Once upon a time there was a persistence little man who lived on a farm. One day he found an eraser lying in the field and decided to keep it as a reminder. Every day he would look at the eraser, but he would feel very sad.
One day, his mom asked him: "Why do you look so sad, dear?"
He looked up at her, blinking back tears, and said: "I miss the farm."
His mom gave him a hug and said, "Let's go visit the farm today. I'm sure it will make us both happy."
So they hopped into the car and drove off. When they got to the farm, the little man was delighted. Everywhere he looked he smiled, ran, and played. But when he tried to pick up the eraser, he started to weep.
His mom saw him weeping, so she hugged him tightly and said: "It's ok, sweetheart. You can keep the eraser and take it home with you. It will always be a reminder of our happy time at the farm."
The little man accepted the eraser with joy, and from then on his happiness was persistent.
