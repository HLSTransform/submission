Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved books and had a big bookcase in her room. One day, Lily's mom made some spicy soup for lunch. Lily didn't like it and said, "Mommy, this soup is too spicy for me."
Mommy replied, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't know you didn't like spicy food. How about we make something else for lunch?"
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, Mommy! Can we have grilled cheese sandwiches instead?"
Mommy smiled back and said, "Of course, Lily! Let's go make some yummy grilled cheese sandwiches together." And they went to the kitchen, leaving the spicy soup behind.
