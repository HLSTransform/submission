Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play with their new toys. Mom and Dad gave them new toys for their birthday. Lily has a new doll and Tom has a new car.
One day, they go to the park with Mom and Dad. They see a big band playing music. The band has drums, trumpets, and flags. The band is doing a march. Lily and Tom want to see the march.
They run to the band. They want to touch the drums and the flags. But the band does not like that. The band says, "Stop! Go away! You are making noise!"
Lily and Tom are scared. They scream. They run back to Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad hug them. They say, "It's okay. The band is not angry. They just need to play their music. You can watch from here. But you cannot touch their things."
Lily and Tom nod. They watch the march from a distance. They clap their hands. They like the music. They forget their scream. They are happy.
