Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play pretend with her dolls. One day, she pretended to be a chef and cooked a pretend meal for her dolls. After they were done eating, she put the pretend dishes in the dishwasher.
Suddenly, her little brother came into the room and saw her playing. "What are you doing?" he asked.
"I'm playing pretend chef," Lily replied. "Do you want to play too?"
Her brother nodded and Lily gave him a pretend apron to wear. "You look cute," she said.
Together, they played pretend chef and cleaned the pretend dishes in the dishwasher. They had so much fun playing together that they didn't even notice when their mom called them for dinner.
