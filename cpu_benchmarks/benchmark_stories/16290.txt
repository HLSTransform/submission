Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to look at pictures in his books. One day, Timmy found a book with a famous picture of a cat. He wanted to examine the picture closely, so he looked at it with his eyes very big. 
Timmy thought the cat in the picture was very funny. He showed the picture to his mom and dad, and they laughed too. Timmy loved the famous cat picture so much that he wanted to draw it himself. He got his crayons and made his own image of the cat. 
Timmy was so proud of his picture that he showed it to everyone he saw. His mom and dad said it was just as good as the famous picture in the book. Timmy was happy that he could make his own image of the cat and show it to others.
