Once upon a time there was a lucky figure. This little figure loved to carry things around.
One day, the figure was walking in the park when he saw something glittering out of the corner of his eye. It was a bag full of glittering coins! The figure was so excited that he stopped and picked up the bag. He carried it around with him wherever he went. 
He went to the store and went shopping. He was able to buy lots of nice things with the coins. Everywhere he went people learned about the lucky figure that had the bag of coins.
 
After a while, he decided it was time to go home. He hugged the bag of coins close to his chest and carried it all the way home. From then on, everyone knew him as the lucky figure!
