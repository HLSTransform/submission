Sara was a daughter who liked to laugh. She laughed when she played with her toys, when she watched funny shows, and when she tickled her mom and dad. She had a big laugh that made everyone happy.
One day, Sara and her mom went to the park. They saw a big slide that looked fun. Sara wanted to go on the slide, but her mom said no. She said the slide was too high and too fast for Sara. She said Sara could get hurt if she went on the slide. She said Sara was very important to her and she did not want her to get hurt.
But Sara did not listen to her mom. She thought her mom was being silly and mean. She wanted to have fun and laugh on the slide. She waited until her mom was talking to another mom. Then she ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. She looked down and saw how high and fast the slide was. She felt scared, but she did not want to go back. She wanted to show her mom that she was brave and strong.
She pushed herself down the slide. She went very fast and felt the wind in her hair. She started to laugh, but then she saw something bad. There was a big rock at the end of the slide. She could not stop or turn. She hit the rock with a loud thud. She felt a lot of pain in her head and her body. She stopped laughing and started to cry.
Her mom heard her cry and ran to the slide. She saw Sara lying on the ground, bleeding and hurt. She screamed and picked her up. She hugged her and cried. She said she was sorry and she loved her. She said she wished she had listened to her mom. She said she hoped Sara would be okay. But Sara did not answer. She did not open her eyes. She did not laugh anymore.
