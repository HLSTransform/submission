Ben liked to swim in the pool with his mom and dad. He had a big floaty that helped him stay on the water. He kicked his legs and splashed his arms. He felt happy and free.
One day, he saw a little girl sitting on the edge of the pool. She looked troubled. She had a bandage on her knee. Ben wanted to help her. He swam to her and said hello.
The girl said her name was Mia. She said she hurt her knee when she fell off her bike. She said she was scared to swim because of her bandage. Ben said he had a floaty that could help her. He asked her if she wanted to try.
Mia nodded. She smiled a little. Ben gave her his floaty and helped her get in the water. He held her hand and told her it was okay. They swam together and had fun. They laughed and played.
Ben and Mia became friends. They shared their floaty and their stories. They forgot about their troubles. They enjoyed swimming in the pool.
