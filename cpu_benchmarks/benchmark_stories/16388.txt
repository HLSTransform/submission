Once upon a time, there was a little ant. The ant was only one inch long. The ant had a friend, a big bear. The bear was very nice and always tried to encourage the ant.
One day, the ant and the bear saw a big hill. The ant wanted to go up the hill, but the bear was afraid. The ant said, "Don't be scared, bear! I will help you." The bear didn't know the ant was ignorant about hills.
The ant tried to push the bear up the hill. But the bear was too heavy. They tried and tried, but they could not get up the hill. The bear was sad and the ant was tired.
In the end, the bear and the ant gave up. They did not go up the hill. They went home, feeling sad. The ant learned that it is important to know what you can and cannot do.
