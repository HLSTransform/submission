Once upon a time, there were two children, one was three and one was five.
The three year old saw a number on the ground and decided to pick it up, but the five year old stopped her. 
"That's a bad number!" said the five year old. 
The three year old was confused and asked why. 
The five year old explained, "It's bad because ignorant people have put it there to do bad things." 
But the three year old was determined and picked up the number. 
Suddenly, a loud noise appeared! 
The five year old was scared, but the three year old was brave and faced the noise. 
It was a kind old man who said, "Thank you for picking up that number. I was trying to find it for a long time". 
The three year old was surprised and asked why, and the old man replied, "That number has the power to do great things and I am going to use it for good". 
The moral of the story is that even though something may appear bad on the surface, it can still have hidden powers to do great things.
