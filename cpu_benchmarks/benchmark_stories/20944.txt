Once there was a brown boat. It was made of wood and had a bright red sail. The sail boat was owned by three children. They loved to go out on the lake and sail in their boat.
One day, the children asked a grown up what they could do to make their boat go faster. The grown up suggested they buy a machine to attach to the sail boat. So the children went shopping and found a brown machine. 
When they got the machine home, they attached it to the sail boat. Then they went out on the lake to see what happened.
The children were so excited when they sailed with the new machine. It was so fast that it felt like they were flying! "Look at us go!" shouted one of them. "This machine is awesome!" 
The children laughed and smiled as they sailed around the lake with the brown machine. They were very happy with their boat and machine and used them for many happy years.
