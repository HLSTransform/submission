One day, Catie went outside to play. She wanted to have fun in the sun. Catie saw a spoon on the ground. She was excited and wanted to pick it up. But it was dangerous, and Catie was scared.
Catie ran away, but then she saw a butterfly. It was so beautiful that Catie stopped and looked. The butterfly flew away, and Catie felt sad. She wanted to follow it, but it was too far away.
Catie started to walk home. She was searching for something in the sky. Then she saw a rainbow! Catie felt very happy and smiled. She hoped and hoped that it wouldn't go away. 
And it didn't! The rainbow stayed for a long time and Catie was so happy. She wished she had her own spoon so she could catch the rainbow. But, it was still a beautiful day, so Catie was content.
