Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived with her parent in a small house in the forest. One day, Lily and her parent went for a walk in the forest. They saw many animals like squirrels, rabbits, and birds. 
Lily's parent said, "Let's play a game! I will guess which animal is behind this tree." Lily said, "I want to guess too!" So they played the game and had lots of fun. 
But then, they got lost in the forest. Lily's parent tried to find the way back home, but they couldn't. They were so miserable because they were hungry and tired. 
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a bear! The bear was angry and chased them. Lily's parent tried to protect her, but the bear was too strong. Sadly, they didn't make it back home that day.
