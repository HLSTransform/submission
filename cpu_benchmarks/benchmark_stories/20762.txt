Once there was a little boy named David. He wanted to do something special, so he made a plan. He worked really hard and tried his best. When it was time to do it, he was a little bit scared. 
But he took a deep breath and tried anyway. To his surprise, he was successful! Everyone was so proud of him and he felt really happy.
After that, David kept on trying new things. He wanted to know how it felt to be successful again. Sometimes things were boring and he had to work really hard. But he kept on trying and learning new things. 
Eventually, he became an expert at lots of things. He was very proud of himself and his success.
