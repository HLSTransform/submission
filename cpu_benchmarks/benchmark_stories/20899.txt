Once there was a very eager bird who wanted to fly. She had big, strong wings and was determined to jump off the tree branch and take off into the air.
The bird stood on the branch for a moment, taking a deep breath. Then, she jumped with all her might. But instead of sailing up, she grabbed on to a branch below. She was a bit confused, so she tried again.
This time, she grabbed onto another branch and hung on tight. She tried one more time and this time was the charm. She soared into the sky, happy as could be. 
She flew around and around, enjoying the feeling of the cool breeze against her feathers. She was so happy that she started singing just like the other birds.
The little bird flew high in the sky and was happy with her journey. From that day on, the bird was always eager to take to the skies once again.
