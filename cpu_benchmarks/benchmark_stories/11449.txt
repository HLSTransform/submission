Once upon a time, there was a girl called Sally. Sally was 3 years old. She loved to explore, and today she had come across a big white glass wall.
"Can I climb it, Mummy?" Sally asked her Mummy.
Mummy smiled. "No, no, darling," Mummy said. "It's too high and too slippery."
But Sally was determined. She was going to climb the white glass wall, no matter what!
Taking a deep breath, Sally started to climb. She used her little hands and feet to grip onto the smooth glass and, bit by bit, Sally inched her way up.
After a few minutes, Sally was at the top! "I did it!" she cheered.
Mummy was so proud of her and gave her a big hug. 
Sally smiled from ear to ear. She had climbed the big white glass wall - and she was so happy!
