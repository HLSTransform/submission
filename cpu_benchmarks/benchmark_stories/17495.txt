Sam liked to pass the newspaper to his dad every morning. He felt very helpful and proud when he did that. He would run to the door, pick up the big paper, and carry it to the kitchen, where his dad was making breakfast.
"Here you go, dad. Your newspaper," he would say, handing it over with a big smile.
"Thank you, Sam. You are such a good boy," his dad would say, ruffling his hair. "Do you want to see what's inside?"
Sam would nod eagerly, and his dad would open the paper and show him some pictures and words. He would point to some people and tell him what they did. Some were successful, like doctors and teachers and astronauts. Some were not, like robbers and liars and bullies.
Sam liked to learn new things from his dad and the newspaper. He wanted to be successful too, when he grew up. He wanted to do something good and important, like his dad.
One day, his dad had a surprise for him. He said he had something special to show him in the newspaper. He opened it and pointed to a big picture on the front page. It was a picture of his dad, smiling and holding a trophy.
"Look, Sam. This is me. I won a prize for my work. I am a successful engineer. I make things that help people and the world. Do you see?"
Sam looked at the picture and his dad. He felt very happy and proud. He hugged his dad and said, "Wow, dad. You are amazing. I want to be like you."
His dad hugged him back and said, "You can be anything you want, Sam. You are smart and kind and brave. I love you, son."
They smiled at each other and looked at the newspaper again. Sam passed it back to his dad and said, "Can we read more, dad?"
"Of course, Sam. Let's read more."
