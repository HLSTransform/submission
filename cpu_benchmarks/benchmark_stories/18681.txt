Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to watch the birds in the bush outside her house. One day, she found an original toy hidden in the bushes. 
Lily picked up the toy and showed it to her mother. "Look, Mommy!" she said excitedly. "I found an original toy in the bush!"
Her mother smiled and said, "Wow, that's great, Lily! It looks like a little bear. Where did you find it?"
"I found it in the bush outside!" Lily replied happily. 
From that day on, Lily always kept an eye on the bush outside her house. She never knew what other original treasures she might find there.
