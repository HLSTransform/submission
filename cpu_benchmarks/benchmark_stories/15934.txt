Once upon a time, there were two friends named Jack and Kate. They had so much fun together.
One day, Jack had a great idea. He said, "Let's have a tea party!" Kate was so excited and quickly agreed.
So they went to the store and bought some large cookies and lots of sugar. When they came home, they set up a table and put on fun dresses.
Jack looked around and said, "Let's suggest drinks!" Kate nodded and said, "Let's make tea!" So Jack went and boiled some water and put a lot of sugar into it.
They quickly drank the sweet tea and enjoyed their cookies. Jack and Kate had so much fun at the tea party! 
The end.
