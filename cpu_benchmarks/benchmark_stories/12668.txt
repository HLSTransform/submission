Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the park with his toys. One day, he brought his favorite toy car with him to the park. He loved that car so much because it was his dad's when he was a little boy too.
While playing, Timmy accidentally dropped his toy car into a pond. He was so sad and scared that he started to cry. Suddenly, he heard a voice behind him saying, "Don't worry, I'll rescue your car from the pond." It was a kind man who saw what happened and wanted to help.
The man went into the pond and got Timmy's car. Timmy was so happy and grateful that he hugged the man. He said, "Thank you so much! My car is very valuable to me." The man smiled and said, "I'm just glad you're safe and happy now." From that day on, Timmy always remembered to be careful with his toys and to say thank you to those who help him.
