Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily who loved to play in her garden. One day, she found a beautiful rose. It was pink and smelled lovely. She picked it up and held it close to her nose. But then, a dark cloud appeared in the sky and it started to rain. Lily was sad because she didn't want her rose to get wet. She tried to fold it up, but it was too big. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew and the rose fell out of her hand. Lily cried and ran inside. But then, her mom came and gave her a warm hug. She told her that the rose would be okay and they could pick another one together tomorrow. Lily felt better and hugged her mom back.
