Lily and Ben love to go to the zoo. They like to see all the animals and hear the noises they make. One day, they go to the zoo with their mom and dad. They are very excited.
They arrive at the zoo and buy tickets. They see a big map with pictures of the animals. They want to see the monkeys first. They run to the monkey house and look for them. They see many monkeys. Some are big, some are small, some are brown, some are black.
The monkeys are funny. They jump and swing and play. They make funny faces and noises. Lily and Ben laugh and clap. They try to copy the monkeys. They jump and swing and make funny noises too. The monkeys look at them and seem to laugh too.
Lily and Ben have a lot of fun with the monkeys. They stay there for a long time. Then they go to see other animals. They see lions and tigers and bears and elephants and giraffes and more. They learn new things and have fun. They love the zoo.
