Once upon a time in Orange Land, there was a big cave. Inside lived a monster named Murphy. Murphy loved to play with his giant spear. Every day, he would take it out and throw it around, making an enormous crashing noise.
One day, the king of Orange Land heard the noise and came to investigate. "What are you doing?" the king asked.
Murphy answered, "I am having fun throwing my spear!"
The king knew this wasn't safe, so he suggested that Murphy separate from his spear every time he heard the king's trumpet. Murphy agreed, and this became the custom in Orange Land.
Every time the king's trumpet sounded, everyone, including Murphy, had to separate from their spears. Sometimes this made Murphy frustrated, especially when he was having the most fun. 
One day the king's trumpet sounded and Murphy didn't separate from his spear fast enough. The king became angry and shouted at Murphy's disobedience.
Murphy had to face the consequences of breaking the rule, but he was also proud of himself for following it all the time before. He learned an important lesson that day: even when you're having the most fun, you must always obey the rules.
