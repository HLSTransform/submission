Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch movies. One day, Timmy went to the movie theater with his mommy and daddy. They watched a funny movie about a silly dog.
After the movie, Timmy and his family went to get some ice cream. While they were eating their ice cream, they saw a bird trying to escape from a cage. Timmy felt sad for the bird because it looked like it was hurt. His mommy and daddy helped the bird escape from the cage and it flew away happily. 
Timmy was happy that the bird was free and not hurt anymore. He went home and told his stuffed animals all about the funny movie and the bird that escaped. They all listened and agreed that it was a great day. The end.
