"Mom, what's in the box?" asked Mark. His mother smiled and said, "We're going to unpack and see!" Mark watched carefully as his Mom opened the box. Inside was a crab! Mark was so excited. He picked up the crab and held it in his lap.
"That crab is so soft!" said Mark. He cuddled it close and stroked its back. Then all of a sudden he felt ashamed. "Did I do something wrong?" he asked. His Mom laughed and said, "No, sweetheart. It's just that crabs need clean sand and water to stay healthy. Can we put it in the fish tank?"
Mark nodded, suddenly feeling more excited than ever. He carefully carried the crab to the fish tank and watched as it found its new home. It was time to unpack the box and explore even more!
