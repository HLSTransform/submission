Once upon a time there was a little girl called Ella. She was only three years old but she was very brave. One day Ella decided to go for a walk in the woods.
As she was walking, Ella heard a noise coming from behind the trees. She was scared at first, but she mustered up the courage to peek behind the trees.
To Ella's surprise, there was a beautiful fairy standing there. The fairy said, "Hi Ella, I have a special prize for you. I think it's very special, but I have to warn you: it might look very ordinary at first."
Ella was curious, so she said, "Yes please, can I have it?" The fairy smiled and waved her wand. A bright star appeared in her hands!
The fairy said, "This is your prize. It will always be with you, no matter where you go. Now you have a star, just like all the other stars in the night sky!"
Ella thanked the fairy and ran off with her prize, a bright, shining star. From that day on, she was never scared to explore the woods, knowing that her star would always be with her.
