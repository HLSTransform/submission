Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to pretend. He would play with his toys and make up stories all day long. One day, Tim found a fake mustache in his toy box. He put it on and looked in the mirror. He laughed and thought it was very funny.
Tim wore the mustache and pretended to be a big, warm bear. He walked around the house, saying, "Roar! I am a big bear with a mustache!" His mom heard him and smiled. She decided to play along with Tim.
"Hello, Mr. Bear," said Mom. "Are you a warm and friendly bear?" Tim nodded and roared again. "Yes, I am a warm and friendly bear with a mustache!" They both laughed and played together, pretending to be bears with mustaches.
After a while, Tim took off the mustache and hugged his mom. "Thank you for playing with me, Mom," he said. His mom hugged him back and said, "I love playing with you, Tim. You have a great imagination." They both smiled and continued to play and pretend for the rest of the day.
