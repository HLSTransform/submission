Once upon a time, there was a boy named Sam. He was 3 years old. Sam loved playing at the beach. Every day, he would build sand castles and search for seashells.
One day, while he was building his sandcastle, a crab came out from beneath the sand! Sam was so surprised that he jumped back! He cautiously stepped closer to the crab and said: "Hello, Mr. Crab!"
The crab scuttled away, so Sam started to chase it. The crab crawled into a hole in the sand and Sam crawled in after it. Once inside, he found something disgusting - a pile of smelly fishbones.
Sam stepped back in surprise and quickly crawled back out. He never wanted to go in there again!
