Once upon a time there was a chubby peach. It was a special peach that everyone wanted to eat. But no one knew that the peach was spoiled.
It had been left in the baking hot sun too long and it was starting to rot. The peach was so sad. It wanted to be enjoyed like it's brothers and sisters.
One day a little girl saw the peach. She thought it looked delicious. She picked it up and was about to eat it when she noticed it was starting to rot.
The little girl frowned and put the peach back down. But then she had an idea. She took it home and planted it. To her surprise, it started to grow!
Soon she had a lovely chubby peach tree filled with delicious, ripe peaches. The little girl was so happy that she'd saved the peach. Everyone else was happy too. They all enjoyed the nice, sweet peaches!
