One day, a little girl named Lily went for a walk in the park. She saw many pretty flowers and bright green trees. Lily felt very happy as she walked and looked around.
As she walked, Lily noticed a small, thin insect on a leaf. It was a tiny caterpillar. "Hi, little caterpillar!" said Lily. The caterpillar looked at her and said, "Hello, Lily! I am just eating this leaf. I am very hungry."
Lily and the caterpillar talked for a while. They became good friends. Soon, it was time for Lily to go home. She said goodbye to her new friend and walked back to her house. Lily knew she would come back to visit the caterpillar again soon.
