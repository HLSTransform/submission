Sam was walking outside and he saw something shiny. He went to take a closer look and he saw a robot! He was very curious so he decided to stare at it. He had never seen something like this before so he didn't know what it was. He looked closely and noticed it had big, red eyes. It was blinking and moving its head around. Sam had never seen a robot before, so he was a bit scared. He slowly stepped closer and said "Hello?". The robot didn't answer, it just kept on staring at Sam. Sam did not know how to react so he just stood there, feeling a bit scared but also excited. He stared back until his mom called for him to come home. Sam said goodbye to the robot, not knowing why it had been there, and walked back home.
