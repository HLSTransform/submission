Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books and clothes. But they do not like to clean up. They leave their things on the floor and on the bed.
One day, Mom comes to their room. She is not happy. She sees the mess. She speaks to Lily and Tom. "Look at this room! It is very dirty. You need to clean up now. Put your toys in the box. Put your books on the shelf. Put your clothes in the closet. And be careful with your socks. They are easy to lose."
Lily and Tom nod. They do not want to make Mom angry. They start to clean up. They pick up their toys and books and clothes. They put them where they belong. But they do not see their socks. They look under the bed. They look behind the door. They look in the drawers. They do not find their socks.
"Mom, we can't find our socks!" they speak to Mom. "Where are they?"
Mom comes to their room. She smiles. She knows where their socks are. She points to their feet. "Look at your feet. You are wearing your socks. You did not take them off. You are silly."
Lily and Tom look at their feet. They see their socks. They are red and blue and green and yellow. They laugh. They are silly. They hug Mom. They say sorry. They are happy. They finish cleaning up. They are careful with their socks. They do not lose them again.
