Tom and Lily were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a new boy. He had brown skin and curly hair. He was sitting on a bench with a big book.
"Hello, what is your name?" Tom asked.
"My name is Sam. I am new here. I like to read books," the boy said.
"Can we see your book?" Lily asked.
"Sure, you can see it. It is a book about animals. Do you like animals?" Sam said. He was generous. He shared his book with Tom and Lily.
"Yes, we like animals. Look, there is a lion. He has yellow fur and a big mane. He is the king of the animals," Tom said.
"And there is a zebra. She has black and white stripes. She is fast and smart. She can run away from the lion," Lily said.
They looked at the book and learned about many animals. They had fun.
"Sam, do you want to play with us?" Tom asked.
"Yes, I want to play with you. You are nice. Can we be friends?" Sam asked.
"Of course, we can be friends. You belong with us. We are all friends," Lily said.
They smiled and hugged. They played in the park. They did not care about their skin. They cared about their hearts. They were happy.
