Once upon a time there was a tall bird. He liked to test events and see how they went. One day he decided to test a very high jump. He wanted to see how far he could get.
“I can do this,” he said to himself.
But, as he was about to jump, he noticed something he hadn’t seen before. The land below him was very far away. He was scared and hesitated.
“Maybe I shouldn’t do it,” he said.
But it was too late. He had already taken the jump. He soared through the air, but he was too scared to flap his wings. He fell down and landed with a thud.
The bird was hurt and sad, and he never tried testing something so tall ever again. The moral of this story, dear child, is that safety is more important than trying something very hard.
