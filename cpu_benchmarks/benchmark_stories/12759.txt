Alice was walking along, on her way to the park. Suddenly, she spotted something pale in the stems of the tall grass. She stepped closer and saw a huge glass of juice! She was so excited she almost couldn't believe it.
Alice dashed over to the juice and peered closely at it. The juice was bright and sunny, and it sparkled in the sunshine. She couldn't wait to take a sip.
"Does this juice belong to anyone?" she asked out loud.
"Yes, it belongs to me," came a voice from behind her.
Alice glanced over her shoulder and saw an old lady.
"I'm Mary," said the lady, with a gentle smile. "This juice is for a special occasion, and I wanted you to be the first to try it. Would you like some?"
Alice grinned and nodded. Mary carefully poured some of the juice into a cup and handed it to Alice. Alice took a sip and she was delighted; it was the sweetest juice she ever tasted!
Mary said that the juice was made especially to serve on a special day. Alice was curious, but before she could ask, Mary gently motioned for her to come closer.
"This juice is going to be served tomorrow," she said. "It's a very special day, and I'm sure you'll be happy to be part of it."
Alice gave Mary a big smile
