Once upon a time, there were two rabbits called Pepper and Peter. They both loved to race. One day, they decided to have a race to see who was faster.
Pepper was a very fast rabbit. But Peter was determined to win. For the race, they had to run around one big tree. Peter was so determined to win that he raced as fast as he could!
After a few minutes, Pepper came around the tree and got to the finish line first. Pepper was so happy to be successful!
Peter was not happy about losing, but he was still very proud of Pepper. He knew that even though he was not successful this time, he could try again another day.
