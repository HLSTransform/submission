Once there was a little girl called Bird. Bird lived in a house with a big garden, and in the garden there was lots of grass. She liked to run in the grass because it was so soft and green.
One day, Bird decided to see how fast she could run through the grass. She ran as fast as she could, faster than she had ever run before. She felt so fast, like the wind was pushing her along.
When she got to the other side, Bird asked herself, "How fast did I run? Do I know?". She quickly saw the answer - the grass all around her was swaying and the leaves were fluttering. Bird knew she had run really fast!
She smiled to herself and ran back through the grass again and again, each time faster than before. Soon she knew that she was the fastest in the garden.
