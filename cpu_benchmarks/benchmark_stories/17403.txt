Anna and Ben were eager to go to camp. They packed their bags with clothes, toys and snacks. They said goodbye to their mom and dad and got on the bus with their friends.
At camp, they did many fun things. They played games, sang songs, made crafts and went on hikes. They also learned about animals, plants and stars. They admired the nature around them and asked many questions.
One night, they had a campfire. They roasted marshmallows and told stories. Anna and Ben sat next to each other and shared a blanket. They looked at the sky and saw many bright dots.
"Look, Ben, there is a big bear!" Anna said, pointing at a group of stars.
"Wow, you are right, Anna. It is a big bear. And there is a little bear next to it." Ben said, following her finger.
"They are called Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. They are constellations. They are like pictures made of stars." Anna said, remembering what their teacher had told them.
"That is so cool, Anna. You are very smart. I admire you." Ben said, smiling at her.
"Thank you, Ben. You are very kind. I admire you too." Anna said, blushing.
They hugged each other and watched the stars. They felt happy and cozy. They loved camp.
