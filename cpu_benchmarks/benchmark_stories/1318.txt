Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mia. She was very happy, for she had a very special place to go. That place was the harbor, a beautiful place where the ocean was very quiet and blue.
Mia would go to the harbor and sit on the sand. She would watch the boats go by, each one more charming than the last. She liked to watch the seagulls too, they were always so loud when they flew by.
One day Mia brought a camera to the harbor and took lots of pictures. Whenever something beautiful caught her eye, she'd snap a photo! Each one she captured was so wonderful that it was almost like a dream.
Mia went to the harbor nearly every day and she'd lose herself in the beauty of it all. She loved being there so much, and it made her feel so happy. In the harbor, she was safe and content, so much so that she never wanted to leave.
