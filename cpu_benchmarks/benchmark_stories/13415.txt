Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy gun that he loved to play with. One day, Timmy was playing with his gun and accidentally shot a glass. The glass broke into many pieces and made a loud noise.
Timmy's mom heard the noise and came to see what happened. She saw the broken glass and asked Timmy what happened. Timmy said, "I shoot glass with my gun." His mom was not happy and told him he should not shoot things inside the house.
Timmy felt bad for breaking the glass, but he had an idea. He went to his room and found an original picture he drew. He brought it to his mom and said, "I'm sorry for breaking the glass. Here's an original picture I made for you." His mom smiled and hugged him. The conflict was resolved and Timmy learned a valuable lesson about playing with his toy gun inside the house.
