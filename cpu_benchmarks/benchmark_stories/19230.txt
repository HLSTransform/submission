Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She was playing with her toys in her room when she heard a loud noise outside. She looked out of the window and saw an emergency truck. 
Lily asked her mom, "What's happening outside?" 
Her mom replied, "There's an emergency. Let's go outside and see." 
Lily and her mom went outside and saw that a big tree had fallen on the road. The emergency truck was there to help move the tree. 
Lily's mom said, "Let's help them push the tree." So they joined the emergency workers and pushed the tree together. 
After the tree was moved, the emergency workers thanked Lily and her mom for their help. Lily felt happy that she could help in an ordinary day.
