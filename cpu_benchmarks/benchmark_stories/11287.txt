Once upon a time, there was a boy who was very eager to help. His name was Tim and he was 3 years old. One day, he saw a ladder being delivered. He wanted very much to be able to help carry it, but it was too big for him to carry on his own.
Tim's Mom saw him looking very keen and asked him, "Do you want to help deliver the ladder?"
"Yes, please!" he said eagerly.
His Mom knew he couldn't do it on his own, so she asked his older brother to help. His brother agreed, and together they carried the ladder inside.
They soon ran into a problem, as the ladder was too long and wouldn't fit through the door!
Tim had an idea. He suggested they fold the ladder to make it smaller. His brother thought this was a great idea, so they folded the ladder and were able to deliver it into the house.
Finally, Tim was able to help deliver the ladder. He felt very proud of himself and was happy to have been an eager helper.
