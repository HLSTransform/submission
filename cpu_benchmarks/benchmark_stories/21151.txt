Once there was a little boy called Mike. He wanted to perform a special act, so he decided to walk along a rail that wound around a hill. The rail was smelly, and Mike was scared. But he kept walking anyway. Soon, he found a big cave. Inside the cave was a huge dragon! Mike was so scared. The dragon roared and Mike started to cry. But then the dragon said, “Don’t worry, I’m friendly! I just wanted you to perform a song for me.” So Mike stopped crying and sang a beautiful song. 
The dragon was so happy he danced around the cave. Mike knew he was safe and the dragon was his friend. They laughed and played together for a long time. Finally, it was time for Mike to go home. The dragon gave him a big hug, and Mike said goodbye to his friendly dragon. Mike was so happy his adventure was over!
