Once upon a time, there was a gentle flower named Daisy. She lived in a beautiful, sunny garden, near a great tree. Every morning, Daisy looked forward to the sun coming up, as she knew it was time for her to bloom.
Every day, Daisy would stretch out her petals towards the sky, and a few moments later, she would burst into a rainbow of colors. She looked so pretty in the garden - like a mosaic made up of the brightest colors.
One day, a soft, gentle wind came into the garden, and with it came an old, furry cord. It twirled around in the breeze, and eventually landed next to Daisy. Daisy smiled, and welcomed the cord into her garden.
Together, Daisy and her cord played every day in the sunshine. They spun together, jumped together, and sang together. Daisy even helped the cord wrap himself around the great tree, so it could get a better view of her fantastic blooms.
From then on, Daisy and her cord became the best of friends. They would stay together in the garden, under the warm sunlight, until the moon came up and it was time to go to sleep.
The end.
