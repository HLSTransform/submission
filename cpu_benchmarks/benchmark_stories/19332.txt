Once there was a raven that was very angry. He hopped around and cawed loudly, wish to help him.
So the people in the village decided to add something to the raven's life. They found a branch and hung it from a nearby tree and hung some shiny objects from it.
The raven flew to the tree and looked at the shiny objects. Then he hopped up to the branch and began to play with the shiny objects. He was so happy!
The people smiled and laughed to see the raven so happy. The raven thanked the people for adding something to his life. Now he wasn't so angry anymore.
