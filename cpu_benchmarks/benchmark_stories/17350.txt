Lila and Sam were at the beach with their mom and dad. They liked to play in the sand and splash in the water. But they had to be careful of the tide. The tide was when the water went up and down. Sometimes the water was far away and sometimes it was close.
"Look, Lila, the tide is going down!" Sam said. "We can see more sand and shells!"
"Let's go find some!" Lila said. They ran to the edge of the water and looked for shiny and colorful shells. They found some big ones and some small ones. They put them in their buckets.
"Be careful, kids, don't go too far!" their mom called. "The tide can change quickly!"
"We know, mom!" they said. They kept looking for shells and having fun.
After a while, they got hungry. They went back to their mom and dad, who had a picnic ready for them. They had sandwiches, fruit, and cookies. They also had some lemonade.
"Here, try this lemonade, kids," their dad said. "It's very refreshing."
Lila and Sam took a sip of the lemonade. They made a funny face.
"Ow, ow, ow!" they said. "This lemonade is spicy!"
Their dad laughed. "Sorry, kids, I put some ginger in it. I like it spicy. Do you want some water instead?"
"Yes, please!" they said. They drank some water and felt better.
They ate their sandwiches, fruit, and cookies. They liked them a lot. They were not spicy.
They thanked their mom and dad for the picnic. They were happy and full.
They decided to play some more in the sand and water. They hoped to find more shells. They also hoped the tide would not be too high or too low. They liked the tide just right.
