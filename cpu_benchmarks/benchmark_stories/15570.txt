Lily was a deaf girl who liked to go to school. She had a special teacher who helped her learn with signs and pictures. She also had many friends who played with her and talked to her with their hands.
One day, Lily found a magic ring in the playground. It was shiny and had a big red stone. She put it on her finger and felt a strange tingling. She looked around and saw that everything was getting bigger. Or maybe she was getting smaller. She was shrinking!
She tried to take off the ring, but it was stuck. She got scared and ran to find her teacher. But she was so tiny that no one could see her or hear her. She called out with her voice and her signs, but it was no use. She felt alone and lost.
She saw a big ant crawling near her. It was bigger than her head. She was afraid it would bite her. She ran away from it, but it followed her. She saw a hole in the ground and jumped in. She hoped the ant would not find her.
She landed on something soft and warm. It was a mouse. The mouse looked at her with curious eyes. It sniffed her and licked her. It did not hurt her. It was friendly. Lily felt a little better. She smiled at the mouse and stroked its fur. The mouse squeaked and nuzzled her.
Maybe the mouse could help her. Maybe it could take her to her teacher. She pointed at the ring and made a sign for help. The mouse nodded and picked her up gently. It ran out of the hole and across the playground. It dodged the ant and the children and the teachers. It found Lily's teacher and dropped her on her lap.
Lily's teacher was surprised and happy. She saw the ring and understood what had happened. She took off the ring and gave it to the mouse. She thanked the mouse and hugged Lily. Lily hugged her back and thanked the mouse too. The mouse winked and ran away.
Lily was back to her normal size. She was glad and relieved. She learned a lesson that day. She learned that magic can be dangerous and that friends can be found in unexpected places. She also learned that she was not alone. She had a special teacher, many friends, and a brave mouse who cared for her. She was a happy girl.
