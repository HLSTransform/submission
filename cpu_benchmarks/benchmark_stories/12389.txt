Ann was a young girl. She was only three years old. Every day she looked forward to going outside with her dad. They liked to take long walks together.
Today Ann and her dad strolled along the beach. Ann loved to gaze at the sea. She could feel its gentle waves. Ann felt peaceful and happy.
Suddenly, she spotted a fish out in the ocean. It was a large fish and its scales shone brightly in the sun. Ann was instantly drawn to the fish. She felt its wisdom as it looked back at her.
Then Ann noticed something else. High above the sea she saw a fragile little bird. It was barely bigger than a bug. Ann wanted to learn from the bird. She wanted to use its wisdom.
Ann watched the bird for ages and soon she felt joy and freedom in her heart. She thought about how amazing life was. Ann and her dad smiled at each other, both feeling the same joy.
