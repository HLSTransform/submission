Every morning Maria went to the kindergarten. She wore a special cap on her head. It was a colorful cap with pretty things on it. It made Maria look very smart. 
One day her teacher asked everyone to go outside. Outside the kindergarten, Maria saw a beautiful tree. She admired it very much. The leaves were a bright green and the trunk was strong and tall. It was so nice to look at. 
Maria's teacher asked her why she was admiring the tree. Maria replied that it was very smart. And so Maria continued to admire the tree every day, just like she admired her colorful cap.
