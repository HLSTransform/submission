Once upon a time there was a white puppy. His fur was so soft and he had a healthy, shiny coat. Every morning his owner would take him outside in the garden and they would play together. They would have lots of fun rolling and hopping around the garden. 
The sun was always so warm and the puppy loved it. He would close his eyes and just rub his head in the grass. The feeling was so nice it made him doze off. Sunbathing made him feel so happy and content. When he was done he was always full of energy and ready to play some more. 
The puppy and his owner were best friends. Every day the puppy would wait for his Owner to come home so that they could go out and play together. 
The white puppy was the happiest and healthiest puppy around. And the feeling of the sun and the grass against his fur always made him feel like everything was perfect in the world.
