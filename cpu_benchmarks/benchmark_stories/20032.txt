Lily loves her pet dog, Max. Max is big and brown and has thick fur. He likes to play with Lily and lick her face. Lily likes to hug him and brush his fur.
One day, Lily and Max go to the park with Mom. They see many other dogs and people. Lily and Max run and play on the grass. They have fun.
But then, Lily sees a big, black dog. The dog is angry and barks loud. He runs at Lily and Max. Lily is scared. She cries. Max is brave. He barks back and stands in front of Lily. He protects her.
Mom comes and picks up Lily. She hugs her and says, "Don't worry, Lily. You are safe. Max is a good dog. He loves you very much." Lily smiles and says, "I love Max too. He is my best friend." She kisses Max and gives him a treat. Max wags his tail and licks her hand. They are happy.
