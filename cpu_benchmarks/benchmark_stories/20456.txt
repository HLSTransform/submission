Once there was a rabbit who really wanted to run very fast. He would go to the field every day and try to speed faster and faster. He was always so envious of the other animals who could speed by without any problems.
One day, the rabbit noticed a pair of scissors lying in the grass. He thought that maybe if he held them really tightly he would speed faster. So he tried and it worked! He raced through the field faster than ever before and was so happy.
This happened every day after that. The rabbit would pick up the scissors each morning and run around the field as fast as he could. He eventually became the fastest animal in the field and all the other animals were envious of him!
