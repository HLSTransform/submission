Lily and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. Lily had a big rubber ball that bounced high and made a loud noise. Ben had a small wooden car that rolled fast and made a soft noise. Lily liked to bounce her ball and make Ben look at her. Ben liked to roll his car and make Lily look at him.
"Look at my ball, Ben!" Lily said, bouncing it hard on the floor. "It is so big and fun!"
"Ignore her, car," Ben said, rolling his car on the couch. "She is so loud and silly!"
Lily felt angry. She wanted Ben to play with her and her ball. She bounced her ball harder and harder, hoping Ben would notice. But Ben did not notice. He ignored her and her ball. He only played with his car and his couch.
"Look at my car, Lily!" Ben said, rolling it down the cushion. "It is so fast and cool!"
"Ignore him, ball," Lily said, bouncing it up the wall. "He is so slow and boring!"
Ben felt angry. He wanted Lily to play with him and his car. He rolled his car faster and faster, hoping Lily would notice. But Lily did not notice. She ignored him and his car. She only played with her ball and her wall.
They played like this for a long time, ignoring each other and their toys. They did not have fun. They did not laugh. They did not smile. They felt lonely and sad.
Then, something happened. Lily bounced her ball too high and it hit the ceiling. The ball fell down and hit Ben's car. The car flew off the couch and hit Lily's ball. The ball and the car bounced and rolled together on the floor. They made a big noise and a big mess.
Lily and Ben stopped playing. They looked at their toys. They looked at each other. They felt confused.
"What happened?" Lily asked.
"I don't know," Ben said.
They walked to their toys. They picked them up. They looked at them. They felt curious.
"Can I see your ball?" Ben asked.
"Can I see your car?" Lily asked.
They swapped their toys. They felt their toys. They played with their toys. They felt happy.
"Your ball is big and fun," Ben said.
"Your car is fast and cool," Lily said.
They smiled at each other. They decided to play together. They bounced the ball and rolled the car. They made a loud noise and a soft noise. They had fun. They laughed. They did not ignore. They were friends.
