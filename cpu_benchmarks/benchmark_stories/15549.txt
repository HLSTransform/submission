Lila was very happy today. She was going to visit her friend Sami, who came from a different country. She wanted to learn about his culture and play with his toys. She also wanted to try his food, because it smelled very good.
When she arrived at Sami's house, his mom greeted her with a big smile. She said, "Hello, Lila. Welcome to our home. I'm Sami's mom. Let me introduce you to our food. This is couscous, this is lamb, and this is harissa. Harissa is a spicy sauce that we put on our food. Do you like spicy food?"
Lila nodded. She liked spicy food. She liked to eat chili and salsa with her dad. She said, "Yes, I like spicy food. Thank you for sharing your food with me. It looks yummy. Can I have some?"
Sami's mom said, "Of course, you can have some. Here, take a plate and help yourself. Sami, why don't you show Lila your room and your toys? You can play together after you eat."
Sami said, "Okay, mom. Come on, Lila. I have a lot of cool toys. I have cars, puzzles, books, and a drum. Do you like drums?"
Lila said, "Yes, I like drums. I have a tambourine at home. We can make music together. You are a very nice friend, Sami. I'm glad I met you."
Sami said, "You are a very nice friend, too, Lila. I'm glad you came to visit me. We have a lot in common. We both like spicy food and drums. And we both like to learn new things."
They smiled at each other and ran to Sami's room, holding hands. They had a lot of fun playing and eating. They learned more about each other's culture and language. They became very good friends.
