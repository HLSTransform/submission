Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweety. Tweety lived in a tree with his family. One day, Tweety saw a big bird flying high in the sky. He said to his mom, "I want to become a big bird too!" 
His mom said, "Tweety, you are perfect just the way you are. You don't need to become anything else." 
But Tweety didn't listen. He tried to fly higher and higher every day to become a big bird. One day, he flew too high and got trapped in a cage. He was very grumpy and sad. 
A little girl saw Tweety in the cage and felt sorry for him. She opened the cage and let Tweety fly away. Tweety learned that it's better to be happy with who you are than to try to become someone else.
