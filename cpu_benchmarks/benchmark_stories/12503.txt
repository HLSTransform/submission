Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pet turkey named Tom. One day, Lily and Tom were playing in the backyard when Tom got lost. Lily searched everywhere but couldn't find him. She was very sad.
Lily went to her mom and said, "Mommy, I lost Tom. I can't find him anywhere." Her mom replied, "Don't worry, Lily. We'll find him together." They searched the whole neighborhood but still couldn't find Tom.
Suddenly, they heard a loud gobble coming from a nearby tree. They looked up and saw Tom perched on a branch. Lily was so happy to have found him. She hugged him tightly and said, "I'm never going to lose you again, Tom." From that day on, Lily made sure to keep a close eye on Tom so she wouldn't lose him again.
