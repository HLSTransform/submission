Danny was a 3 year old boy who lived in a neighbourhood with lots of trees and grass. He loved to play outside.
One sunny day, Danny was playing with his friends when he noticed something sparkling in the grass. He picked it up to have a better look and realized it was a cell phone. He was so excited about his discovery and started to play with it.
Suddenly, the cell phone screen fell off and the phone was broken. Danny started to cry. His friends gathered around him and tried to console him.
Danny soon felt better, and his friends had a great idea. They decided to give him a surprise and build Danny a secret fort out of sticks and stones.
Danny was overjoyed and spent the rest of the day playing in the fort. He was so happy that he had realized his broken cell phone wasn't the end of the world and that he still had his friends.
