Mummy was really excited. She had a big surprise for her little girl. She said, "Come here, let me help you." 
Mummy put some soft sticky skin on her little girl's hands and face. It felt strange, but it felt nice too. 
Mummy took some more sticky skin and put it on her little girl's arms and legs. Then, she started to shape and mould the sticky skin. 
When she was done, she asked the little girl said how she felt. The little girl felt so excited. With the help of Mummy, she had been given a special costume! She was now dressed up as a butterfly!
