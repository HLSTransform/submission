Lila likes to wear her panda hat. It is soft and warm and has two black ears. She wears it every day when she goes to play with her friends.
But one day, a big boy sees her panda hat and wants it. He runs to Lila and tries to take it from her head. He says, "Give me your hat, it is mine now!"
Lila is scared and sad. She does not want to lose her panda hat. She holds it tight and says, "No, it is not yours, it is mine! Go away, big boy!"
The big boy is angry and pulls harder. He says, "You are a baby, you do not need a hat. I am bigger and stronger, I can have what I want!"
Lila cries and screams. She does not know what to do. She needs help.
Then, she sees her friend Tom. Tom is light and fast. He runs to Lila and the big boy. He says, "Stop, big boy, you are mean and bad! Leave Lila alone, she is my friend!"
Tom pushes the big boy away from Lila. He says, "Lila, are you okay? Do you have your panda hat?"
Lila nods and hugs Tom. She says, "Thank you, Tom, you are brave and good! I have my panda hat, it is still mine!"
Tom smiles and says, "You are welcome, Lila, I am glad you are safe. I like your panda hat, it is cute and nice!"
Lila and Tom walk away from the big boy. They hold hands and wear their hats. They are happy and proud. They are friends.
