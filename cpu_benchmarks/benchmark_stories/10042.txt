Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a big oak tree. The oak tree has many leaves and acorns. Tom and Mia want to make a necklace with the acorns.
They pick some acorns from the ground. They use a string to tie them together. They make a long necklace. They are happy.
"Look, Mia, we made a great necklace!" Tom says.
"Yes, Tom, it is very pretty. But it is not shiny. I want it to be shiny," Mia says.
"How can we make it shiny?" Tom asks.
"I know. We can polish it. My mom polishes her shoes with a cloth. Maybe we can find a cloth," Mia says.
They look around the park. They see a bench. On the bench, there is a red cloth. Someone left it there.
"Look, Tom, there is a cloth. We can use it to polish our necklace," Mia says.
They run to the bench. They take the cloth. They rub the acorns with the cloth. The acorns become shiny. They are happy.
"Wow, Mia, our necklace is shiny now. It looks great," Tom says.
"Yes, Tom, it does. We are very good at polishing. Let's wear our necklace and show it to everyone," Mia says.
They put the necklace around their necks. They smile. They are proud of their work. They walk around the park. They show their necklace to the birds, the squirrels, and the people. Everyone likes their necklace. Tom and Mia are happy. They are friends.
