Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to clap her hands whenever she was happy. One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy and daddy. She saw a big slide and felt a bit fearful to go down it. But then her mommy and daddy held her hand and she felt safe. 
After playing on the slide, they went to the ice cream truck. Lily asked for two scoops of ice cream, but her mommy said she could only have one. Lily felt a bit sad, but then she remembered that having one scoop was better than having zero scoops. She clapped her hands and said, "Yay! I still get ice cream!" 
As they walked back home, Lily saw a little bird on the sidewalk. She clapped her hands and said, "Look, mommy and daddy! A birdie!" They all stopped to watch the bird. Then Lily's daddy clapped his hands too and the bird flew away. Lily felt happy and clapped her hands again. The end.
