Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to talk with her friends. One day, she went to her friend's house to play. They played and laughed until they noticed a spider on the ceiling. They discussed how to get rid of it but couldn't decide.
Later that day, Lily went back to her own house. Her mom had just cleaned the ceiling and it looked so nice. She felt proud of her modest home. But then, Lily saw a spider on her own ceiling. She remembered how she couldn't decide with her friends earlier and felt scared.
Lily's mom saw her daughter's fear and said, "Don't worry, we'll figure out how to get rid of it together." They discussed different ways to remove the spider, but suddenly, the spider fell down and bit Lily. She got very sick and had to go to the hospital. Sadly, Lily learned that spiders can be dangerous and it's important to be careful around them.
