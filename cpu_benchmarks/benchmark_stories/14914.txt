Once upon a time, there was a kangaroo who was feeling scared. He met a useful little bunny and asked for help. The bunny said, "Don't worry, kangaroo. I know how to help you be brave." 
Together, they started walking and the bunny asked, "Kangaroo, what do you see?" The kangaroo said he could see a tree and the bunny said, "That's very useful. We can use it to help you not be scared."
The kangaroo and the bunny grabbed a branch and the bunny said, "If you hold this in your hands, it will help you feel brave." The kangaroo held the branch tight, and it worked! He was no longer scared.
The bunny said, "That's very useful. Let me show you something else." Then they went off on an adventure, and from then on, the kangaroo was never scared again.
