One day, a little dog named Max went for a run in the park. Max loved to run very fast. As he was running, he saw a big, harmless bug on the ground. Max stopped running and looked at the bug with big eyes. The bug had many legs and was a funny sight to see.
"Hi, little bug!" Max said to the bug. "Do you want to run with me?" The bug looked up at Max and nodded its head. So, Max and the bug started to run together in the park. They were having so much fun.
After a while, they got tired and decided to rest under a big tree. Max and the bug talked and laughed. They became good friends. From that day on, Max and the bug would meet in the park to run and play together.
