Once upon a time there were two friends. They were playing near a river. One of them had a funny idea. He suggested that they should build a raft and go on a voyage on it. The other one liked the idea and so they decided to build a raft.
They collected pieces of wood and put them together. Then, they took an old sheet and wrapped the raft in it. Suddenly, the sheet ripped and the raft started to fill with water. The boys were very sorry but they decided they would try and build another raft.
So they found more pieces of wood and wrapped it with a stronger sheet. Once they had finished, they put the raft in the river. They hopped on and started their voyage. They held on to the edges of the raft and sailed down the river. They laughed and shouted and had lots of fun.
Finally, they arrived at their destination. The sun was setting and it was time to go home. But they decided to take the raft home too, so they could sail on it another day.
