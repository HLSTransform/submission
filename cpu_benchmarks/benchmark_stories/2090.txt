Once upon a time, there was a big kangaroo. He lived in a big field with lots of grass to eat. But one day, he got very hungry and couldn't find any food. He looked around and saw a little girl with a basket of apples. The kangaroo hopped over and asked if he could have an apple. The little girl was happy to feed the kangaroo and gave him a juicy apple. 
After eating the apple, the kangaroo felt uncomfortable. He had eaten too much and his tummy hurt. He lay down in the grass and closed his eyes. The little girl felt bad for the kangaroo and decided to stay with him until he felt better. They sat in the field together and watched the clouds go by. Eventually, the kangaroo's tummy felt better and he hopped away, feeling grateful for the little girl's kindness.
