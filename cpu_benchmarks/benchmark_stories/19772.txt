Once upon a time there was an ancient cake. It was made by the kindest baker in the world. Every morning, he would plan to make the most delicious cake. He would take the butter and the eggs and the flour and mix them together. Then the wicked oven would cook the cake. When it was finished, the baker would put it on a plate and leave it on the table.
He would also plan to invite all the children he knew to come to the bake shop and have a piece of his cake. As soon as they saw the plate of ancient cake, the children's eyes would sparkle with joy. They would hurry to grab a piece and enjoy its delightful flavor.
The baker was the happiest man in the world when the children left the bake shop with the biggest smiles, because he knew he had made them happy with his ancient cake.
