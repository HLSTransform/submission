Kitty was playing in her garden on Wednesday. She saw something rough and leaned in to take a closer look. It was a big rock. 
Kitty touched the rock. She said to herself, "Mmm, this feels rough!" 
Kitty leaned back and sat down on the grass. She thought very hard and then said, "I know what I can do!"
Kitty stood up, grabbed the rock, and leaned it against the garden wall. She said to herself, "Now I have a seat!"
Kitty then leaned back on the rock and watched the clouds. She smiled and said, "Wednesday is the best day ever!"
