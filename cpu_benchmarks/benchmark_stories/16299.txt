Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved animals and wanted to visit the zoo. Her mommy promised to bring her there on the weekend.
On the day of the visit, Lily woke up early and got ready. She was very excited to see the animals. When they arrived at the zoo, they saw a big sign that said "Don't feed the animals". 
Lily's mommy told her that it was rude to feed the animals because it could make them sick. But later, they saw a boy who was feeding the animals. Suddenly, a big monkey got angry and threw something at the boy. Lily's mommy said, "That's what happens when you are rude to animals." 
Lily learned that it's important to follow the rules and be kind to animals. She had a great time at the zoo and couldn't wait to visit again.
