One day a little girl had an idea. She wanted to build a nice, soft fort out of sacks. She ran to the sack and asked her mom if she could take one. Her mom said yes and she started to drag it to her room.
The little girl started to build the fort. She arranged the sack in a circle and tucked them in so they were nice and soft. She put some pillows, a blanket, stuffed animals and books inside.
The little girl was so proud of her fort. She jumped inside and felt so safe. She brought a special storybook and read it quietly until she felt very sleepy. Then, she hugged her stuffed animal and fell asleep in her soft little fort.
