Once upon a time, there was a big bear named Brownie. Brownie was very strong, but he wanted to be even stronger. So, every day he would do his exercises. He would run, jump, and lift heavy things. His muscles got very thick because of all the exercise he did.
One day, Brownie met a little rabbit named Benny. Benny was very small and he looked up at Brownie with big eyes. Brownie asked Benny if he wanted to exercise with him. Benny nodded his head excitedly and they started to run together. Even though Benny was small, he did his best to keep up with Brownie.
After they finished their exercise, Brownie felt very proud of himself and Benny felt very tired. Brownie thanked Benny for exercising with him and they became good friends. From that day on, they exercised together every day and Brownie's muscles got even thicker.
