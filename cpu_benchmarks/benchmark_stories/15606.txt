Sara liked to sign. She learned how to sign from her mom, who was deaf. Sara could talk and hear, but she also liked to use her hands to say things. She signed to her mom, her dad, her friends, and her toys.
One day, Sara went to school. She had a new teacher, Miss Lee. Miss Lee was nice, but she did not know how to sign. Sara wanted to tell Miss Lee her name, but Miss Lee did not understand. Sara felt sad and shy.
Miss Lee saw that Sara was sad and shy. She wanted to help Sara feel happy and welcome. She asked Sara to come to her desk. Sara walked to the desk. Miss Lee smiled and pointed to a pink paper. On the paper, there were letters and pictures. Miss Lee said, "This is your name tag. You can write your name here and stick it on your shirt. Then everyone will know your name."
Sara looked at the paper. She saw the letters S, A, R, and A. She knew how to write them. She also saw a picture of a hand. She knew what that meant. She smiled and nodded. She took a crayon and wrote her name on the paper. Then she drew a hand next to her name. She stuck the paper on her shirt.
Miss Lee looked at Sara's name tag. She saw the hand. She guessed what it meant. She said, "Sara, do you sign?" Sara nodded and signed, "Yes, I sign. Do you sign?" Miss Lee shook her head and signed, "No, I don't sign. But I want to learn. Can you teach me?" Sara nodded and signed, "Yes, I can teach you. I like to sign. It is fun." Miss Lee smiled and signed, "Thank you, Sara. You are very smart and kind. I am happy to have you in my class." Sara smiled and signed, "Thank you, Miss Lee. You are very nice and friendly. I am happy to be in your class." They hugged and became friends.
