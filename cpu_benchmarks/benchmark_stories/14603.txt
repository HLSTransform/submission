Once there was a dependable dog. He loved taking pictures and playing outside. Every day he would go for a walk and take a picture of something he liked. One day, he was out for a walk when the sky suddenly turned dark. The wind began to blow and it was very cold. Then it started to snow. He took a picture of the snowflakes falling, but then the sky froze solid! 
The dependable dog was so cold that he couldn't move. His feet felt like blocks of ice. Everything around him was perfectly still. Even the birds and squirrels had stopped moving. The only thing he could do was look at the picture of the snow falling he had taken. Suddenly the sun came out again and everything unfroze! The dependable dog was happy to stretch his legs once more and take more pictures.
