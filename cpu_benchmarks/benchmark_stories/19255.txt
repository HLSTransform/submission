One day, a little girl named Mary and her mom went to the park. Mary saw a big shiny bike and wanted to try it. She asked her mom if she could ride it. Her mom said yes and they went to the bike. She looked at it and saw a long handle. She grabbed it and started to pedal. Mary was so happy as she pushed the handle and the bike went faster. She went around in circles, feeling the wind in her hair. Mary laughed and smiled as she continued to ride the bike. Her mom smiled and clapped as she watched. The day was so fun and Mary was so happy!
