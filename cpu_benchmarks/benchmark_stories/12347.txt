John grumbled to himself as he walked through the forest. He had a big bad feeling inside of him and he didn’t understand why. As he walked, he whispered to himself, “John has a bad feeling.”
John came to a clearing and was shocked when he saw a glowing journal sitting on the grass! He cautiously moved closer and then the journal said “Hello, John.”
John was scared, but he asked the journal “What are you?” The journal replied, “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you. I’m here to help you. I’ve been sent to you from a magical place. I can allow you to write your feelings and thoughts here and then magic will turn them into happy things.”
John was still scared, but he decided to give it a try. He took the journal and began to write and suddenly he felt the bad feeling leave his body. He smiled and knew that he had made the right decision. John thanked the journal and said goodbye.
