Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to go to the beach with his mommy and daddy. One day, Timmy saw a jellyfish in the water. He was scared because he thought the jellyfish might sting him. But his mommy told him not to worry, and they went to play in the sand instead.
Later that day, Timmy and his family went to get some ice cream. Timmy got a crazy flavor called bubblegum blast. He loved it so much that he couldn't stop talking about it. He even mentioned it to the ice cream man.
But after they finished their ice cream, Timmy started to feel sick. His tummy hurt and he felt dizzy. His mommy and daddy rushed him to the hospital, but it was too late. Timmy had eaten too much ice cream and got very sick. He learned that even though something might taste good, it's important to not eat too much of it. And so, Timmy's day at the beach ended in a sad way.
