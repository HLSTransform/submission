Once upon a time there was a graceful cat who lived in a little house in the woods. Every night the cat would sneak out of the house and go for a walk in the forest. One night, when the cat was walking in the forest, it heard a noise.
The cat stopped walking and said, “Who is there?”
A small voice replied, “It’s me, Butter!”
The cat asked, “What are you doing here Butter?”
Butter said, “I let myself out of the house and came here to explore. Can I join you?”
The cat smiled and said, “Sure, let’s explore together!”
So the cat and Butter had a wonderful time exploring the forest together. They played hide and seek and ran around and had fun. The cat was so graceful that Butter felt like he was flying when he watched the cat move.
When the sun started to set, the cat said, “Let’s go home now. It’s getting late.”
Butter said goodbye to the cat, and they both went home with happy hearts.
