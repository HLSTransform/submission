John was an adventurous young boy. He wanted to explore. One day, he opened his bedroom door and looked up. He saw the ceiling and was very curious. He liked it because it was rough, like the sand at the beach.
John wanted to see what was on the ceiling. He asked his mom if he could climb up there. She said "No, John. Stay on the ground, please. The ceiling is too high for you."
But John did not give up. He had a plan. He asked his mom for the tall ladder in the garage. He brought the ladder into his bedroom and slowly climbed up.
John slowly reached out to the ceiling. He looked up and saw all the bumps and cracks. Then he put his hand on it. "It's so rough!" he said with a smile.
John stayed up there for a while, exploring the ceiling. Then he thanked his mom, carefully climbed down and went back to playing.
