Jimmy was so excited for his birthday. He wore his special hat and put on his adventures shoes, ready for a day of fun. 
Jimmy and his mom went to the store to buy a cake for his birthday. It was a big pink cake with chocolate frosting. On top was a chocolate castle.
When they got home it was time for the fun part. Jimmy blew out all of the candles in one breath and everyone cheered. He ate a big piece of cake and it was delicious.
After the cake was gone, his family gave him a present. It was small box with a big smiley face on it. Inside was a cup with a straw, just for Jimmy. 
He was so excited he immediately asked, "What do I do with this?"
Mom said, "You drink with it, silly!" Jimmy said, "Okay" and began drinking his special beverage. He felt like such an adventurous kid and smiled.
