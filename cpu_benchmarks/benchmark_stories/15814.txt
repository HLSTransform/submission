Once upon a time, there was a smooth classroom with five children in it. One day, Tom noticed something strange. He thought he saw something move behind the big cupboard. He asked his friend Lila, "Did you see that?"
Lila nodded. "Let's go and hide," she said.
The two friends went over to the cupboard and peered behind it. Sure enough, there was a cute little strange.
Tom and Lila were so surprised! They quickly decided to hide and wait. Soon, a teacher came into the room and asked, "Who is here?"
The strange answered, "I'm here!"
The teacher screamed with delight. "It's a puppy!" she cried.
Tom and Lila began to laugh. They had found a smooth puppy hiding in their classroom.
