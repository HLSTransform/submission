Ben and Sam were brothers who liked to play on the farm. They liked to run, jump, and chase the animals. But they did not like to do their chores. Their mom and dad always told them to help with the milk, the eggs, and the hay. But Ben and Sam always said no.
One day, they saw a big cow in the field. The cow had a bell around her neck. Ben and Sam thought it would be fun to take the bell and make noise with it. They ran to the cow and tried to grab the bell. But the cow did not like that. She mooed loudly and kicked with her legs. Ben and Sam got scared and ran away.
The cow followed them, still mooing. She wanted her bell back. She chased them all the way to the barn, where their mom and dad were. Their mom and dad saw the cow and the bell and knew what Ben and Sam had done. They were very angry.
"Ben and Sam, you have been very bad boys!" their mom said. "You should not take things that are not yours. You should not bother the cow. She gives us milk. You have made her angry and sad. You have to give her back her bell and say sorry."
"And you have to do your chores for a week," their dad said. "That is your punish. You have to learn to be good and helpful. Or else you will not get any milk or eggs or hay. And you will not get any cake or candy or toys. Do you understand?"
Ben and Sam nodded. They felt sorry and ashamed. They gave the cow back her bell and said sorry. The cow mooed softly and licked their faces. She forgave them. Ben and Sam learned their lesson. They did their chores and were good and helpful. They never took things that were not theirs again. And they never bothered the cow again.
