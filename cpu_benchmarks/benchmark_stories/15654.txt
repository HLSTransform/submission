Once there was a little girl named Rose. Rose was always complaining about things that didn't feel right. One day, she was walking in a wide field, feeling very lonely. 
Rose said "I don't like this. I didn't ask to be here." 
Then, a little rabbit hopped up to Rose. It said, "What's wrong? You seem upset." 
Rose said, "I'm feeling very lonely and I don't like it here. I want to be somewhere else." 
The little rabbit said, "Well, why don't we adventure together? That way you won't have to be so lonely." 
Rose smiled and said, "That's a great idea! Let's go!" 
They set off, travelling together and enjoying all the wonderful things they saw. Rose never complained again, as she felt so lucky to have a new friend.
