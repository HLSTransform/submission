Once upon a time, there was an old shelf in a house. The shelf was very big and it had many things on it. One day, something bad happened. The shelf fell down and all the things on it broke into small pieces. The old shelf was broken too and it could not be fixed. The people in the house were very sad because they lost all their things. The end.
