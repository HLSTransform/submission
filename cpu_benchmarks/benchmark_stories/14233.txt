Once there was a dog named Sam. He was very fast and every day he would practice running. One day, pretending he was in a race, he started running as fast as he could through the park.
Sam saw a fence at the end of the park and got an idea; he wanted to see if he could jump over it! He smiled and kept running. When he got to the fence he started to jump, but he didn't make it. He fell to the ground and frowned.
Just then, a rabbit hopped by and saw what had happened. He said to Sam, "Try again! If you want success, you can't give up!"
Sam smiled and got up quickly. This time he jumped higher and higher and made it over the fence! He was so proud and happy.
Sam ran back to the rabbit, who smiled, and said, "You did it! Success!"
Sam smiled and started running around the park again, happy and proud of his success.
