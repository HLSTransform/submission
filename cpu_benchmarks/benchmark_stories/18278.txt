Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved cars and trucks. One day, Timmy's dad took him to a factory where they made cars. Timmy thought it was so cool! 
At the factory, Timmy saw big machines and lots of workers. They were making all kinds of cars. Timmy's dad explained how the workers put all the parts together to make a car. 
Before they left, Timmy's dad bought him a toy car from the factory gift shop. Timmy was so happy! He couldn't wait to bring it to show his friends.
