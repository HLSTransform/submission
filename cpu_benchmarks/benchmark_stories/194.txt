Ben and Mia were playing in the park with their bikes. They liked to ride fast and make noises. They saw a big hill and wanted to go down it.
"Let's race!" Ben said. "I bet I can go faster than you!"
"OK!" Mia said. "But be careful. There is a cable at the bottom of the hill. It is for the lights. We have to stop before we hit it."
They got ready and started to pedal. They went down the hill very fast. They felt the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They laughed and shouted.
But Ben did not listen to Mia. He wanted to win. He did not look at the cable. He did not stop. He hit the cable with his bike. He fell off and hurt his leg. He started to scream.
Mia stopped and ran to him. She saw the blood on his leg. She felt sorry for him. She said, "Ben, why did you not stop? I told you about the cable. You were not wise. You were silly. Now you are hurt."
Ben cried and said, "I'm sorry, Mia. I wanted to win. I did not think. You were wise. You were careful. Can you help me?"
Mia nodded and said, "Yes, I can help you. But first, we have to call Mom. She will know what to do. She will take you to the doctor. He will make your leg better."
She took out her phone and called Mom. She told her what happened. Mom said she would come right away. She told them to stay where they were and not to move.
Mia hugged Ben and said, "Don't worry, Ben. It will be OK. Mom is coming. She will help you. And I will stay with you. You are my brother. I love you."
Ben smiled and said, "Thank you, Mia. You are my sister. I love you too."
