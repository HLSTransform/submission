Tom and Sue like to play in the park. They see a big pond with many fish. They want to catch some fish. They find a rod and a hook near a bench. They think someone left it there.
"Look, Tom, a rod! Let's use it to catch fish!" Sue says.
"OK, Sue, but be careful. The hook is sharp. It can hurt you." Tom says.
They take the rod and the hook and go to the pond. They put the hook in the water and wait. Soon, a fish comes and bites the hook. Sue pulls the rod and the fish comes out of the water.
"Wow, Sue, you caught a fish! It is big and shiny!" Tom says.
But the fish is not a normal fish. It has big teeth and eyes. It is a mysterious fish. It is angry and scared. It opens its mouth and bites Sue's hand. Sue screams and drops the rod and the fish.
"Ow, ow, ow! The fish bit me! It hurts!" Sue cries.
Tom runs to Sue and tries to help her. But the fish is still on the hook. It swings and hits Tom's head. Tom falls and hits his head on a rock. He bleeds and does not move.
"Tom, Tom, wake up! Please, wake up!" Sue cries.
But Tom does not wake up. He is very hurt. The fish is still angry and scared. It tries to get free. It makes a loud noise.
The noise attracts a big dog. The dog sees the fish and the rod. It thinks they are toys. It runs to them and grabs them with its mouth. It shakes them and tears them. The fish dies. The rod breaks.
The dog sees Sue and Tom. It thinks they are also toys. It runs to them and bites them. Sue and Tom scream and cry. They are very hurt. They cannot run away.
The dog plays with them until it gets bored. Then it leaves them alone. Sue and Tom lie on the ground. They are bleeding and crying. They are very sad and scared. They want their mom and dad. But no one comes to help them. They are alone in the park. The end.
