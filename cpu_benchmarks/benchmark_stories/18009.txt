Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved flowers and had a big garden with many colors. One day, Lily saw a pretty flower and wanted to pick it. She remembered her mom said to tie a ribbon around the stem so it wouldn't fall apart. Lily found a pink ribbon and tied it around the flower. It looked fair and pretty with the ribbon on it. Lily was happy and ran inside to show her mom the flower she tied.
