Once there was a little girl called Jane. Jane was just three years old, and she liked playing a lot. One day, Jane went to the park with her mom.
At the park, Jane wanted to swing. She ran to the swing and sat down. Her mom told Jane to hold tight to the swing with her hands, but Jane forgot. As she swung, she lifted her arms up high and forgot to hold on.
Suddenly, Jane flew up in the air. She was scared and screamed for help. She was too far away for her mom to catch her, but then she remembered her thumb! She put her thumb in her mouth, and her thumb helped save her. 
Jane came back safe and sound. From that day on, she never forgot to hold on to the swing with her hands.
