Once there was an animal who was very brave. He enjoyed wandering around the forest looking for adventure. One day he came across another animal who was also exploring. They quickly became friends and started to look for new places and things together. 
One day, they had a disagreement. The brave animal wanted to take a path that was filled with danger, while the other animal was worried they would get hurt if they took this route. They argued back and forth, but neither of them wanted to give in. 
Finally, the brave animal said, "Let's find another way! I'm sure we can find a path even more exciting!" After he said this, the other animal smiled, and they continued on. They found a wonderful new spot, and were very glad they decided to disagree and find another route.
