Lily and Tom were playing in the garden. They liked to run and jump and hide. They saw a big red ball near the fence. They wanted to play with it.
They ran to the ball and picked it up. It was very hot. They dropped it and said "ouch". They looked at the ball and saw a hole. Smoke was coming out of the hole. The ball was not a ball. It was a firework.
They were scared. They knew fireworks were dangerous. They could make loud noises and hurt people. They ran away from the firework and shouted for help.
Mum and Dad heard them and came to the garden. They saw the firework and said "oh no". They quickly got a bucket of water and poured it on the firework. The smoke stopped and the firework was wet.
They hugged Lily and Tom and said "are you okay?". They said "yes, we are okay". They said "sorry, we thought it was a ball". They said "we did not know it was a firework".
Mum and Dad said "it's okay, we are glad you are safe". They said "fireworks are not toys, they are for special days". They said "you should never touch them, they are very hot and dangerous". They said "you should always tell us if you see something strange in the garden".
Lily and Tom said "okay, we understand". They said "thank you for saving us". They said "we love you". They said "can we play with something else now?".
Mum and Dad said "yes, you can play with something else". They said "how about this?". They showed them a big box with a bow. They said "this is a surprise for you". They said "we got it for your birthday".
Lily and Tom were happy. They said "wow, a surprise". They said "what is it?". They opened the box and saw a big teddy bear and a big doll. They said "yay, we love them". They hugged Mum and Dad and said "thank you, thank you, thank you". They played with their new toys and forgot about the firework. They had a lot of fun.
