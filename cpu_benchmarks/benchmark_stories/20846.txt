Once upon a time there was a small gray bird. The bird lived in a very big tree. Every morning it looked out of its nest to see the world.
One day, the bird saw a scary thing. It was a big, nasty cat. It was filthy and mean. The bird was so scared! It started to chirp to tell its family about the cat. 
The family of birds was scared, too. But then, the biggest bird in the family stepped forward to protect them all. The big bird swooped around the cat and scared it away. 
The family of birds was happy and safe. And from that day on, the big bird always made sure to protect them from nasty cats!
