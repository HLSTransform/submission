Once upon a time, there was a little car named Red. Red loved to race with his friends on the road. They would go really fast and have fun. Red liked to go fast, but he also wanted to be safe.
One day, Red was racing with his friends and he was going really fast. He was having so much fun that he forgot to be safe. Red didn't see the big truck coming towards him. The truck was going too fast and Red couldn't move out of the way in time.
The truck hit Red and he went flying. Red was hurt really bad and he couldn't race anymore. His friends were sad and they missed him. They learned that it's important to go fast and have fun, but it's more important to be safe.
