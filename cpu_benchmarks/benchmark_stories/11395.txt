Once upon a time there was a girl called Nina. Nina was three years old and she loved skipping. Whenever she was feeling happy she would go outside and skip along. 
One day, Nina's family were heading to the airport. A rare thing had happened and their plane was ready to go early. Nina was thrilled, she was so excited and when they were at the airport she didn't want to stop skipping! Everyone was happy that Nina was so happy, and they watched as she skipped her way to the plane. 
"Keep skipping, Nina!" said Mum as she watched.
Nina smiled. She skipped right onto the plane and the journey to their destination began. Nina kept skipping all the way there, happy and laughing. 
When they eventually reached their destination it was time to say goodbye. But they all knew that Nina's skipping had made their journey so special and had given them a rare moment to enjoy together. 
They said goodbye and Nina set off, still skipping, back home to her friends and family.
