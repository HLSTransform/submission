Once upon a time there was a happy little boy who loved to skip. His favourite place to skip was in the park by his house. Every day he would put on his shoes and head out to the park with a skip in his step.
One day when he was skipping he heard a voice behind him say, “Hello there little boy!” He turned around to find a nice nurse smiling at him. She asked him if he wanted to play a game, so he of course said yes! The nurse taught him a new game when he skipped. Whenever he skipped he had to say, “one, two, three!”
The little boy loved the game, so he played it every day and got better and better. He even started teaching it to his friends too!
One day while they were playing, they heard a very noisy noise coming from the park. It was loud and it seemed like it was coming from the nurse! She had put on a hat and was acting silly, singing and dancing. The little boy and his friends all started having an even more noisy time, laughing and cheering as the nurse skipped around with her funny hat. They all had so much fun!
