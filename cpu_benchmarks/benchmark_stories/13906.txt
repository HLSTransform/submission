One day, a little girl named Sue went to the bakery with her mom. Sue saw a yummy pastry. She asked her mom, "Can I take the pastry, please?" Her mom said, "Yes, you can take it."
At the bakery, there was a rude boy named Tom. He wanted to take Sue's pastry. Tom said, "Give me your pastry!" Sue said, "No, it's mine!"
Sue's mom saw the rude boy and told him, "You cannot take her pastry. That is not nice." Tom's face turned red, and he said, "Sorry." Sue and her mom left the bakery with the yummy pastry, happy and smiling.
