Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a nice pen that she loved to draw with. One day, Lily went to the park and met a new friend named Timmy.
"Hi, I'm Timmy. That's a nice pen you have," said Timmy.
"Thank you," replied Lily. "Do you want to draw with it?"
"Yes, please!" said Timmy excitedly.
Lily let Timmy use her pen and they drew pictures together. But when it was time to go home, Timmy ran away with Lily's pen. Lily was very sad because she lost her favorite pen and gained a feeling of betrayal.
From that day on, Lily learned to be careful with her things and to not trust strangers. She never saw Timmy again and never got her pen back. The end.
