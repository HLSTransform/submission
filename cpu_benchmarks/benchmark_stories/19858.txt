Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat yummy cookies and wear pretty blouses. One day, Lily was walking in the park when she stumbled and fell down. Her blouse got dirty and she started to cry.
A kind lady saw Lily and asked her what happened. Lily told her that she fell and her blouse got dirty. The lady wiped her tears and said, "Don't worry, accidents happen. Let's clean your blouse and you'll be good as new."
Lily learned that it's okay to make mistakes and stumble sometimes, but there are always kind people who are willing to help. She also learned to be grateful for those who lend a helping hand. From that day on, Lily always remembered to say thank you to those who helped her.
