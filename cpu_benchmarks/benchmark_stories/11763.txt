Once upon a time, there was a man who had to deliver a present. He drove to a house, and when he arrived he saw lots of bright lights. He stepped out of his car and knocked on the door.
When it opened, a woman greeted him. She looked so happy and said "It has been such a long stay here, I am so glad you have come to deliver a present." 
The man smiled and nodded, handing her the present. When the woman opened it, she saw a big box of sour candies. She smiled even more and thanked the man, telling him how much she loves sweet and sour candy. 
The man smiled and waved goodbye. The woman clapped her hands and said what a wonderful surprise this was. She thanked him once again and the man drove away.
The end.
