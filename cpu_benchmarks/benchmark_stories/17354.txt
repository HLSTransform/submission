Tom and Lily liked to play in the farm. They liked to see the cows, the pigs, the chickens and the horses. But they did not like to see the bull. The bull was big and scary. He had horns and he made loud noises. He lived in a part of the farm that had a fence and a sign that said "Keep Out".
One day, Tom and Lily were playing near the fence. They saw the bull sleeping in the grass. Tom had an idea. He said to Lily, "Let's go and touch the bull. He won't wake up. It will be fun." Lily was afraid. She said, "No, Tom. We can't go there. The sign says 'Keep Out'. The bull is scary. He might hurt us." But Tom did not listen. He said, "Don't be a baby. I will go first. You can come after me." He climbed over the fence and walked towards the bull.
Lily watched Tom from the other side of the fence. She felt nervous. She hoped Tom would come back soon. She saw Tom reach the bull and touch his back. The bull did not move. Tom smiled and waved at Lily. He said, "See? It's easy. Come on, Lily. Don't be scared." Lily shook her head. She said, "No, Tom. I don't want to. Please come back." But Tom did not come back. He wanted to touch the bull's horns. He thought they were cool. He moved his hand towards the bull's head.
But the bull was not sleeping. He was just resting. He felt Tom's hand on his back and his head. He did not like it. He opened his eyes and saw Tom. He was angry. He made a loud noise and jumped up. He swung his horns at Tom. Tom was scared. He screamed and ran away. But the bull was faster. He chased Tom across the grass. Tom tried to reach the fence, but he was too late. The bull caught him and threw him in the air.
Lily saw everything. She was very scared. She cried and shouted for help. She saw a farmer running towards them. The farmer had a stick. He hit the bull with the stick and made him stop. He picked up Tom and carried him to the fence. He gave Tom to Lily and said, "Are you okay, kids? What were you doing here? Don't you know this is a dangerous part of the farm? You should never go near the bull. He is scary and he can hurt you. You are lucky I was here. You could have been killed." Tom and Lily were sorry. They said, "We are sorry, farmer. We were playing and we wanted to touch the bull. We did not know he was awake. We won't do it again. Please don't be mad at us." The farmer was not mad. He was glad they were safe. He said, "It's okay, kids. I'm not mad. But you have to be careful. The bull is not a toy. He is a wild animal. You have to respect him and stay away from him. Now go home and tell your parents what happened. And don't come back here again." Tom and Lily nodded. They hugged the farmer and thanked him. They ran home and told their parents. They learned their lesson. They never went near the bull again. They played in other parts of the farm that were safe and fun.
