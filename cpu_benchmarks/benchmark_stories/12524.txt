Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with puzzles. One day, her mom gave her a bright puzzle with many colors. Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you, mommy! I love it!"
Lily spent the whole afternoon playing with her new puzzle. She was so proud when she finished it. She showed it to her little brother and said, "Look, I finished my puzzle! It's so pretty!" Her brother smiled and said, "I want to play too!"
Lily said, "Okay, let's play together!" But her brother accidentally broke the puzzle. Lily was so sad and said, "Oh no, my puzzle is broken! I can't fix it!" She cried and cried because she loved her puzzle so much. The end.
