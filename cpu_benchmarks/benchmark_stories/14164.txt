Once upon a time there was a lazy bear called Benny. Benny was very, very lazy and he loved to sleep more than he liked to do anything else!
One day, Benny was walking around in the forest when he saw a strange switch. The switch was shiny and sparkly and it made Benny really curious! He wanted to touch it.
Benny's mama, however, was not too happy. She saw the switch too, and she knew that it was very important and that Benny shouldn't touch it. Despite this, she saw the gleam of excitement in Benny's eyes and couldn't help but frown.
"No Benny!", Mama said sternly. "You must not touch the switch!"
But Benny was too curious and before Mama could stop him, he had already reached out to flick it. Mama quickly grabbed his hand and she looked down at him with a stern expression.
"Benny, you must learn to be more responsible. That switch is important and you must always be careful when you see something like this. Now, let's go home."
Mama took Benny's hand and the two of them slowly walked away from the mysterious switch. Although Benny was disappointed, he knew that Mama was right and he would never forget this lesson.
