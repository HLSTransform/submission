Once upon a time, there was a big house. It was dark and scary and the people who lived inside it were very sad.
One day, something magical happened! A kind fairy arrived and showed the people a very special present. It was a pile of coal.
The fairy told them, "This coal can make your house happy again. Put it in your fireplace and it will help you build a bright and cosy place to live".
The people in the house were so excited. Together, they worked really hard to build a glowing fire in the fireplace. The coal pieces sizzled and popped as they were added. Soon, the house was filled with a warm, comforting light.
The people in the house were so excited. They hugged each other and thanked the kind fairy for leaving them the coal. That night, they all snuggled up by their cosy fire, safe and happy.
