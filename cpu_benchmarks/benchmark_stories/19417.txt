Once upon a time there was a little girl named Susie. She was three years old. She loved learning new things. Every day she would go to school. Her teacher, Mrs. Smith, would teach her fun things.
Today, Mrs. Smith taught Susie to be independent. She showed Susie how to take care of herself. Susie was so excited to learn new things and do them on her own!
When school was over, it was time to leave. Susie was sad, but she was happy too. She was happy because she had learned how to be independent. She hugged Mrs. Smith goodbye and waved to her friends. Then, she left school on her own.
Susie was so proud of herself. She was very independent! She was so happy and looked forward to coming back to school tomorrow to learn more.
