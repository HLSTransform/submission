Once upon a time, there were two birds. One bird was small and the other bird was big.
The small bird sang and sang every day. The big bird watched and listened.
The small bird wanted to be wide, like the big one. So it practiced and sang harder and harder.
One day, the big bird said, "Little bird, fly wide. Go above the clouds and you will be happy".
So the small bird followed the big bird. He flew and flew high and wide. The wind was cold, but he sang louder and louder until he broke through the white clouds.
The small bird saw that all birds, big and small, could be wide. On top of the clouds, all the birds sang together.
The moral of the story is: never give up on your dreams. If you keep trying, you can be wide too.
