Once upon a time, there was an old man who loved to teach. He had many pupils who came to learn from him every day. One day, he asked his pupils to guess how many apples were in a basket. One pupil guessed ten, another guessed twenty, but no one got the right answer.
The old man smiled and said, "It's not about guessing the right answer, it's about trying your best." He then showed them the basket and said, "There were twelve apples in the basket."
The pupils were surprised and asked how he knew. The old man replied, "I counted them." The pupils learned that sometimes it's better to ask questions and find out the answer, rather than just guessing.
The moral of the story is that it's okay to not know the answer, but it's important to try your best and learn from your mistakes.
