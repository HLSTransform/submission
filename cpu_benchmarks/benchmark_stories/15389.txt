Once there was a girl named Zoe. Zoe was 3 years old and she loved to study.
One day, Zoe decided to go to the library to study. She took her special equipment with her, like her books and pencils.
When she arrived at the library, Zoe was excited to see all the tall shelves full of books. She carefully studied each book and took notes to remember the important things.
Zoe was a great student and soon she was able to answer all the questions in the books. She was so proud of herself!
After studying all day, Zoe knew she would need more equipment next time to become even better at studying.
The end.
