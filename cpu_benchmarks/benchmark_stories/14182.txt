Once upon a time, there was a jolly little girl who loved to go for adventures. She had a red bicycle and she would ride it far and wide, exploring the world.
One day, the little girl hopped onto her red bicycle and started pedaling away. She rode and rode until her tummy started to rumble. She decided to stop and looked around for something to eat.
Suddenly, she spotted a small, round fruit sitting on a tree branch. The girl stepped off her red bicycle and went over for a closer look.
The little girl plucked the fruit off the branch and took a bite. It tasted sweet like candy! She was so delighted, she quickly ate the rest of it.
Just then, a big, fat bee flew past her. The bee was angry because the little girl had stolen its snack! It started buzzing really loudly and shooting out angry puffs of beesmoke.
The girl was scared, so she jumped back on her red bicycle and started pedaling as fast as she could. The bee followed her, still angry and buzzing. The little girl pedaled faster until the bee disappeared and she was safe again.
The end!
