Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited to go to the park with her mommy. They packed a picnic and went to the park. When they got there, they saw a big slide. Lily's mommy said, "We have to wait for our turn to go down the slide." 
Lily didn't want to wait. She wanted to go down the slide right away. She started to cry and said, "I don't like waiting, it's bad." Her mommy said, "I know waiting is hard, but we have to be patient." 
After a few minutes, it was finally their turn to go down the slide. Lily was so excited that she forgot all about the waiting. She went down the slide and had so much fun! She said to her mommy, "Waiting was bad, but going down the slide was so much fun!"
