Once upon a time there was a clever pet named Fluffy. He lived with a girl called Ruby. Every day, Ruby and Fluffy would play together.
Ruby would keep Fluffy safe. She made sure that he always had food, water and a warm, dry place to sleep. Fluffy would wait for her outside every day until she came back home.
Ruby enjoyed playing hide and seek with Fluffy. Whenever she hid, Fluffy would try to find her. He was so clever that he always found her hiding spot.
In return, Ruby would give Fluffy lots of cuddles and treats. She looked after him very carefully and they became very good friends.
Ruby and Fluffy still keep very happy together. They play lots of games and enjoy spending time together. They both know that they will always be the best of friends.
