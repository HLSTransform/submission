Once upon a time, there was a big red ball. The ball loved to roll all day long. It would roll down the hill, in the park, and even in the house.
One sunny day, the ball was rolling in the park. It saw a bench. The ball wanted to roll on the bench too. It rolled and rolled until it jumped onto the bench. The ball was very happy.
After a long day of rolling, the ball was tired. It rolled back to its home and rested next to its friend, the small blue ball. They both slept and dreamed of more rolling adventures for the next day.
