Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and run around with her friends. One day, Lily saw a patient man walking down the street. He looked very tired and his feet hurt.
Lily wanted to help the patient man, so she ran over to him and asked if he needed any support. The patient man was very grateful for Lily's kindness and thanked her for offering to help.
Lily walked with the patient man and talked to him to make him feel better. She told him about her favorite toys and games to play. The patient man smiled and said that Lily's kind words and support made him feel much better.
From that day on, Lily always looked out for people who needed support and helped them feel better when they were hurt.
