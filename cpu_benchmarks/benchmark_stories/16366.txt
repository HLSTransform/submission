One day, a little girl named Lily went out to play. She saw a delicate flower that was very pretty. Lily wanted to help the flower grow, so she thought of giving it a shower.
Lily ran inside her house and got a small cup. She filled it with water and went back outside. She gave the flower a gentle shower with the water in the cup. The flower seemed to smile and say "thank you" to Lily.
Every day, Lily would give the flower a shower. The flower grew bigger and more beautiful. Lily was happy that she could help the flower. The flower was happy too, and they became best friends.
