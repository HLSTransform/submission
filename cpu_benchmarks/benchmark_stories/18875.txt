Lily and Max are friends who like to play in the park. They admire the big kids who can run fast and jump high. They want to be like them when they grow up.
One day, they see a sign that says "Exercise Class". They think it is a fun game where they can learn to run fast and jump high. They follow the sign and join the class.
But the class is not what they expect. It is hard and boring. The teacher makes them do push-ups, sit-ups, and squats. They do not like it at all. They want to play and have fun.
"Max, this is not a game. This is work. I do not want to do this anymore. Let's go back to the park." Lily says.
"But Lily, we have to finish the class. Maybe then we can run fast and jump high like the big kids. We have to try." Max says.
"No, Max. This is not fun. This is silly. Come on, let's go." Lily says. She grabs Max's hand and pulls him away from the class.
The teacher sees them and shouts. "Hey, where are you going? You have to stay and finish the exercise. It is good for you. Come back here!"
But Lily and Max do not listen. They run away as fast as they can. They go back to the park and play with their toys. They are happy and free. They do not need to do the exercise class. They can run fast and jump high in their own way. They admire each other and their own skills. They are the best friends ever.
