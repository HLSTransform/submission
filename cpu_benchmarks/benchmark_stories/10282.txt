Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very excited to go to school because he loved to learn new things. One day, Timmy's teacher gave him a folder to take home. Timmy was so proud of his folder, and he wanted to show it to his mom and dad.
When Timmy got home, he saw that his mom was very busy cooking dinner. Timmy asked his mom if she could look at his folder, but his mom said she was too busy. Timmy felt sad, but he didn't give up. He asked his dad, and his dad was also too busy to look at the folder.
Timmy felt a little bit discouraged, but he remembered something his teacher told him. She said that it's important to be humble and always answer questions when someone asks for help. So, Timmy went back to his mom and dad and asked them humbly if they could please look at his folder. His parents were so proud of Timmy for being so polite, and they happily looked at his folder. Timmy learned that being humble and asking for help is always the right thing to do.
