Suddenly, a big bear appeared. He was angry and started to growl. The little girl was scared and started to run away. 
Suddenly, her mom came to help. She shouted for the girl and warned her. She said, "Don't touch the vegetable, it's dangerous! Let's go home."
The little girl was scared but she listened to her mom. She followed her mom and went home. The little girl learned that it's important to listen to warnings.
