Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy and his friends were playing hide and seek. Timmy was hiding behind a big tree on his street when he saw a man walking by. The man looked very sad.
Timmy asked the man, "Why do you look so sad?" The man replied, "I lost my wallet with all my money in it. I feel guilty for being so careless." Timmy wanted to help the man, so he asked, "What's your name and phone number? Maybe someone will find your wallet and call you." The man smiled and gave Timmy his phone number.
Later that day, Timmy's mom found the man's wallet on the street and called the phone number Timmy had given her. The man was so happy to get his wallet back and thanked Timmy for being such a good helper. Timmy felt proud of himself for doing a good deed and making a new friend.
