Once there was a mummy, daddy and a baby. The baby was very obedient, going to bed on time and eating all of his dinner. One day mummy noticed that the baby had forgotten to close the fridge door when he'd finished getting out his dinner.
Mummy was very cross and told the baby he must be more obedient and not forget to close the fridge door. The baby was very sorry and said it was a mistake, he would try his best to be more obedient.
The next day, daddy went to get some food from the fridge but when he opened the door, he noticed that the baby had remembered to close the fridge door this time! Daddy was very pleased and gave the baby a big hug for being so obedient. From then on, the baby never forgot to close the fridge door.
