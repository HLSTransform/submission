Sam was a rich boy who loved to whistle. He loved to whistle every day as he walked through his neighborhood. One day, he came across a big billboard. He stopped and looked at the billboard and started to smile. It was beautiful. On the billboard was a picture of a sunny day and a large tree with colorful leaves. Sam wondered what it was like to be so rich and have such a beautiful billboard. He decided to whistle a happy song and slowly walked away.
The next day, Sam walked back past the billboard, but this time it had changed. The picture of the sunny day was gone and the tree was covered in colorful presents! Sam couldn't believe his eyes. He started to whistle again and ran to his house to tell everyone the wonderful news. He was so happy. He had seen what it was like to be rich.
