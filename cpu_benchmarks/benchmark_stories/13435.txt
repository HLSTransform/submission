Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy box full of toys. He loved all of his toys very much, but his favorite was his red fire truck. He would play with it every day and never let anyone else touch it.
One day, Timmy's friend came over to play. Timmy showed him all of his toys, but when he got to the fire truck, he said, "This is mine and you can't play with it." His friend was sad, but Timmy didn't care.
Later that day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean up his toys. Timmy didn't want to, but he knew he had to. He quickly put all of his toys away, but he forgot to shut the toy box. 
That night, a mouse snuck into Timmy's room and saw the open toy box. The mouse climbed in and found the fire truck. He started to play with it and accidentally knocked it off the edge of the toy box. The fire truck broke into a million pieces.
Timmy was very sad when he woke up and saw his broken fire truck. He realized that he should have shared his toys with his friend and he should have shut the toy box. He learned a valuable lesson that day.
