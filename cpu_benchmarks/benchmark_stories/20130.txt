Anna and Ben were friends who lived in a small village. They liked to play in the fields and help their parents with chores. One day, they saw a big cart full of apples on the road. The cart was broken and the apples were falling out.
"Look, Ben, apples!" Anna said. "Let's take some and eat them. They look yummy."
"No, Anna, that's not right," Ben said. "The apples belong to someone else. We should help them fix the cart and carry the apples back."
"But they won't notice if we take a few," Anna said. "And we are hungry. Come on, Ben, don't be a baby."
Anna grabbed an apple and bit into it. Ben shook his head and walked towards the cart. He saw a man lying on the ground, holding his leg. He looked hurt and sad.
"Hello, sir, are you okay?" Ben asked. "Can I help you?"
The man smiled and said, "Thank you, little boy. You are very kind and honest. I was taking these apples to the market, but my cart broke and I hurt my leg. Can you help me carry the apples to the village?"
"Of course, sir, I will help you," Ben said. "But I need to find my friend first. She was here a moment ago."
Ben looked around and saw Anna hiding behind a tree. She had a guilty look on her face and a half-eaten apple in her hand. She knew she had done something wrong.
"Anna, come here," Ben called. "We need to help this man. He needs our help."
Anna came out of her hiding place and walked slowly to the cart. She saw the man and the apples and felt ashamed. She said, "I'm sorry, sir. I took one of your apples. I was hungry and I didn't think."
The man looked at Anna and said, "It's okay, little girl. I forgive you. But you should always be honest and not take what is not yours. Will you help me carry the apples to the village?"
Anna nodded and said, "Yes, sir, I will help you. And I will never take what is not mine again. I'm sorry, Ben. You were right. I was wrong."
Ben smiled and said, "It's okay, Anna. We all make mistakes. But we can learn from them and be better. Come on, let's help this man. He is very nice and he has a lot of apples."
Anna and Ben helped the man carry the apples to the village. They worked hard and had fun. The man thanked them and gave them each an apple as a reward. They ate the apples and felt happy. They had learned a valuable lesson about honesty and kindness. They hugged the man and each other and went home. They were still friends and they were proud of themselves.
