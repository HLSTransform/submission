Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved the color pink and always wore a pink dress. One day, she asked her daddy to build her a pink castle. Daddy said yes and they went to the store to buy pink bricks. 
Daddy worked hard to build the castle and Lily helped by carrying the bricks. When it was finished, Lily was so happy and ran inside to play. She pretended to be a princess and sang songs. 
As the sun set, Lily went to bed in her pink room inside the castle. Daddy kissed her goodnight and said he loved her. Lily smiled and felt so lucky to have a daddy who could build her dreams.
