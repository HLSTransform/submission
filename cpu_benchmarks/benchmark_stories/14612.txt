Once upon a time there were two friends, Joe and Kate. Joe liked to pinch Kate's shoulder when he wanted to play a game. But sometimes he would pinch her too hard and it would hurt. Kate would say, "Ouch! That hurt!" Then Joe would stop and say, "Sorry Kate. I didn't mean to pinch you hard like that." So Joe and Kate would hug and make-up and go off to play their game. The end.
