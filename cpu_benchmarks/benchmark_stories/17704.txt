Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. She was three years old, and loved to explore the world around her. 
One day, Sarah saw a well in the backyard. It was a very old well and she wanted to see what was inside. So, she got a little stick and started to hit it against the well. 
Suddenly, the old well split into two! Sarah was so excited that she had broken the well open! She looked inside of the well and saw a few small rocks and some water. She then decided to look around the well to see if there was anything else. 
Sarah discovered a little rabbit hopping around the well. She picked it up and held it tight. She was so happy that she had found a little friend. The two of them roam around the backyard together until the sun was setting. 
Sarah was so glad that she had split open the well and found a little friend. She said goodbye to the little rabbit, and they both went home to get some rest.
