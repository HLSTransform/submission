Once upon a time, there was a lively boy named Tim. He was very happy and liked to play all day. One day, Tim had the best idea ever! He wanted to make a cake. He grabbed the ingredients from the cupboard and started to mix them together. Suddenly, his mom called from the other room. She was in trouble and she needed Tim's help to save her! Tim quickly ran over to help. He was so brave!
When the danger was gone, Tim and his mom went back to make his cake. They mixed the ingredients until everything was perfect. Then he put the cake in the oven. After a while, the timer went "ding!" and the cake was ready.
Tim and his mom took the cake out of the oven and it looked delicious! Tim was so proud of his creation. He invited all his friends over to eat the cake and they had a very lively celebration. Everyone was happy and having a good time.
Tim had saved his mom and made a delicious cake! It was an amazing day for Tim.
