Molly was very excited. She was going to the top of the highest hill. As Molly walked, she noticed a beautiful crystal. It sparkled brightly in the sunshine. She went over to the crystal, and held it in her hands.
Molly said to the crystal, "Do you want to come with me to the top of the hill?" 
The crystal didn't answer, but it twinkled harder in the sun.
Molly smiled and said, "Come on, I'll carry you!" She tucked the crystal carefully into her pocket and continued up the hill.
When she reached the top, Molly found the most perfect spot and she sat down. She reached into her pocket and held the crystal up in the sunlight. The crystal sparkled even more brightly and Molly smiled. She said out loud, "This is the perfect place for you!"
When the sun began to set, Molly said goodbye to the crystal. She hugged it tight and then put it back in her pocket. As she walked back down the hill, Molly felt very happy.
