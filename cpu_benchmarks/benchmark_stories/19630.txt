Once upon a time there was a modern forest. It was filled with trees, birds and other animals. One day, a curious little bunny poked its head out of its hole to see what was going on. It spotted a family of bears walking through the forest. The bunny hopped after them, wanting to explore. 
The family of bears was so excited when they spotted the bunny! They poked and tickled him and let him tag along. The bunny was so happy! He explored with the bears, hopping from one place to another. 
The little bunny and the family of bears explored the modern forest, discovering new things they had never seen before. Before they knew it, the sun was setting and it was time to say goodbye. 
The bunny waved goodbye to his bear friends and hopped off into the sunset. Everyone was so happy that they had spent the day together, finding so many magical things in the forest.
