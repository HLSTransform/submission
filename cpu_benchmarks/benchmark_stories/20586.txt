Once upon a time, there was a boy with a bicycle. It was big and his favourite. He was very careful with it, and it was always in the same place. One day, the boy got off his bike to do something else. But when he went back to get his bicycle, it had vanished! He was so sad and couldn't understand where it had gone. He searched everywhere but could not find it. Where had it gone? Suddenly, he heard a noise coming from far away. He looked up to the sky and saw his bicycle! It was flying through the air! He couldn't believe his eyes! He was so happy to have it back that he forgot to be careful and decided to go for a spin on his bike. It was the best ride ever!
