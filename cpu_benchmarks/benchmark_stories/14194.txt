Once upon a time there was a lively dog. His name was Spot. Every day he would run and play outside with his friends. But he hadn't found something special to eat!
One day, Spot went to his favorite store and asked his friend for help. His friend had a good opinion for Spot. He said “Why don’t you try the yummy cookies? They’re sure to make your tummy happy!” 
Spot was so excited to hear his friend’s opinion and he wanted to try the cookies right away, so he grabbed a bag of them from the shelf. On the way home he opened the bag and started eating the cookies.
They were delicious! Spot had never tasted such yummy cookies before. He ran back to the store to get more and ate them with his friends. They all had a great time and laughed and played the day away! 
Spot was so happy that he had listened to his friend. He learned that it's always a good idea to trust the opinions of people who look out for you.
