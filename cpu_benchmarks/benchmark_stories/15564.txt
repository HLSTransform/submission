Lily was sick. She had a bad cough and a hot head. Mommy gave her a pill to make her feel better. Lily did not like the pill. It was big and bitter. She made a face and spit it out.
"Come on, Lily, you have to take the pill," Mommy said. "It will help you stop coughing and cool your head."
Lily shook her head. She did not want the pill. She saw her brother Jake playing with his toys. He was not sick. He looked happy and fun. Lily felt jealous. She wanted to play too.
"Jake, can I play with you?" Lily asked.
"No, Lily, you are sick. You have to stay in bed," Jake said. "And you have to take the pill. Mommy said so."
Lily was angry. She did not like Jake. He was mean and bossy. She wanted to make him sad. She had an idea. She acted like she was very sick. She coughed louder and louder. She closed her eyes and moaned.
"Mommy, Mommy, Lily is very sick!" Jake shouted. He was scared. He ran to get Mommy.
Mommy came and saw Lily. She was worried. She felt her head and took her temperature. She saw the pill on the floor.
"Lily, why did you spit out the pill?" Mommy asked. "You need to take it to get better."
Lily opened her eyes and smiled. She was not sick. She was acting. She wanted to trick Jake. She wanted to play with his toys.
"I'm sorry, Mommy. I don't like the pill. Can I play now?" Lily asked.
Mommy was not happy. She was angry. She knew Lily was acting. She did not like her lie.
"No, Lily, you cannot play. You have to take the pill and stay in bed. And you have to say sorry to Jake. He was worried about you. You were not nice to him. You were jealous and mean," Mommy said.
Lily felt bad. She knew Mommy was right. She did not want to make Jake sad. She wanted to be nice to him. She said sorry to Jake and took the pill. She hugged Mommy and Jake. She hoped she would get better soon. She learned not to act and lie. She learned to be happy for Jake and share his toys.
