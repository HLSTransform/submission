Once upon a time, there was a big lion named Leo. He lived in the jungle with his friends. One day, Leo went hunting for food. He saw a big tray of fruits but he didn't want to share it with his friends. 
As he was about to eat, his friend, a little bird named Tweety, flew by and said, "Leo, sharing is caring. Don't be selfish." Leo felt bad and realized that Tweety was right. He decided to share the fruits with his friends.
From that day on, Leo became a loyal friend and always shared his food with his friends. They all lived happily ever after in the jungle. The moral of the story is that it's important to share and be loyal to your friends.
