Jacky was a lazy little rabbit. He liked to stay in bed and nap all day long. He had no ambition and was never interested in the things around him. One day, Jacky was out walking in the woods and he spotted a blueberry bush. Jacky was intrigued, he had never seen a blueberry before! Jacky ran up to the bush and started to pick the blueberries. 
Suddenly, a wise old fox appeared from the shadows. "Little rabbit," the fox said, "you should never be so lazy with your life, you should always reach for greater heights and never be content with mediocrity. Now, off you go and pick some more of those delicious blueberries!"
Jacky understood the lesson and he went back to picking blueberries with newfound ambition. He gathered enough for a nice blueberry pie, and Jacky and the fox had a wonderful meal that only a lazy little rabbit and wise old fox can appreciate. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to never be too lazy and complacent with your life. Whenever you have the opportunity to do something new, have an ambition to strive for greater heights and never be content with mediocrity. Learn from the example of Jacky the lazy little rabbit and reach for higher goals.
