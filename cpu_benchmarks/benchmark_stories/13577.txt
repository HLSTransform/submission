Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very hungry and wanted to eat her meal. But she saw her friend, a little bird, who was also hungry and had no food to eat. Lily felt sad for the bird and wanted to help.
She thought of an idea and decided to throw some of her meal to the bird. The bird was very happy and ate the meal. Lily felt happy too because she helped her friend.
The moral of the story is that when we see someone who is hungry, we should try to help them. Even if we have just a little bit of food, we can share it with others and make them happy.
