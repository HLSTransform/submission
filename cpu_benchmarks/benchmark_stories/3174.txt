Once upon a time, there was a big, powerful truck. The truck loved to drive around the town and show off its strength. One day, the truck was driving down the road when it saw a little girl trying to cross the street. The truck stopped to let her pass, but a small car behind the truck honked its horn and yelled, "Hurry up!"
The little girl was scared and didn't know what to do. The truck saw the car and decided to help the girl. "Don't worry, little one," the truck said. "I will block the car and keep you safe." The truck then drove in front of the car and stopped it from passing.
The little girl was so happy and started to applaud the truck. "Thank you, truck! You are my hero!" she said. The truck smiled and replied, "No problem, little one. I will always protect you." From that day on, the little girl and the truck became good friends and the truck always made sure to keep her safe on the road.
