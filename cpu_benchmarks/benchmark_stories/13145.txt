One day, Jack and Jill went to work. Jack was tired and Jill was excited because she had an invitation. They both worked hard all day and made lots of things. At the end of the day they went home. Jack was still tired, but Jill was happy. She showed her parents the invitation. It was an invitation to her friend's birthday party. They were all happy and excited. They started to plan how they were going to get to the party and what they were going to bring. Jack was happy too and he was no longer so tired.
