Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she saw a red flower and wanted to pick it. She reached out her hand to take it, but a bee was buzzing around it. Lily was scared of bees because she didn't want to get stung. She waited patiently until the bee flew away. Then, she took the red flower and smelled it. It smelled so sweet! Lily was very happy and ran back inside to show her mommy.
