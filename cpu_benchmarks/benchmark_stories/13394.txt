Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to class every day to play with her friends and learn new things. One day, Lily's teacher brought a fragile vase to show the class. It was very pretty, but they had to be careful not to break it.
Suddenly, it started to rain outside and the wind blew hard. The raindrops were tapping on the window, and Lily and her friends watched as the rain poured down. They were happy to be inside, safe and dry.
After class, Lily's mom picked her up and they walked home in the rain. Lily splashed in the puddles and laughed as the raindrops fell on her face. When they got home, they cuddled up with a warm blanket and watched the rain fall outside. It was a cozy and peaceful day.
