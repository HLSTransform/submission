Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and her favorite toy was a bright yellow teddy bear. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help spread some butter on her toast for breakfast. Lily was happy to help and spread the butter carefully with a knife. 
Later that day, Lily and her mom played a game of matching cards. They had to find two cards that looked the same. Lily was very good at the game and matched all the cards quickly. She was so proud of herself!
As the day went on, the sun began to set and the sky turned a bright orange color. Lily and her mom went outside to watch the sunset. They sat on the grass and looked up at the sky. Lily thought the colors were so pretty and bright. It was a wonderful day for Lily and she went to bed with a big smile on her face. The end.
