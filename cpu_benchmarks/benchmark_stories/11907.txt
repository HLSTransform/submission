Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved flowers and always wanted to see them bloom. One day, she saw a beautiful flower on the side of the road. She picked it up and smelled it. It smelled bitter.
Lily said, "This flower smells funny. Why is it bitter?"
A voice answered, "That flower is poisonous. You should never smell or touch it."
Lily was scared and threw the flower away. She continued down the road, looking for more flowers to see bloom. But as she walked, she suddenly fell into a big hole in the ground. She cried for help, but no one came. She was stuck there forever.
The end.
