Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to swing on the playground. She would go back and forth, higher and higher, giggling with joy. One day, she brought her favorite bag to the playground. It was a pink bag with a unicorn on it. She put her snack and water bottle in the bag and hung it on the swing next to her. Suddenly, a crazy wind blew and the bag flew away! Lily was sad and didn't know what to do. But then, her friend came and helped her find the bag. They were both happy and went back to swinging together.
