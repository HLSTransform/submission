Mama and Papa were having a discussion. Mama said, "I think these pants are too boring. Let's design a different pair!" Papa thought for a bit and then said, "That's an awesome idea!"
Mama grabbed some fabric and scissors and, with Papa's help, started to cut and sew pants. They measured and cut the fabric in different shapes, and soon the new pants were complete.
Mama tried on the new pants and said, "Wow! They look so different! I love them!" Papa agreed and said, "I'm so proud of us. We designed a beautiful pair of pants together!"
Mama smiled and hugged Papa. She said, "We make the best team!"  They both smiled and agreed.
