Once there was a little boy and he wanted to go for a walk. He had a wagon and he said, “Please wagon can you take me for a walk?” Then the wagon said, “Yes, I can take you for a walk.” And so the little boy and the wagon went for a walk.
They walked through the park and saw lots of birds, bunnies and even squirrels. They also saw a thin stream which was wiggling gently. The little boy saw it and said, “Please wagon can I cross the stream?” Then the wagon said, “Yes, but be careful because the stream is very thin.”
So the boy was very careful and stepped on a few stones to get across the stream. He made it safely and he and the wagon continued walking. They saw bigger and bigger animals while they walked, until they reached the end of their walk. 
Then the little boy said to the wagon, “Thank you for giving me a nice walk. Please wagon you can take me back home now.” The wagon said, “Yes, I will take you back home now.” And so the little boy and the wagon went back home.
