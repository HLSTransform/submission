Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loves to play. Her name was Gabby. Every day she would play with her toys and sing her songs.
One day, Gabby's mommy came to her with some scissors and some envelopes. She said, "Gabby, we are going to mail some letters today." Gabby was so excited! She was never allowed to do something herself that was so grown-up.
So they made the letters and put them in the envelope. Then Gabby got to take the scissors and cut the envelopes open. She was so proud of herself. Gabby's mommy gave her some stamps and told her to put them on each envelope.
After Gabby was done, she put the letters in the mailbox with a smile on her face. When she got back inside, her mommy said, "Gabby, look at what we mailed today. Remember that playful feeling when you put the letters in the mailbox?"
Gabby nodded as she curled up into her mommy's lap. Then she said, "Let's mail more letters tomorrow." And they did!
