Once there was a boy who was very anxious. Everywhere he looked, he could see a tiny, pesky mosquito flying around.
He decided he should try to tie it down. He found a long piece of string and carefully tried to tie it around the mosquito. But it was too fast! It flew away.
So he looked around and found a net. He tried to catch the mosquito with the net, but it was too quick and it flew away again.
The boy was very frustrated and anxious. He wondered how he could ever tie down the mosquito. Then, he had an idea. He rushed to the store to buy a fly swatter. With one quick swat, he was able to tie down the mosquito! He was so proud of himself!
