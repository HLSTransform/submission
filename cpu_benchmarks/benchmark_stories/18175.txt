Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue lived with her old grandma in a small house. One day, Sue found a big, colorful wrap in her grandma's room. It was very pretty.
Sue ran to her grandma and said, "Look what I found! Can I wear the wrap, please?" Her grandma smiled and said, "Of course, dear. That wrap used to be mine when I was young. I'm happy to see you like it."
Sue put on the wrap and felt very happy. She danced and twirled around. Grandma watched Sue and clapped her hands. "You look so pretty, Sue!" she said. Sue felt very special wearing the old wrap.
Sue wanted to do something nice for her grandma. She decided to complete a puzzle with her. They worked together and had a lot of fun. When the puzzle was done, they both felt proud.
From that day on, Sue and her grandma spent more time together. They played games, read books, and sometimes Sue wore the old wrap. They were very happy and loved each other very much.
