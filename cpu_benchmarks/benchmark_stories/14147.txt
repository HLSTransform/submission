It was a sunny morning and the little girl wanted to play. She was feeling very excited and wanted to do something fun. She packed her bookbag with all her favorite things. Inside her bookbag she had a modern toy and some snacks. 
The little girl went to the park and saw a colorful rainbow on the horizon. She happily ran towards it and began to unpack her things. As she was unpacking, it began to rain. She was getting wet and started to cry.
The little girl was so disappointed. All of her favorite things were now wet and ruined. But then out of the corner of her eye the little girl saw something: a rainbow in the sky among the rain clouds.
She focused on the rainbow, which seemed to be a reminder of the fun she had been planning. She remembered the modern toy she had packed in her bag to play with and suddenly felt hopeful.
When the rain stopped she carefully unpacked her bookbag to see what had been saved. To her surprise, the toy was as good as new! The little girl smiled and decided she would enjoy the day playing with her modern toy in the sunshine.
