Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her garden with her spade. One day, she found a green caterpillar. It was crawling on a leaf. Lily picked up the caterpillar with her spade and put it in a jar. She watched it for a long time. 
As it got dark, Lily saw that the caterpillar started to glow. It was so bright! Lily was amazed. She ran inside to show her mom. "Look, mom! Look at my caterpillar. It's glowing!" Her mom was so happy for her. They watched the caterpillar together until it went to sleep. 
From that day on, Lily loved to play in her garden even more. She hoped to find more glowing creatures. And maybe one day, she would find a glowing spade too!
