One day, a man named Dan was walking down the street. He heard a noise and stopped to listen. He heard music coming from a big building. He went closer to take a look.
When he got there, he saw that it was a music school. He went inside and saw a lot of staff walking around. He found out that they were organizing a music festival.
He watched them as they were working hard to get everything ready. Then, he heard the most beautiful music coming from the school. He listened to it for a long time and then went back home.
Every day after that, Dan would hurry past the school and hear the music. He loved listening to it and the staff always did a great job. They were very organized and everything worked perfectly.
