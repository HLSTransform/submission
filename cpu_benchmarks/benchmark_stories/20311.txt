Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big rock. Ben wants to climb on it. He says, "Look, Anna, a big rock! Let's climb on it!"
Anna is scared. She says, "No, Ben, it is too high. We might fall and hurt ourselves."
Ben does not listen. He runs to the rock and tries to climb on it. He finds a tie on the rock. He says, "Look, Anna, a tie! Someone left it here. Maybe it is a magic tie. I will put it on and be a superhero!"
Anna says, "No, Ben, it is not a magic tie. It is a dirty tie. It might have germs on it. Take it off and come down."
Ben does not listen. He puts the tie on his neck and pretends to fly. He says, "Whee, I am flying! I am a superhero!"
But the tie is too loose. It slips off his neck and gets caught on a branch. Ben loses his balance and falls off the rock. He lands on the ground and cries. He says, "Ow, ow, ow! I hurt my knee and my elbow. And I lost the tie. I am not a superhero. I am sad."
Anna runs to him and hugs him. She says, "I am sorry, Ben. You are not sad. You are brave. You tried to climb a big rock. But you should listen to me next time. I am your friend. I want you to be safe and happy."
Ben hugs her back. He says, "Thank you, Anna. You are my friend. You are kind and smart. I will listen to you next time. Can we play something else?"
Anna says, "Yes, Ben, we can play something else. How about we play with the swings and the slide? They are fun and safe."
Ben says, "Yes, Anna, let's play with the swings and the slide. They are fun and safe. And maybe we can find another magic tie."
They laugh and run to the swings and the slide. They forget about the rock and the tie. They are happy.
