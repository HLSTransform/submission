Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved candy more than anything in the world. She also loved to mail letters to her friends. One day, Sue found a big, icy rock. It was so cold that she had to wear gloves to touch it. She thought it was very special and wanted to show it to her best friend, Tim.
Sue had an idea. She would mail the icy rock to Tim with a letter. The letter said, "Dear Tim, I found this icy rock. I hope you like it. Love, Sue." She put the rock in a box with some candy and sent it to Tim's house.
A few days later, Tim got the box. He was so happy to see the candy and the icy rock. But the icy rock had melted, and now it was just a wet rock. Tim laughed and thought it was funny. He ate the candy and kept the wet rock as a reminder of the fun surprise from Sue.
