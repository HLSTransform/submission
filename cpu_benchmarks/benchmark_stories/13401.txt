Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to dig in the ground and find carrots to eat. One day, Fluffy found a big carrot with a long root. She pulled and pulled, but the carrot wouldn't part from the ground. 
Fluffy asked her friend, a little bird, for help. The bird flew down and pecked at the root until it finally came loose. Fluffy was so happy that she shared the carrot with the bird. 
A few days later, Fluffy saw a dead flower in the garden. She asked the bird why the flower was dead. The bird explained that the flower needed water and sunlight to live, but it didn't get enough of either. Fluffy felt sad for the flower and decided to water it every day. 
Thanks to Fluffy's kindness, the flower came back to life and bloomed again. Fluffy and the bird were very happy to see the pretty flower. From then on, Fluffy always made sure to take care of the plants in the garden.
