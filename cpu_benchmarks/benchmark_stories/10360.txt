Lily and Max were friends who liked to play together. One day, they saw a big brown pumpkin in the garden. They both wanted to take it home and make a pie.
"I saw it first!" Lily said. "It is mine!"
"No, I saw it first!" Max said. "It is mine!"
They started to pull the pumpkin from both sides, but it was too heavy and hard. They could not move it at all.
"Stop it!" a voice said. It was Mama, who came to see what was going on. "Why are you fighting over the pumpkin?"
Lily and Max told her their reasons, but Mama shook her head.
"That is not a good way to share," she said. "You should discuss and find a fair solution. Maybe you can take turns, or cut the pumpkin in half, or make a pie together."
Lily and Max looked at each other. They felt sorry for being mean and selfish. They decided to make a pie together and share it with Mama and Papa.
"Thank you, Mama," they said. "We learned our lesson. Discussing is better than fighting."
Mama smiled and hugged them. She was proud of them for being kind and cooperative. She helped them to wash and cut the pumpkin, and they had a fun time making the pie. They enjoyed the sweet and warm pie, and agreed that it tasted better when they shared it.
