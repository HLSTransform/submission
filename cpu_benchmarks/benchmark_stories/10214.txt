Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day. Lily had a big toy box in her room. She had a lot of fun, but sometimes, she forgot to clean her room. Her mom would ask her to put her toys away, but Lily didn't like to do it.
One day, Lily's mom told her about a magic touch that could help her clean her room. Lily was very excited about this magic touch. She wanted to learn how to use it. Her mom said, "You must be patient, Lily. It takes time to learn."
Lily was patient and listened carefully to her mom. She practiced using the magic touch every day. Soon, she could clean her room very fast. Her mom was so proud of her. Lily was happy too, because she had more time to play with her toys. And the best part was that her room was always clean and tidy.
