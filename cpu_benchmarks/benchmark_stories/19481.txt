Once there was a girl named Emily. She was only three years old. Emily was envious of all the other children, especially when she saw them playing with their daddy. She wanted her daddy to play with her too.
One day, Emily was feeling especially sad so she closed her eyes and started to cry. Just then her daddy came by and said, "What's wrong, Emily?". Emily told her daddy that she wanted to play with him too.
Her daddy was so kind. He said, "Of course! I will play with you today". So he scooped her up in his arms and together they went to play.
Emily was so happy. She smiled up at her daddy and hugged him tight. Together they played and laughed until she couldn't stay awake any longer.
As Emily drifted off to sleep she felt so lucky and happy to have her daddy to love her.
