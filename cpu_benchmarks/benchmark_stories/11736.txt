Once upon a time there was a disobedient little girl. She was always sneaking away from her family, looking for places to explore. One day, she decided to escape to the attic. 
From the outside, the attic didn't look very exciting. It was dull and grey. But when she opened the door she was surprised to discover a secret magical kingdom! There were bears wearing clothes and talking! The little girl was so excited she wanted to stay forever. 
But soon her family found her and she had to escape. She quickly ran out of the attic, back to her family. Although she was sad to go, she knew she would come back to the magical kingdom one day.
