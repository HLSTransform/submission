Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, she saw a little birdie stuck in a tree. She was eager to help the birdie and asked her friends to help her rescue it.
They tried to climb the tree but it was too high. Suddenly, a kind man came by and offered to help. He climbed the tree and rescued the birdie. Lily was so happy and thanked the man.
The next day, Lily had to go to the doctor for an exam. She was a little scared but her mom told her that it was important to check if she was healthy. After the exam, the doctor said that Lily was healthy and strong.
Lily was so relieved and happy. She told her mom that she wanted to be like the man who rescued the birdie and help others too. Her mom smiled and said that helping others is a great thing to do.
