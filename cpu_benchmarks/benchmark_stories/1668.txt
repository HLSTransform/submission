Once upon a time, there was a big player named Max. He was enormous and loved to play with his friends. One day, he got a letter in the mail. It was a surprise from his grandma! Max was so happy and ran to show his friends. They all looked at the letter and smiled. 
Max's friends asked him what was inside the letter. Max didn't know, so he opened it up. Inside was a picture of his grandma and a toy for him to play with. Max was so excited and thanked his grandma by writing her a letter back. He put it in the mail and waited for her to get it. 
A few days later, Max's grandma wrote back to him. She said she was happy he liked the toy and that she loved him very much. Max was so happy to get another letter in the mail from his grandma. He showed his friends and they all smiled again. They loved getting letters too!
