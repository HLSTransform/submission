Once there was a family and they had a daughter who was three years old. She was a very curious girl and liked to explore. One day, the three-year-old was exploring in her garden and she found something very special. It was a spell! She admired the spell as she had never seen one before.
The three-year-old was so excited by the spell that she decided to bring it inside. When her parents saw the spell, they were amazed! They decided to use the spell to make some delicious food for their daughter.
They cooked up the spell with some MagiGoo, a special kind of magic food. But when the three-year-old tasted the food it was very disgusting! She spat it out quickly and did not want to try it again.
Despite this experience, the three-year-old still admires the spell. She is always telling her parents and friends about it, and how much she enjoyed exploring and admiring it in the garden!
