Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was so excited for her first adventure. She grabbed her coat and headed outside.
As she stepped out the door she saw a tall, curious object. It was a tight skull made of metal. She touched the skull carefully and felt something inside. She knew that something really special was inside and she wanted to get it.
She looked around and noticed a keyhole on the skull. She quickly reached into her pocket and found a tiny key. With a grin she carefully placed the key inside the keyhole and unlocked the skull!
The girl gasped with excitement as the skull opened. Inside it was a shiny treasure chest. She carefully opened the chest and looked inside. Inside was the most beautiful necklace she had ever seen. She held it up to the sunlight and gasped in amazement.
“Wow!” she said to herself. “This is so beautiful!”
