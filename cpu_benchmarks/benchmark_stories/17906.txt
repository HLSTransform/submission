Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack who liked to spin around really fast. One day he was spinning and spinning in the backyard when he saw a flash of lightning above him. He stopped spinning and looked up. It seemed the lightning had made a rainbow in the sky!
Jack ran and got some friends to come see the rainbow. They all spun around together, trying to reach the end of the rainbow. They thought maybe there was a pot of gold at the end!
But no matter how fast they spun, the rainbow stayed out of reach. When Jack looked closer, he realized that the rainbow was made of sparkly lights. The lights were already in the sky and weren't available. They couldn't get to the end of the rainbow!
Jack and his friends laughed and spun around some more. They didn't find a pot of gold, but it was still a fun adventure with the beautiful rainbow made of lightning.
