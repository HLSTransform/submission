Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and make new friends. One day, Lily went to the park and saw a boy playing with a ball.
"Hi, I'm Lily," she said.
"Hi, I'm Jack," he replied.
Lily saw that Jack had a pattern on his shirt. It was a cool pattern with lots of colors.
"I like your shirt, Jack. It has a pretty pattern," she said.
"Thanks, Lily. My mom picked it out for me," he said.
Lily wanted to play with Jack's ball, so she asked him if she could poke it.
"Sure, you can poke it," he said.
Lily poked the ball and it bounced away. Jack laughed and they spent the rest of the day playing together. Lily learned that Jack was a wise friend and she was happy to have met him.
