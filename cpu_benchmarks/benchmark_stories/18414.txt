Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo was very small and he lived in a big ocean. One day, Nemo saw a big fish that was very ugly. The big fish was trying to eat Nemo, but Nemo was too quick and he swam away.
Nemo was very scared and he thought about what he could do to stay safe. He remembered that his mommy had told him about oxygen. Oxygen is what fish breathe to stay alive. Nemo realized that he needed to find a place with lots of oxygen so he could breathe and stay safe.
Nemo swam and swam until he found a place with lots of oxygen. It was a perfect fit for him! Nemo was so happy that he found a safe place to live. He learned that it's important to find a place that fits you and keeps you safe.
