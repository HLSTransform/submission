There was a family with two kids, a brother and a sister. The brother wanted to play basketball outside, but the sister didn't want to.
The brother said, "Let's play basketball!"
But the sister said, "No, I don't want to."
The brother was loud and said, "Come on! It'll be fun!"
But the sister disagreed. She said, "No, I don't want to play basketball. It's too loud outside."
The brother said, "Please? It will be fun!"
But the sister didn't want to, so she said, "No, I don't want to. I don't like basketball."
The brother was disappointed, so he said, "Okay, if you don't want to play basketball, we can do something else."
The sister smiled and said, "Okay, let's go find something else to do."
The brother and the sister decided to play a different game, and they had a lot of fun together.
