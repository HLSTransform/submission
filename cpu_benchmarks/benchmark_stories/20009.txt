Tom and Jen were twins who liked to play outside. They had a big ball that they kicked and threw to each other. One day, they saw a big billboard near their house. It had a picture of a clown and some words they could not read.
"Let's go see the clown!" Tom said. He ran to the billboard and Jen followed him. They crossed the street without looking. A car was coming very fast. It honked and screeched, but it was too late. The car hit Tom and Jen and they flew in the air. They landed on the ground and did not move.
The driver of the car got out and cried. He called for help on his phone. He was very sorry and scared. He did not see the twins until it was too late. He wished he could vanish and make it all go away.
The clown on the billboard smiled and winked. He was proud of his trick. He liked to make children come to him and then hurt them. He was a bad clown who hated children. He laughed and laughed as he watched the twins die. He waited for more children to come. He was not done yet.
