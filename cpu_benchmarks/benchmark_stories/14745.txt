Lily and Ben were playing with their toy dinosaurs in the garden. They liked to make them roar and stomp and fight. Lily had a big green dinosaur with sharp teeth and a long tail. Ben had a small yellow dinosaur with a horn and a hard scale on its back.
"Rawr! My dinosaur is stronger than yours!" Lily said, making her dinosaur bite Ben's dinosaur.
"No, mine is faster and smarter!" Ben said, making his dinosaur dodge and ram Lily's dinosaur.
They played like this for a while, until they heard a loud noise from the shed. It sounded like something was moving and scratching inside.
"What's that?" Lily asked, feeling scared.
"Let's go and see!" Ben said, feeling curious.
They left their toy dinosaurs on the grass and walked slowly towards the shed. They opened the door and peeked inside. They saw a big box with holes in it. The noise was coming from the box.
"Maybe it's a present!" Ben said, reaching for the box.
"Wait, don't touch it!" Lily said, pulling him back.
But it was too late. The box shook and burst open. Out came a real dinosaur! It was bigger than Lily and Ben, and had red scales, a long neck, and a small head. It looked at them with big eyes and made a soft sound.
Lily and Ben trembled with fear. They thought the dinosaur was going to eat them. They ran back to the garden, screaming for help.
But the dinosaur did not follow them. It did not want to hurt them. It was lonely and hungry. It saw the toy dinosaurs on the grass and thought they were its friends. It picked them up gently and played with them. It also saw some apples and carrots in a basket and ate them. It was happy and full.
Lily and Ben's mom heard their screams and came out of the house. She saw the dinosaur in the garden and gasped. She recognized it from a book she had read. It was a brontosaurus, a plant-eating dinosaur that lived a long time ago. She wondered how it got here.
She called Lily and Ben and told them not to be afraid. She explained that the dinosaur was not dangerous and that it needed their help. She said that someone had sent it to them by mistake and that they had to find a way to send it back to where it belonged.
Lily and Ben felt sorry for the dinosaur. They decided to be brave and generous. They went back to the garden and gave the dinosaur some more food and water. They also gave it their toy dinosaurs as a gift. They petted it and talked to it. The dinosaur liked them and made happy sounds.
They called the number on the box and told them what happened. They said they wanted to keep the dinosaur, but they knew it was not fair. They asked them to come and get the dinosaur and take it to a safe place.
Soon, a big truck arrived. The people inside were very sorry and thanked Lily and Ben for taking care of the dinosaur. They said they had a special farm where they kept dinosaurs and other animals that came from the past. They said they would take good care of the dinosaur and let it live with other dinosaurs like it.
They put the dinosaur in a big cage and loaded it on the truck. The dinosaur looked sad and scared. Lily and Ben hugged it and said goodbye. They told it they would miss it and that they hoped it would be happy.
The dinosaur nodded and made a soft sound. It remembered Lily and Ben and their toy dinosaurs. It was grateful and sad. It hoped it would see them again.
The truck drove away. Lily and Ben waved and cried. They went back to the house and looked at the book about dinosaurs. They learned more about the brontosaurus and other dinosaurs. They wondered if they would ever meet another dinosaur.
They kept the toy dinosaurs as a memory of their adventure. They played with them every day and told them stories about their real dinosaur friend. They never forgot the day they met a dinosaur.
