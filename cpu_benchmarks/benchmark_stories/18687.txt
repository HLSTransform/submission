Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved flowers and always helped her mom in the garden. One day, Lily saw a seed in the ground and asked her mom what it was. "That's a seed, my dear," said her mom. "It will bloom into a beautiful flower soon."
Lily was very excited and asked her mom if she could watch the flower bloom. Her mom said yes and they waited patiently. After a few days, a tiny green stem popped out of the ground. "Look, Mommy! It's growing!" exclaimed Lily.
Days went by and the stem grew taller and taller until it finally bloomed into a pretty pink flower. "Wow, it's so beautiful!" said Lily. "It's like a circle of petals."
Lily's mom showed her how the stem was flexible and could bend in the wind. "It's like a rubber band, see?" said her mom as she bent the stem back and forth. Lily was amazed and said, "I want to be flexible like that flower!"
