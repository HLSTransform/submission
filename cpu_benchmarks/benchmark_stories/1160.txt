Once, there was a lonely bag. The bag was called Luggage. Luggage had no friends. It was sad. It wanted to play with others, but nobody wanted to play with Luggage.
One day, Luggage heard a sound. It was a small bird. The bird was also lonely. The bird said, "Hi, Luggage! Can we be friends?" Luggage was very happy. It said, "Yes, let's be friends!"
Now, Luggage and the bird were not lonely anymore. They played together every day. They were very happy. And Luggage heard the bird sing, and the bird heard Luggage laugh. They were the best of friends.
