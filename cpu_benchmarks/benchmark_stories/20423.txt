Once upon a time, there was a man who had a store. He would sell toys and candy to kids. One day, he saw a comet in the sky. It was big and bright, but it looked dirty. The man wanted to sell the comet to someone, so he put a sign outside his store that said "Comet for Sale". But no one came to buy it because they didn't want a dirty comet. The man decided to clean the comet, and when he did, it looked beautiful. He put up a new sign that said "Clean Comet for Sale", and soon lots of people came to buy it. The man was happy because he sold the comet and made lots of money.
