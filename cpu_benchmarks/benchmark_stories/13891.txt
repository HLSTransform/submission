Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a small stone that he liked to play with. He named the stone "Rocky." Tim and Rocky would play and have lots of fun all day.
One day, Tim and Rocky met a sad, miserable dog. The dog was lost and couldn't find his way home. Tim wanted to help the dog feel better. So, Tim told a funny joke to the dog. The dog started to laugh and wag his tail. The joke made the dog feel much better.
Tim, Rocky, and the happy dog walked together. They found the dog's home and the dog's family was very happy. Tim and Rocky said goodbye to their new friend. They went back to their own home, knowing they had helped someone feel better.
