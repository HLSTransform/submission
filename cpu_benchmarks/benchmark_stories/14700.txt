Once upon a time, there lived two old friends: a bear and a rabbit. They were very good friends, and they welcomed each other every day with a big hug.
One day, the bear was feeling a little bit sad. He thought about how he wished he had something special to give to his friend to show how much he cared.
He remembered something his grandmother had taught him! She said that a rare rub from a bear was the best thing to give a friend who was feeling a little bit down.
So the bear happily gave the rabbit a big rub, and the rabbit felt much better! He thanked the bear for the rare, special rub, and the two friends smiled and hugged, welcoming each other once again.
