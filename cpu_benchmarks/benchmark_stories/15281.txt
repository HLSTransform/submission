Once upon a time there was a special frame. It was made out of shiny metal and glittered in the sun. One day, when the sun was high in the sky, a careless little girl saw the frame. She wanted to take a closer look, so she walked up to it and when she did, the frame blinked.
The girl was so surprised, she jumped back and smiled. She thought the frame was magical and that it was telling her something. She reached out her hand and the frame blinked again. She laughed and touched it.
Then she kept walking and the frame followed her. Everywhere the little girl went, the frame blinked. She kept blinking back, until she reached her house. The girl kept the frame close to her and when she was feeling sad or happy, the frame blinked at her to show it was there.
The girl was never careless again and was thankful to have her very special frame.
