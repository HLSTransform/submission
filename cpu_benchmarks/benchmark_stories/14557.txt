Jill had a special bracelet. It was shiny and thick. She wanted to put it in a safe place, so she put it in her bed.
Jill's mom came into the room and asked, "What's that?" Jill said, "It's my bracelet. It's thick and sparkly." Mom said, "Let me help you make sure it doesn't get lost. Let's put it in this box." 
Jill said, "Ok." She carefully took the bracelet and put it in the box. She closed the lid and said, "Now it's safe."
Mom said, "That's right! This way, you can take your bracelet with you to show your friends whenever you want. It won't get lost." Jill smiled and said, "Yay!"
