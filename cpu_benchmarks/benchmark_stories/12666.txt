Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside in the park with his friends. One day, Timmy and his friends were playing hide and seek when a mist came over the park. It was very foggy and hard to see.
Timmy's friend, Sarah, got lost in the mist. Timmy and his other friends looked for her but they couldn't find her. They were very scared and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, they heard Sarah's voice calling for help. They followed her voice and found her stuck in some bushes.
Timmy's friends were very happy that they found Sarah. But Timmy felt sad because he didn't act fast enough to save her. He felt like an ordinary boy who couldn't do anything right. From that day on, Timmy promised himself that he would always act fast and be a hero.
