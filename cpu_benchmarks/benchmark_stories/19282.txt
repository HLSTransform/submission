Once upon a time, there was a friendly kitty named Bella. Bella lived in a big house with a kind family. Every morning, Bella liked to play in the kitchen while the family ate cereal.
One morning, Bella was playing in the kitchen and noticed something strange. She saw a big mouse next to the cereal. Bella was scared, so she quickly ran to the family and warned them about the mouse. 
The family was very surprised. The father grabbed a broom and chased the mouse away. 
Afterwards, the father made sure to warn the family to always check for any mice before eating cereal. Bella was very proud of herself for discovering the mouse first and warning her family. The family thanked Bella for protecting them.
