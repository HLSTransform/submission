Once upon a time, there was a long cat named Tom. Tom was very good at finding things. One day, Tom's friend, a little girl named Sue, asked for help. She lost her pot. The pot was very special to her. It was given to her by her mom.
"Tom, can you help me find my pot?" Sue asked. Tom nodded and started to look around. They looked in the house, under the bed, and even outside in the yard. But they could not find the pot anywhere.
Finally, Tom had an idea. He went to the kitchen and looked in the cupboard. There, he found the pot! Tom provided the pot to Sue. Sue was so happy and thanked Tom for his help. They played together all day long, and Sue never lost her pot again.
