Anna is a daughter. She has a mom and a dad. She likes to play with her toys and her books. But sometimes she feels angry or sad. She does not know why.
One day, she feels very angry. She throws her toys and her books on the floor. She yells and cries. Her mom and dad hear her. They come to her room.
"Anna, what is wrong?" her mom asks. "Why are you so angry?"
"I don't know!" Anna says. "I just feel angry!"
Her dad hugs her. He says, "It's okay to feel angry sometimes. But you can't hurt your toys or your books. They are your friends. And you can't yell or cry so loud. It hurts our ears."
"I'm sorry," Anna says. She feels sorry for her toys and her books. She feels sorry for her mom and dad.
Her mom says, "Why don't we pick up your toys and your books together? Then we can read a story or sing a song. That might make you feel better."
Anna nods. She helps her mom and dad pick up her toys and her books. She puts them back on her shelf and in her basket. She feels proud of herself.
Her dad says, "Now, let's choose a story or a song. What do you want?"
Anna thinks. She says, "I want the story about the bunny and the carrot."
Her mom smiles. She says, "That's a good choice. I like that story too."
Her dad says, "Me too. Let's sit on your bed and read it together."
Anna, her mom, and her dad sit on her bed. Her mom holds the book. Her dad holds Anna. They read the story about the bunny and the carrot. Anna listens and laughs. She feels happy.
She feels calm.
