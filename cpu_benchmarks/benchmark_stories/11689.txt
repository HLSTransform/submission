Once, there was a little girl. She was three years old and she was very excited. She was going to a castle. When she arrived, she saw that it was very big and noisy. 
The girl liked castles, but this one was extra special. Inside the castle, a special cooking was happening. There was a big kitchen and people were cooking all sorts of delicious food. 
The little girl was so excited to get to help with the cooking. She followed the cooks around and got to stir and mix things. She even got to taste some of the food too. 
When the food was finished, it smelled and looked so delicious. The girl had a great time helping cook in the noisy castle and she was very proud of her work.
