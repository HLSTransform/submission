Tom and Mia like to play by the river. They have a raft that they made from wood and rope. They put the raft in the water and get on it. They use sticks to move the raft along the river.
One day, they see a big rock in the water. They try to steer the raft away from the rock, but it is too late. The raft hits the rock and makes a hole. Water comes in the hole and the raft starts to sink.
"Help! Help!" Tom and Mia shout. They are scared. They hold on to the raft and hope someone will hear them.
Sam is a farmer who lives near the river. He hears Tom and Mia's shouts and runs to the river. He sees them on the sinking raft and throws them a rope. He pulls them to the shore and helps them get off the raft.
"Are you okay?" Sam asks them.
"Yes, thank you," Tom and Mia say. They are wet and cold, but happy to be safe.
"Your raft is broken," Sam says. "Do you want me to help you fix it?"
"Yes, please," Tom and Mia say. They like their raft and want to play with it again.
Sam takes them to his barn and gives them some tools and materials. He shows them how to patch the hole and tie the rope. He also gives them some cookies and milk.
"There, your raft is fixed," Sam says. "But be careful next time. The river can be high and fast. Don't go too far or too close to the rocks."
"Thank you, Sam," Tom and Mia say. They hug him and take their raft back to the river. They promise to be careful and have fun. They wave to Sam as they move the raft along the river. Sam waves back and smiles. He is glad he helped them.
