Once upon a time, a little squirrel had a big problem. She had a tail so long that it dragged on the ground behind her. Every time she tried to jump, it made it difficult for her.
One day she got a brilliant idea. She went to her friend, a friendly fox. She asked if the fox would help her by cutting off her tail. Her friend was worried about her, but disagreed with her plan.
The squirrel was determined, though, so she said goodbye to her friend and set off with a pair of scissors. She found a big rock and sat down to start cutting.
After a few cuts, she heard a noise behind her. It was her friend, the fox. This time, he had agreed to help her. The fox cut off the tail, and the squirrel felt much better. She jumped around with so much energy and excitement that the fox could not help but smile.
