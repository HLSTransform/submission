Sara and Tom were playing hide and seek in the park. Sara was the seeker and Tom was the hider. Sara counted to ten and then opened her eyes. She looked around and saw a big sack near a tree. She thought Tom might be hiding inside it.
She ran to the sack and lifted it up. But there was no Tom inside, only some leaves and sticks. She was puzzled. Where did Tom go? She called out, "Tom, where are you? I can't find you!"
Tom heard Sara's voice from a distant bush. He giggled and whispered, "She can't see me. I'm a good hider. I made the sack look like me and then I ran away. I'm going to vanish like a ghost."
He waited for Sara to come closer and then he jumped out of the bush and shouted, "Boo!" Sara was startled and screamed. Then she laughed and said, "You scared me, Tom! You're a tricky hider. How did you make the sack look like you?"
Tom showed Sara how he put his hat and jacket on the sack and stuffed it with leaves and sticks. He said, "It was easy. I just used what I found in the park. Do you want to try it too?"
Sara nodded and said, "Yes, let's do it again. But this time, I'll be the hider and you'll be the seeker. And I'll vanish better than you!"
They put the sack back on the ground and swapped their roles. They had fun playing hide and seek with the sack until it was time to go home.
