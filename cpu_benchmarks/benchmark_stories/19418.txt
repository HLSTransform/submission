Once upon a time, there was a little boy called James. He went to the market with his mum and dad. He saw lots of colourful things and smiled. 
Suddenly, he heard a loud noise. It was bad and disturbed him. His parents were worried and called the police. 
The policemen looked around and saw a big monster. It had been making all the noise! The monster frightened the market and everyone scattered.
The policemen worked together and chased the bad monster away. Everyone was happy again! James laughed and smiled. His mum and dad were happy too.
The market was peaceful once more and the little boy enjoyed his day.
