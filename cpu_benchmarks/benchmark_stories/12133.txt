Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who lived in a big country. One day, a storm came and blew away her house. Lily was so sad because she had nowhere to live.
She went to her neighbor's house and asked for help. "Please, can you help me? My house is gone," she said.
The neighbor was a strong man and he said, "Of course, I will help you. We can build a new house together."
Lily was so happy and they worked together to build a new house. It was a small house, but it was strong and cozy. Lily was grateful for her neighbor's help and they became good friends.
