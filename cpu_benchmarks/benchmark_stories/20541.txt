Once upon a time, a little girl called Lily wanted to go for a walk near the beach. When she arrived, she noticed the heavy tide coming in. She wasn't sure what to do - should she stay in one place and get wet, or should she try and run from the tide?
The little girl decided to choose and ran as fast as she could. She ran up the dry beach away from the heavy tide. She ran, and ran, and ran until she was safe. She found a good spot and watched the tide rolling in. 
Lily was happy she chose to get away from the heavy tide. She stayed and enjoyed the view near the beach until the tide finally went back out.
