Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. He was only three years old. 
One day, Tim asked his mom for some candy. His mom said "No! Candy will spoil your dinner!"
But Tim was being silly and he just wanted the candy. He begged and begged until his mom said "Yes!"
Tim was so happy and he ran to the kitchen to get the candy. But when he opened the box, it was all gone!
His mom had been too smart and she had already taken the candy away! Tim was very mad and he called his mom "stupid" for not letting him have the candy.
But his mom was smarter than Tim and she knew the candy would spoil his dinner. So she "spoiled" the candy so that Tim couldn't eat it.
And so Tim learned his lesson, and he never asked for candy again!
