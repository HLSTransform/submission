In the dark night, a 3 year old was walking in the snow. He looked around and saw an igloo in front of him. He wanted to explore it, so he slowly approached it. 
Suddenly, a loud voice said, "Don't go in there! It's not safe!" 
The little boy looked around and saw a giant polar bear. The polar bear said, "I'm here to protect the igloo."
The little boy was very scared, but he asked, "Why would you want to protect an igloo?"
The polar bear replied, "Because the igloo is my home. I want to make sure it's safe."
The little boy understood and thanked the polar bear for protecting the igloo. From then on, whenever he would walk by the igloo in the dark night, he would remember how the polar bear was protecting it.
