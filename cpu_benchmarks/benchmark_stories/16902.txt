Sara and Ben like to play outside. They run and jump and laugh. They have a ball and a kite and a bike. They have fun with their toys.
But sometimes they get tired. They need to rest. They look for a good place to rest. They see a big tree. The tree has green leaves and brown bark. Under the tree, there is soft grass. The grass is cool and nice.
Sara and Ben go to the tree. They lie down on the grass. They close their eyes. They feel the mild breeze. The breeze is gentle and sweet. It makes them happy. They hear the birds sing. The birds sing songs for them. They smile.
Sara and Ben rest under the tree. They rest on the grass. They rest in the mild breeze. They rest with the birds. They rest and dream. They rest and love. They are happy.
