Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lola. She loved playing outside in the snow. One day when Lola was playing in the snow, she found a funny looking ice block. Suddenly, the ice began to vanish! It was a strange, terrible sight.
Lola was so scared that she ran away. She ran and ran until she arrived home. She told her mom what happened, but her mom couldn't believe her. Lola was so sad and scared.
The next morning, Lola's mom took her outside to the spot where she saw the ice vanish. She showed Lola the ground where the ice used to be - it had turned into a big puddle! Lola was relieved that the ice had gone away and she was no longer scared.
