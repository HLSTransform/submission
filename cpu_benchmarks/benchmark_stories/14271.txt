Beth was a young girl who had long brown hair. Every morning she would brush it carefully and then rub lotion in. This made her hair more silky and gave it a beautiful sheen.
One day when she went to put lotion on her hair, her brother grabbed the bottle.
"Give that back!" Beth said.
Her brother ignored her and tried to run away with it, but Beth was determined not to let him take it. She resisted and managed to grab the lotion bottle away from her brother and run back to her room.
She put the lotion back and smiled at herself in the mirror. She did it! She had resisted her brother and taken back her lotion. She was proud of herself!
