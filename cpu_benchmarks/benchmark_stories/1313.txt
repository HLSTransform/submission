Once upon a time there was a very fit lemon. He was so fit that he could run and jump all day. So, every day he would go out and play in the sunshine.
The lemon had lots of fun running around and jumping. But, after all of that running and jumping he was very tired. So he climbed up a tree to take his nap.
He curled up under the leaves and closed his eyes. Soon, he was fast asleep and snoring. The birds and bugs in the trees were all very quiet so the lemon could sleep peacefully. 
Time flew by and before the lemon knew it, he was waking up from his nap. He felt so energised and ready for the day ahead. He jumped down from the tree and ran off into the sunshine to play again. 
The end.
