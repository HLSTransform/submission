John was listening to the birds sing. He watched as they flew in the sky, so delicate and carefree. He smiled.
Then, he heard something familiar. It was Mrs. Robinson, who lived down the street! She was singing a song. It had a happy and familiar tune.
John laughed and jumped for joy. He loved it when Mrs. Robinson sang. He shouted, "Lead me, Mrs. Robinson!"
Mrs. Robinson smiled and started to sing her song, louder and faster. John danced around in circles, all the while repeating her words.
The day passed quickly and when night fell, John was still singing the song. He repeated the words one last time before his mommy called him in for the night.
John was so delighted that he sang the song every day since. He thought of Mrs. Robinson and how she'd made his day so special.
