Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside in the sun, but today was different. The sky was dark and the wind was strong. Her mom said, "We should go inside, Lily. A storm is coming."
Lily replied, "But I want to play outside. It's so busy and fun!"
Her mom said, "We can return outside when the storm is over."
Lily didn't want to go inside, but she listened to her mom. They went inside and waited for the storm to pass. After a while, the storm stopped and the sun came out. Lily was happy and said, "Let's go outside now!"
But when they went outside, they saw that the storm had caused a lot of damage. Lily's favorite tree had fallen and her swing was broken. Lily was sad and said, "I wish we didn't have to go inside. Then my tree and swing would be okay."
Her mom replied, "Sometimes we have to listen to grown-ups, even if we don't want to. It keeps us safe."
