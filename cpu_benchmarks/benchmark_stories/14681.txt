Little John and his mom were walking in the forest. It was so quiet and peaceful. Little John saw a big log lying on the ground. He ran over to it and kneeled down. He was amazed by the beauty and texture of the log! His mom smiled and said, "Let's see if you can roll it".
Little John was so excited! He tried to push the log but it was too heavy. His mom said it was okay, that it was too hard to do it by himself. He couldn't give up so he asked his mom to help him. She said sure and they both put their hands on the log and started pushing. It was tough, but little by little they managed to move it.
Finally, they rolled the log to the other end of the forest. Little John was so proud of himself and excited because he had done it! His mom said, "That was fast work little one. You did a great job!". Little John was so happy and thanked his mom for her help. 
Little John knew that with the help from his mom, he could do anything!
