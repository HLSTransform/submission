Ben and Lily liked to play in the park. They had a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. One day, they saw something new in the pond. It was an alligator!
"Wow, look at that!" Ben said. "It has a long tail and big teeth. Do you think it is friendly?"
Lily was scared. She hid behind Ben and said, "No, it is not friendly. It is scary. Let's go away."
Ben wanted to see the alligator closer. He said, "Don't be scared, Lily. Maybe it is lonely. Maybe it wants to play with us. Come on, I will hold your hand."
He encouraged Lily to walk with him to the edge of the pond. The alligator saw them and made a loud noise. It opened its mouth and showed its teeth.
"Hello, alligator!" Ben said. "We are Ben and Lily. Do you want to be our friend?"
The alligator was surprised. It had never seen such small and brave humans. It closed its mouth and made a softer noise. It nodded its head.
"See, Lily? It is friendly. It likes us. Can we pet you, alligator?" Ben asked.
The alligator nodded again. It let Ben and Lily touch its skin. It felt rough and bumpy. Ben and Lily smiled. They had a new friend.
"Thank you, alligator. You are very nice. But we have to go now. Our mom is waiting for us. Bye, alligator!" Ben said.
"Bye, alligator!" Lily said. "You are very tidy. You keep the pond clean. We will come back and play with you again."
The alligator waved its tail. It was happy. It watched Ben and Lily run to their mom. It hoped they would come back soon. It liked to play with them.
