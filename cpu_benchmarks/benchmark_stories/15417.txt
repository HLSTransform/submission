Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved fashion. She loved to dress up in frilly skirts and colorful tops. Every day, she would rummage through her closet, looking for the perfect outfit.
One day she got dressed and decided to go outside. She ran around the sidewalk, twirling and spinning in her clothing. But she was having so much fun that she didn't pay attention to where she was running.
Suddenly, she tripped on the edge of the sidewalk. Her skirt flew up in the air and her shirt landed in the dirt. When she stood up, she was so sad. All of her clothing was dirty and she had lost her beautiful fashion.
The little girl started to cry. She had tried so hard to find the best outfit, but now it was all gone.
Fortunately, her mother saw what had happened and gave her a big hug. She told her daughter that no matter what happened, she was still loved. And even if she lost her fashion, she would always have her imagination.
