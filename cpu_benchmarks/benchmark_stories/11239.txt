Once upon a time, there was a bossy little girl named Sarah. Sarah loved to visit her Grandma and Grandpa's house. One day, when Sarah was visiting, Grandma made a special dinner. She had a bottle of special pink wine.
Sarah wanted to try a sip. Grandma said, "No, Sarah. The wine is not for children." Sarah got very upset. She stamped her foot and shouted, "I want to try it! It looks so nice!"
 
Grandpa said, "We can make a deal. If you can step up onto that chair over there, you can have one sip. But if you don't step up, then no wine for you."
Sarah thought for a moment and then stepped up onto the chair. Grandma filled a tiny glass and gave it to Sarah. Sarah took a sip and made a funny face. She said, "That's yucky! I don't like wine!"
Everyone laughed and Grandma said, "You have been so brave, Sarah. Now let's have dinner!" They all sat down to eat and Sarah was very happy.
