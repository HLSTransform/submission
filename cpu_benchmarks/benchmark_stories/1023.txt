Once upon a time there was a rude girl called Helen. One day, Helen was playing with her scissors. She wanted to cut a picture of her best friend, Jack. But as she cut, her scissors got stuck! 
Helen was frustrated and she shouted at Jack. She was very rude to him. Jack didn't like it and he ran away.
Helen chased after him, holding her scissors. But Jack was too fast and he managed to escape. So Helen stopped running and just stood still. 
She couldn't believe she had been so rude. Suddenly, she saw Jack a few metres away, looking at her sadly. Helen slowly smiled and waved at him. Jack smiled back and waved. 
The situation had ended. Jack and Helen both realised that being rude wasn't nice. They hugged and made up, then went off to play together.
