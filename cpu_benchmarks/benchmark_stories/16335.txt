Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy was very scared of the big, bad cat that lived in the house. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to deliver a piece of cheese to their neighbor, who lived an inch away. 
Timmy was very scared to go outside, but he knew he had to be brave to help his mom. So, he put on his little hat and set out on his journey. As he walked, he saw the big, bad cat lurking around the corner. 
Timmy was so scared that he froze in place. But then, he remembered the cheese he had to deliver. He took a deep breath and ran as fast as he could past the cat. He made it to his neighbor's house and delivered the cheese, feeling very proud of himself for being so brave.
