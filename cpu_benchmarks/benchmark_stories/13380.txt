Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color with her crayons. One day, Lily's mom came into her room and said, "It's time for your bath."
Lily didn't want to stop coloring, but she knew she had to take a bath. She put on her bathrobe and went to the bathroom. But when she got there, she saw that her bath toys were missing.
"Mom, where are my bath toys?" Lily asked.
"I'm sorry, sweetie. I think I accidentally left them in the car. We can get them tomorrow," her mom replied.
Lily was upset. She loved playing with her bath toys. But then she had an idea. She said, "Mom, can I draw some new bath toys?"
Her mom thought that was a creative idea. Lily got to work and drew some new bath toys. She was so proud of her work that she wanted to repeat the process every night. From then on, Lily had fun in the bath with her new creative toys.
