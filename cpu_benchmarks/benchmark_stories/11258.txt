The sun was shining bright and bright. It was a perfect day for park!
Mia, who was 3 years old, saw the park and it was very popular. She was so excited, she could not wait to go inside.
Mia's mommy helped her put on her sun hat and brush her hair with a comb. "Now, don't forget to have fun," said Mama.
Mia smiled, and then she ran to the park. She spotted her friends, who were already there. They were playing tag while laughing and giggling.
Mia ran and joined in their fun. It was the best day ever! They played until the sun set, and then it was time to leave.
Mia could not wait to come back to the park. She hugged her friends goodbye and skipped home with her comb in her hand.
