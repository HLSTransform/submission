Once there was a man who was worried. He had a very long rope. Every day, he would take the rope and keep it in his pocket.
He took the rope everywhere he went. Even when he went to the park, he kept the rope with him.
One day, the man was walking in the park with his rope. Suddenly, he tripped and dropped the rope. He was so worried about losing it that he couldn't move.
But luckily, a kind boy saw what happened. He picked up the rope and gave it back to the man. The man smiled and thanked him. He was so relieved that he had kept his rope.
