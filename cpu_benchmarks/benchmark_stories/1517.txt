Once upon a time there was a little girl named Harriet. Harriet was humbly dressed and adored jewelry. One day, while out on a walk, she spotted a tiny jewel sparkling at the bottom of a pond. 
Harriet took off her shoes, rolled up her pants and stepped in carefully. She felt around the pond and soon she could feel the smooth, cold surface of the jewelry. She took hold of it and thankfully managed to get it out of the water.
As she looked at it, the jewelry suddenly lit up and Harriet gasped. A magical figure stood before her. It was an old, wise woman who smiled kindly at Harriet. 
She then gave Harriet a special gift; a beautiful necklace with a bright red jewel in the middle. Harriet thanked her and promised to take care of it forever.
The two of them hugged tightly and smiled. It was a moment Harriet would never forget; the moment she met the old, wise woman and was given the most precious jewelry of all.
