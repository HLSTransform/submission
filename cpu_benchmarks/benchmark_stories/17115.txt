Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to walk in the park with her mommy and daddy. One day, they went to the park to have a picnic and eat some yummy food. They had sandwiches, fruit, and cookies.
While they were eating, a group of birds came and started to eat their food. Lily got scared and shouted, "Go away, birds!" But the birds didn't listen and kept eating. Daddy got angry and threw a rock at the birds to scare them away. But he accidentally hit one of the birds and it fell down.
Lily felt sad and told her daddy that it was not nice to hurt the birds. Daddy said sorry and they all went home. Lily learned that it's important to be kind to animals and not to hurt them. She also learned that throwing things is not a good way to solve problems. From then on, they always made sure to clear their food away from the birds.
