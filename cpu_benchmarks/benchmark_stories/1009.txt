John wanted something special. He asked his mom to help him find it. Mom said she knew someone with deep wisdom. She told John that he could learn something powerful if he went to visit this person.
John found the man, and the man smiled and introduced himself. The man said he could replace John's old toy with something special. He waved his hands and a beautiful shiny stone appeared!
John was so excited. He thanked the wise man and ran home. When he got there, he put the stone on the shelf and looked at it every day. Whenever John felt sad, he stared at the stone and felt better.
John now knew the power of deep wisdom and he was happy that he went to visit the wise man.
