Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park to play. She saw a butterfly and tried to catch it, but it flew away. She looked up and saw the sun high in the sky. It was noon.
Suddenly, she felt a pinch on her arm. She turned around and saw a big, scary dog. Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. She tried to run away, but the dog chased her. Just when she thought the dog would catch her, she saw her dad coming to rescue her. He scared the dog away and hugged Lily tightly.
From that day on, Lily made sure to always be careful around big dogs. She was grateful to have her dad to protect her when she was scared. And whenever she saw a butterfly, she would remember the time she got pinched by a dog at noon.
