Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was a quiet boy who liked to play with his toys. One day, Timmy went to the park to play. He saw a big dog and wanted to pet him. But the dog didn't like it and bit Timmy. Timmy cried and cried, but nobody heard him.
Finally, a nice lady saw Timmy and called for help. The ambulance came and took Timmy to the hospital. Timmy was very hurt and couldn't speak. The doctors tried to help him, but it was too late. Timmy didn't make it.
The people in the town were very sad. They remembered Timmy as a quiet boy who liked to play with his toys. They wished they could have helped him when he needed it the most.
