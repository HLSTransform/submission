Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play on the beach with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends were playing near the water when they noticed the tide was coming in. 
Lily's friend, Timmy, said "We need to go back, the tide is coming in!" But Lily didn't mind and kept playing. Soon, the tide came in and Lily got wet. She was sad and her friends tried to make her feel better. 
Lily's mom came over and said "Lily, you need to listen to your friends when they tell you something important. You got wet because you didn't mind the tide." Lily realized her mistake and apologized to her friends. They forgave her and they all had fun playing together again. 
The moral of the story is to always listen to your friends and not to mind the tide because it can be dangerous. And even if you get wet, it's not the end of the world.
