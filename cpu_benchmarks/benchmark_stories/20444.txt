Once upon a time, there was a family who went to a festival. They were so excited to be out together, and they had so much fun. 
They went in the car and when they arrived, they saw lots of happy people. Everyone was smiling and laughing. 
They found a place to seat and they sat down together. It was so peaceful and the atmosphere was harmless. 
The family ate some food and watched a show. The sun was out and they were having so much fun. 
At the end of the festival, they all exchanged hugs and said goodbye. They had such a great day at the festival!
