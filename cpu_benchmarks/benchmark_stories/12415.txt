Once there was a little girl who loved to poke things. One day she came across a beautiful television. She was so excited she ran over and started to poke it.
"No, no, no," said Mom. "We don't poke the television."
But the little girl didn't listen. She kept poking the television. Suddenly, the television started to make a loud noise and smoke came out of it.
"Oh no!" said Mom.
Mom quickly took the little girl away from the television.
It was too late. The beautiful television was completely ruined. The little girl had to learn that she really shouldn't poke things.
