Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very shy and didn't talk to many people. One day, her mom asked her what she wanted for dinner. Lily said, "I want pizza!" Her mom smiled and said, "Okay, we can have pizza for dinner tonight."
Later that evening, the pizza arrived and Lily was very happy. She loved pizza! But when the delivery person came to the door, Lily was too shy to say anything. Her mom had to accept the pizza for her.
After they ate their pizza, Lily felt brave. She asked her mom if they could invite some friends over to have pizza with them next time. Her mom said yes and Lily was so excited. She couldn't wait to share her favorite food with her friends.
