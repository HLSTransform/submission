Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toy cars. One day, Tim's dad gave him a shiny silver car to play with. Tim was very happy and said, "Thank you, Dad! Can we drive it outside?"
Dad smiled and said, "Sure, let's go for a drive!" Tim put on his seatbelt and sat in the driver's seat. Dad sat next to him and helped him steer the car. The car fit perfectly in Tim's small hands.
As they drove down the street, Tim saw his friend Billy playing outside. Tim rolled down the window and shouted, "Hey Billy, look at my new silver car!" Billy ran over and said, "Wow, that's so cool! Can I drive it too?"
Tim handed Billy the car and said, "Sure, you can drive it for a little bit." Billy drove the car around and then gave it back to Tim. They played with the car together until it was time to go back home. Tim was very happy that he got to share his new toy with his friend.
