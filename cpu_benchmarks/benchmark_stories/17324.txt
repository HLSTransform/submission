Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a red cord that she loved to play with. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to help with the laundry. It was an easy job, all she had to do was put the clothes in the washer. 
Lily was happy to help and ran to get the laundry basket. As she was putting the clothes in the washer, she accidentally dropped her red cord inside. She tried to grab it, but her little hands were too small. 
Lily asked her mommy for help and together they were able to get the red cord out of the washer. From that day on, Lily made sure to keep her cord in a safe place while helping with the laundry.
