Once there was a boy who wanted to bake a cake. He went to the store to buy the ingredients he needed. He was so excited about baking the cake!
When he arrived at the store, he saw lots of different recipes. He noticed one that was called 'Weird Ranch Cake'. He had no idea what ranch was so he asked the store clerk.
The store clerk explained that ranch was a type of sauce that could be used to bake the cake. The boy asked the store clerk if he could buy the ingredients to make the weird ranch cake. The store clerk said yes, and the boy paid for the ingredients.
The boy went back home and started to bake the weird ranch cake. He followed the recipe carefully and soon the cake was finished. When he opened the oven door, he could smell the sweet and tangy ranch flavor of the cake.
The boy couldn't wait to try a piece of the cake. He smiled as he bit into it, it was delicious! The boy had a lot of fun baking the weird ranch cake, and he was proud of the cake he made.
