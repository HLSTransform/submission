One day, a little girl named Lucy wanted to play with her mom's jewelry. She was anxious to try on the pretty necklaces and bracelets. She asked her mom, "Can I play with your jewelry, please?"
Her mom said, "Yes, but be careful. You can add one necklace and one bracelet to your dress-up box." Lucy was so happy and picked her favorite ones.
Lucy and her friend, Lily, played dress-up all day. They took turns adding the jewelry to their outfits. They felt like princesses in their pretty clothes and jewelry.
