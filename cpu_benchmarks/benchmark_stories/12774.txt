Once upon a time there was an elderly lady. She had soft white hair that was tied up in a bun. She seemed kind and gentle, like a fairy godmother.
The elderly lady was wearing a beautiful velvet dress. It was so soft and warm. She seemed even kinder and wiser when she wore it.
On a sunny day the elderly lady went for a walk in the park. She walked slowly and smiled at everyone she passed.
Suddenly, a little girl appeared in her path. She had big, bright eyes and a mischievous smile.
The little girl smiled at the elderly lady, who smiled back and said, “Hello there! What is your name?”
The little girl replied, “My name is Jane. What's yours?”
The lady laughed and said, “My name is Mrs Smith. It's nice to meet you, Jane.”
Jane smiled and said, “Hello, Mrs Smith. Your velvet dress is very nice.”
Mrs Smith nodded and said, “Thank you! You seem very wise for a young girl.”
The elderly lady and the little girl talked for a while. Then, Jane said goodbye and ran off. 
Mrs Smith stayed in the park until the sun started to set. She seemed to walk a bit lighter on her way back home.
