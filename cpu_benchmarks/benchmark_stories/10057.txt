Sara and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. Sara had a tea set and Tom had a truck. Sara wanted to have a tea party with Tom, but Tom did not want to.
"Tom, come and have tea with me," Sara said. "I have cups and plates and cookies."
"No, I want to play with my truck," Tom said. "It is fast and loud and fun."
Sara was stubborn. She did not like it when Tom said no. She picked up the teapot and walked over to Tom. She poured some water from the teapot onto Tom's truck.
"Hey, stop that!" Tom shouted. "You are making my truck wet and dirty!"
Sara laughed. She thought it was funny to pour water on Tom's truck. She poured some more water on Tom's head.
"Stop it, stop it, stop it!" Tom cried. He was wet and cold and angry.
Sara did not stop. She poured all the water from the teapot on Tom and his truck. She was having fun.
Tom had enough. He grabbed the teapot from Sara and threw it on the floor. It broke into pieces. The water spilled everywhere. The pieces were white and sharp.
Sara and Tom both gasped. They knew they were in trouble. They heard their mom coming.
"What is going on here?" their mom asked. She saw the water, the broken teapot, and the wet and dirty children. She was not happy.
Sara and Tom looked at each other. They did not know what to say. They wished they had played nicely.
