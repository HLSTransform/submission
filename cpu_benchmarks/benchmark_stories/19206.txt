Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat cauliflower because it was her favorite vegetable. One day, Lily's mom went to the market to buy some cauliflower for dinner. When she came back, she was very happy because she found a really big and impressive one. 
Lily's mom washed the cauliflower and started cooking it. While she was cooking, Lily saw a butterfly outside and ran to see it. She forgot about the cauliflower and went outside to play. 
When it was time for dinner, Lily's mom called her to come inside. But Lily didn't hear her because she was having too much fun playing with the butterfly. So, Lily's mom served the cauliflower without her. 
When Lily came back inside, she saw that there was no cauliflower left. She was sad and started crying. Her mom tried to explain what happened, but Lily didn't understand. She just wanted her cauliflower. The end.
