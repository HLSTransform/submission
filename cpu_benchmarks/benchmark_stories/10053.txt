Lily and Tom are friends. They like to travel on the big bus to school. The bus is yellow and loud. It has many seats and windows. Lily and Tom sit together and talk.
"Look, Tom, there is a cow!" Lily says. She points to a field. The cow is black and white. It eats grass.
"Moo!" Tom says. He makes a cow sound. He likes animals. He wants to be a vet.
"Me too!" Lily says. She also likes animals. She wants to be a zookeeper.
They see more animals on the way to school. They see a horse, a sheep, a dog, and a cat. They make sounds for each animal. They have fun.
At school, they learn new things. They learn about numbers, letters, colors, and shapes. They listen to the teacher. She is nice and clever. She tells them stories and sings songs.
Lily and Tom are clever too. They answer questions and do tasks. They draw pictures and write words. They share and help each other.
They enjoy school. They learn and play. They make more friends. They are happy.
