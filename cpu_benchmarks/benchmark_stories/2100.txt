Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she was running around and she stubbed her toe on a rock. It hurt a lot and she started to cry.
Her mom came over and asked, "What happened, Lily? Why are you crying?"
"I hurt my toe," Lily replied, still crying.
Her mom kneeled down beside her and looked at her toe. "It's just a little scrape, you'll be okay," she said.
Lily stopped crying and felt better. "I was being foolish and not looking where I was going," she said.
"That's okay, Lily," her mom said, "just be more careful next time." And with that, Lily went back to playing, being careful not to hurt her toe again.
