Paul was very excited. His mom said they were going to a restaurant for dinner. Paul said a quick prayer, thanking God for the excitement.
When they arrived at the restaurant, Paul's eyes lit up. He loved all the colors and lights on the walls. There were so many people and it seemed like everyone was having a good time.
Paul's mom said, "let's find a table and order some dinner." Paul was so excited and he couldn't wait to choose his meal.
After dinner, Paul said another prayer. This one said thank you for the delicious food and for the wonderful restaurant. His mom smiled and said she was glad he was happy. Paul agreed and said he felt so blessed.
