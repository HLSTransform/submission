Once upon a time, there was a little boy who couldn't understand things very easily. He was deaf and he couldn't hear anything that people said. One day at noon, the boy was walking in the park with his mom. He was trying to understand the noises he heard, but it was too hard. Then all of a sudden, he saw a bunch of birds in a tree nearby. He saw that the birds were dancing and singing and making noise. He was so amazed, he stopped to watch them.
The boy noticed that some of the birds were louder than the others. He watched as the birds flapped their wings and jumped around. He felt so happy that he could understand what the birds were saying! He laughed and smiled, and his mom smiled too. She was so happy to see her son so happy and understanding things. 
From then on, the boy loved visiting the park at noon to watch the birds. He liked to listen to the birds and understand what they were saying. He was so happy to understand something even though he was deaf. The boy and his mom would both go visit the birds every day at noon.
