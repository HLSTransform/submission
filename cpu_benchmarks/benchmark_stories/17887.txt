Jimmy and his mom were at the store. He wanted a new toy, but his mom said it was too expensive. Jimmy pointed at the toy, he really wanted it! His mom smiled, gave him some money, and said he could buy it.
Next, they went to the toy store. Everything inside was so modern! Jimmy saw a shiny truck and pointed at it. His mom said if he was careful he could get it. So he picked up the truck, put it in his pocket, and they left the store.
At home, Jimmy played with his modern truck all afternoon. He drove it around his room, made it go up and down the stairs, and even let his little friends play with it. He was so excited to have his new toy! All thanks to the money his mom gave him.
