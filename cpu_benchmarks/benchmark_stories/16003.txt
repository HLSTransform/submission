Once upon a time there was a playful bird. He lived in a big tree with a green plant. Every day he would fly around the tree and explore the world. One day, the bird saw a beautiful butterfly and he wanted to play with it. He flew up high and called out to the butterfly.
"Come fly with me," the bird said happily.
The butterfly was too scared to move and stayed still. The bird got closer and closer until he was very close. 
The butterfly started to flutter away. The bird's wings moved quickly and he started to chase after the butterfly. He chased it around the tree until it flew away. The bird was sad and flew back to the tree.
When he got there he saw that the green plant was gone. He knew that he had played a bit too much and he didn't have the plant anymore.
The bird was very sad. He stayed in the tree and never flew away again. He missed the green plant very much.
