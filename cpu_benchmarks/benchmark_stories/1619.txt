Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to run, jump and slide on the grass and the swings. They were happy and laughed a lot.
But then they saw something in the sky. It was big and bright and yellow. It was the sunshine. They stopped playing and stared at it.
"Wow, look at that!" Lily said. "It is so brilliant!"
Tom nodded. "Yes, it is. It makes everything warm and shiny."
They wanted to touch it, but they knew it was too far and too hot. They wondered what it was and why it was there.
"Maybe it is a big ball of fire," Lily said.
"Maybe it is a giant lemon," Tom said.
They giggled at their silly ideas. They liked to imagine things.
They stared at the sunshine for a long time. They felt happy and curious. They liked the sunshine. It was their friend.
