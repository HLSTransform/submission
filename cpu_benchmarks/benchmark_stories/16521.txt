Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a great day on Tuesday because she got a new teddy bear. The teddy bear was soft and cuddly, and Lily loved it very much. She hugged it tight and whispered, "You belong to me, teddy bear."
Lily played with her new teddy bear all day long. They had a tea party together and went on a pretend adventure. When it was time for bed, Lily made sure her teddy bear was tucked in next to her. "You're my best friend," she said to her teddy bear. "You belong with me always."
From that day on, Lily and her teddy bear were inseparable. They went on many more adventures together and had lots of fun. Lily knew that her teddy bear belonged with her, and she was very happy to have such a great friend.
