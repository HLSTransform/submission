Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jane. She was so happy because one day, her mommy invited her to go to the forest. Jane was so glad! 
When they arrived, the forest was so magical. Everything was green and beautiful, and the sunshine lit up the trees. Jane felt like she was in a fairytale.
In the middle of the forest, Jane saw a big tree with colorful birds flying around it. All of a sudden, the birds started flying around Jane and singing a beautiful song. Jane couldn't believe it was real!
After that, Jane saw an old man with a long white beard. He smiled at Jane, and said he was a magical man. He said he could make things happen in a blink of an eye. Jane was so glad and amazed. 
The magical old man asked Jane if she wanted to play a game. Jane happily nodded her head yes. He smiled and invited her to fly with him around the forest. So, Jane and the magical man flew above the trees and had so much fun. 
When they were done, the magical old man waved goodbye and vanished. Jane came back home with a big smile on her face. She knew it was a magical day and she would never forget it!
