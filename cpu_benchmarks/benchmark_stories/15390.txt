Once upon a time, there was a wide valley. In the valley there lived a little girl named Ellie. Ellie was learning lots of new things, but most of all, she was learning how to peek. Peeking was a fun task for Ellie, as she was very curious about the world around her.
One day, Ellie decided that she wanted to go explore the wide valley. She put on her sun hat and set off. As she wandered around the valley, she peeked around every corner. She saw all kinds of wonderful things, from the singing birds in the trees, to the grasshoppers hopping across the ground.
Finally Ellie came to a clearing. She was amazed by just how wide the clearing was, and she began to peek around to try and find out what could be in this special place. Before long, she found a secret garden full of all kinds of flowers. Ellie smiled and had lots of fun exploring this wide, secret garden.
Soon it was time for Ellie to go back home and so she left the garden until next time. She knew that by continuing to practice her peek task she would eventually be able to find even more secret places in the wide valley.
