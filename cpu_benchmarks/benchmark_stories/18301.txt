Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and sing. One day, she decided to perform a dance for her teddy bear. She put on her favorite dress, and started to twirl and jump around.
As she danced, she noticed a pin on the floor. She was careful not to step on it because it was delicate and could hurt her. She picked it up and put it on the table.
After she finished her dance, Lily felt very happy. She hugged her teddy bear and went to bed. From that day on, she always made sure to look for pins and other delicate things on the floor before she danced.
