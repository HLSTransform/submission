Once upon a time there was a gifted three-year-old boy called Jimmy. He loved playing and exploring with his friends in the nearby playground. 
One day they were at the playground and Jimmy noticed a giant peanut. He thought it was amazing. 
“What should we do with it?” asked Jimmy's friend. 
“Let’s open it and eat it,” Jimmy replied.
So they opened it up and found a delicious peanut inside. But Jimmy’s friends were so excited that they ended up gobbling it all up before he could take even a single bite. Poor Jimmy felt very sad.
One of Jimmy’s friends saw his disappointment and said, “Don’t worry Jimmy, looks like this peanut has vanished. But never be greedy when you share something. Next time let’s share the peanut with everyone so nobody misses out.” 
Jimmy nodded and smiled. He understood the moral of the story. From then on, Jimmy shared everything fairly with his friends.
