Once there was a little girl called Sarah. Sarah was three years old and she loved playing by the ocean. One day, Sarah looked out and saw something very strange in the ocean. She saw a long rope that was hanging in the water; it was so long that it almost touched the bottom of the sea.
Sarah was curious and so she asked her mummy if she could climb down the rope and see what was at the end. But her mummy said 'No! It is too dangerous.'
Sarah was disappointed but then she had an idea. Sarah asked her Daddy if he could take her out in the boat so she could find the end of the rope and see what was at the bottom.
But Sarah's Daddy also said 'No! The rope is very long, we wouldn't be able to reach the end of it before the sun went down.'
Sarah was sad. She wanted to find out what was at the bottom of the rope, but her mummy and daddy wouldn't let her. She knew that if she didn't hang the rope, she would never be able to find out.
The next day, Sarah's mummy and daddy were busy. So Sarah decided to take the boat out by herself. She was so excited, but also a bit scared.
With a little help from her big brother, Sarah managed to climb down the rope and find what was at the bottom â€“ it was a secret pot of treasure!
