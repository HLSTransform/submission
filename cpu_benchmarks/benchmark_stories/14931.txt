Once upon a time there was a little boy named Joe who loved to explore the world. One day, he had a very exciting adventure. He went with his parents to a restaurant to order lunch. When the waiter gave them the menu, Joe was very excited as he had never seen so many things to choose from.
But when Joe looked at all the choices, he became anxious and began to resist. He wanted a simple meal and he could not decide what to have. His parents tried to help him, but he kept shaking his head.
Finally, Joe's dad pointed to one of the items on the menu and said, "What about this one? It looks terrible! Are you sure?", but Joe nodded and said yes. His dad was relieved as he knew Joe was very picky. Joe chose a very simple and plain dish, a cheese sandwich. 
His parents smiled since they were happy Joe had resisted his urge to choose something that was too complicated. Happily, they all enjoyed their lunch together.
