Once upon a time there was a boy called Jack. He was only 3 years old but he wanted to find something exciting.
One day, Jack looked around the house. He wanted to find something fun. Suddenly, Jack saw something shiny. He looked closer and it was a trumpet!
Jack picked it up and he put it to his lips. He blew as hard as he could and then, a big, loud noise came from the trumpet.
He loved it! He took it with him everywhere he went. He also loved to try new things, so he decided to make his trumpet even more exciting.
He added many different spices, such as chilli and pepper, to make his trumpet spicy. When he blew the trumpet, it made a very spicy sound and it was so delicious, he couldn't stop smiling.
Jack was so excited that he had found such a fun thing, and he enjoyed playing with his spicy trumpet every day!
