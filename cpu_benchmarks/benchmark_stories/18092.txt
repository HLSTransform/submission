Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved her bottle very much. It was her favorite thing in the world. One day, Lily's little brother, Max, wanted to play with her bottle. But Lily didn't want to share it because it was heavy and she was afraid Max would drop it. 
Max started to cry and Lily felt bad. She knew she should accept that her brother wanted to play with her bottle too. So, she gave it to him and watched him play with it. 
Suddenly, Max accidentally dropped the bottle and it broke. Lily was sad but she knew it was her fault for not sharing. She hugged her brother and told him it was okay. From then on, Lily learned to share and accept that sometimes accidents happen.
