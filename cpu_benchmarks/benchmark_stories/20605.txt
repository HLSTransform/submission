Max the mouse was getting warm. He spread out his paws and heated up the ground. He could feel the heat going all around. 
Suddenly, he saw a group of birds. They looked very competitive and started to fly around in different directions.
Max felt a little nervous but decided to spread his wings too. He joined the group of birds and flew in the air. The heat strongly followed him, so Max felt very warm.
The birds spread out in the sky and made beautiful shapes. Max was full of energy and he kept flying higher and higher. He was going places!
The team of birds and Max had a great time. They spread heat and happiness until the sun started to set. Now it was time to go home.  Max thanked the birds for the fun competition and flew away into the night.
