Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and help their mom. One day, mom says she has a new thing for them. She takes them to the kitchen and shows them a big white box. She says it is a freezer. It can make things very cold.
Sara and Ben are curious. They want to see what is inside the freezer. Mom opens the door and lets them look. They see ice cream, popsicles, frozen peas, and meat. Mom says they can have a treat if they are good. Sara and Ben nod. They love ice cream and popsicles.
Mom gives them each a bowl of ice cream and a spoon. She says they have to eat it fast or it will melt. Sara and Ben sit on the floor and enjoy their treat. They lick their spoons and smile. They think the freezer is a great new thing. They thank mom and give her a hug. Mom says they are welcome and hugs them back. She says she is happy they like the freezer. She says they can have more treats another day. Sara and Ben nod. They can't wait.
