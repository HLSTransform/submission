Once upon a time, there was a nice girl named Becca. Becca was very helpful and loved to help people. 
One day, Becca was visiting a friend's house. Her friend asked her to get him something he had forgotten in his bedroom. Becca went there, but she couldn't find what her friend asked her for. 
She saw a white circle under the bed. She picked it up and it was a soft, round pillow! She took it to her friend and he was happy. He said it was very helpful and thanked her. 
Becca was happy to help her friend, but she forgot the pillow when she left. The pillow was a helpful circle that made her friend happy. 
The end.
