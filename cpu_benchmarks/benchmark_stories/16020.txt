Once upon a time, there was a mild infant playing near a big door. She was delighted to be able to explore the world. She asked her mom, "What's behind this door?" Her mom smiled and said, "It's a secret until you can unlock it." The infant looked around and tried to find something to open the door, but she wasn't able to.
The infant's mom could see the disappointment on her daughter's face and said with a gentle hug, "Don't worry, I know how to unlock this door!" She grabbed a big key, and with a big smile said, "Letting you use my big key to unlock it would be the best way to let you learn something new!"
The infant was elated and exclaimed, "Yes! Let me try it!" She cheerfully grabbed the key and tried to find the right hole, but it was difficult. After several attempts, she finally managed to unlock the big door.
The infant ran inside and discovered a mysterious new world. She was so excited that she had been able to unlock the door. She will never forget the feeling of accomplishment she felt.
