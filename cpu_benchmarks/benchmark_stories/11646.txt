Once upon a time, there was a mommy and her baby. The baby was very sleepy and wanted to take a nap. Just as the baby was about to drift off, the mommy saw something frightening! It was a big, black bug. 
The baby started to scream. Loudly. The mommy grabbed her baby and quickly looked for something to swat the bug away. She spotted a magazine and used it to swat the bug away.
The baby was so relieved that there was no more bug. The mommy cuddled the baby close and the baby soon fell asleep. The baby slept so peacefully because the bug was gone. 
The mommy smiled, happy that her baby was safe. The end!
