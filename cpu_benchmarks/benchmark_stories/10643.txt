Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. Jack was only three-years-old, but he already loved to talk. Everywhere he went, he would chat and chat and chat. 
When Jack asked his mom what an opera was, she smiled and said, "An opera is a special kind of show. Everyone sings and there's lots of beautiful music."Jack was so excited, he began telling all of his friends at daycare all about opera. 
One day, Jack's mom told him she had a surprise. When they arrived, Jack couldn't believe his eyes: they were at a fake opera! The singer's voices were loud, and the performers acted out each scene. Jack had so much fun, he couldn't stop talking about it! 
The next day, Jack went around telling everyone all about the fake opera show. Jack was also excited to see another real one someday soon!
