Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and twirl around in her room. She had a special spot in her room where she would dance every day. It was her favorite spot because it was right by the window and the sun would shine on her face. 
One day, Lily's mom took her to a store to buy a new dress. Lily saw a beautiful pink dress that she loved, but it was too expensive. Her mom found a dress that was just as pretty, but it was much cheaper. Lily was happy because she could still dance in her new dress, even if it wasn't the one she originally wanted. 
When they got home, Lily put on her new dress and went to her special spot to dance. She twirled and spun around, feeling happy and free. She knew that no matter what dress she wore or how much it cost, she could still dance and have fun.
