Tim and Jen were twins who liked to play in the snow. They had red mittens that their mom made for them. One day, they went outside to make a snowman. They rolled big balls of snow and stacked them up. They found a carrot, a hat and some buttons for the snowman's face.
But then, a big dog came running towards them. It was black and hairy and had sharp teeth. It barked loudly and jumped on the snowman. It knocked down the balls of snow and bit the carrot. Tim and Jen were frightened. They ran back to the house, but they dropped their mittens on the way.
The dog saw the mittens and thought they were toys. It grabbed them with its mouth and tore them apart. It made a big mess of wool and threads. Tim and Jen arrived at the house and told their mom what happened. They were sad and scared. Their mom hugged them and said she was sorry. She said she would make them new mittens, but it would take a long time. Tim and Jen cried and wished they had their red mittens back. They did not like the big dog. It was a bad day.
