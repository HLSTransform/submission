Judy was very sad and she began to cry. Her tears flowed down her cheeks and she felt so lonely. She wanted to be with her Mommy, who had gone to get a special license.
Judy looked around. Everywhere she looked was very filthy. There was dirt on the floor and the walls had cobwebs. This made Judy cry even more.
But then, Judy heard the sound of car wheels on the road outside. She ran to the window and saw Mommy driving up in her car.
Judy was so happy that she wiped away her tears, opened the door, and ran to Mommy. Mommy held her tightly and said everything was going to be okay.
Judy knew, deep down, that Mommy was right. She felt so much better, and was soon smiling again. She was happy to be with Mommy, and even happier that she was now the proud owner of her very own license!
