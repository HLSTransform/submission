Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play together. But sometimes they did not agree on what to play. Lily was bossy and wanted to be the leader. Ben was quiet and wanted to have fun.
One day, they found a big box in the garage. Lily said, "Let's make a castle with this box. I will be the queen and you will be the knight." Ben said, "No, let's make a spaceship with this box. I will be the pilot and you will be the co-pilot." They both pulled the box and tried to take it.
"Stop it, Ben! This is my box and I will decide what to do with it!" Lily shouted.
"Stop it, Lily! This is our box and we should share it!" Ben shouted back.
They were so loud that their mom heard them. She came to the garage and saw them fighting over the box. She was not happy. She said, "Lily and Ben, what are you doing? You are making a lot of noise and you are not being nice to each other. If you don't stop, I will take away the box and you will have nothing to play with. That is a threat."
Lily and Ben looked at their mom and felt scared. They did not want to lose the box. They said, "Sorry, mom. We are sorry for being loud and mean." Mom said, "It's okay, but you have to learn to cooperate and compromise. Why don't you take turns and play both games with the box? You can spend some time as a queen and a knight, and then some time as a pilot and a co-pilot. That way, you can both have fun and be fair."
Lily and Ben thought that was a good idea. They said, "Thank you, mom. We will do that." Mom smiled and said, "You're welcome. Now, go and play nicely." She left them with the box and they started to play. They took turns and played both games with the box. They had a lot of fun and they did not fight anymore. They were happy and so was mom.
