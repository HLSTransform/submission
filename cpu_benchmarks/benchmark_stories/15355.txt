Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a house with her mom. She loved her home and thought it was so cute. One day, it got very cold outside, and the girl began to shiver. She asked her mom if they could turn on the heater to make it nice and warm. 
Her mom smiled and said yes. The little girl was so happy that she jumped up and down with glee. Together, they turned on the heater, and the room filled with warmth and comfort. The little girl stopped shivering and started feeling cozy and safe. 
She thanked her mom for making her home so warm, and then curled up in her bed. As she closed her eyes, she thought to herself that her house was the coziest one ever!
