Sam and Ben are brothers. They like to play outside. But today it is raining. They are sad. They want to see the sun.
Mom says, "Do not be sad. Rain is good. It makes the plants grow. And sometimes, after the rain, you can see a rainbow. A rainbow is many colors in the sky. It is pretty."
Sam and Ben look out the window. They hope to see a rainbow. But they only see gray clouds. They sigh.
Mom says, "Why don't you play a game inside? You can pay me with hugs and kisses. I have a tough puzzle for you. It has many pieces. Can you put them together?"
Sam and Ben smile. They like puzzles. They run to the table. Mom gives them the puzzle. It is a picture of a rainbow. Sam and Ben start to pay mom with hugs and kisses. They say, "Thank you, mom. You are the best."
They work on the puzzle. It is tough. But they help each other. They find the pieces that match. They make the rainbow. They are happy.
They look out the window again. They see the sun. It is shining. And they see a rainbow. It is many colors in the sky. It is pretty. They clap their hands. They say, "Wow, mom. You were right. Rain is good. And rainbows are good. We love rainbows. And we love you."
