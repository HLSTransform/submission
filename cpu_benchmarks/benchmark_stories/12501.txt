Once upon a time, there was a smelly reindeer. His name was Rudolph. He lived in a cold place with snow and ice. Rudolph liked to eat grass and carrots. He wanted to grow big and strong like his friends. 
One day, Rudolph saw a big carrot. He wanted to eat it so he could grow. But the carrot was too big for him. So, Rudolph asked his friend, the rabbit, to help him. The rabbit helped Rudolph eat the carrot. 
After a few weeks, Rudolph grew bigger and stronger. He was happy because he could run faster and jump higher. His friends were happy for him too. They all played together in the snow. And Rudolph was no longer the smelly reindeer, he smelled like fresh flowers. The end.
