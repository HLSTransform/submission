Once upon a time, there was a little boy who wanted to go on an adventure. He walked for a long time until he came across a gloomy forest.
The boy was scared, but he kept walking until he noticed something strange. There was a triangle in the middle of the forest.
He asked the triangle,“What are you doing here?”
The triangle seemed to answer, “I am here to take you on an adventure!” The triangle started to glow.
The boy was amazed. He said, “Let’s go!”
The triangle took the boy on a wonderful adventure. He saw things he had never seen before. He met different people and tasted new foods.
He had the best day! When he came back, the triangle said goodbye and the gloomy forest seemed brighter.
