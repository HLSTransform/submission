Ben and Mia were playing with a big box of toys. They liked to build things with the screws and the blocks. Ben wanted to make a car, and Mia wanted to make a house.
"Pass me a screw, please," Ben said to Mia. He needed one more screw to finish his car.
"No, I need it for my house," Mia said. She was stubborn and did not want to share.
"But I asked first," Ben said. He was angry and tried to grab the screw from Mia's hand.
"Stop it, Ben!" Mia shouted. She pulled the screw away from Ben and hit him on the head.
"Ow!" Ben cried. He felt a bump on his head and tears in his eyes.
"Ben, Mia, what's going on?" Mom asked. She heard the noise and came to see what was wrong.
"Mia hit me with a screw!" Ben said, pointing at Mia.
"Mia, why did you do that?" Mom asked, looking at Mia.
"She wouldn't pass me a screw for my house," Mia said, looking down.
Mom sighed. She knew Ben and Mia were both stubborn and liked to have their own way. She decided to teach them a lesson.
"Ben, Mia, you need to learn to share and be kind to each other," Mom said. "If you want to play with the screws and the blocks, you have to take turns and help each other. Otherwise, I will take them away and you will have nothing to play with. Do you understand?"
"Yes, Mom," Ben and Mia said, nodding.
"Good. Now, say sorry to each other and give each other a hug," Mom said.
"Sorry, Ben," Mia said, giving Ben a screw.
"Sorry, Mia," Ben said, giving Mia a hug.
They smiled and said thank you. Then they started to play together again. They decided to make a car and a house with the screws and the blocks. They had more fun when they shared and were kind. Mom was happy to see them get along. She gave them a kiss and a cookie.
