Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her toys and her favorite toy was a teddy bear.
One day, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her room. Lily didn't want to because she loved playing with her toys and didn't want to put them away. But her mom told her that it was important to keep her space clean and organized.
Lily didn't understand why it was important, so her mom explained that when things were in their proper place, it was easier to find them and take care of them. She said, "We value our things and want to keep them safe and happy."
Lily was still a little frightened of cleaning up her room, but with her mom's help, she started to see the value in keeping things organized. And in the end, she was happy to have a clean and tidy space to play in.
