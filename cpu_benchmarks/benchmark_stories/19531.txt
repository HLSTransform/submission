Once upon a time there was a boy named Joe. He was three years old and wanted to explore the world. He was very brave and didn't let things scare him.
Joe had some equipment that he liked to use to explore. He had a cape, a helmet and a backpack. He thought these things made him look like a superhero.
One day Joe went exploring and found a big, ugly bug. It had a lot of legs and he was scared. But Joe was brave, so he decided to look at it and think. He thought that the bug was trying to tell him something.
Joe kept exploring and found some much bigger and uglier creatures. He was a little scared, but kept thinking. He thought to himself that maybe the creatures weren't that bad and that he should try to understand them. So he did! And Joe learned a lot that day.
