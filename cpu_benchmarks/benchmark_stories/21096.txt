Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He was a very honest boy. One day, Tim found a hanger on the floor. He picked it up and started to play with it. He made a funny guess about what it could be used for. "Maybe it's a hook for a pirate's hand!" he said to his friend, Sam.
Sam laughed and said, "No, silly! It's a hanger for clothes." Tim and Sam used the hanger to hang their coats in their room. They were happy to find a new use for the hanger.
Later, Tim's mom asked who found the hanger. Tim told her the truth. "I found it, Mom," he said. His mom smiled and said, "Thank you for being honest, Tim. It's important to always tell the truth." Tim felt proud that he was an honest boy.
The moral of the story is to always be honest and tell the truth.
