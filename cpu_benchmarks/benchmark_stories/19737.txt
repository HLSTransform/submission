Once there was a lazy bear who liked to sleep all day and play all night. He was always playing very noisily, so one day his mom said, "You can't play late anymore. Time for bed!"
The bear was sad and he made a big mark on the wall to show how angry he was. His mom got angry and said, "That's not nice!" So the bear tried to break the mark, but he couldn't. His mom said, "If you can't break it, then you have to stay in your room and be quiet." 
The bear was mad, but he didn't want to break anything else. So he stayed in his room and tried to be quiet. But it was hard and he was so lazy! He wanted to play all day. Then he had an idea. He got a cloth and tried to clean the mark off the wall. After a few scrubbing and some soap, the mark was gone!
His mom was so happy that the bear had done it without breaking anything. She said, "Good bear. You can go play now." 
The bear was so excited and he wasn't lazy anymore. He ran outside and played all day!
