Once upon a time, there was a brave knight named Max. Max had a shiny sword that he loved to show off to his friends. One day, Max heard a loud noise coming from the forest. He went to investigate and found a dragon who was stuck in a trap. The dragon was sad and scared.
Max wanted to help the dragon, but he knew he needed to be slow and careful so he wouldn't get hurt. He went back to his castle to get some tools to support the dragon and free him from the trap. Max worked hard to free the dragon and finally, the dragon was able to fly away.
Max felt proud of himself for helping the dragon and he knew that being slow and careful was important when helping others. He also realized that his sword wasn't always the answer to every problem. Sometimes, supporting others was the best way to solve a conflict.
