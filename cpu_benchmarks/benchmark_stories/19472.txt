Once upon a time, there was an animal named Fred. He was small and white. He was very flexible, he could use his long body to reach high places and squeeze into tight spaces.
One day, Fred wanted to fly like a bird. He looked up into the sky and hopped over to the highest mountain he could find. He felt so brave and strong like he could do anything. He looked up to the highest point and held on tight.
Fred hoped that he could jump and flutter up in the air, but no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't do it. He thought to himself, if only I was a bird then I could fly away.
But even though Fred wasn't a bird, the thought of flying filled his heart with hope. He knew that one day he could be flexible enough and strong enough to do it. Until then, he'll keep trying!
