Once upon a time, there was a little beetle. The little beetle lived in a big tree. The tree was his home. He had many friends in the tree.
One sunny day, the little beetle wanted to go for a walk. He walked on a leaf. But the leaf was wet. The little beetle did not see the water. He started to slip. He slipped and slid on the wet leaf.
The little beetle's friends saw him slip. They all came to help him. They held his legs and pulled him up. The little beetle was happy. His friends saved him. They all played together and had a fun day.
