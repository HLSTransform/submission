Mum and Dad stopped talking and looked down at Claire. Dad smiled and said "We were just talking about your upcoming birthday party. Would you like that?". 
Little Claireâ€™s eyes lit up and she began to clap with happiness. She said "Oh yes, a birthday party would be so fun!" 
Dad said "Well, we'll have to discuss everything we need for the party. Let's make a list!". 
Mum and Dad discussed what to serve for food, what decorations to buy and what games to play. Little Claire was thrilled that she was included in the discussion. 
They had a really fun time planning the party. Little Claire was so excited - she couldn't wait for her birthday!
