Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to run and play in the park. One day, Max saw a pretty butterfly and started to chase it. But as he was running, he got his collar stuck on a branch. Max tried to pull himself free, but he couldn't. 
Just then, a little girl saw Max and came to help him. She gently touched his collar and untangled it from the branch. Max was so happy and grateful. He realized how important it was to have friends who help you when you're in trouble. 
From that day on, Max always made sure to stay close to his friends and never wander too far away. He knew that having friends was the most important thing of all.
