Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play dress-up with her mom's jewelry. One day, Lily's mom gave her a shiny necklace to wear. Lily was so proud of it that she wore it everywhere she went.
One afternoon, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. She showed them her pretty necklace and they all admired it. Suddenly, Lily's friend Tommy said, "I have a joke to tell you!" Lily and her friends giggled as Tommy told his joke.
Later that day, Lily went home and took off her necklace. She put it on her dresser and went to bed. The next morning, Lily woke up to find that her necklace was gone! She searched everywhere but couldn't find it. Just when she was about to give up, Tommy came over to play. He had a mischievous look on his face and said, "I have a surprise for you!" He handed Lily her necklace and said, "It was just a joke, I took it to play a trick on you!" Lily was so happy to have her necklace back and she learned that sometimes jokes can be fun, but it's important to always give things back to their owners.
