Once upon a time, there was a fish named Nemo. Nemo was an independent fish who loved to swim around in his fish tank all day. One day, Nemo's tank got too hot and started to burn. Nemo didn't know what to do, so he just kept swimming. 
As the tank got hotter, Nemo started to feel sick. He tried to swim away, but he was too weak. Eventually, Nemo couldn't swim anymore and he died. The end. 
Remember, it's important to take care of your pets and make sure their homes are safe. Don't let them get too hot or they might get hurt.
