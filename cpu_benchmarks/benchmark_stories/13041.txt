Once upon a time there was a mighty coat. It lived in a far away land with a big friendly bear. One day, the bear found the coat and put it on. He wanted to keep the coat so he wore it all day.
But when night came, the bear had to go home. He couldn't take the coat with him, so he carefully hung it on a tree. The coat was sad because the bear had to leave, but the next morning the bear returned with a smile.
The bear took the coat off the tree and wrapped it around his shoulders. He was so happy to have his mighty coat back! Together, they walked through the woods, laughing and singing.
The coat and bear were best friends. Every day the bear would take the coat off the tree and together they would go on grand adventures. The coat always felt safe and mighty with the bear by its side.
