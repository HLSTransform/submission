Lily and Ben were excited to go to the park with Mom. They wanted to play on the swings, slide and sandbox. They also wanted to learn about the flowers and bugs that lived there.
"Look, Mom, sunshine!" Lily said, pointing at the bright yellow sky. "It is warm and happy."
"Yes, sunshine is very nice," Mom said. "It helps the plants grow and gives us vitamin D. Do you know what vitamin D is?"
Lily shook her head. Ben said, "It is something good for us. It makes our bones strong and our teeth white."
"Very good, Ben," Mom said. "You are learning a lot at preschool. Lily, you will learn more when you start preschool too. But you can also learn from books, games and nature."
They reached the park and ran to the playground. They had fun swinging, sliding and digging. They also saw some flowers and bugs. Mom taught them the names and colors of the flowers. She also showed them how to be gentle and respectful to the bugs.
"Mom, look, a ladybug!" Lily said, holding a red and black insect on her palm. "It is so pretty and small. Can I keep it?"
"No, sweetie, you have to let it go," Mom said. "The ladybug has a home and a family too. It needs to find food and water and sunshine. Just like us."
Lily nodded and gently blew the ladybug away. She watched it fly to a nearby flower. She smiled and said, "Bye bye, ladybug. Thank you for letting me see you. I learned something new today."
Mom hugged Lily and Ben and said, "I'm proud of you, my little learners. You are curious and kind. Now let's go have a picnic and enjoy the sunshine."
