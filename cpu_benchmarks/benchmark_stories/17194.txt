Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars and zoom them around the room. One day, Timmy's mom said, "It's time to bathe now, Timmy." Timmy didn't want to stop playing, but he knew he had to get clean.
After his bath, Timmy put on his pajamas and snuggled up in bed. Suddenly, he heard a noise outside his window. "What was that?" Timmy asked his mom. "It's just a harmless bird, Timmy," his mom replied. Timmy felt better knowing it was nothing scary.
As he drifted off to sleep, Timmy thought about his fun day of playing and how good it felt to be clean after his bath. He knew he would have more adventures tomorrow with his zooming cars and maybe even spot another harmless bird outside his window.
