Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Belle. Belle loved to play outside and care for her pet bird. One day, she was out in her garden, when she saw something strange - a broken wheel. She took the wheel and carried it inside.
When Belle's mom saw the wheel, she said, "What did you do, Belle?!" Belle said, "I was trying to care for it." Her mom smiled and said, "Come on, let's go see where it belongs." 
Belle and her mom walked around the neighborhood. They saw a little old dog who looked very hungry. Belle looked at the wheel and said, "Let's give this to the dog. He looks like he needs it." 
Belle's mom smiled and said, "That's a very caring thought, Belle. Let's go and see if the dog wants it." They walked to the dog's house and when the dog saw the wheel, he wagged his tail with joy. He was so happy he couldn't stop thanking them. 
Belle knew that if she cared, others would be happy. From then on, she made sure to care for everyone and everything.
