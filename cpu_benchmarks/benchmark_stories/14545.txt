Once upon a time, there was an empty planet. It had no trees and no animals. Everything was dry and dusty.
One day, a little bird called Tweety flew to the planet. He looked around and saw nothing green or wet.
Tweety was so sad that he wanted to make the planet green and give it life. He asked the clouds in the sky to help.
The clouds started to cry and the tears dropped on the planet. The Earth began to feel wet and green.
Soon, the planet was filled with trees and animals, and the river and lakes were full. Tweety was so happy, he could not stop singing.
The end.
