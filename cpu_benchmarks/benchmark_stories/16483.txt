Sam and Mia are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a big box in the park. The box has many things inside. Some things are shiny, some things are soft, some things make noise.
"What is this?" Sam asks, pointing to a round thing with buttons and a screen.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a test," Mia says. "Let's try it."
They push the buttons and the screen lights up. It shows letters and numbers and pictures. They hear a voice from the screen.
"Hello, children. This is a test. Can you answer some questions?"
Sam and Mia are curious. They nod and say yes.
"Good. Question one: what is the name of this animal?" The screen shows a picture of a cat.
"Cat!" Sam and Mia say together.
"Correct. Question two: what color is the sky?"
"Blue!" Sam and Mia say together.
"Correct. Question three: how many fingers do you have?"
Sam and Mia look at their hands. They count their fingers.
"Ten!" Sam and Mia say together.
"Correct. You are very smart. Here is a prize for you." The screen shows a picture of a star.
"Wow, a star!" Sam and Mia say together. They are happy.
But then, something goes wrong. The screen starts to flicker and make strange noises. The voice from the screen changes.
"Error, error, error. Test is broken. Test is broken. Test is broken."
Sam and Mia are scared. They drop the round thing and run away. They leave the box and the things behind. They don't want to play with the test anymore. They want to play with their toys.
