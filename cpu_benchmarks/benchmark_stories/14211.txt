Once there was a brown wagon. It was in the meadow filled with sun and birdsong. The wheels of the wagon were sparkling in the warm sun.
Suddenly, the wind blew, and the air around the wagon got cold. It started snowing, and everything around the wagon started to freeze!
The cold snowflakes made the wagon ice cold. The sound of the children's laughter was replaced by the sound of their shivering.
But then, a kind, magical creature came to help. He blew his warm breath on the wagon, and a wave of warmth and light spread across the meadow. All the snow melted away and the wagon was warm again!
The wagon, filled with the children's laughter and joy, was rolling across the meadow once more. What a wonderful day it was, thanks to the creature!
