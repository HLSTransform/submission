Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucy. She was 3 years old and very curious.
One day, Lucy asked, “Mummy, can I go outside?”
Mummy said, “No Lucy, I don't permit it - it's too dangerous.”
Lucy then asked, “Mummy, can I have a present?” 
Mummy said, “Of course, Lucy. We shall go shopping for one. What kind of present do you want?” 
Lucy thought hard and replied, “I'd like a really expensive present, please.” 
Mummy laughed and said, “What kind of expensive present would you like?” 
Lucy thought some more and then said, “I'd like a nice dolly.” 
Mummy smiled and said, “Okay, we'll see what we can find.” 
And so, Lucy and Mummy went shopping and found the perfect dolly. Lucy was very excited and thanked Mummy for the present. 
Mummy said, “You're very welcome, Lucy. Let's take the dolly home.” 
And so they did. Lucy was very happy with her new, expensive present and ran off to show her Daddy. 
The End.
