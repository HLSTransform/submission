One day, a near the sea, a boy found an oyster. He was so excited, he immediately took it home.
The boy's mom had a reliable plan to open the oyster. She put the oyster on a flat surface and used a special tool to spin it open.
The boy watched intently as the spinning made the oyster's shell break apart. When the oyster was finally opened, the little boy saw something shining inside!
He was so surprised and amazed - it was a beautiful pearl! The boy had never seen anything so sparkly and special before. He knew it was now his most prized possession. 
The boy thanked his mom for making his discovery possible. He cherished the pearl and was so happy with his new treasure.
