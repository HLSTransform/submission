Once upon a time, there was a little bird who found an egg. The bird was so happy and excited because it was the first time it found an egg. The bird was curious and wanted to question the egg, but the egg didn't answer. The bird thought the egg was reliable and decided to take care of it.
Days passed, and the bird took care of the egg every day. The bird was very happy and couldn't wait for the egg to hatch. But one day, the egg cracked, and the bird was shocked to see that there was nothing inside. The bird was sad and didn't understand why the egg didn't hatch. The bird questioned itself if it did something wrong.
The little bird realized that not everything is reliable, and sometimes things don't go as planned. The bird was heartbroken and flew away, leaving the empty eggshell behind.
