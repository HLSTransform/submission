Once upon a time, there were two best friends. One day, the friends were outside playing together. Suddenly, a magical powder appeared! The friends were so excited! The powder was magical and could shrink things.
The friends picked up the powder and sprinkled it on their toy house. Instantly, the house started to get smaller! Then came the fun part - they could both sit inside the house.
The powder helped their ordinary toy house become a special tiny house! They spent the whole day playing inside the house. When it was time to go, the friends put the powder in a special jar and kept it safe.
The powder was available whenever they wanted to play in their tiny house! They knew that the powder would always be there to make their house shrink. And so the friends lived happily ever after!
