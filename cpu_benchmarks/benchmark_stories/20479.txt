Once there was Jack who really really wanted a rose. He asked his Mom to get him one but she said no. Jack insisted and begged and pleaded with his Mom to get him one. Finally, his Mom gave in and got him a big rose. Jack was so happy that he hugged the rose, and took it inside the house and showed it to Daddy. His Daddy said it was beautiful, and Jack smiled. He then put the big rose in a special vase in the kitchen, and every day he would check and make sure the rose was still there. He was so proud of his rose.
