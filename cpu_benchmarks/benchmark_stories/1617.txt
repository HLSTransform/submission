Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys and books. One day, they find a big box in the yard. They open the box and see many things inside. They see a hat, a ball, a doll, a car, and a bear.
Sara likes the bear. It is soft and brown. She picks it up and hugs it. She says, "This is my bear. I love it." Ben likes the car. It is red and shiny. He picks it up and rolls it. He says, "This is my car. I can go fast."
They play with the bear and the car for a long time. They are happy. But then, Sara sees something on the bear's ear. It is a cut. The cut is small and red. Sara is sad. She says, "Oh no, my bear has a cut. It hurts."
Ben sees the cut too. He says, "Don't worry, Sara. I can help. I have a band-aid." He takes a band-aid from his pocket and puts it on the bear's ear. He says, "There, now your bear is better. The band-aid will make the cut go away."
Sara smiles. She says, "Thank you, Ben. You are a good friend. You are kind." She hugs Ben and the bear. Ben hugs Sara and the car. They are happy again. They play with the bear and the car until it is time to go home. They say, "Bye, box. Thank you for the unusual things. We had fun." They take the bear and the car with them. They are friends.
