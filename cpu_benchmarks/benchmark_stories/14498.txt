Once upon a time, there was a happy little boy named Tom. Tom loved to explore the world and he was so excited to try something new!
Tom's mummy took him to see something special. It was a clean, shiny, blue kayak! Tom gasped with delight. He had always wanted to try kayaking and now he was going to get the chance.
Mummy helped him climb into the kayak and pushed him out into the waves. Tom was so happy and excited. He paddled up and down the river, shouting with joy.
Mummy and Tom had so much fun together. When Tom climbed out of the kayak, he was tired but very happy. He couldn't wait to go kayaking again soon!
