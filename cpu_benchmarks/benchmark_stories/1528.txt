Once upon a time there was a bird. The bird was very happy and loved to fly high in the sky. Every day the bird would fly around looking for dinner.
One day the bird found something very bad. It was a dark cloud and it was chasing him. The bird flew and flew as fast as he could but the dark cloud kept getting closer.
The bird kept flying until he saw a very bright light. It was so bright that it made the dark cloud go away.
The bright light was coming from a little house in the forest. The bird flew down to say hello, and the people inside welcomed him in. They gave the bird some tasty dinner, and the bird was so happy that he sang a song of thanks.
The bird stayed at the little house for the rest of the day. He was so happy that he had found a safe place and a delicious dinner. He knew he wouldn't have to worry about the bad cloud ever again.
