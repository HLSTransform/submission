One day, a little girl named Jenny went outside to play in the garden. She was very excited! She saw some birds in the trees and decided to watch them. She gazed at the birds for a long time and wondered where they were going.
Jenny found an old journal lying in the grass. She picked it up and started to read it. She read about all sorts of intelligent things like music and science. Jenny enjoyed reading the stories and feeling smart. 
The next day Jenny decided to write her own journal. She wrote about the birds she saw and how intelligent they seemed. She wrote about how she wanted to understand the world like they did. 
Jenny continued to gaze at the birds and read her journal every day. She felt very happy and grew more and more intelligent each day.
