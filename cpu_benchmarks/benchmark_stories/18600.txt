Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved her mommy very much because she was always there to help her. One day, Lily and her mommy went to the store to buy some food. While they were there, Lily saw a toy she really wanted. She asked her mommy if she could have it, but her mommy said they didn't have enough money to buy it.
Lily was sad, but her mommy told her that there were other things that were more important than toys. She said, "It's important to value the things we have, like our home and our family. And I am always here for you, Lily. I am a dependable mother."
Lily smiled and hugged her mommy, knowing that she was right. She didn't need a toy to be happy because she had a loving and dependable mother who always took care of her.
