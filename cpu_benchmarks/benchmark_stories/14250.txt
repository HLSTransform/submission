Once upon a time, there was a boy named Joe. Joe liked to play with his friends, but his favorite toy was a flag. Every day, Joe would take his flag outside and fly it in the wind. He would tell stories with his friends about all the places his flag could fly to. Joe had a regular day playing with his flag.
One day, Joe saw something special in the sky. It was a magical rainbow flag. Joe was so excited that he shouted for his friends to come and look. They all told stories about the beautiful flag, each one more exciting than the next.
After that, Joe started to take his flag outside more often. He flew it in the wind and told stories about the magical flag and all the places it could go. Joe had regular friends come and play outside with him, too. They all had a great time.
Joe was so happy, and he learned something important. He realized that as long as he kept telling stories, his flag could take him anywhere.
