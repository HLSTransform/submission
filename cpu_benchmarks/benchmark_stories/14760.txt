Sara and Tom were playing with their blocks. They liked to build towers and houses and bridges. They pretended they were in a big world of their own.
But then, their baby brother Max came crawling into the room. He saw the blocks and wanted to play too. He grabbed some blocks and threw them around. He knocked down Sara and Tom's towers and houses and bridges. He laughed and clapped his hands.
Sara and Tom were very sad and angry. They shouted at Max. "No, Max, no! You broke our world! Go away, Max, go away!"
Max did not understand. He thought they were playing a game. He crawled towards them and tried to hug them. He said, "Max love Sara. Max love Tom."
Sara and Tom did not want to hug Max. They pushed him away. They said, "We don't love you, Max. You are bad. You are mean. You are enormous. You ruin everything."
Max felt hurt and confused. He started to cry. He said, "Max sorry. Max want play. Max want love."
Sara and Tom heard Max cry. They felt sorry for him. They realized he did not mean to break their world. He was just a baby. He did not know better.
They decided to forgive him. They said, "It's okay, Max. We love you too. You are not bad. You are not mean. You are just enormous. But you can help us restore our world. You can give us back our blocks. You can help us build again."
Max smiled and nodded. He said, "Max help. Max give blocks. Max build world."
Sara and Tom hugged Max. They said, "Thank you, Max. You are a good brother. You are a good helper. You are a good friend."
They took their blocks and started to build their world again. They let Max join them. They had fun together. They were happy.
