Once upon a time there was an ancient sailor named Carl. He was sailing in his boat when he spotted a dolphin swimming in the sea. He wanted to make friends with the dolphin, so he held out his hand. But to his surprise, the dolphin didn't want to be friends. She kept swimming away from him.
Carl said, "Please don't be scared. I just want to be your friend."
The dolphin said, "I'm not scared, I'm just not interested in being your friend. I'd rather be alone."
Carl said, "It's ok. I understand. But can I at least replace your loneliness with something else? Something that will bring you joy?"
The dolphin thought for a moment, and then said yes. So Carl gave the dolphin a hug and said, "You deserve to be happy. And no one should ever have to be alone."
This story teaches us that true friendship is based on kindness and understanding, and not on replacing someone's loneliness with something else.
