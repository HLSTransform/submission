Once upon a time there was a red ostrich. He liked to set off in the mornings, running around the big farm.
One day, the red ostrich decided to do something special. He set off on an adventure! He ran past the cows, pigs and horses. All the animals said hello to him as he passed by.
Finally, the red ostrich reached the top of the mountain. He was so excited! He stood tall and opened his wings and wings flapped in the wind.
Suddenly, a big group of ostriches came flying towards him. The red ostrich had made some new friends! The big group set off together flying high in the sky.
The red ostrich and his friends flew off into the sunset, saying goodbye until their next adventure.
