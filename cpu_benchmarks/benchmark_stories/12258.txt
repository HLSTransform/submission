Once upon a time, there was a kind little girl called Ella. Ella used to love playing in the garden. One day, while playing, she spotted something very special. 
Ella thought it must be an angel. She smiled and said "Hi, angel!" 
Suddenly, the angel spoke. She told Ella that she was there to help her do something special. Ella was very excited.
The angel said it was quite an easy task. The angel explained that Ella had to pick some flowers from the garden. Ella started picking the flowers and soon there were flowers all around.
When Ella was finished, the angel smiled and disappeared. Ella was sad to see the angel go, but she was very happy that she had been able to help. And, it had been really easy!
