Jill jumped in joy when she saw the huge celebration taking place in her city. The streets were filled with people. Music was playing and everyone was laughing and talking.
When Jill asked her mom what was happening, she replied, "This is a jazz celebration! Everyone is here to have fun and enjoy the music."
Jill was very excited, she wanted to join in the celebration. Although she was still very young, she wasn't afraid to try something new.
Suddenly, Jill heard the same music being played from far away. She asked her mom, "What is that music? Where is it coming from?" Her mom told her to follow it.
They followed the music and soon reached a big stage. On the stage was a huge jazz band full of singing and dancing. Everyone was having a wonderful time.
Jill was mesmerized by what she saw. She couldn't wait to join the celebration. Her wish came true when the bandleader called her onto the stage! She was so happy and started dancing to the tunes.
The huge crowd cheered her on. They clapped and sang along with her. Jill danced and sang until she was too tired to go on.
It was a night that Jill would never forget. From that night on, she would always be sure to celebrate jazz!
