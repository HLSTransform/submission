Once upon a time there was a girl. She wanted to find a special surprise. So she looked around the house and she found a big chest. Inside the chest was a secret. 
The girl was very excited, so she opened the chest to reveal what was inside. However, when she opened it, she felt very upset. All that was in the chest were some old clothes. 
The girl was so sad! But then, something caught her eye. Inside a pocket of the clothes, she could see something shiny. She reached in and pulled out a beautiful golden necklace.
The girl was so happy! She put the necklace around her neck and smiled. From then on, she wore the necklace every day and it made her feel very special.
