Once upon a time, there was a little turkey, named Tom. Tom liked to wander around his farm, exploring every inch of the dirt. One day while Tom was wandering, he saw something special. It was warm! About 10 feet ahead of Tom, he saw a large pond filled with warm water. Tom had never seen anything so nice before!
Tom walked up to the pond and dipped his feet in. The water felt so nice and warm that Tom just had to get in. Tom started to swim around and paddle the water. The water was so much fun!
After a while, Tom decided to see what else was around the pond. He kept wandering until he came across a small mushroom patch. Tom sat down and began to munch away on the mushrooms. Tom was having the time of his life!
Suddenly, Tom heard a noise behind him and quickly turned around. He saw a little fox walking by, and the fox asked Tom, "What are you doing out here all alone?" Tom replied, "I was just wandering around and having some fun!" The fox smiled and said, "That sounds like an adventure, I want to come too!" So Tom and the little fox wandered around together, exploring every inch of the farm, and having a great time.
