Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He had a board that he loved very much. One day, he took it to the park to play. But then something strange happened! Suddenly, the board began to change and it grew wings! The little boy was so excited! The board began to fly around in the sky with the little boy on it. Everywhere they went, people watched in amazement. People even stopped what they were doing just to watch! The little boy and the flying board had so much fun together. After a while, it was time for the little boy to go home. He was sad to go, but he was so happy for the amazing time he had with the magic, flying board.
