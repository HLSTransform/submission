Once upon a time there was a dad who had a very bright daughter. She was so kind and smart and always made him feel proud. Every day he would recommend new activities for her to try. One day, he suggested she paint a picture. His daughter was so excited, she couldn't wait to get started.
She picked out bright colors and squeezed them onto a canvas. As she painted, her dad watched, feeling so thankful that he had such a wonderful daughter. When Daddy asked her what she had made, the little girl happily showed him her masterpiece. He was so impressed, he said it was beautiful and he even recommended that she show it to her mommy.
When her mommy saw the painting she was amazed. She said it was the most lovely thing she'd ever seen and she wanted to hang it in the living room. The daughter was so proud! From that moment on, Daddy made more and more recommendations to help his daughter explore and grow. He was always there to help her achieve her dreams. What a bright and wonderful daughter he had!
