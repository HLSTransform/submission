Tommy and Mummy were taking a ride in the car. It made Tommy so happy, he cheered and cheered. He was so glad they were going out!
When they stopped, they went inside a building. Mommy told Tommy they needed to get his medicine. He didn't know what it was, but he was still glad.
Inside the building were lots of people. They were wearing masks, but Tommy was still happy he was there. He looked around and saw lots of things he wanted to play with!
Soon, the time to go home came. Mummy said goodbye to the people inside and put Tommy in the car. He felt glad to be going home.
As they drove away, Tommy remembered to take his medicine every day. That made him glad too, because it meant he would feel better soon.
