Once upon a time there was a big, fluffy dog. His name was Ace. His fur was thick and white. Every day Ace liked to go for a long walk.
One day, Ace was walking and he suddenly stopped moving. He felt sad and could not walk anymore.
Buddy, his owner, knew something must be wrong. So he decided to take Ace to the veterinarian. At the veterinary office, the vet looked closely at Ace. She asked Buddy:
"How long has the dog been walking like this?”
Buddy told the vet, “He was fine until today. He just suddenly stopped walking.”
The veterinarian looked closely at Ace and said, “I think Ace has a twisted paw. We will need to look at it closely and do some tests to determine the best way to help him.”
Buddy nodded and said, “I'm so glad you can help him. Thank you.”
The vet smiled and said, “That's what I'm here for!”
So with the help of the veterinarian, Ace was able to beat his twisted paw and went back to his happy walks with Buddy.
