Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a humble girl named Mia. Mia loved to play outside with her friends. One day, while playing, she found a pretty belt on the ground.
Mia showed the belt to her friends and said, "Look at this belt I found! Do you want to join me in finding who it belongs to?" Her friends nodded and joined her to look for the owner.
They walked around the village, asking everyone if they lost a belt. Finally, they met an old lady who said, "That's my belt! Thank you for finding it!" Mia and her friends were happy to help and went back to play together, feeling proud of their good deed.
