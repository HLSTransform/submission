Once upon a time, in a small town, there was an ancient rock. This rock was very big and old. Many kids loved to play around it.
One sunny day, a little girl named Sara and a little boy named Tom were playing near the rock. Sara said, "I want to bake a cake, but I have no oven." Tom thought for a moment and said, "Let's use the ancient rock to bake the cake!"
Sara and Tom went home to get the cake mix. They mixed it and came back to the rock. They put the cake on the rock and waited. After a while, the sun made the rock very warm, and the cake started to bake.
As the cake baked, more kids came to see what was happening. They all laughed and played around the ancient rock. When the cake was ready, Sara and Tom shared it with all their friends. Everyone was happy, and they all agreed that the ancient rock was the best oven ever.
