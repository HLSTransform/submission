Once upon a time, there was a big purple bus. The bus had many friends who loved to ride on it every day. The bus would take the friends to fun places like the park, the store, and the zoo.
One day, a little girl named Sue did not believe the purple bus could go to the moon. She told her friends, and they all laughed. The bus felt sad and wanted to show them that it could go to the moon.
So, the purple bus asked a magic bird to help. The bird gave the bus special wings to fly. The next day, Sue and her friends got on the bus, and it took them high up into the sky. They went all the way to the moon! Sue and her friends were so happy and now believed in the purple bus. They had the best day ever on the moon and went back home with big smiles on their faces.
