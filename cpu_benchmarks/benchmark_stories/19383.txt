Once upon a time, there lived a little boy called Jack. He loved to explore the world around him, but his parents were always telling him to be careful. However, one day, Jack decided to go on an adventure and he wandered deep into the woods by himself.
As he was walking, Jack heard a loud noise. He stopped and became scared, not knowing what it was. Suddenly, he saw something shiny and darker in the grass. It was a gun! Jack was very disturbed.
He wanted to go home, but the gun was so big and heavy that he couldn't pick it it up. Then, he noticed a flexible stick and he suddenly had an idea. He used the stick to grab the gun and he dragged it away.
Finally, Jack made it back home safe and sound. After that, he made sure he never went exploring on his own again.
