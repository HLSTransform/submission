Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to make cakes with her mommy. One day, they decided to make a cake for Lily's grandma. They got all the ingredients and started to mix them together. Lily's mommy told her to use a small fork to mix the batter.
While they were making the cake, Lily's little brother came into the kitchen. He wanted to help too. He grabbed the small fork and started to play with it. Suddenly, he accidentally swallowed the fork! Lily's mommy quickly called the doctor, but it was too late. The fork had gotten stuck in his throat and he couldn't breathe.
Lily and her mommy were very sad that they couldn't save her little brother. They learned that it's important to be careful with small things, especially when making food. From that day on, they always made sure to keep small objects away from their little brother.
