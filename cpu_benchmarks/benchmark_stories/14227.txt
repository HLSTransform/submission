Once upon a time there was a boy, who was searching high and low. He searched for a chair and he searched for so long. He looked in many places, but couldn't find it anywhere.
Finally, after lots of searching, he found a chair in a closet. He was so happy and excited, but he was also careful. He knew if he was too rough, the chair would break.
He dragged the chair out of the closet and dragged it through the hall. He placed the chair near the window, so he could sit and watch the birds fly by. He was so proud of himself for finding the chair.
Every day, the boy would sit in the chair, but he was careful not to break it. He knew he found it by searching and he wanted to enjoy it for as long as he could.
