Once there was a boy who loved to play. He always played with his best friend, the staff. One day, the boy heard a loud noise. He was so frightened he hid in the corner. He didn't move, even when his best friend, the staff, tried to come closer. The staff tried to help the boy but he was too scared. Eventually the noise stopped but the boy was still scared. He never played with his staff again.
