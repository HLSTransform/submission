Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to climb trees in the park. One day, she climbed a tall tree and shouted, "Look how high I am!"
Suddenly, she heard silence. She looked down and saw that her mom was gone. She was scared and started to cry. "Mommy, where are you?" she shouted.
But then she heard a strong voice from below. It was her daddy! "I'm here, Lily. Don't worry, I'll help you down." And he did. From that day on, Lily always climbed trees with her daddy by her side.
