Once upon a time there was a lot of music playing in the air. A little girl wanted to dance, so she put on her prettiest dress and twirled around the room.
The girl's mom was in the kitchen cooking something mysterious. The girl's nose was twitching, it smelled sweet and spicy. She wondered what it was that her mom was making.
The girl peeked into the kitchen and asked her mom what she was cooking. But her mom just giggled and said it was a surprise.
The girl danced back into the next room, waiting eagerly. Finally, after a few minutes, her mom announced that dinner was ready.
The girl raced to the kitchen table excitedly and when she saw what was there she was delighted. Her mom had cooked the most delicious pancakes for her.
The girl gobbled them up, then thanked her mom for the mysterious treat. They danced happily together in the kitchen for the rest of the evening.
