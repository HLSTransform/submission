Ben and Lily are playing with their toy cars in the garden. They make them zoom on the grass and the dirt. They pretend they are racing drivers and make loud noises.
"Vroom, vroom, I'm the fastest!" Ben says.
"No, I'm the fastest!" Lily says.
They zoom their cars towards each other and crash them. They laugh and pick them up.
"Look, there's a note on your car!" Lily says. She sees a piece of paper stuck on Ben's car.
"What does it say?" Ben asks. He can't read yet.
Lily can read a little bit. She looks at the note and says, "It says, 'This car is very important. It belongs to Daddy. Please be careful with it.'"
Ben gasps. He didn't know the car was Daddy's. He thought it was his.
"Uh-oh, we broke Daddy's car!" Ben says. He feels sad and scared.
"Don't worry, Ben. We can fix it." Lily says. She is a good sister. She helps Ben find some tape and glue. They stick the car back together. It looks a bit funny, but it still zooms.
They write a new note and put it on the car. It says, "Sorry, Daddy. We love you."
They hope Daddy will not be mad. They hug each other and wait for him to come home.
