Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing golf with his dad. They would go to the golf course every weekend and have so much fun. Timmy's dad would always say, "Timmy, one day you will be a great golfer!"
One day, Timmy and his dad went to the golf course like they always did. But this time, something bad happened. A big storm arrived and it started to rain really hard. Timmy and his dad tried to run back to their car, but they slipped on the wet grass and fell down. Timmy's dad hurt his leg really badly and they couldn't get up.
Timmy was scared and he didn't know what to do. He said, "Dad, I'm sorry. I can't help you. I'm just a little boy." They were stuck there in the rain for a long time until someone finally found them. Timmy's dad had to go to the hospital and he couldn't play golf anymore. Timmy was sad because he loved playing golf with his dad.
