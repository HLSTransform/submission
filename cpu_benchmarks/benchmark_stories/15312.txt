Once upon a time there were two friends, Jay and Sue, who lived in a big house. They liked to play and explore, but sometimes things got messy.
One day, Jay and Sue decided it was time to get organized. They picked up their toys and put them away. They wiped the counters and vacuumed the floor.
After that, Jay and Sue decided to play. But just as they were about to, they heard a noise from below. It was coming from the basement! They quickly opened the door and looked inside.
The basement was full of boxes and stacks of papers. Everything was so mixed up! Jay and Sue's eyes lit up and they said, "Let's organize it!"
They worked hard for hours, until at last the basement was neat and organized! Jay and Sue smiled at each other. They had worked very hard and now the basement was ready for lots of fun!
