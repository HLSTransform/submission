Once upon a time there was a curious little boy who was very independent. He often wondered what lay beyond his garden. 
One day, while in the garden, he noticed a beautiful vine begging to be climbed. He was so excited and started to climb up the vine. As he reached the top of the vine he looked around in wonder and admiration of the beautiful sights that he had never seen before.
But then he noticed a thick wall blocking him from going any further. He was angry and wanted to get past the wall to explore what lay beyond. So he tried to push it with all his might, but it wouldn’t move. He resisted and resisted, but eventually he realized that nothing he did was going to move the wall. 
His mother came and saw him trying to push the wall and she said, “Son, no matter how hard you try and resist, sometimes things are just too strong. You must remember, be independent, and go the paths that you can explore but don’t force anything.” 
Since then the little boy has remembered the lesson his mother taught him and learned to appreciate the beautiful sights within his reach.
