Anna likes to go to the library with her mom. She likes to look at the books with many pictures and colors. She likes to listen to the stories that the librarian tells. She likes to sit on the big rug with the other kids.
One day, Anna and her mom go to the library. Anna sees a book about animals. She wants to read it. She asks her mom to help her. Her mom says, "Okay, but we have to finish soon. We have to go home and make dinner."
Anna and her mom sit on a chair and read the book. Anna learns about lions, elephants, monkeys, and more. She likes the sounds they make. She tries to make them too. She roars like a lion, trumpets like an elephant, and chatters like a monkey.
The librarian hears Anna and smiles. She says, "You are very good at making animal sounds, Anna. Do you want to join me for the story time? I have a story about a zoo."
Anna says, "Yes, please. I love zoos. Can I bring my book?"
The librarian says, "Of course. Come on, let's go to the rug."
Anna and her mom follow the librarian to the rug. Anna sits with the other kids. She holds her book. The librarian starts to tell the story. She shows the pictures. She makes the sounds. Anna listens and watches. She feels happy.
But then, she feels something else. She feels dizzy. She feels her head spin. She feels her tummy hurt. She feels sick. She does not like it.
She says, "Mom, I don't feel good. I want to go home."
Her mom hears her and sees her face. She says, "Oh, no. You look pale. You have a fever. Let's go home, honey. We can come back to the library another day."
Anna nods. She does not want to stay. She wants to go home. She wants to lie down. She wants to feel better.
Her mom picks her up and hugs her. She says, "I'm sorry, Anna. You are sick. You need to rest. We will finish the book later. I love you."
Anna says, "I love you too, Mom. Thank you for taking me to the library. It was fun. But I want to go home now."
Her mom says, "Okay, let's go. Bye, librarian. Thank you for the story."
The librarian says, "Bye, Anna. Bye, Mom. I hope you feel better soon, Anna. Come back when you are well. I have more stories for you."
Anna and her mom leave the library. They go home. They finish the book. Anna feels better. She sleeps. She dreams of animals. She smiles.
