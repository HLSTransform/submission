Anna likes to help her mom in the kitchen. She has a big spoon and a bowl. Mom says she can stir the eggs for breakfast. Anna stirs and stirs. She likes to see the eggs change color. She stirs fast and slow. She stirs hard and soft.
She hears a noise behind her. It is her pet cat, Max. Max is hungry too. He wants some eggs. He jumps on the table and tries to get the bowl. Anna says no, Max. These eggs are for us. She pushes him away. Max is not happy. He meows and scratches.
Mom hears the noise and comes to see. She sees Anna and Max. She is not angry. She smiles and says good job, Anna. You are a good helper. She gives Anna a hug and Max a pat. She says she has some milk and fish for Max. Max likes milk and fish. He follows Mom to his dish.
Anna is happy too. She likes to stir eggs. She likes to help Mom. She likes her pet cat, even when he is naughty. She says thank you, Mom. She says I love you, Max. She is ready for breakfast.
