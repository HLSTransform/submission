Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Spot. Spot loved to run in the grass. One day, Spot saw a little girl named Sue. Sue was sad.
Spot asked, "Why are you sad, Sue?" Sue said, "I lost my ball in the tall grass. I can't find it." Spot wanted to help Sue. He was a generous dog.
Spot ran and ran in the grass. He looked for Sue's ball. Soon, he found it! Sue was so happy. She said, "Thank you, Spot! You are a good friend." Spot and Sue played together all day.
