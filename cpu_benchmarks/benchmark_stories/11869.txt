Once upon a time, there was a three year old who wanted to be impressive. He asked his mom to explain to him how he could do it. 
His mom smiled and told him she had just the thing to help him. She pulled out a stamp and told him if he had this, he could do some impressive things. 
The three year old asked what the stamp was for. His mom explained to him that if he got the stamp, he could get into places that usually only grown-ups can go. 
The three year old was so excited that he grabbed the stamp and ran off to explore. He couldn't believe all the impressive places he could go. He had seen grown-ups go to these places, but now he could too! 
The three year old was so happy that he had the stamp. Now he could go places, see sights, and do things that grown-ups do. He realized that the stamp was special, and he would never forget how important it was for him to have it and how it made awesome things happen.
