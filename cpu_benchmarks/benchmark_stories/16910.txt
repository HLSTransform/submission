Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big mill near their house. The mill had a big wheel that turned with the water. Ben and Lily wanted to see the mill closer.
"Let's go to the mill!" Ben said.
"OK, but we have to be gentle," Lily said. "Mom said the mill is old and we can't spoil it."
They ran to the mill and looked around. They saw a door that was open. They went inside and saw many things. They saw sacks of flour, tools, and a big machine.
"Wow, this is cool!" Ben said. He touched the machine and pushed a button.
"Ben, don't!" Lily said. "You might spoil the machine!"
But it was too late. The machine made a loud noise and started to shake. Smoke came out of the machine and filled the mill. Ben and Lily coughed and ran out of the mill.
They saw a man coming from the house next to the mill. He looked angry and scared. He ran to the mill and saw the smoke.
"Who did this?" he shouted. "Who spoiled my mill?"
Ben and Lily felt sorry and scared. They hid behind a tree and hoped the man would not see them. They wished they had been gentle with the mill.
