Once upon a time, there was a rich man named Jim. Jim had a huge house and lots of money, but he didn't know what to do with it. One day, while he was walking around town, he met a small boy. His name was Sam.
When Jim asked Sam what he was doing, Sam said he was playing in the sand. Jim loved watching Sam play, and decided to join him. For hours, they played together in the sand.
Soon, Sam asked Jim why he had so much money, and Jim replied that he was looking for a way to use it. Sam told Jim that he should build a big jungle in his backyard. Jim liked the idea and thanked Sam for the suggestion.
Little did they know that this was just the beginning of their adventure together! Jim used his money to build the jungle and he and Sam spent their days playing in it. As years went on, Jim became even richer. Not just richer in money, but richer in life as well!
