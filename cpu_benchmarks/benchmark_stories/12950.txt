Once upon a time there were two friends, Jack and Dan, who both loved to bake. They were very competitive and wanted to be the best baker.
One day, Dan wanted to make the most delicious pastry. He asked Jack for help, but Jack said no. He wanted to do it alone.
So Dan decided to try making the pastry by himself. He mixed all the ingredients together, but something was wrong and he couldn't figure out what it was.
Jack came over and said, "I can fix it. Let me help you." 
But Dan replied, "No way! I can do it myself."
Jack shook his head, but he gave Dan an idea. Dan tried it and the pastry came out perfectly!
In the end, Dan and Jack were both happy that they worked together to make the best pastry ever. They learned that teamwork and helping each other is the best way to be the most competitive and successful bakers.
