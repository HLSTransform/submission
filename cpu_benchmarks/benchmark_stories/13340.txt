Once upon a time, there was a sleepy cat. The cat liked to sleep all day, every day. One day, the cat met a little girl. The girl said, "Come with me, cat! I will lead you to a cozy bed." The cat was happy to follow the girl. 
The girl took the cat to a soft bed with a warm blanket. The cat snuggled in and closed its eyes. The girl said, "Goodnight, sleepy cat." The cat purred and fell asleep. In the morning, the cat woke up feeling happy and rested. It meowed, "Thank you for leading me to such a nice bed, little girl." And they became friends forever.
