Once upon a time there was a girl called Sue. Sue was very happy and enjoyed playing in the park. Every day Sue would go for a walk and play with her friends.
One day Sue came across a big hill. She wanted to climb to the very top, but it looked too high. Sue took a deep breath and started walking up the hill. All the way to the top she kept on going until she finally made it!
Sue stopped at the very top and looked around. It was a very nice view from there. She took a deep breath and let out a huge sigh of relief. It had been a hard climb, but she felt a sense of accomplishment. Sue noticed a comfy chair and decided to take a break. She sat in the chair and looked at the view with a big smile on her face.
After a while, Sue said goodbye to the top of the hill and went home. She was happy and felt very comfortable knowing that she had climbed the hill.
