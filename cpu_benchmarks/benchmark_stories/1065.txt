Once upon a time there was a small boy who loved to relax. Every day after school he would lie down in his bed and close his eyes. He would think of all the fun things he had done and the people he had met that day.
One day while he was lying in his bed, he found a small pencil. He picked it up and looked at it. He liked the way it felt in his hand and wanted to use it.
He sat up in his bed and looked around. He had a piece of paper and he wished to draw something. He closed his eyes and started to relax. Soon, he was thinking of a house or a tree or something else he wanted to draw.
He opened his eyes, picked up the pencil and started to draw. He filled the paper with small, beautiful pictures that made him smile. Every time he looked at them, he relaxed even more.
The pencil and the pictures helped the small boy relax and have fun. They were his special friends who made him feel so happy. From then on, he always kept the pencil nearby so that he could continue to draw whenever he felt like he needed to relax.
