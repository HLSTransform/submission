Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved muffins very much and always asked her mom to make them. One day, she saw her friend, Timmy, eating a muffin. She wanted one too, so she asked Timmy to share it. But Timmy was being bossy and said no. 
Lily felt sad and didn't know what to do. She really wanted a muffin but Timmy wouldn't share. Then she remembered her mom always said to take action when there's a problem. So, she decided to take matters into her own hands. 
She went to her mom's kitchen and made her own muffin. It wasn't as good as her mom's, but it was still yummy. When Timmy saw Lily with her muffin, he realized he was being mean and asked if he could have a bite. Lily happily shared her muffin with him and they became friends again. From that day on, Lily learned that sometimes you have to take charge and make things happen.
