Once upon a time, there was a cat and a dog. They lived in a small house near a big tree. The cat liked to drink tea, but the dog did not. One day, the cat made a cup of tea, but it was very dry. The dog did not want to drink it.
The cat and the dog began to quarrel. They were very loud and upset. The cat wanted the dog to drink the tea, but the dog said no. They were not happy with each other.
The cat and the dog quarreled for a long time. They were so loud that a big bird heard them. The big bird came to their house and took the dry tea away. The cat and the dog were still not happy. They did not have tea or a friend to play with.
