Tom and Amy are children. They like to play in the park. They enjoy the swings, the slide and the sand. They laugh and shout. They are loud.
"Look at me, Amy!" Tom says. He swings very high. He feels happy.
"I can swing higher, Tom!" Amy says. She swings faster. She feels brave.
But they are too loud. They do not see the big dog. The big dog does not like loud noises. The big dog runs to the park. He barks and growls. He is angry.
"Help, help!" Tom and Amy scream. They are scared. They jump off the swings. They try to run away. But the big dog is faster. He bites Tom's leg. He bites Amy's arm. They cry and bleed. They are hurt.
The big dog's owner comes. He shouts at the big dog. He pulls him away. He says sorry to Tom and Amy. He calls for help. But it is too late. Tom and Amy are very sick. They go to the hospital. They do not play in the park anymore. They do not enjoy anything anymore. They are sad. The end.
