Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play outside in the park. One day, they see a big truck with a picture of ice-cream on it. They run to the truck and ask for ice-cream.
"Hello, little ones. What kind of ice-cream do you want?" the truck man says.
"I want chocolate," Anna says.
"I want strawberry," Ben says.
The truck man gives them each a cone with ice-cream. They pay him with their coins and say thank you. They are very happy.
They sit on a bench and lick their ice-cream. But then, a big dog comes and barks at them. The dog is hungry and wants their ice-cream. Anna and Ben are scared. They hold their cones tightly and try to shoo the dog away.
"Go away, dog! This is our ice-cream!" Anna says.
"Leave us alone, dog! You are bad!" Ben says.
But the dog does not listen. He jumps on the bench and tries to grab their cones. Anna and Ben scream. They feel helpless. They do not know what to do.
Then, they see their mom coming. She hears their screams and sees the dog. She runs to them and chases the dog away. She hugs them and asks if they are okay.
"Mom, mom, you saved us! The dog wanted our ice-cream!" Anna says.
"Mom, mom, you are brave! The dog was mean!" Ben says.
Their mom smiles and kisses them. She says they are brave too. She says they can get new ice-cream if they want. They say yes. They go back to the truck and get new ice-cream. They are happy again. They love their mom. They love ice-cream.
