Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and collect pebbles. One day, she found a shiny pebble and put it in her pocket. But as she was playing, the pebble disappeared from her pocket! 
Lily looked everywhere for the pebble but couldn't find it. She was feeling uncomfortable because she really liked that pebble. Suddenly, she heard a voice behind her. "Hi Lily, what are you looking for?" It was her friend Timmy. 
Lily explained what happened and Timmy said, "Don't worry, we'll find it together!" They searched high and low and finally found the pebble under a bush. Lily was so happy and thanked Timmy for helping her. From that day on, they always looked out for each other's things so nothing would disappear again.
