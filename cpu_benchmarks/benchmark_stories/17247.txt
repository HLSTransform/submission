Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books and play with yarn. One day, she found an orange ball of yarn and decided to make a scarf for her mom.
Lily worked very hard on the scarf and was very proud of it. She showed it to her mom, who loved it very much. But then, Lily accidentally dropped the ball of yarn and it rolled away.
Lily chased after the yarn, but it rolled into the street. A car was coming and the driver didn't see the yarn. The car ran over the yarn and it broke. Lily was very sad that her hard work was ruined.
The moral of the story is that we should always be careful and pay attention to our things. Accidents can happen, but we can try our best to prevent them.
