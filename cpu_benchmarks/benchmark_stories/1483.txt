One day, there was a careless pilot who decided to change their plans. They wanted to go on a special adventure. So, the pilot got into their plane and began flying. They flew up high in the sky and as they flew, they started to change direction.
The pilot flew higher and higher until they reached the clouds and felt so happy. But then, a big change happened. Suddenly, the plane started to shake and swerve back and forth. The pilot had become careless and forgotten to check the weather.
The pilot started to worry and tried to make the plane change direction, but it didn't seem to work. The plane kept shaking and swaying. Eventually, the pilot was able to get the plane under control and flew back to the ground safely.
The careless pilot learned an important lesson that day - to be careful when flying and always check the weather first!
