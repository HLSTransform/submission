Once upon a time there was a boy who loved to play with his basketball. He was only three years old and his name was John. John loved to shoot the ball through the hoop and he was quite good at it - better than all of his friends. Every day he would go outside and shoot the ball and dream of being a basketball player when he grows up.
One day, John went to the park to play basketball as usual. But, this time something was different: there was an old man watching him. John was very curious, so he asked the old man what he was doing. The old man said he was admiring John's basketball skills and gave him a wise piece of advice: "If you practice hard enough you could become as good as LeBron James one day." 
John was happy to get the advice but he was also a bit sad because he knew it was impossible - he only had a small basketball and he couldn't practice enough to become as good as his idol. He was so disappointed that he had to stop playing and went home instead. 
But then something magical happened. In John's dreams that night, he was playing with LeBron James. He was happy and felt like he can do anything. When he woke up the next morning, John was excited and he decided that he will practice hard everyday, so he can become a great basketball player one day.
