Once upon a time, in a land of pastel colors, there lived a wise old cat. This cat loved to balance on a big ball. Every day, the cat would roll the ball around town, showing off his skills.
One day, a little dog came to town. The dog saw the cat on the big ball and wanted to try it too. The dog jumped on the ball and started to balance. But the dog was not as wise as the cat, and he fell off the ball.
The cat saw the dog fall and felt bad. He wanted to help the dog learn to balance. So, the wise cat taught the little dog how to balance on the big ball. They practiced every day, and soon the dog could balance just like the cat. The cat and the dog became good friends, and they rolled their big ball all around the pastel town together.
