Lily and Max were playing in the park. They saw a big castle made of sand. It had towers and flags and a door. Lily and Max wanted to play with the castle.
"Can we go to the castle?" Lily asked Max.
"Yes, let's go!" Max said.
They ran to the castle. But when they got there, they saw a boy sitting next to it. He had a bucket and a shovel. He looked angry.
"This is my castle!" the boy said. "Go away!"
Lily and Max stopped. They felt sad. They wanted to play with the castle, but the boy did not want to share.
"Please, can we play with you?" Lily asked. "Your castle is very nice."
"No!" the boy said. "It is mine! I made it!"
He picked up his shovel and hit the castle. He broke one of the towers. Sand flew everywhere.
Lily and Max gasped. They saw the castle fall apart. They felt angry. The boy was mean. He ruined the castle.
"Stop it!" Max said. "You are bad!"
He pushed the boy. The boy pushed him back. They started to fight.
Lily did not like fighting. She wanted to play. She looked around. She saw another castle. It was smaller, but it was still nice. It had flowers and shells on it. It looked peaceful.
Lily walked to the other castle. She gazed at it. She smiled. She saw a girl sitting next to it. She had a hat and a doll. She looked friendly.
"Hello," Lily said. "Can I play with you?"
"Hello," the girl said. "Yes, you can. This is my castle. Do you like it?"
"I like it very much," Lily said. "It is beautiful."
"Thank you," the girl said. "Do you want to help me decorate it?"
"Yes, please," Lily said.
They took some more flowers and shells and put them on the castle. They made it more beautiful. They talked and laughed. They had fun.
Lily and Max forgot about the boy and his broken castle. They played with the girl and her pretty castle. They were happy. They made a new friend.
