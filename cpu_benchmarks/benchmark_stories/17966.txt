One day, a little girl named Mia wanted to bake a cake. She asked her mom, "Can we bake a cake?" Her mom said, "Yes, let's bake a cake together." They were very happy.
Mia and her mom got all the things they needed to bake. They put the cake in a line to make it pretty. Mia liked how the cake looked. The sun was shining, and it was a mild day.
But when they put the cake in the oven, they forgot to set the timer. The cake baked for too long and burned. Mia and her mom were sad. They could not eat the burned cake. Next time, they will remember to set the timer.
