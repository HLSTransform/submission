Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint pictures with her mommy. One day, Lily accidentally spilled paint on her dress. She was frightened that her mommy would be mad at her.
Lily's mommy saw the paint on her dress and asked, "What happened, sweetie?"
Lily said, "I spilled paint on my dress. I'm sorry."
Mommy smiled and said, "It's okay. Let's remove the paint from your dress."
Together, they washed the dress and the paint came off. Lily was happy and continued painting with her mommy.
