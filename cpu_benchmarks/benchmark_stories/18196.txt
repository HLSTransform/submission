Once upon a time, there was a frog named Fred. Fred loved to hop and play with his friends. One day, Fred saw an attractive red blanket on the grass. It was a picnic! He hopped over to take a closer look.
At the picnic, there were many yummy foods like apples, cheese, and bread. Fred's tummy rumbled. He wanted to eat some food too. But there was a big, mean bird at the picnic. The bird said, "No, Fred! You can't have any food. This is my picnic!"
Fred felt sad and hungry. He hopped back to his friends and told them about the mean bird. His friends wanted to help. They all hopped together to the picnic. There were so many frogs hopping that the bird got scared and flew away.
Now, Fred and his friends could enjoy the picnic. They shared the yummy food and had a great time. From that day on, they knew that together they could face any problem. And they all lived happily ever after.
