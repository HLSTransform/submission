Once upon a time, there was a big, strong lion named Leo. Leo lived in a big jungle with lots of other animals. One day, a mean tiger came to the jungle and started to hurt the other animals. Leo knew he had to protect his friends, so he roared really loud and chased the tiger away.
After the tiger was gone, Leo's friends were very happy and grateful. They decided to thank him by painting a big picture of him in the jungle. They used lots of colors to make the picture look pretty. Leo felt very proud and happy when he saw the picture.
Leo was a very rich lion because he had lots of friends and was very brave. He knew that being rich didn't just mean having lots of money, but also having people who cared about you. Leo felt very lucky to have so many friends who loved him and he knew he would always protect them. The end.
