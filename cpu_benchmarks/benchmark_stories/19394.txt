Once upon a time there was a big network of caves. Little Toby was very curious and wanted to explore them. But Toby’s mom said, “No! It’s not safe.”
Toby was disappointed, but he didn’t give up. So the next day he asked, “Mom, can I dare go into the big network of caves?”
His mom smiled and said, “Sure, but stay close, and you must come back before dark.”
Toby was so excited and ran off. He explored every single cave, finding all kinds of interesting things. He even found a secret passageway! It was great fun.
When Toby finally came back home, he was so happy and proud of himself for daring to explore the big network of caves.
