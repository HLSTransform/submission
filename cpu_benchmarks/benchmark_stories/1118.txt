Jenny was embarrassed. She sat in her chair and held her guitar. She had never played in front of so many people before. She didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, the music started playing. Jenny was so nervous she almost dropped her guitar. She gripped it tight and started to play. She was shaking and the notes were shaky at first.
But Jenny kept playing. She closed her eyes and started to get the hang of it. She finished the song and opened her eyes. Everyone was clapping and cheering! Jenny was so relieved.
Jenny smiled, put down the guitar and sat back down in her chair. She wasn't embarrassed anymore. She was so proud of herself for playing in front of all those people. She would never forget it.
