One day, a little girl called Sarah went to the park. She saw some children there playing football. She asked them if she could join in, and they said yes. 
The game was fierce. Sarah kicked the ball so well. Everyone was cheering for her! 
Suddenly, Sarah tripped and fell down. Everyone gasped, but Sarah started to laugh. She said, "It's ok. I didn't break anything." 
Her friends hugged her. They said, "Wow, Sarah, you are so brave. That was a cool trick you did to not break anything." 
Sarah smiled. She picked up the football and said, "Let's keep playing. Sport is so much fun!" 
Everyone laughed and started to play again. Sarah was so happy, and she was part of the fierce game.
