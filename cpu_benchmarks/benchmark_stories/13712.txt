Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and gather sticks and rocks. One day, Timmy saw a big van parked on the street. The van had a picture of candy on it. Timmy was so excited to get some candy, so he ran up to the van. 
But then, a mean man inside the van grabbed Timmy and took him away. Timmy's parents searched for him everywhere, but they couldn't find him. They were so sad that they cried every day. 
Eventually, the police found Timmy's body in the van. He had been hurt very badly. Timmy's parents were heartbroken and couldn't believe what had happened to their young son. From that day on, they warned all the other young children in the neighborhood to stay away from strangers and their vans.
