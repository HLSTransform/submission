Lila and Tom were on a big boat with their mom and dad. They were going to an island for a holiday. Lila liked to look at the water and the fish. Tom liked to play with his toy cars and make them speed on the deck.
"Look, Tom, there is the island!" Lila said, pointing to a green spot in the distance. "It has palm trees and sand and shells. Maybe we can find some treasure there!"
Tom put down his cars and looked at the island. He smiled and said, "Yes, Lila, maybe we can. But we have to be careful. Some shells are delicate and can break easily. And some treasure can be hidden and hard to find. We have to use our eyes and our hands and our brains."
Lila nodded and said, "OK, Tom, we will be careful. But we will also have fun. I can't wait to get to the island and explore!"
The boat got closer and closer to the island. Lila and Tom ran to the front and waved to the people on the shore. Their mom and dad followed them and held their hands. They were happy and excited to start their island adventure.
