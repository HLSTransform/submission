Mommy and Daddy were sitting in the kitchen, drinking their coffee. Daddy suggested they should go out for a walk. Mommy said she was tired and suggested they just stay home and relax. 
Daddy said he was feeling restless. He suggested they turn up the music so that the house would no longer feel so quiet. Mommy said it would be too noisy for her and shook her head.
Daddy sighed and said he was bored. He suggested they go outside, but Mommy said it was too hot. Daddy threw up his hands and shook his head. 
Suddenly, Daddy had an idea. He suggested they have a picnic in their living room. Mommy smiled and said that was a great idea. So they quickly made some sandwiches and spread out some blankets. Daddy put on some calm, quiet music, and they enjoyed their picnic together.
