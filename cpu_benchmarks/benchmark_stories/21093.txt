Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Emma. Emma had a blue comb that she loved very much. She used her blue comb every day to brush her long, pretty hair.
One sunny day, Emma went to the park with her mom. They sat on the soft grass and watched the birds fly by. Emma took out her blue comb and started to brush her hair. She saw a small bird watching her.
"Hi, little bird!" Emma said. "Do you like my blue comb?" The bird nodded its head and flew closer. Emma smiled and gently combed the bird's soft feathers. The bird was very happy.
After a while, Emma's mom said it was time to go home. Emma waved goodbye to the little bird and put her blue comb back in her bag. As they walked away, the bird watched them and chirped a happy song. From that day on, Emma and the little bird became good friends.
