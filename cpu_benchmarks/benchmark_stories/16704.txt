Tom and Lily are playing with their toy cars in the living room. They make loud noises as they zoom and crash their cars on the carpet. Mom is in the kitchen, making lunch for them.
"Tom, Lily, lunch is ready!" Mom calls from the kitchen. "Come and wash your hands!"
Tom and Lily pause their game and run to the kitchen. They see two plates of sandwiches and two cups of juice on the table. They smile wide and say, "Thank you, Mom!"
They sit down and start to eat their sandwiches. They are very yummy and they make them happy.
"Mom, can we watch TV after lunch?" Tom asks.
"Sure, you can watch one show, but then you have to take a nap," Mom says.
"OK, Mom," Lily says.
They finish their lunch and drink their juice. They put their plates and cups in the sink and say, "Thank you, Mom!"
They run back to the living room and turn on the TV. They find their favorite show and sit on the couch. They watch the show and laugh at the funny parts.
Mom comes to the living room and sees them. She smiles wide and says, "You are such good kids. I love you very much."
She gives them a hug and a kiss and says, "Now, it's time for your nap. Come on, let's go to your room."
Tom and Lily turn off the TV and follow Mom to their room. They are a little sleepy and they know they need to rest. They get into their beds and Mom tucks them in. She sings them a lullaby and says, "Good night, Tom. Good night, Lily. Have sweet dreams."
Tom and Lily close their eyes and fall asleep. They dream of playing with their toy cars and watching TV. They are happy and they love Mom.
