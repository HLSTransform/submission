Once upon a time, there was a little melon. She was all alone in the big, wide world. One day, the little melon decided to display her beauty. She went to the edge of a valley and waited.
A big, furry bear came along. He saw the little melon and wanted it for himself. He growled and wanted the little melon to come with him.
The little melon was scared, but brave. She did not want to display her beauty to the bear. She quickly ran away, determined to stay safe.
Finally, the little melon was safe. She was happy that she had been brave and had displayed her beauty without giving in to the big, furry bear.
