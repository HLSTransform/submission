One day, there was a grumpy man. He didn't want to do anything, except eat pie! He had a lot of pie - apple pie and cherry pie. But he was still grumpy.
Then, he saw a shovel and he had an idea. He dug a big hole and then he put the pies into the ground. He buried the pies!
When he was all done, he felt a little happier. He was happy that he had buried the pies!
