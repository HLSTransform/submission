Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat grapes because they were sweet and yummy. One day, her mom gave her some grapes to eat, but Lily refused to eat them because they had seeds in them.
Later that day, Lily went to the park to play. She saw a graceful swan swimming in the pond. The swan was so pretty and Lily wanted to touch it, but her mom told her not to because the swan might get scared and fly away.
As they were leaving the park, Lily's mom offered her some more grapes to eat. This time, Lily happily ate them because her mom had taken out all the seeds. She felt so full and happy, and she even said "thank you" to her mom for being so kind.
