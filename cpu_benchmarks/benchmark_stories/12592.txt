Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was helping her mom in the kitchen. Her mom was making pancakes in a lovely pan. Lily asked her mom if she could help.
Her mom said, "Sure, you can help me count the pancakes. Can you tell me the number of pancakes in the pan?"
Lily counted the pancakes and said, "There are five pancakes in the pan."
Her mom smiled and said, "Good job, Lily! You are a great helper."
The moral of the story is that counting is important and helping others is lovely.
