Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her doll named Daisy. One day, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her room. Lily didn't want to at first, but then she thought about how happy her mom would be if she did it. So, she decided to complete the task.
As she was picking up her toys, she noticed something strange. The light in her room was flickering on and off. Lily didn't like it, it was scary. She asked her mom to fix it. Her mom said it was just an ordinary light bulb that needed to be changed. So, they changed the light bulb and the room was bright again.
Lily was happy that she completed her task and that the light was fixed. She hugged her doll Daisy and went to bed, dreaming of all the fun she would have with her toys the next day. The end.
