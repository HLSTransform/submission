Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play sport. He played every day with his friends. One day, they found a huge problem. They couldn't find their ball! They looked everywhere but they couldn't find it.
Timmy had an idea. He said, "Let's solve this problem together!" They all searched and searched until Timmy found the ball under a big rock. They were so happy and played sport again.
From that day on, Timmy and his friends knew that if they had a problem, they could solve it together. And they never lost their ball again!
