Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big teddy bear named Teddy. One day, Lily got sick and had to stay in bed. Her mommy gave her some medicine to make her feel better. 
Teddy said, "Lily, I will take care of you. You can depend on me." 
Lily said, "Thank you, Teddy. Can we cook something together?" 
Teddy said, "Sure! Let's make some yummy soup." 
So, Teddy and Lily went to the kitchen and cooked some soup together. They had so much fun and Lily felt much better after eating the soup. From that day on, Lily knew that Teddy was a dependable friend who would always take care of her.
