Once there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and run around in her garden. One day, she was playing with her dolls and she heard someone mention her name. 
She looked around and there was nobody there. She decided to find out where it came from. 
She looked around and found that it was her neighbour's dog. He was standing on his two hind legs and scratching his head with his back paw. His back paw was tapping against his heel. 
Lily was scared and she ran away. She never went back out to the garden for weeks. She felt guilty for scaring away her neighbour's dog. 
One day, she decided to apologize to the dog. She bravely walked up to him, welcomed him with a smile and told him that she was sorry. The dog happily barked and licked her hand. From that day onwards, Lily and the dog were the best of friends.
