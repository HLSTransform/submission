Sara likes to help her mom in the garden. She likes to water the plants and dig the dirt. She likes to see the flowers and the fruits grow. Her mom grows many things, but Sara's favorite is the tomato. She likes to eat it raw or cooked, with salt or cheese.
One day, Sara sees a big red tomato on the vine. She wants to pick it and eat it. She asks her mom if she can have it. Her mom says yes, but she has to wash it first. Sara runs to the kitchen with the tomato in her hand. She turns on the tap and holds the tomato under the water.
But the tomato is not a tomato. It is a balloon. It pops and splashes water everywhere. Sara is wet and surprised. She drops the balloon and starts to cry. Her mom hears her and comes to the kitchen. She sees what happened and hugs Sara. She tells her it was a joke. She says she bought the balloon at the store. It was cheap and looked like a tomato. She wanted to make Sara laugh, not cry.
Sara stops crying and looks at her mom. She sees her mom is smiling and not angry. She smiles too and says she is sorry. Her mom says it is okay and gives her a real tomato. She says they can share it and have some fun. Sara nods and bites the tomato. It is juicy and sweet. She laughs and gives her mom a bite. They both enjoy the tomato and the joke. They are happy and love each other.
