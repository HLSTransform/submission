Once there was a red balloon. It floated around in the sky, happy and free. It wanted to find something to make it even happier.
Soon, the balloon spotted a cream cone. He floated towards the cone, hoping it would fit in his mouth. When he got close enough, it did fit! The balloon was so excited that he found a delicious treat.
The cream was sweet and creamy. The balloon was so happy he gobbled it down. The red balloon was so full he couldn't float anymore! He had to stay put until he felt light enough to float away again.
The balloon had found the perfect treat for a happy day. He was happy and full and had a red magical colour. He was glad he could fit the cream cone in his mouth.
