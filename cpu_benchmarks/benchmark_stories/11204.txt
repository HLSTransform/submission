Danny was a young boy who always wanted to be a fireman when he grew up. One day he went to visit a fire station and was amazed at all the brave fireman who were working. He met a friendly fireman with a big, red helmet and asked him if he could help him fight fires.
The fireman smiled and said, “No, Danny. You are too young to be a fireman. But there are other ways you can help”.
Danny was disappointed, but he asked the fireman what he could do.
The fireman said, “You can hope. Hope that everyone is safe and that nobody gets hurt. Hope that fires are put out quickly. Hope that your neighbors are looked after. That's an important job too.”
Danny smiled and said he would always hope for those things. The fireman was proud of him and told him never to give up on his dreams even if they seem hard to reach.
Danny thanked the fireman and went home feeling hopeful. He learned that day that there are many ways to help others and make a difference in the world.
