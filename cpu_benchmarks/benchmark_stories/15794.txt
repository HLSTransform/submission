Once there was a family having a fun afternoon in the park. They spread out a blanket on the grass, opened a special bag, and made some popcorn with their hands.
The littlest one was a three-year-old girl named May, who was wearing a pretty gray dress. She was so excited to see the popcorn and kept asking, “What’s that?”
“It’s popcorn, May!” said the mother. “It’s little bits of corn that we make in the kitchen.”
May said, “I want to eat it!”
So, the mother gave May some popcorn, and she started to eat it. She liked the taste so much that she started to break it with her hands.
“Whoa!” she laughed. “I like to break it!”
The family all laughed, and May continued to break her popcorn as she nibbled away. Gray bits of popcorn flew onto the blanket as May laughed and enjoyed the snack.
