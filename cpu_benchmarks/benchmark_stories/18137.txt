Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, while playing, she found a small seed. She asked her friend, "What is this?" Her friend replied, "That's a seed. If you plant it, it can grow into a beautiful flower."
Lily was very excited and decided to plant the seed in her backyard. She watered it every day and waited patiently. After a few weeks, she saw a small sprout coming out of the ground. She was so happy and said, "Look, my plant is growing!"
As the days passed, the plant grew bigger and bigger. It had beautiful leaves and flowers. One day, Lily's mom came to see the plant and said, "Wow, your plant is ready to bloom!" Lily was so proud of her plant.
Later that day, Lily's dad came home from work. He was covered in coal dust from the mine where he worked. Lily asked him, "Daddy, why are you so dirty?" Her dad replied, "I work in a mine where we dig coal. It's a dirty job, but it helps us make electricity for our homes."
Lily was fascinated and said, "Wow, coal is important for our homes!" Her dad smiled and said, "Yes, it is. And your plant is important too. It helps us breathe fresh air and makes our world a beautiful place."
