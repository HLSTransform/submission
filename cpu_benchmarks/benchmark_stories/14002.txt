Once upon a time, there was a long cat named Tom. Tom liked to play with a ball. One day, Tom saw a bin. The bin was big and blue. Tom was very curious about the bin.
Tom went to the bin and jumped in. Inside the bin, he found many toys. Tom played with the toys for a long time. But then, Tom got tired. He wanted to quit playing and go home.
Tom jumped out of the bin and went back to his house. He was happy that he found the big blue bin with toys. Tom told all his friends about the bin. They all went to play with the toys together. And they lived happily ever after.
