Once upon a time there lived a boy named Joe. Joe was only three years old but he was very brave. Joe had a special bow that made him feel calm. 
One day, Joe wanted to take his bow outside and show it to his friends. 
But Joe's mom warned him, "No Joe, you must not go outside with your bow." 
But Joe ignored his mom's warning and happily went outside with his bow. He called out to all of his friends but none of them came. Joe felt very sad. 
He sadly walked back home and saw his mom in the garden. Joe expected his mom to be mad at him, but she was not. Instead, she had a big smile on her face. 
Joe's mom said, "Don't be bitter Joe. Everyone has days like this. I too was once a little boy and I know how you feel. I'm sorry I ignored you earlier." 
Joe hugged his mom, who wiped away the tears in his eyes. She looked at him and said, "Let's go inside and have some ice cream!" Joe smiled and felt better. 
The end.
