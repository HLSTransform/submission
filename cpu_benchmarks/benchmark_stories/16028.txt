Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to explore the world. She asked her mom for help and her mom said, “You can choose whatever you want to do!” 
The girl thought for a moment and then said, “I want to go see the bee!” Her mom smiled and said, “Let’s go!” They put on their shoes and walked down to the garden.
When they got to the garden, they saw an original bee. It was black and yellow and buzzing around the flowers. The little girl was so excited and ran over to take a closer look. She watched the bee for a few moments and then said to her mom, “I choose this bee!” 
Her mom smiled and said, “That’s a great choice! Just be careful and don’t touch it.” The little girl nodded and watched the bee with awe. 
They watched the bee fly around the garden for a while longer and then the girl said, “Let’s go home now!” They put their shoes back on and walked home with smiles on their faces. 
The little girl had experienced an amazing adventure and now she knew she could choose to explore the world anytime she wanted!
