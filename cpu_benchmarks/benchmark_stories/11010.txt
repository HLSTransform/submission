Lily and her daddy were playing in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. Lily saw a big hill with many rocks. She wanted to climb it.
"Can we go there, daddy?" she asked.
"Sure, sweetie. But be careful. The rocks are sharp and hard," daddy said.
They walked to the hill and started to climb. Lily found a small rock that was shiny and smooth. She picked it up and showed it to daddy.
"Look, daddy! A pretty rock!" she said.
"That's very nice, Lily. You can keep it if you want," daddy said.
Lily smiled and put the rock in her pocket. She saw a bigger rock that was round and brown. She tried to lift it, but it was too heavy.
"Daddy, help me! I want this rock too!" she said.
Daddy came over and looked at the rock. He saw that it was stuck in the ground.
"That's not a rock, Lily. That's a root. It belongs to the tree. We can't remove it," he said.
"Why not, daddy?" Lily asked.
"Because the tree needs it. The root helps the tree get water and food from the ground. If we remove it, the tree will be sad and sick," daddy said.
"Oh, I don't want that. I like the tree. It gives us shade and leaves," Lily said.
"Me too, Lily. The tree is mighty and beautiful. We should respect it and leave it alone," daddy said.
They hugged the tree and said thank you. Then they climbed down the hill and continued to play. Lily was happy with her small rock and her daddy. She learned something new and had fun.
