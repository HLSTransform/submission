Jimmy had a rare treat today. He was invited to join his family for a special bath. As soon as he arrived, he was welcomed with lots of hugs and love. Everyone was excited for him to take a bath with them.
Jimmy stepped into the warm bathwater, and he felt so relaxed. His family had brought lots of toys for him to play with in the water. They had a bumpy ball, some bright rubber ducks and a boat.
Jimmy splashed around, laughed and enjoyed himself. His family clapped and cheered when he showed off his bath time tricks.
When the bath time was over, Jimmy and his family dried off and got snug in some cozy, warm towels. Jimmy felt so happy and content as he was welcomed back into the arms of his loving family. It was such a rare treat to bathe with them, and he will remember it always.
