Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat blueberries and would pick them from her garden every day. One day, she went to pick some blueberries, but they were all gone! She felt sad and missed eating them.
Lily asked her mom where the blueberries went, and her mom said they were eaten by the birds. Lily felt restless and wanted to do something to stop the birds from eating her blueberries. So, she made a scarecrow to scare the birds away.
The scarecrow worked, and the birds didn't eat the blueberries anymore. But one day, Lily forgot to check on the scarecrow, and it fell apart. The birds came back and ate all of the blueberries. Lily was so sad and missed her blueberries. She learned that sometimes, even when we try our best, things can still go wrong.
