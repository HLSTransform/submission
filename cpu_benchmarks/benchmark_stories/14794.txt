Tom and Anna are playing in the backyard. They see a big wire on the ground. It is long and shiny and has a hook at the end.
"Look, a wire!" Tom says. "Let's play with it!"
"OK!" Anna says. "What can we do with it?"
Tom thinks for a moment. He sees a big rock near the fence. He has an idea.
"Let's weigh the rock!" he says. "We can use the wire as a scale!"
He picks up the wire and wraps it around the rock. He holds the hook in his hand and lifts the rock.
"Wow, it's heavy!" he says. "Can you guess how much it weighs?"
Anna looks at the rock. She does not know how to weigh things. She does not know what a scale is. She does not know what a pound or a kilo is. She only knows big and small, light and heavy.
"I don't know," she says. "Maybe it weighs... a lot?"
Tom laughs. He thinks Anna is funny. He likes playing with her.
"Maybe it does," he says. "But I have a better idea. Let's swing the rock!"
He swings the rock with the wire. He makes it go up and down, left and right. He pretends it is a plane or a bird or a rocket.
Anna claps her hands. She thinks Tom is clever. She likes swinging the rock.
"Yay, this is fun!" she says. "Let's swing it higher!"
They swing the rock higher and higher. They do not see the unknown man who is watching them from the other side of the fence. He is angry. He does not like children. He does not like noise. He does not like his wire being used as a toy.
He shouts at them. He tells them to stop. He tells them to give him back his wire. He tells them to go away.
Tom and Anna are scared. They do not know the man. They do not know why he is mad. They do not know what to do.
They drop the wire and the rock. They run to the house. They tell their mom what happened.
Their mom hugs them. She tells them they are safe. She tells them they did nothing wrong. She tells them the wire belongs to the electric company. She tells them the man is a worker who is fixing the power lines. She tells them he should not have yelled at them. She tells them he should have been nicer.
Tom and Anna feel better. They understand now. They are not afraid anymore.
They go back to the backyard. They find a new toy to play with. They have fun. They are happy.
