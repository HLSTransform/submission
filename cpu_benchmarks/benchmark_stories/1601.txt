Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play in the garden. They see many flowers. Some are red, some are yellow, some are pink. Sara likes the pink ones best. Tom likes the yellow ones best.
"Look, Tom, this flower is not open yet. It is a bud. Do you know what it will do?" Sara asks.
"No, what will it do?" Tom asks.
"It will bloom. That means it will open and show its pretty petals. Like this one." Sara points to a blooming flower.
"Wow, that is amazing. How does it do that?" Tom wonders.
"I don't know. Maybe it likes the sun. The sun is hot. It makes the flowers grow and bloom." Sara guesses.
"Can we make a flower bloom?" Tom asks.
"I don't think so. We can only watch and wait. But we can make something else. We can make a tunnel." Sara says.
"A tunnel? How?" Tom asks.
"Come, I will show you. We can use these sticks and leaves and make a tunnel under the bush. Then we can crawl inside and pretend we are in a secret place." Sara explains.
"OK, that sounds fun. Let's do it." Tom agrees.
They work together and make a tunnel. They crawl inside and giggle. They feel cozy and happy. They can see the flowers through the gaps in the leaves. They wait for the bud to bloom. They are friends.
