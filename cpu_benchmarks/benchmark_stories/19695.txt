Once upon a time, there was an ugly bird. It had a big heart and wanted to keep it safe. It was scared something bad might happen. 
So every night, the bird dug a deep hole and kept its heart inside. Then it filled the hole with dirt and covered it with some leaves. 
One night, the bird heard a loud rumble and saw a monster coming towards him. He was so scared that he forgot about his heart. 
The monster stopped and smiled at the bird. He asked the bird if it wanted a shiny stone for its heart. The bird knew it was safer to keep its heart in the ground, so it said no thank you and flew away. 
The bird was happy it followed its heart and kept it safe.
