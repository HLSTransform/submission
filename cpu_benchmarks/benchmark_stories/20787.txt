Once upon a time, there was a very small boy called Sam. He was only 3 years old and he was very brave.
One day, Sam said to his Mum, "I want to find gold!" His Mum said, "But Sam, it's very hard to find gold!"
So Sam went on a journey to find gold. He looked in the river but it was too deep. He looked in the ground but it was too hard.
Then Sam saw a high mountain. He thought, "Maybe there is gold at the top!"
So Sam climbed the high mountain. It was very hard but he kept going. Finally, he reached the top and there was gold everywhere! Sam was very excited.
He shouted, "I find gold!" Everyone was so happy. Sam went home with a lot of gold.
The End.
