Once there was a little girl called Max. She was only 3 years old, but she was very cheerful. One day, Max went for a walk with her Dad. They went to the beach and saw a big, grey sky in the distance.
Max asked, "What’s that Dad?" 
Her Dad replied, "That’s a big, strong hurricane, Max. It can do a lot of damage." 
Max's Dad hugged her close and said, "Let’s go back home now, it's getting too windy here." Max nodded and took her Dad's hand.
When they got back home, Max’s Dad said, "Let’s stay inside until the hurricane passes. Then we can go outside and have some fun." 
Max smiled and said, "Ok Dad, I feel cheerful already!"
