Jim was a little bug. He loved to crawl. He was on a mission to find the tallest waffle. So he crawled on and on. He saw many waffles, but none of them were high enough. Then, he saw it! The tallest waffle ever! He was so excited and he started to crawl really quickly. He got so close to reaching the top until he slipped! He fell down and down until he landed on the ground. But Jim was still determined to reach the tallest waffle. So he got up and started to crawl again. This time, he made it all the way to the top! He reached his goal and he was so proud of himself. Now Jim will always remember his journey and his goal of reaching the highest waffle.
