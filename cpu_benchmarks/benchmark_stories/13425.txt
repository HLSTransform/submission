Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was playing in the park with his friends when he slipped on a banana peel. He fell down and hurt his thumb. 
Timmy's friends were glad that he wasn't hurt too badly. They helped him up and walked him to the playground to play on the swings. Timmy's thumb hurt a little bit, but he was still happy to be playing with his friends. 
After a while, Timmy's mom came to pick him up from the park. She saw that Timmy had hurt his thumb and was a little bit worried. But Timmy told her that he was okay and that he had a lot of fun playing with his friends. His mom was glad that he wasn't hurt too badly and they went home together. 
From that day on, Timmy was more careful when he was playing in the park. He didn't want to slip and hurt his thumb again. But he was still glad to have his friends to play with and have fun. The end.
