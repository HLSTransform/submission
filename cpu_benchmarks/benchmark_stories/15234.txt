Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toy cars. He had a big red car, a small blue car, and a rough yellow truck. Tim liked to make the cars go fast and the truck go slow.
One day, Tim found a stamp on the floor. It was a pretty stamp with a picture of a cat. He put the stamp on his hand and showed his mom. She smiled and said it was nice. Tim went back to playing with his cars and truck.
But then, something strange happened. The stamp on Tim's hand started to disappear! Tim looked around and saw that the cat from the stamp was now on his yellow truck. The cat jumped off the truck and ran away. Tim laughed and clapped his hands. The cat had come to play with him and his cars. And they all played happily together.
