Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very lonely. Every night, she would look out her window and see nothing but darkness. But one night, something magical happened.
The girl was looking out her window and saw a tiny light in the darkness. She wanted to see what it was, so she opened the window and saw something glowing. It was the faucet in the garden! It was glowing a beautiful yellow color.
The girl was so excited, she jumped out of bed and ran outside. She touched the faucet and it felt warm. She was amazed by the beautiful light and couldn't take her eyes off it.
The girl stayed outside for hours, feeling warm and happy. The faucet glowed brighter and brighter until soon the whole garden was lit up.
The little girl was no longer lonely. Every night she'd spend time with her glowing faucet, until one day it stopped glowing. But the little girl never forgot how magical that night was.
