Once upon a time there was a baby called Andy. He loved playing with his favourite blanket. It was fancy, with little stars and moons on it.
One day his mommy said with a smile, "Andy, we are going to raise your blanket up in the air!"
Andy was so excited to see what would happen. He could feel the blanket becoming lighter and lighter. Then, all of a sudden, Andy was lifted off the ground. He squealed with delight as he flew through the air, the blanket swishing around him.
Mommy had raised Andy high in the air on the blanket! It was like a fancy special magic ride! Andy laughed and laughed as he spun around. All of his family and friends clapped with joy to see him so happy.
Andy flew higher and higher and just when he thought he was reaching the sky, he fell gently down to the ground.
The magic was over, and Andy was sad - until his mommy said, "Who wants to go round again?" Andy shouted with joy, "Me, me!"
