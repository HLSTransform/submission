Once upon a time, there was a big green frog. He was very patient and stayed still in the pond all day. He waited and watched the water. He wanted to catch something! 
One day, something swam by the frog. It was a big blue fish! The frog hopped closer and held his breath. He was going to catch the fish! He held out his tongue, trying to be very still. 
Suddenly, the fish saw the frog. The fish raced away in a hurry! But the frog was very patient. He stayed still and waited for the fish to come back. 
After a few moments, the fish came back. This time, the frog was fast. He caught the fish with his tongue! The frog was so happy. He enjoyed his yummy catch.
