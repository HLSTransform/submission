Once upon a time, there was a pepper. It was red, round, and it was a very long pepper. It was so long, it nearly touched the ground!
The pepper liked to rock. Every day, it would rock back and forth in the sun. It rocked and rocked and rocked, until the sun went down.
Then one day, a little boy came and picked up the pepper. He was only three years old, but he was so excited! He carried the pepper home with him and gave it a big hug.
The boy put the pepper in the corner of his room and they both rocked together. The little boy was so happy. And the long pepper rocked back and forth until it was time for bed.
