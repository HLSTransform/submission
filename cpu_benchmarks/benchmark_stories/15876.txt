Once upon a time, there was a white duck who lived in a pond. He loved to splash in the water and have fun with his friends. 
One day, he noticed a gray bucket floating in the water. He said "What a cool bucket! I bet it will be fun to splash around in." 
So, the duck swam over to the bucket and began to play in it. He jumped in and out, splashed around and even flipped it over. He had such a good time! 
His friends saw what was going on and soon they all joined in to play. They all splashed and laughed and had a great time. 
Finally, they had to go, but the duck said "Let's come back tomorrow and play in the gray bucket again!" And so they did.
