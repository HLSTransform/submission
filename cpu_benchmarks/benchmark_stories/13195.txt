Little Johnny was eager to watch a video. His mom said no, which made him sad. He disagreed, but she made it clear that he had to wait until the weekend. Johnny was very enthusiastic the day he finally got to watch the video. He was so excited that he forgot to take off his PJs. The video was a great surprise and it made him very happy. They both disagreed about the video for a few moments, but then they both agreed it was full of fun and adventure. Everyone laughed and cheered as they watched. It was a great day!
