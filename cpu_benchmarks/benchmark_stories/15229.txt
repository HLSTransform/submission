Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue had an orange ball that she loved to play with. One day, she lost her ball and started to worry. She looked everywhere for it but could not find it.
Sue's friend, Tom, saw her and asked, "Why do you worry, Sue?" Sue told him about her lost orange ball. Tom said, "Don't worry, I will help you find it." They both used their brains to think of where the ball could be.
After looking around, they found the orange ball near a big tree. Sue was very happy and thanked Tom. They played together with the ball and had a lot of fun. The moral of the story is: when you are worried, ask a friend for help and use your brain to solve the problem.
