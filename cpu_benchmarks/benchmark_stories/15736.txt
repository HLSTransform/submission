John was driving in his car. He saw a bald frog in the middle of the road. The frog looked very scared.
"Hello there!" said John "What are you doing in the middle of the road?"
The frog said "I don't know! I was just crossing the street when I saw your car coming."
"Don't worry" said John. "I'll help you get to the other side safely. Let's go!"
John drove slowly down the street. He stopped in front of a pond near the other side of the street.
The frog hopped out of the car and said "Thank you! You saved my life!"
John smiled and said "You're welcome. Have a safe journey!"
The frog hopped into the pond and was soon out of sight. John drove away with a smile on his face.
