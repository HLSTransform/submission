Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Lily. She liked to play with her toys and eat candy. One day, her mommy told her they were going to visit her grandma. Lily was excited because she loved her grandma.
They got into the car and drove for a long time. But when they arrived, Lily saw that her grandma was troubled. She was sad and didn't want to play with Lily. Lily didn't understand why her grandma was acting this way.
They stayed for a little while but then had to leave. Lily was sad because she didn't get to play with her grandma like she usually did. She said goodbye and hugged her grandma, but her grandma didn't hug her back. Lily didn't know why her grandma was acting so strange. They got back into the car and drove away. Lily asked her mommy if they could visit grandma again soon, but her mommy said "not yet."
