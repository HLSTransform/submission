John and Mary were very excited. They were going to get a present! It was a modest present, wrapped in colorful paper with a bright ribbon. It was small, but they could tell it was special. 
John and Mary had no idea what it was. But when they opened it, they saw a small pine tree! They were so excited. They quickly went outside and found the perfect place for their tree. It fit perfectly! 
Mary then took a bucket of water and carefully wrapped the roots of the tree with it. She then filled the bucket with soil and sprinkled it around the base of the tree.
John and Mary were so proud of their new tree. They decided to give it a name. They chose 'Modesty'! From then on, Modesty was part of their family. 
John and Mary liked to go and sit under it's shady branches and talk. They knew it would stay with their family forever.
