Sara likes to slide. She has a big slide in her backyard. She slides every day after school. She slides fast and laughs.
One day, it rains a lot. Sara cannot slide. She is sad. She looks out the window and sees the slide. It is wet and muddy. She wants to slide, but she knows it is not safe.
She asks her mom if she can slide. Her mom says no. She says the slide is slippery and dirty. She says Sara can get hurt or sick. She says sliding is hard when it rains.
Sara cries. She does not like rain. She does not like hard things. She wants to have fun. She wants to slide.
Her mom hugs her. She says she is sorry. She says she loves her. She says rain is part of life. She says life is sometimes hard, but also good. She says they can do other things inside. She says they can read, draw, play, or bake. She says they can slide another day.
Sara stops crying. She thinks about what her mom says. She thinks life is hard, but also good. She thinks she can do other things inside. She thinks she can slide another day. She smiles. She hugs her mom. She says she loves her. She says she wants to bake. She says baking is fun. She says she likes rain a little bit.
