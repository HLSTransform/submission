Once upon a time, there was a brave dog named Spot. Spot lived in a small structure, which was his dog house. He loved his little home very much. One day, Spot saw a big cat near his structure. The cat was trying to take Spot's favorite toy.
Spot did not like this. He wanted to stop the cat, but he was scared. Spot wanted to be brave, but he did not know how. He thought and thought. Then, he remembered that his mom told him to be brave when he was scared.
Spot took a deep breath and barked at the cat. The cat was surprised and ran away. Spot did not forget to be brave, and he saved his favorite toy. He was very happy and proud of himself. From that day on, Spot knew he could be brave whenever he needed to be.
