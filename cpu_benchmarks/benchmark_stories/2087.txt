Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside in the park. One day, he saw a big truck coming to the park. The truck had a lot of boxes on it.
Timmy asked the man driving the truck, "What are you doing?"
"I'm loading these boxes onto the truck," said the man.
Timmy watched as the man lifted the boxes and put them on the truck. Then, he saw a blue box with an oak tree on it. "That's a pretty box," said Timmy.
"Yes, it is," said the man. "It's going to a store where people can buy things inside."
Timmy waved goodbye to the man and went back to playing. He wondered what was inside the blue box with the oak tree on it.
