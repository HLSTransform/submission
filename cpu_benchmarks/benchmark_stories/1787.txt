One day, Willie the Wombat wanted to go on a new adventure. He saw a bright, enormous path, and he wanted to explore. He took some paint and went to go follow the path. 
The path was so long and twisty - it was all very exciting! With his paint in hand, Willie started to paint the path he was travelling. Soon enough, Willie heard some rustling from behind him and then he heard a voice call out. 
"Why are you painting the path, Willie?" asked an old turtle who was walking past.
"I'm painting it because I want to explore and see where this path goes," said Willie happily.
"That's a wonderful idea!" replied the turtle. "I'm sure this painted path will make exploring even more exciting!" 
And so, Willie continued on his adventure. He painted the path, exploring and following it wherever it would lead. The path was enormous, and he had no idea where it would end - and he was very excited to find out.
