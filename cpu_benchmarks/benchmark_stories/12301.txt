One day, a large velvet chair appeared on the porch. All the children in the neighbourhood were curious to find out who the chair belonged to.
The kids started to whisper to each other. "I think it's for me" one said.
They all went up to the chair and started to feel how soft it was. Suddenly, a voice boomed from upstairs.
"Who said you could touch my chair?”
The children froze, not sure what to do.
An old lady stepped onto the porch and smiled at them. “It’s for all of you to enjoy,” she said.
The children cheered with delight. Every day they spent happy hours playing on the large velvet chair.  It was the favourite spot in all of the neighbourhood.
