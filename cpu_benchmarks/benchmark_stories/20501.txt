Once upon a time, there was a fragile girl. She loved to climb trees, but one day she got too high. She tried to come down, but felt scared. She tried to laugh, but instead she shrugged. 
Suddenly, she started to fall. She screamed and grabbed for a branch, but it was too far away. She kept falling until she hit the ground.
When she opened her eyes, she saw a kind lady. She helped the fragile girl up and gave her a big hug. The girl felt better, and she soon smiled again.
Since that day, the girl doesn't climb as high. She still loves to climb, but she knows when to stop. The girl still shrugs sometimes, but it's usually with a smile!
