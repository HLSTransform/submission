Lily and Ben were happy to see their new house. They had many boxes to unpack. Mom and Dad said they could help.
"Can I unpack this box?" Lily asked, pointing to a big one.
"Sure, that's your box of toys," Mom said. "Be gentle with them, okay?"
Lily opened the box and saw her favorite things. She had her doll, her teddy bear, her blocks, and her clay. She loved to play with clay. She could make anything with it.
"Look, Ben, I have clay!" Lily said, showing her brother.
"Wow, can I play with you?" Ben asked.
"Okay, but you have to be gentle too," Lily said. "Clay is soft and can break."
They took out some clay and put it on the floor. They started to make shapes and animals. Lily made a flower and Ben made a snake.
"Look, Mom, we made clay things!" they said, holding up their creations.
Mom smiled and praised them. "You are very good at making clay things," she said. "And you are very gentle with them. I'm proud of you."
Lily and Ben felt happy. They liked their new house and their clay. They hugged Mom and thanked her. Then they went back to playing with their clay.
