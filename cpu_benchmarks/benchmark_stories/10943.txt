Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a boy named Tom. Tom was deaf, so he could not hear. He had a best friend named Sally. They liked to play together.
One day, Sally mentioned to Tom that she wanted to learn about the body. Tom, using his hands to talk, told her about the lung. He said, "We have two lungs inside us. They help us breathe."
Sally was happy to learn this. They spent the day playing and talking about the body. At the end of the day, Sally said, "Thank you, Tom, for teaching me about the lung. I love learning new things with you."
Tom smiled and gave her a big hug. They were the best of friends, and they always had fun together.
