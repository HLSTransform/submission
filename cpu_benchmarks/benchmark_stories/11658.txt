Once, there was a tall boy named Jack. He was very adventurous, and always looking for fun. One day, he saw a tree with a really strange fruit. He thought it looked like a joke and started to laugh, so he decided to try it.
He carefully climbed up the tree and picked one. He was very careful not to fall, but accidently he slipped and fell onto the ground. Luckily he was not hurt. 
He got back up and decided to try the fruit. To his surprise, it was incredibly sweet. He was so happy he shouted out with joy and laughed. 
He wanted to share the joke with his family, so he decided to pick some more and give them some of the tasty fruit. He gathered as much as he could, being careful not to fall again. 
Everyone in the family enjoyed the fruit, and Jack was proud that he found such a treat. He was also glad that no-one had been hurt when he fell from the tree earlier!
