Tara and her mom were walking down the street one cold day. Tara was excited and asked her mom, “Can I share?” Her mom smiled and said, “Of course you can, what do you want to share?”
Tara pointed to the mitten on the ground. She said, “I want to share this mitten”. Mom picked up the mitten, which was big and warm. She asked Tara, “Why do you want to share this mitten?” Tara took the mitten and said, “It looks so funny! I want to show it to my friends!”
Mom smiled at Tara and said, “You’re so considerate. You always want to share with your friends.” Tara smiled and nodded. Then they walked down the street, flipping the mitten back and forth as they went. They had lots of fun!
