Once there was a little girl named Lily, who was only three years old. One day, Lily's parents gave her a special journal.
Lily was excited to explore her journal and was amazed at all the unusual things inside. She found a magical pencil and pages of colorful crayons, sticker and tape.
Lily began to write her very own stories in the journal, and she drew and colored more pictures than she could imagine! When she was done, she realized that her journal was very special, and she promised to take good care of it.
With the permission of her parents, Lily took her journal everywhere she went. She brought it to school, to the library, and to her friends' houses. Every day, her journal became even more special.
Lily's Journal had become something she treasured, and it helped her create wonderful stories that were unique and beautiful. She realized that with her journal, she could explore the world around her in an unusual way.
