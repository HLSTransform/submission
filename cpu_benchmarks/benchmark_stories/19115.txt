Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tom. Tom loved to draw with his pencil. But one day, his pencil broke and he didn't have another one. Tom was sad.
Then, his mom came in and asked what was wrong. Tom told her about his broken pencil. His mom said not to worry, she would supply him with a new one. Tom was happy again.
But when Tom went to school, he forgot his new pencil at home. He felt stupid and sad. But then, his teacher gave him a pencil to use. Tom was happy again and he realized that sometimes, other people can supply what we need.
