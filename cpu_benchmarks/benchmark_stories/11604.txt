Once upon a time, there was a bee named Jack. One day, Jack flew near a big hive and he thought it looked nice. He decided to take a closer look.
As Jack flew closer, he started to tremble. The hive was huge and it had lots of buzzing bees around it. It looked very difficult to enter.
Suddenly, one of the bees noticed Jack and he asked, "What are you doing here?" Jack didn't know what to say, so he just shook his head.
The bee saw that Jack was scared and he said, "Don't worry, it's ok. You can come and join us in the hive if you want."
Jack was so relieved and he flew into the hive. After that, he was never afraid again.
