Once upon a time there was a boy named Tim. He was three years old and loved to play. 
One day, Tim went to the playground. He saw a tool and was so excited. He ran over to it and picked it up. On it was a light that blinked on and off. He liked it very much.
Then Tim decided to play with it. He pushed the button and the tool moved very quickly. It made a funny sound as it sped away.
Tim loved to watch the tool speed, so he went to all the different places in the park and watched it go faster and faster. He laughed and had a lot of fun. 
Finally, when it was time to go, Tim put the tool back where he found it and ran to his mom. What a fun day he had!
