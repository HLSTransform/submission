One day, a big oak tree stood in a sunny field. It had many hidden spots where animals could hide. A little bird lived in the oak tree. The bird had a small nest in a hidden spot.
Soon, dark clouds came and it started to rain. "Oh no!" said the little bird, "I need to find a friend to stay dry with me." The bird flew to a squirrel who lived in the oak tree too. "Can I stay with you in the rain?" asked the bird.
"Of course!" said the squirrel. They both stayed in the hidden spot, safe from the rain. They talked and laughed until the rain stopped. The sun came out again, and they were happy to be friends in the big oak tree.
