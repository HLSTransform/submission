Lila and Sam were best friends. They liked to play with dolls, cars and blocks. They shared their toys and snacks. They had fun every day.
One day, Lila brought a lovely new doll to school. It had long hair, a pink dress and shiny shoes. Sam wanted to see it, but Lila said no. She said it was her doll and she did not want to share. Sam felt sad and angry. He tried to grab the doll from Lila, but she pulled it away. They started to fight.
"Give me the doll!" Sam shouted.
"No, it's mine!" Lila yelled.
They pulled and pushed until the doll's head came off. Lila and Sam stared at the broken doll. Lila burst into tears. She loved her new doll and now it was ruined. She wept and wept. Sam felt sorry for Lila. He did not mean to break her doll. He wanted to say sorry, but he did not know how.
Miss Lee, their teacher, heard the noise and came to see what was wrong. She saw Lila crying and Sam looking guilty. She picked up the doll's head and body and put them together. She said it was not a big problem. She said she could fix the doll with some glue and tape. She said Lila and Sam should not fight over toys. She said they should be kind and share. She said they should say sorry to each other and hug.
Lila and Sam listened to Miss Lee. They felt ashamed and sorry. They looked at each other and said sorry. They hugged and said they were still friends. Lila offered Sam to play with her doll. Sam thanked Lila and said she was a good friend. They smiled and played with the doll. Miss Lee smiled and said they were lovely children. She gave them a sticker each and a hug. She said she was proud of them. Lila and Sam felt happy and proud. They learned a lesson that day. They learned to share and care.
