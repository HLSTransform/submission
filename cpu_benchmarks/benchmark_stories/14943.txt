Once upon a time, there was a boy named Joe. Joe wanted to learn how to play the drums. He wanted to make music with them. So, he asked his mother for help.
His mother thought it was a great idea. "Let's go to the music store," she said.
At the store, Joe saw lots of drums. He was so excited. "Which one should I choose?" He asked.
The shopkeeper smiled. He recommended the normal drum. "It has a nice sound. You'll be able to play some really great music on it," he said.
Joe was happy. He chose the normal drum. He took it home and practiced every day. Soon, he was playing some great music on it!
