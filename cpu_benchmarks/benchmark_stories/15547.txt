Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play football in the park. They kick the ball and run and laugh. They have fun.
One day, it is very hot. Tom and Sam are thirsty and tired. They see a fountain in the park. The fountain has water that sprays up high. They think it looks cool and fun.
"Let's go to the fountain!" Tom says.
"OK!" Sam says.
They run to the fountain. They go under the water. They feel the water spray on their faces and bodies. They splash and giggle. They are not hot and thirsty anymore. They are happy.
They see a bench near the fountain. The bench has a big cushion. The cushion is soft and comfortable. They go to the bench. They sit on the cushion. They hug the cushion. They are not tired anymore. They are cozy.
They look at the ball. The ball is wet and dirty. They do not want to play football anymore. They want to stay on the bench.
"Let's stay here!" Sam says.
"OK!" Tom says.
They close their eyes. They smile. They fall asleep. They dream of water and football and friends. They have a good nap.
