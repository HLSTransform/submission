One day, Little Bob went out for a walk. His mom said he could bring one special toy and he chose his stuffed puppy. As he was walking, he counted the mailboxes on his street. He counted 1, 2, 3, 4 and quickly lost count. Little Bob was so busy counting mailboxes, he didn’t notice he was heading to the veterinarian’s office. When he got there, he was very curious. He put his stuffed puppy on the counter and the polite lady veterinarian behind the counter smiled warmly. She asked him, “How can I help you?” Little Bob said, ‘I am trying to number the mailboxes on my street” The lady veterinarian was very understanding and kindly gave him some advice. She said, “If you count 1, 2, 3, 4 and then start again from 1, it might be easier” Little Bob thought it was a great idea and thanked the lady veterinarian for her help before he headed back home to count the mailboxes.
