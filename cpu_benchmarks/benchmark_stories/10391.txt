Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jane. Jane was only three years old.
One day, Jane was playing with her crayons. She was having a lot of fun coloring in her coloring book. Suddenly, her mom called her. "Jane, it's time to stay in bed," her mom said.
But Jane didn't want to. She wanted to keep playing. She replied, "No, I want to keep coloring!"
Her mom gave her a stern look. "Jane, it's very important for you to follow the rules. You need to stay in bed."
Finally, Jane relented and crawled into bed. As she lay there, she felt bored. She wished she could be coloring with her crayons.
Suddenly, Jane perked up. She realized that boring doesn't have to mean not doing anything. Instead, boring can mean that you stay in one place and rest, which is also important for you to be able to stay healthy. So Jane decided to stay in bed and rest.
From then on, Jane knew that staying and following the rules was important. She learned that staying can be fun, too.
