Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved candy more than anything else. One day, Tim saw a big candy store. He was very happy and ran to the store.
Inside the store, Tim met a strange man. The man said, "I have magic candy, but you must not eat it all. If you do, you will freeze!" Tim took the candy and said, "I will not eat it all."
Tim went home and ate some of the candy. It was the best candy he ever had. But Tim did not listen to the man. He ate all the candy. Suddenly, Tim felt very cold.
Tim started to freeze. He could not move or talk. His mom found him and cried, "Oh no, my boy is frozen!" 
And so, Tim stayed frozen forever, all because he did not listen to the strange man in the candy store.
