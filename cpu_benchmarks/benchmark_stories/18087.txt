Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and look at all the pretty colors in the flowers and trees. One day, she was playing with her friend Timmy when she saw a big, mighty tree. 
Lily: "Wow! Look at that tree! It's so big!"
Timmy: "Yeah, it's really tall. I hope it doesn't fall."
Lily: "What does fall mean?"
Timmy: "It means when something that is standing up falls down."
Lily: "Oh, I don't want the tree to fall. It's my favorite color, green!" 
Timmy: "Yeah, it's a nice color. Let's go play over there instead." 
Lily and Timmy ran over to the flowers and played together all afternoon, happy and safe under the mighty tree.
