Once upon a time there was a girl named Bella. She was three years old and loved to play with her flute.
One day, it was raining outside. The sky was grey and it was very wet. Bella didn't want to stay inside, so she ran outside and started playing her flute in the rain.
Bella's mom saw her from the living room window. "Bella," her mom called, "you better come inside. You're getting too wet!"
At first, Bella wanted to keep playing her flute, but she decided that her mom was right. She ran inside and put her flute down on the table.
Bella and her mom went to the kitchen and had some snacks. They laughed and talked and had a lot of fun together. 
Bella was happy she listened to her mom and didn't get too wet in the rain.
