Once upon a time there lived a little tiger called Spike. He was clever and adventurous, but he was also a bit scared. He wanted to explore the world but was worried about being safe.
One day, Spike decided to go for a walk. As he walked, he heard a loud noise coming from the forest. Spike was scared, but he was also curious. He knew he had to be brave and explore. He took a few steps forward, but then he heard the noise again.
Suddenly, he saw a few friendly animals moving towards him. He was relieved, and he knew he was safe. The animals were friendly and helpful. They told him about the source of the noise - it was just the wind blowing through the trees. Spike thanked the animals and continued with his walk.
It was then that he knew that feeling safe was importantâ€¦ but with a little help and courage, you can do anything!
