Timmy was an active three year old. He enjoyed playing outside in the sun. One day, he went out and found something dull in his hand. It looked like a funny rock. He enjoyed feeling its rough surface. He twirled it around and around in his hands. 
The rock had a funny smell and Timmy thought it was special. He enjoyed picking it up and moving it close to his face. He looked at it for a long time, imagining all kinds of shapes and colours. 
Finally, he put it in his pocket and ran to tell his mum. She said the rock was an old fossil. Timmy smiled and said that he would always enjoy keeping it with him.
