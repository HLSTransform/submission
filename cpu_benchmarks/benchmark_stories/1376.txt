John and his mom were at the shop. John saw a big box of muffins sitting on the counter. His mom smiled and said, "Let's load them in the car. We can eat them for a snack."
John was so excited and ran to the car. He said, "I can help you load them." He carried some of the thick muffins to the car and his mom helped him.
When they finished, they drove off in the car. All the way home, John dreamt of eating the delicious muffins.
At home, John's mom served them muffins with a glass of milk. They were so thick and sweet and yummy. John and his mom smiled as they ate their snack.
