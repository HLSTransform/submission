Once upon a time, there were two friends, a and b, who lived in a village next to the sea. Every day, they would do things together, like running and playing.
One day, a had a surprise for b. He took him to the sea and pointed out a yummy fish swimming in the water. b was so excited!
However, a told b to not eat any fish from the sea, because it would not be kind to our friends, the fish. So, they decided to play games in the sand instead!
From this story, we can learn that while itâ€™s OK to be excited and surprised by something, we must also remember to be kind to all of our friends, big and small.
