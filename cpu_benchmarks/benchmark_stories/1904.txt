Once upon a time, there was a clumsy little bear who liked to explore the world. One day, she was walking through a dark and gloomy forest when suddenly she saw a special light. As she got closer, she could see that power was making the light glow. The power was so strong that it was like a magical surprise! 
The little bear was so excited that she jumped up to try to catch the power. But it was too slippery for her little paws and the power just kept on glowing. She tried with all her might to get hold of this special power, but nothing worked. 
Finally, the bear had an idea - she stood still and wished as hard as she could that the power would stay with her. Miraculously, the power understood and it stayed with her like a faithful friend. The bear was so happy that the power was always with her - she felt invincible! 
The little bear explored the forest with the glowing power, never having to worry about darkness or loneliness again. From then on, the clumsy little bear was never afraid!
