Once upon a time, there was a barber who loved to dance. He was always happy when he was dancing and he often stayed up all night to dance.
One day, the barber was feeling very tired, so he decided to take a nap. While he was asleep, something terrible happened. Two giant dragons suddenly flew into the village and started to cause a lot of chaos and destruction. 
The barber woke up with a start and he was so scared that he couldn't move. He was terrified of the dragons and he wanted to run away. Suddenly, he remembered something his mother had told him a long time ago. "No matter how scared you are, never forget to keep dancing," she said.
The barber was filled with courage and he started to dance. His movements were brave and he filled the air with courage. The villagers cheered and the dragons were so scared that they flew away.
The barber taught the villagers an important lesson. No matter how terrible something is, it's always possible to have courage and overcome your fears.
