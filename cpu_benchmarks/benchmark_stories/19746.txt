Once upon a time there was a grumpy bear. He was so grumpy that he didn't want to play with anyone. One day he decided to organize a picnic. He wanted to celebrate his birthday! He gathered up some of his favorite things and began to organize a picnic. 
He found a nice soft blanket to lay on the grass, then he set up a basket with some delicious apples, bananas and pears. One of his favorites, steak, was also on the menu. He was so excited he couldn't wait to start eating! 
The bear smiled and sang while enjoying his food. All the animals around were impressed. They were happy that the grumpy bear was finally in a good mood. 
The end.
