Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go to school because she had lots of friends there. One day, Lily's teacher told a funny joke and everyone laughed. Lily laughed so hard that she fell off her chair!
After school, Lily went to the park with her friends. They played on the swings and had a picnic. When it started to get dark, Lily's mom came to pick her up. She turned on the light in the car so they could see where they were going.
When they got home, Lily told her family about the funny joke her teacher had told at school. They all laughed and her little brother even tried to tell his own joke, but it wasn't as funny as the one from school. Lily went to bed happy, thinking about all the fun she had that day.
