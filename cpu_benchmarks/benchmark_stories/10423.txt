Once upon a time there was a dolphin that lived in the ocean. He felt so happy every day as he swam with his friends. One day, he had a foolish thought. He thought he could fly like a bird! He jumped really high out of the water and flapped his fins like wings. But he couldn't fly. He felt so sad when he landed back in the ocean. 
Sadly, the dolphin was never seen again. He had been foolish and had tried to do the impossible.
