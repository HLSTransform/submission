Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was wearing yellow shoes. One day, she went outside to play. She wanted to have fun, so she decided to slide. She climbed onto the slide and looked down. It looked kind of scary, but she was brave.
The little girl started to slide down the slide. It was fast and she was giggling. Halfway down, she saw something yellow. It was a something fluffy and yellow! She wanted to know what it was.
She got off the slide and ran over. It was a yellow caterpillar! She had never seen one before. It was moving slowly and she thought it was kind of cute. But then, it changed! It turned into a yellow butterfly! 
The butterfly flew away and the little girl was scared. But, she knew it was only trying to find a place to sleep. So, she said goodbye and went back to the slide. She was brave enough to slide one more time before it was time to go inside.
