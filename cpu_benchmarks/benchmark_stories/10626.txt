Once upon a time there was an old bird who wanted to soar in the sky. But every time the bird tried, he got tired and couldn't reach far. "You need more practice," said a tiny voice. It was a little sparrow who was watching. 
The old bird thanked the sparrow for her advice and tried to practice every day. He was determined to fly far and high like the other birds. But he got tired again and again and soon he was out of breath. 
The sparrow shook her head and said, "You must be foolish. Here, let me teach you the secret of how to soar." The old bird was very excited. He did exactly as the sparrow said and soon he was making big circles in the sky. 
"You see, the secret is to stay focused and believe in yourself," said the sparrow. The old bird smiled and flew even higher. From that day on, he soared like a king every single day and kept believing in himself.
The moral of the story is that everybody should never give up and must believe in themselves to be able to achieve their goals. Even the foolish old bird managed to fly high and reached his dreams with the help of his little friend.
