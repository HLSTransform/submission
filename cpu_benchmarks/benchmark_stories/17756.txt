Once upon a time there was an amazing jar. It was a special jar that could mix things together. One day something very special happened. Everyone was so excited to find out what was in the jar. 
When they opened it, a rainbow of colors filled the sky! Everyone cheered and laughed with amazement! What was in the jar? It was a mix of all their favorite colors. 
It was so amazing, they decided to make it a special celebration. They painted the sky with the colors from the jar and ate rainbow-colored cupcakes. 
It was a day everyone remembered for years to come. They danced and sang and had so much fun!
The amazing jar was filled with love and it was never forgotten.
