Once upon a time there was a modest dinosaur. He lived in a forest and loved to explore. One day, he came across an exciting new area. He had so many questions!
"What is this place?" the dinosaur asked.
He heard a voice answer back, "This is a clearing in the forest. It is a very special spot." 
The dinosaur was amazed. He asked, "What can I do here?" 
The voice replied, "You can make this place your own. Collect leaves and stones, and make it a beautiful home."
The dinosaur was very happy and thanked the voice for helping him. He began to collect leaves and stones and arranged them nicely. He felt very proud of his work and declared this clearing his very own home.
 
The modest dinosaur could now explore the forest with joy. He had found a special place where he could have fun and ask questions.
