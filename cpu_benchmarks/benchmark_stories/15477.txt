Once there was a very honest little girl, who loved to bathe. Every day she would rush over to her mommy and daddy and say, "Can I have a bath?!" And every day mommy and daddy said yes, and they all went off to the bathroom.
The little girl loved playing in her bath. She would splash around, laugh, and make all kinds of bubbles. When the bath was over she always felt all warm and cozy.
But, sometimes when mommy and daddy were too busy, they would take the little girl out to the park. Instead of a regular bath, the little girl would have to bathe in the park!
The park had a special grill, and the little girl loved it. She'd play in the grill, cook pretend food, and bathe. The water from the hose always felt so refreshing, and the sun always made her feel so happy! 
Once the girl was done with her bath she always felt clean, refreshed, and just a little bit more honest!
