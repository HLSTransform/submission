Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She lived in a small house with her mom, dad, and her dog, Spot. Mia liked to play outside in the sun. One day, it was very dry and hot outside. Mia and Spot were thirsty.
Mia said to Spot, "Let's go fill our cups with water." They went inside the house to the kitchen. Mia filled her cup with water from the sink. She also filled a bowl with water for Spot. They both drank the water and felt much better.
Then, Mia and Spot went back outside to play. They found a big, dry patch of dirt. Mia had an idea. She said, "Let's make mud!" They took the cups and the bowl back inside and filled them with water again. They poured the water on the dry dirt and mixed it all up with their hands and paws. They had so much fun playing in the mud and making a big mess.
