Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim and his baby brother, Sam. They lived in a house with a high tree in the yard. Tim loved to climb the high tree and look at the sky.
One day, Tim said, "Sam, I want to protect you. Let's play under the high tree." Sam smiled and followed his brother. They played together, laughing and having fun.
Suddenly, a big bird flew down from the high tree. Tim stood in front of Sam and said, "I will protect you, brother!" The big bird saw how brave Tim was and flew away. Sam hugged Tim and said, "Thank you for protecting me, brother." They went back to playing, safe and happy under the high tree.
