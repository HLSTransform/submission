Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucy. She was 3 years old and very excited to try out surfing. She put on her swimsuit, grabbed a surfboard and stepped onto the beach.
When she arrived, she saw that there were lots of big waves coming in. She felt very nervous, but also excited.
A friendly lifeguard came up to Lucy and said, "Hello there! Do you want to try and surf?" Lucy nodded her head, yes.
The lifeguard showed Lucy how to step onto the surfboard, how to paddle, and how to stand up on it. After watching a few times, Lucy was ready to try it for herself.
Feeling a bit nervous, she stepped onto the surfboard, paddled forward and then stood up tentatively.
Suddenly, Lucy felt the board start to move and the wave caught her. She was so happy that she had done it! After that, Lucy went back every day to practice her surfing until she became a pro.
