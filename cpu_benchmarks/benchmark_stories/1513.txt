Molly was a 3 year old girl who loved to have fun. Every day, she enjoyed playing in her backyard. Her favourite activity was swinging on the swing set. She thought it was so fun!
Molly would fly high in the air, laughing and squealing with delight. Even though she was not very heavy, she felt as if she was flying like a bird each time she swung.
One day, Molly's mom decided to give her an even crazier experience. She had borrowed an adult sized swing from a friend. Molly was so excited! She had never been on an adult swing before.
When Molly sat on the swing, she felt a bit scared. The swing was much bigger and much heavier than the little one she was used to. But then, mom gave her a big push, and Molly began to enjoy the experience.
Molly loved feeling the weight of the swing as she went higher in the air. She would let out squeals of delight each time she swung by. Molly enjoyed the crazy experience of swinging on an adult swing, and she smiled with glee.
