Once upon a time, there was a modest cave. Inside the cave, there was a magical wheel. Every day, the wheel would spin. Everywhere the wheel spun, a rainbow of colors would appear.
One day, a small child found the cave. She was excited to see the wheel! She wanted to spin it and see the colors. The wheel was much bigger than her, so the child needed help. A kind butterfly came to help her spin the wheel.
The wheel began to spin faster and faster. The colors created a beautiful pattern on the walls of the cave. The child was amazed by the bright lights that the wheel created.
When the wheel stopped spinning, the child thanked the butterfly for all his help. The wheel had spun its magic in the cave and the child was happy.
