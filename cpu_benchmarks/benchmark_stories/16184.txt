Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lisa. Lisa was very clever and loved to write with her pen. Every day she would go outside and draw pictures on the ground.
One day, Lisa found a big piece of paper lying on the ground. She picked it up and said, "This is so cool!" She was so excited that she dropped her pen and it fell into the grass.
Lisa didn't know what to do. She looked around feeling sad. Suddenly, she had a clever idea. She picked up some stones and put them on the paper. Then, she started to write with her stones.
At the end of the day Lisa's paper was full of wonderful pictures and stories. She was so proud of herself and so excited to show everyone what she had done.
From then on Lisa never stopped writing with her pen and using her clever ideas.
