Once upon a time there was a lucky bird. Every day it would fly high up into the sky over the valley. It would soar in the air and feel so happy.
The birdâ€™s friends were two little rabbits who lived in the valley. Every day they would run around playing, chasing each other and having lots of fun.
One day the lucky bird flew down to them and taught its friends how to fly. The rabbits were so excited. They flapped their ears like wings and jumped up and down trying to fly.
But no matter how hard they tried, the rabbits couldn't get high enough to fly. So the lucky bird swooped down and grabbed each rabbit with its strong beak. It flew up into the sky and dropped them inside the valley.
The rabbits were so happy and thanked the lucky bird for helping them. They ran around the valley playing, chasing each other and having lots more fun. From then on, the lucky bird and the two rabbits were best friends forever.
