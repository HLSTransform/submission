Once upon a time, there was a big, tough wolf. He liked to go on long walks and explore the woods. One day, he decided to bring a friend with him on his walk.
So the wolf brought a little lamb along with him. The lamb was so excited to go on this big adventure with the wolf. She was a bit afraid, too, because she had heard stories about wolves.
The wolf was very nice to the lamb. He showed her all the interesting things in the woods, like the birds and the squirrels. He also showed her how to pick blueberries, which were yummy and sweet.
The two friends had a lot of fun together. They talked, laughed and even raced each other. The wolf knew he had to keep the lamb safe, so he stayed close by her side and kept a careful eye out for danger.
In the end, the lamb wanted to thank the wolf for being so tough. She gave him a big hug and said, “Thank you for bringing me on this adventure. I had so much fun today!”
