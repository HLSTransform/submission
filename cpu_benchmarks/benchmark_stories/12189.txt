Bobby was so excited - he was visiting the mall for the first time. His mommy had promised him a fun day out!
When they arrived, Bobby's eyes lit up. He was amazed by the modern mall. Everywhere he looked there were bright colours and friendly faces.
"Welcome!" said the security guard with a big smile.
Bobby grinned back. He couldn't believe how many shops were inside the mall. He wanted to explore them all!
Mommy took Bobby's hand and said, "Remember, it's important to be kind. Everywhere we go, let's say 'hello' and welcome people with a smile."
Bobby nodded and said, "Ok Mommy, I understand. Let's go and say 'hello' to everyone!"
Together they walked inside, greeting each person they saw with a warm welcome and a smile. Bobby soon found out that being friendly and welcoming was even more fun than exploring the mall!
The moral of the story: A friendly welcome can bring more joy than anything you could find in a mall.
