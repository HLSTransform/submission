Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to eat sweet things. His favorite sweet thing was a waffle. He wanted to make a waffle all by himself.
One day, Tim asked his mom for help. She showed him how to mix the flour, eggs, and milk. Then, she told him to be careful with the hot waffle maker. Tim tried his best to make the waffle. He poured the mix into the waffle maker and waited.
Finally, the waffle was ready. Tim was so happy that he could succeed in making his sweet waffle. He shared the waffle with his mom. They both enjoyed the sweet waffle together.
