Once upon a time there was a little girl called Anna. One day, Anna went to the park to play. She looked around and saw a big tree with a measure of hidden leaves. Anna wondered what they were. She went closer and started to question the leaves.
Suddenly, the tree started to whisper a response. The leaves said "Come closer and touch them, they will give you a surprise!" Anna was curious but she was afraid. She took a deep breath and bravely touched the hidden leaves.
To her surprise, Anna suddenly felt scared and cold. She tried to back away but it was too late. Anna realised that the leaves were hiding a monster! The monster grabbed Anna and she screamed for help. Even though she screamed and yelled, no one came. 
The monster flew away with Anna, never to be seen again.
