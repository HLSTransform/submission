Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat cauliflower, but he always made a big, messy mess when he ate it. His mommy would always tell him to try to eat it neatly, but he just couldn't do it.
One day, Timmy went to visit his grandma. She showed him a beautiful vase that she had just polished. Timmy asked her what "polish" meant, and she explained that it meant to make something shiny and clean.
Later that day, Timmy's grandma made him some cauliflower for dinner. Timmy remembered what she had said about polishing and decided to try to eat it neatly. To his surprise, it was much easier to eat and he didn't make a big, messy mess.
When Timmy went back home, his mommy was so proud of him for eating his cauliflower neatly. She told him that it's important to try new things and to always do his best. Timmy felt happy and proud of himself for learning something new.
