Ben and Lily were twins. They liked to play pretend. One day, they decided to play vacation. They put on their hats and sunglasses. They took their toy bags and went to the living room.
"Welcome to the hotel," Ben said. He was the manager. He gave Lily a key. "Your room is number five. It is very high. You can see the sky and the birds."
"Thank you, manager," Lily said. She was the guest. She took the key and went to the stairs. She climbed up and up. She found room number five. She opened the door and went inside. She saw a big bed, a table, and a window. She smiled. She liked the room.
She put her bag on the bed and looked out the window. She saw the sky and the birds. She also saw Ben. He was in the kitchen. He was wearing an apron and a hat. He was the chef. He was making food for Lily.
"Hello, guest," Ben said. He came to the room with a tray. He had a plate, a cup, and a napkin. "I made you lunch. It is very yummy. I have a sandwich, a juice, and a cookie. I hope you like it."
"Wow, chef, you are very good," Lily said. She took the tray and put it on the table. She sat down and ate the food. She liked it very much. She drank the juice and ate the cookie. She said, "Thank you, chef. You are very kind. This is the best vacation ever."
