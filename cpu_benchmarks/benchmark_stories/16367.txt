Once upon a time, there was a thin cat named Tom. Tom lived in a small house with his best friend, a little girl named Lisa. They loved to play in the park together.
One day, they went to the park and saw a big statue. The statue was of a tall man who used to serve food to the people in the town. Lisa and Tom liked the statue and wanted to play near it.
They played hide and seek around the statue. Tom hid behind the statue's legs while Lisa tried to find him. Then, they had a fun picnic near the statue. They served each other yummy sandwiches and juice. After a happy day, Lisa and Tom went back to their small house, excited to visit the statue again soon.
