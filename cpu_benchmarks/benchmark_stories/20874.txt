John was a bald man who was looking for his phone. He searched around his room and asked his 3 year old daughter for help.
John: "Have you seen my phone sweetheart?"
Daughter: "No, I haven't seen it."
John looked all around the house but still could not find his phone. He became frustrated and started shouting.
John: "Where is my phone?!"
His daughter started crying and ran out of the room. John was feeling guilty and followed after her. He found his daughter in the kitchen looking at the counter.
Daughter: "It's there!"
John saw his phone on the counter and smiled. He picked up the phone and hugged his daughter.
John: "Thank you for finding my phone, sweetheart!"
His daughter smiled and hugged him back. From then on, John was more careful to keep his phone in the same place.
