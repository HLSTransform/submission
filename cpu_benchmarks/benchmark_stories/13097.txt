Once upon a time there was a little girl called Amelia. She liked to try new and exciting things, like playing games and sports, travelling and learning. One day, Amelia decided to try yoga.
Amelia put on some comfy clothes and went to the yoga studio. Everyone in the studio was so friendly and kind. Amelia took a deep breath and started to move her body. She giggled and smiled, feeling very happy.
There were lots of different poses that Amelia tried out and she felt very relaxed. But when it came to balancing poses, Amelia struggled a bit. She started to feel a bit frustrated, so she paused for a moment and looked around the room.
Amelia felt inspired by the other people in the room and their clear focus on the yoga. She tried one more time and finally, she managed to hold the pose. Amelia felt so proud and clear. She had really enjoyed her very first yoga class!
