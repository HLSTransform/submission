Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy robot that he loved to play with. One day, Timmy accidentally broke his robot and it stopped working. Timmy was sad because his robot was his favorite toy.
Timmy's mom told him not to worry because she knew someone who could fix the robot. She took the robot to a man who had a reliable repair shop. The man used a special tool called a laser to fix the robot. Timmy was amazed to see the robot working again.
When Timmy asked the man how he fixed the robot, the man explained that he used the laser to shrink the broken parts back to their original size. Timmy was so happy to have his favorite toy back and he thanked the man for fixing it.
