Once there was a clever little girl. She loved to number things. The girl had a special chess set and she wanted to number it. First, she grabbed the king. She numbered it number one. Then the queen, number two. She kept going until all the pieces were numbered from one to sixteen. 
The girl had a great plan. She would think of numbers and then find the pieces with that number. The girl was so clever. She worked until sunset and had numbered all the pieces of her chess set. 
The girl was so proud of herself. She never forgot all the numbers from one to sixteen. She was so pleased that she could challenge her friend to play chess and show them how clever she was.
