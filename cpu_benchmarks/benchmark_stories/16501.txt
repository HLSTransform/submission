Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run outside. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a pretty necklace with shiny jewelry on it. Lily was so happy and she put it on right away.
Later that day, Lily and her mommy went to the park. Lily saw a big, scary dog and she felt fearful. But then her mommy held her hand and Lily felt safe. They played on the swings and the slide, and Lily enjoyed it so much.
When they got home, Lily showed her daddy her new necklace. He said it was very pretty and he could see how much Lily enjoyed it. Lily went to bed happy, feeling safe and with her shiny jewelry on her neck.
