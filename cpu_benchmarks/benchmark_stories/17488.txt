Mira and Ravi went to the zoo with their mom. They saw many animals, but their favorite was the elephant. The elephant was big and gray, and had a long nose that could pick up things. The elephant also made loud noises that made Mira and Ravi laugh.
"Can we feed the elephant, mom?" Ravi asked.
"Sure, we can buy some fruits for the elephant," mom said. "But we have to be careful and follow the rules."
They bought some bananas, apples, and oranges from a stand near the elephant's enclosure. They waited for their turn to feed the elephant, and then mom helped them hold the fruits in their hands.
The elephant was happy to see the fruits, and reached out its nose to grab them. It ate the bananas and apples quickly, and made a happy sound. But when it ate the orange, it made a funny face and spat it out.
"Yuck, the orange is spicy!" the elephant said.
Mira and Ravi were surprised to hear the elephant talk. They looked at mom, who smiled and winked at them.
"Did you hear that, mom?" Mira asked.
"Yes, I did," mom said. "The elephant can talk, but only to children who are kind and gentle. The orange was too spicy for the elephant, but maybe you can enjoy it."
Mom peeled the orange and gave a slice to Mira and Ravi. They tasted it and found it sweet and tangy.
"Mmm, the orange is yummy!" Mira and Ravi said.
The elephant smiled and nodded. It was glad that Mira and Ravi enjoyed the orange, and that they were nice to it. It waved its nose at them and said, "Thank you for the fruits, and for being my friends."
