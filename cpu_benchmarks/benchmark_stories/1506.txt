Once upon a time, there were two friends, Jake and Daisy. They decided to go to Daisy's house. When they got to Daisy's house, they went inside. Daisy showed Jake her bedroom. It was so nice. The walls were pink and there was a toy box in the corner. Jake was so excited.
Then, Daisy and Jake decided to get some snack. Daisy took out some cookies. They were so delicious! Daisy and Jake enjoyed the cookies and then headed outside to play. They had so much fun playing together.
Finally, it was time to go home. Daisy and Jake said goodbye and Daisy helped Jake manage to get home. When he got home, he laid down in his bedroom and soon he was fast asleep.
The end!
