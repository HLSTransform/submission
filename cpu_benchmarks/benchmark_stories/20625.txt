Once there was a little boy named Steve. He loved to play basketball with his friends. One day Steve got very sad because his basketball was broken. He asked his dad to help him restore the basketball.
Dad took some special tools and worked on the basketball for a while. Finally, the basketball was in one piece and it looked beautiful. Steve smiled with joy and thanked his dad.
The next day, Steve and his friends started playing basketball again. Steve's friends were disgusted with the broken basketball. But now that it was restored, they were all happy and began a good game.
Steve was grateful to his dad for restoring the basketball and helping to make the game fun for everyone. Now Steve and his friends could continue to play happily and look forward to their next game.
