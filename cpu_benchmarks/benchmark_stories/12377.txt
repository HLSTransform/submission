John was playing in his garden with his toy truck. He was digging in the dirt, trying to find something special. Suddenly, he saw something moving in the dirt. He reached down and pulled out a small worm.
John was excited by the discovery, but he wasn't sure what to do with it. He asked his mom, "Mom, what do I do with this worm?"
Mom smiled and said, "Put it back in the dirt, John."
John was a bit frustrated, but he listened to his mom and put the worm back. Then he stood back and watched. 
Soon something magical began to happen. First two worms appeared and then four, then eight and then more. Soon the garden was full of worms! John laughed with joy.
He looked back at his mom and she was smiling. He knew she had known all along that this would happen. John was so excited and he couldn't help but give his mom a big hug.
