Once upon a time, there was a cow named Betsy. Betsy was very old, she was an ancient cow. One day, Betsy was walking in a field when she met a little girl named Lily. Lily loved cows and wanted to pet Betsy. 
Lily said, "Hello Betsy, you are an ancient cow. Can I pet you?" 
Betsy replied, "Yes, you can pet me, but be careful. I am very fragile." 
Lily reached out to pet Betsy, but she accidentally touched her with an ice cube. Betsy started to melt! 
Lily was scared and said, "Oh no! Betsy is melting! What do we do?" 
Betsy said, "Don't worry, just get me to some shade and I will cool down. Thank you for being careful with me." 
Lily helped Betsy to some shade and she eventually stopped melting. They became good friends and would often visit each other in the field.
