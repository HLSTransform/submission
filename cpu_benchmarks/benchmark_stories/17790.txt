Once, there was a crazy volcano. Every day, the volcano would speak. It would speak about the things in its world. One day, a little girl heard the volcano and decided to go see it.
When the little girl arrived, she was amazed! The volcano was so loud! The little girl was scared and ran away. But then she stopped and thought. If the volcano was speaking, she wanted to know what it was saying.
So the little girl went back to the volcano. She got closer and closer, until she was close enough to listen. When she listened, she found out that the volcano was talking about how much it loved the world!
The little girl was so happy to find out that the volcano was actually friendly. She stayed and talked with the volcano every day. They talked about everything and had lots of fun together.
Now, every day the little girl goes to the crazy volcano and listens as it speaks. They have lots of adventures together and the little girl loves it!
