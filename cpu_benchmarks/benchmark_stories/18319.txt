Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One hot day, they decided to play a game of capture the flag.
Timmy's team had the red flag, but the other team had the blue flag. They were both hiding in their forts, waiting for the other team to make a move.
Suddenly, Timmy heard a noise. He looked over and saw the other team sneaking towards their fort. He ran over to his friends and said, "They're coming! What should we do?"
His friend Sarah shrugged and said, "I don't know, but we have to protect our flag!" Timmy knew they had to act fast. They came up with a plan and were able to capture the blue flag, winning the game. Timmy felt proud of his team and was happy they were able to work together.
