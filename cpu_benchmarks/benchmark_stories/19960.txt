Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big oak tree with many acorns on the ground. Lily and Tom ran to the tree and started to pick up the acorns.
"Look, I have more acorns than you!" Lily said, holding her basket.
"That's not fair, you took too many!" Tom said, feeling sad.
"No, I didn't. I was faster and smarter. These are my acorns, you can't have any!" Lily said, being selfish.
Tom did not like how Lily was acting. He wanted to share the acorns and have fun. He thought of a way to teach Lily a lesson.
"Okay, fine. You can keep your acorns. But I have something better. Do you want to see?" Tom said, pretending to be happy.
Lily was curious. She wanted to see what Tom had. She followed him to the other side of the park, where there was a pond.
"Look, I have a frog!" Tom said, showing Lily a green frog in his hand.
"A frog? That's silly. What can you do with a frog?" Lily said, not impressed.
"You can do many things with a frog. You can pet it, and kiss it, and make it jump. And maybe it will turn into a prince!" Tom said, making up a story.
Lily liked the idea of a prince. She wanted to have a frog too. She asked Tom if she could hold his frog.
"Sure, you can hold my frog. But only if you give me some of your acorns. That's fair, right?" Tom said, smiling.
Lily thought for a moment. She did not want to give up her acorns, but she also wanted to hold the frog. She decided to trade some of her acorns for the frog.
"Okay, here are some of my acorns. Now give me the frog!" Lily said, handing Tom a few acorns.
Tom gave Lily the frog and took the acorns. He put them in his basket and thanked Lily.
"Thank you, Lily. You are very kind. Do you want to play with the frog together?" Tom said, being friendly.
Lily nodded and smiled. She realized that sharing was more fun than being selfish. She and Tom played with the frog and the acorns, and had a great time. They learned to be good friends.
