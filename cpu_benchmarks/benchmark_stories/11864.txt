Once upon a time there was a little girl called Sarah. She was three years old and loved playing make-believe.
One day Sarah found an old pencil on the floor. She picked it up and said, "This pencil looks clean so it will be perfect for drawing."
Then she ran to the park with the pencil and started drawing a picture. The picture included a lot of colors and shapes. She was so proud of her drawing that she wanted to show it to someone.
She looked around and saw a dog zipping around the park. Sarah thought it would be fun to show her picture to the dog. She hopped on the dog's back with the pencil and zipped around the park. 
When Sarah and the dog arrived back at the spot where she started, she showed the dog her picture. The dog looked at the picture and said, "It's beautiful. You are very lucky to have a pencil so you can draw such a clean and creative picture."
Sarah smiled and said, "Yes, I am grateful for my pencil."
