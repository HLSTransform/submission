Once upon a time, there was a mom. She had a special book. The book was a novel. The novel was very tough. The mom wanted to hide it.
So, she stayed up very late. She looked all around the house. She looked in all the corners. She looked in the closets. But she couldn't find a good spot.
Then, the mom had an idea. She went outside and looked in the garden. She found a perfect spot. Right under a bush!
Mom tucked the novel in and hid it. Later, when she came back, it was still there. She smiled. No one could find her special novel.
