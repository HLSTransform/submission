One day, a boy and his sister went out to the park. They were so excited because they had never been to the park before. Suddenly, they spotted something that looked interesting. It was a big, bright slide. 
The boy's sister said "Let's go down the slide first!" He nodded and ran towards the slide. He went down it and shouted "This is so fun!"
On the other side, his sister wanted to do something else. She saw a large, boring sandpit nearby. She said "Let's go and make something in the sandpit." 
So, the brother and his sister ran towards the sandpit. They put their hands together and started building different shapes in the sand. They finished building animals, castles and all sorts of structures. They had so much fun!
They looked at the completed sandpit and were very proud. "We did a great job!" said the brother. His sister smiled and said "Now let's go do something else!"
