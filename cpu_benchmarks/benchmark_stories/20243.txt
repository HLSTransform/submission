Once upon a time, there was a mighty cat named Tom. Tom lived in a small house with his best friend, a little girl named Sue. They loved to play together all day long.
One day, Tom and Sue saw a big door with a sign that said "Exit." They were very curious and decided to open the door. Behind the door, they found a room full of big, noisy things. The noise was so loud, it disturb Tom and Sue.
They tried to leave the room, but the door was locked. Tom and Sue were very sad and scared. They could not find a way to get out. The noise kept getting louder and louder, and they missed their quiet home.
