Sara and Ben are twins. They are three years old. Today is their birthday. They are very happy. They want to celebrate with their family and friends.
They help their mom and dad make a big cake. The cake has chocolate and cream and candles. Sara and Ben like chocolate and cream. They put the cake on the table. They wait for their guests to come.
Soon, the doorbell rings. Sara and Ben run to the door. They see their grandma and grandpa, their aunt and uncle, and their cousins. They hug and kiss them. They say hello and welcome.
"Happy birthday, Sara and Ben!" their grandma and grandpa say. "You are such lovely children. We have a surprise for you."
"What is it?" Sara and Ben ask.
"Come with us. We will show you." their grandma and grandpa say. They take Sara and Ben by the hand. They go upstairs.
Sara and Ben are curious. They wonder what the surprise is. They follow their grandma and grandpa to a room. They open the door.
Sara and Ben gasp. They see a lot of balloons and toys and books and clothes. They are all for them. They are their birthday presents.
"Wow! Thank you, thank you, thank you!" Sara and Ben say. They hug and kiss their grandma and grandpa. They are very happy. They play with their new toys and books and clothes.
They hear their mom and dad call them. "Sara and Ben, come downstairs. It's time to cut the cake and sing the song."
Sara and Ben leave their presents in the room. They go downstairs. They see their family and friends around the table. They see the cake with the candles. They smile.
They sit on their chairs. They blow the candles. They make a wish. They cut the cake. They share it with everyone. They sing the song. They say thank you. They celebrate their birthday. They are very happy. They have a lovely day.
