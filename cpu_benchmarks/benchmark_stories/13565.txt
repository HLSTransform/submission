Once upon a time, there was a little birdie named Tweety. Tweety loved to sing all day long. One day, Tweety was flying around when he saw a big piece of meat on the ground. It smelled very spicy and delicious. 
Tweety landed on the meat and started to eat it. Suddenly, a big cat named Tom came out of nowhere and saw Tweety eating the meat. Tom said, "That's my meat! Give it back to me!" 
But Tweety didn't want to give the meat back. He said, "No, it's my meat now. I found it first!" 
Tom got very angry and chased Tweety. Tweety tried to fly away, but Tom caught him and ate him up. And that was the end of Tweety's singing.
