Lily was a baby girl who liked to talk a lot. She talked to her toys, to her mom and dad, and to her big brother Tom. She talked when she was happy, when she was sad, and when she was bored. She talked so much that sometimes she forgot to listen.
One night, Lily was in her crib and she saw a bald man outside her window. He had a big bag and a mask on his face. He looked scary and mean. Lily wanted to scream and call for help, but she was too afraid. She wished she had listened to Tom when he told her about bad people who try to take things from houses.
The bald man saw Lily's crib and thought there might be something valuable inside. He opened the window and climbed in. He reached for the crib and pulled the blanket. But instead of finding a treasure, he found Lily. She looked at him with big eyes and said, "Hi, I'm Lily. Who are you? Do you want to talk?"
The bald man was so surprised and confused that he dropped the blanket and the bag. He did not expect to see a baby who wanted to talk to him. He felt ashamed and sorry for what he was doing. He said, "No, I don't want to talk. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I shouldn't be here. Please don't cry or tell anyone. I'll go now."
He climbed out of the window and ran away. He decided to stop stealing and to find a better way to live. Lily watched him go and smiled. She was glad he was gone, but she also felt sorry for him. She hoped he would be happy and good someday. She learned that talking can be powerful and helpful, but also that listening can be important and wise. She fell asleep and dreamed of happy things.
