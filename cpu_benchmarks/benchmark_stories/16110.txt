Once there was a family who had a very intelligent boy. His name was Andy. Every day, Andy would use the faucet in the bathroom and play a game. He would press his tiny hand to the faucet and watch as the water came out like magic.
One day, Andy wanted to make something special from the faucet. He tried and tried, but nothing worked. He was very disappointed.
Suddenly, an idea came to him! He ran to his parents and asked them for some paper. His parents gave him a roll of paper and he ran back to the faucet. He put the paper under the faucet and pressed the handle. Water started to flow and it made beautiful shapes. Andy smiled and laughed.
He had learned a new way to use the faucet. He had made something special. He had printed a picture with the faucet!
