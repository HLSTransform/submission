Once upon a time, there was a little ant. The ant was walking in the grass when it saw a big piece of candy. The ant was happy and said, "I have found a yummy candy!" Then, a little girl came and saw the ant. She wanted to play with it, but the ant was scared and said, "Please don't hurt me, I want to be safe." 
The little girl picked up the candy and the ant and put them in her pocket. She went back to her house and showed her mom the candy and the ant. Her mom was not happy and said, "We don't keep ants in the house, they can make us sick." The little girl was sad and said, "But I want to keep it safe." 
The mom said, "No, it's not safe for us to have ants in the house." So, the little girl had to let the ant go outside. She put the ant on the ground and it ran away. The little girl was sad that she couldn't keep the ant safe, but she knew it was the right thing to do.
