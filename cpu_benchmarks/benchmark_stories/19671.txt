There was a vendor in the village. He was wearing a big hat and carrying a basket. Sarah was three years old and she was very obedient. She wanted to help the vendor and so she asked her mum if she could dress up like him. 
Her mum agreed and so Sarah put on a colourful dress and the biggest hat she could find. She took the empty basket from the kitchen and off she went. 
When she arrived at the village, she found the vendor. He was very surprised to see her! She followed him around the village as he sold his goods. He looked very happy and kept patting her on the head. 
At the end of the day, she received lots of compliments from the customers. The vendor thanked her and they said goodbye.
