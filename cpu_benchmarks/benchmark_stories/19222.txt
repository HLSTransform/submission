Once upon a time, there was a happy family. They wanted to go on a trip. Daddy said, "We need to pack our bags." So, they got their bags and put in their clothes.
The next day, they got in the car. Daddy turned the key and the car started. They drove for a long time. Then, they saw a bright light in the sky. It was the sun! They arrived at the beach and had a fun day playing in the sand and swimming in the sea.
At the end of the day, they packed up their things and went back home. They were tired, but happy. They went to bed and dreamed of their next trip.
