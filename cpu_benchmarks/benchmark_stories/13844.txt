Once upon a time, there was a slow lizard. He lived in a big green garden. The lizard liked to play with his friends, the birds and the bugs. They would play all day under the warm sun.
One day, the slow lizard saw a big frown on his friend, the bird's face. The bird was sad because he lost his toy. The lizard wanted to help his friend find the toy and make him happy again.
The slow lizard and the bird looked all around the garden. They asked the bugs if they saw the toy. Finally, they found the toy under a big rock. The bird's frown went away, and he was happy again. The slow lizard and the bird played together for the rest of the day.
