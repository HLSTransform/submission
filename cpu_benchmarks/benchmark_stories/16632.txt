Lila was a little deer who liked to play in the forest. She had many friends, like Ben the bird and Max the mouse. They had fun jumping, running and singing together.
One day, Lila saw a shiny thing on the ground. It was a bow, made of metal and string. She picked it up and felt very happy. She thought it was a toy, and she wanted to show it to her friends.
She ran to Ben and Max, who were sitting on a twig. She said, "Look what I found! It is a bow, and it is mine!" She did not want to share it with them. She was very proud and selfish.
Ben and Max were curious and asked, "What does it do? Can we see it?" But Lila said, "No, it is only for me. You can't touch it. Go away!" She made them sad and angry.
They left her alone and went to play with other friends. Lila tried to play with the bow, but she did not know how. She pulled the string, but it snapped. She bent the metal, but it broke. She hurt her fingers and cried.
She realized that the bow was not a toy, but a trap. It was meant to catch animals, like her. She was very scared and sorry. She wished she had been nice to her friends.
She ran to find them and said, "I am sorry, I was wrong. The bow was not a toy, but a trap. It was very bad and dangerous. I broke it and hurt myself. Can you forgive me?"
Ben and Max saw that she was sincere and felt sorry for her. They said, "We forgive you, Lila. We are your friends. We are glad you are safe. Come and play with us."
Lila hugged them and thanked them. She learned that it is better to share and be kind than to be greedy and mean. She was lucky to have such good friends. She threw away the bow and never touched it again.
