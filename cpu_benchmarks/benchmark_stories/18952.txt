Once upon a time, there was a big house with a strong lock on the door. Inside the house lived a kind man named Tom and his small dog named Spot. They were very happy living in the big house.
One day, a harsh wind blew and made the trees dance. Tom looked out the window and saw a little girl named Sue standing outside. She was cold and sad. Tom opened the door and said, "Come in, Sue! The wind is very harsh today."
Sue came inside and saw the strong lock on the door. She asked Tom, "What is the lock for?" Tom said, "The lock keeps us safe when we sleep at night." Sue felt better knowing the lock was there.
Later, Sue saw a sign on the wall with a picture of a cat. She asked Tom, "What does the sign say?" Tom said, "The sign says, 'We love cats.'" Sue smiled and said, "I love cats too!" Tom, Sue, and Spot became good friends and lived happily in the big house with the strong lock and the cat sign.
