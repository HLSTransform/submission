One day, a little girl named Mia went to the kitchen. She saw a big tray on the table. The tray had all sorts of yummy things on it. There were apples, bananas, and cookies. Mia's eyes got big and she smiled.
Mia's mom came into the kitchen and said, "Mia, let's sort the yummy things on the tray. We can put the apples in one pile, the bananas in another pile, and the cookies in a third pile." Mia nodded her head and they started to sort the yummy things together.
When they finished sorting, Mia looked at her mom and asked, "Can I eat a yummy cookie now, please?" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, Mia, you can have one yummy cookie for helping me sort the tray." Mia picked up a cookie, took a big bite, and said, "Thank you, Mommy! This is so yummy!"
