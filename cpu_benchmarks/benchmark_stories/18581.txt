Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved sausages and he always wanted to eat them. One day, Timmy went to the park with his mom and saw a little girl crying. He went to her and asked what was wrong. The little girl said that someone pinched her toy and she couldn't find it.
Timmy felt sad for the little girl and wanted to help her. He looked around the park and found the toy. He gave it back to the little girl and she stopped crying. Timmy felt incredible because he made the little girl happy again.
Timmy learned that it's important to be kind and help others. He also learned that it's not nice to take things that don't belong to us. From that day on, Timmy always tried to be helpful and kind to everyone he met.
