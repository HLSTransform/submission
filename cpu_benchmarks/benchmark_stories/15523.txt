Once there was a kid. She liked to wear pink. Everywhere she went people smiled at her because she looked so cute. 
One day, the kid wanted to change. She wanted to wear different colors and look different. So, she went to the store and got some new clothes. 
The clothes were yellow, blue and green. She looked amazing in her new clothes and everyone said she looked very pretty. 
The kid was so happy with her new look. She thought it was fun to change and she loved to show off her new clothes.
From then on, she kept on changing her look. Everyday she found new ways to mix and match her clothes and look different. She was so excited to show off her style every day.
