Billy and his mommy were walking in the park. The sunny sky was blue and the birds were singing. Billy wanted to reach the mark on the ground. He pointed to it and said, "Mommy, I want to reach it!" 
Mommy smiled and said, "Sure you can, Billy."
Billy started running and jumping. He looked so excited to reach that mark. He tried many times but all his efforts seemed too dull. He stopped and was feeling so disappointed. 
Mommy came to him and said, "It's alright, Billy. Reach out your hands, I will help you."
She kneeled down and asked Billy to give her his hands. With her help, they both reached the mark. Billy was so happy and said, "Mommy, thank you!" She kissed him and said, "You can do anything, Billy."
