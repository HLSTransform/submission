Once upon a time, there was a green frog. He lived in a pond with lots of other frogs. One day, the frog had to suffer a shock. He was very scared! 
He quickly hopped away and found a safe, dark place to hide. He curled up tightly and hoped the shock would go away. But it didn't.
Suddenly, the frog heard a voice. It said, "My dear, do not be afraid. I know you are scared, but try to be brave."
The frog slowly crept out of his hiding spot. He looked around and saw a tall, green tree. The tree said, "Follow me, I will help you." 
The frog took the tree's advice and followed it. Together, the frog and the tree danced around the pond. As the frog danced and sang, he slowly forgot about the shock. He was happy and free! 
The end.
