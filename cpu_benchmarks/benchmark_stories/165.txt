Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his blocks. He would build towers and castles all day long. Timmy was very creative with his blocks.
One day, Timmy's mom called him for lunch. Timmy was so excited to eat his favorite sandwich. But when he went back to his room to play with his blocks, they were gone! Timmy looked everywhere, but they had disappeared.
Timmy was sad, but he didn't give up. He used his creative mind to think of a way to find his blocks. Suddenly, he remembered that he had let his friend borrow them. Timmy went to his friend's house and there they were - his blocks! Timmy was so happy to have his blocks back and he knew he would never let them disappear again.
