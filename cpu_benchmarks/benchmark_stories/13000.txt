Once upon a time there was a friendly cat. He ran around in the garden, chasing birds, rolling in the dirt and having fun. But one day things changed. 
The cat saw a threat. It was a big, mean dog. The cat was scared and wanted to run away. But the dog kept coming closer and closer. The friendly cat stopped. 
The cat glared at the dog, but the dog kept growling. The cat thought fast and came up with a plan. He opened his mouth and meowed as loud as he could! 
The dog stopped and looked surprised. The cat kept meowing. The dog finally got the message and ran away.
After making sure the dog was gone, the friendly cat ran around the garden again, having lots of fun.
