Once upon a time there was a big storm. It was really loud and windy. All the birds flew away and the trees moved like they were dancing. Everyone wanted the storm to go away.
The next day the sun came out. Everyone smiled because the storm was gone. But the storm left something important behind. It left lots of water, like a big swimming pool. Everyone wanted to play in it.
So they ran outside and jumped in. They swam and laughed and made big splashes. They were so happy that they even forgot all about the storm. They just wanted to have fun.
The end.
