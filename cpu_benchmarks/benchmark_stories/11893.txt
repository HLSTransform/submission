Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy who loved lollipops. One day, he went to the candy store to buy a lollipop. He picked a red lollipop and started to lick it. Suddenly, a clever fox appeared and snatched the lollipop from Timmy's hand.
"Hey, give me back my lollipop!" Timmy cried.
The fox laughed and said, "No way! This lollipop is mine now."
Timmy was sad and didn't know what to do. But then, he had an idea. He ran to the nearby park and climbed up a tree. The fox tried to catch him, but Timmy was too clever. He waited until the fox was distracted and then he escaped with his lollipop.
From that day on, Timmy learned to always be careful and clever so that he could keep his lollipops safe.
