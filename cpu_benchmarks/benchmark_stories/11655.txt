Once there was a family who wanted to celebrate. They gathered around the grill and started to prepare the food. The dad was excited and the mom was happy. But when the little girl saw the grill, she was frightened.
The dad saw the little girl and said, "Don't be scared! There is nothing to be afraid of." He showed her the grill and explained how it worked. The little girl watched and soon she wasn't frightened anymore.
The family cooked the food and enjoyed the feast. They celebrated with a lot of laughter and fun. They ate the food and shared stories. At the end of the night, they were all very happy. They had the best celebration ever!
