Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Anna. She was three years old and very curious. One day, she was exploring her grandma's house when she found a beautiful stove. Anna was so excited, she ran over to her grandma to tell her all about it.
Grandma smiled and said, "Yes, that old stove is very special. It's been in the family for a very long time and it still works!"
Anna wanted to learn more about the stove, so Grandma showed her how it worked. She explained that you had to put wood inside and then light it with matches. Then, the stove would give off heat and cook food.
Anna was amazed. She thought the stove was so beautiful. She asked if she could turn the stove on, but Grandma said she was too young.
Anna was a bit disappointed, but then Grandma said that when she was a bit older, she could help out in the kitchen with the stove and make lots of delicious treats. Anna was so excited!
The two of them spent the rest of the day talking about the beautiful old stove and all the delicious food they could make with it. Anna loved visiting Grandma's house and hearing all the stories she had to tell.
