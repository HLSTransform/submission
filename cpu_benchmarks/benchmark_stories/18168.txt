Once upon a time, there was a nice lady who liked to wear a pretty apron. She lived in a small house with her cat, Tom. The nice lady loved to cook yummy food for her and Tom. One day, she wanted to make a big cake for them to eat.
The nice lady put on her apron and started to cook. She put all the things she needed on the table. She opened a big box and took out some eggs, milk, and sugar. She mixed them all together in a big bowl. Tom sat near her and watched as she made the cake.
When the cake was all done, she opened the oven and put the cake inside to bake. The nice lady was very tired, so she sat down in a chair and fell asleep. Tom saw the oven was still open and jumped in to see what was inside. The nice lady woke up and saw Tom was gone. She looked everywhere but could not find him. The nice lady was very sad and cried because Tom was gone forever.
