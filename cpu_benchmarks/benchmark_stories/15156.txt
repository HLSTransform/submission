Once there was a little boy. His name was Jack. He had a friendly Daddy who he loved very much. One day, Jack wanted to go to the park with Daddy, but Daddy said no, he had to stay at home and tidy his room.
At first Jack felt very sad, but then he remembered something his mommy said to him. She said that when you do something that you don't want to, you can act like a big boy and be brave and it will help you feel better.
So Jack said to Daddy, “Okay, I'll do it.” And Jack started cleaning and tidying his room.
When he was done, Jack felt good. He was so proud of himself. He thanked Daddy for helping him.
Daddy was so proud too. He smiled and said to Jack, “That's my brave boy! You should always be proud of yourself no matter what you do.”
Jack was so happy and he felt ashamed that he had been sad about having to do the chores. He knew it was something he must do and he learned a valuable lesson.
From that day on, Jack was proud of himself every time he did something brave and he thanked his daddy for helping him learn this important lesson.
