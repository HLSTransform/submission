Once upon a time, there was a thin bird named Tim. Tim loved to fly high in the sky. One day, he saw a big place with lots of big birds. It was an airport.
Tim wanted to meet the big birds. He flew down and said, "Hi, I am Tim. Can we be friends?" The big bird said, "Yes, we can be friends. I am Bob, the big airplane."
Tim and Bob played together all day. They seemed very happy. Tim liked his new friend at the airport. And they lived happily ever after.
