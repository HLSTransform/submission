Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max was very stubborn. He didn't like to listen to his owner, Sarah. One day, Max hurt his paw and Sarah took him to the vet. The vet took an x-ray of Max's paw to see what was wrong. The x-ray showed that Max had a little bone in his paw that shouldn't be there. 
The vet said they needed to do surgery to take the bone out. Max was scared, but Sarah told him it was okay and that she would be with him. The surgery went well and Max's paw was all better. Sarah gave Max lots of treats and love. From then on, Max learned to listen to Sarah and include her in his adventures.
