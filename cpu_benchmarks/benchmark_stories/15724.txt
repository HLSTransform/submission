Once upon a time, there was a girl called Tara. She was three years old and loved to balance on her toes.
One day, her mom gave her a bar of soap in the shape of a star. It was pale pink, Tara's favorite color.
Tara couldn't wait to play with it. She looked down at her feet and saw that she was standing on her toes. "I'm balancing!", she said out loud.
Her mom smiled and said, "You're doing a great job, Tara! Keep balancing and have fun with the soap".
Tara looked back up at her mom and replied, "Okay, Mommy. I will!"
She hopped around the room, balancing on one foot for a few seconds at a time, and painting the walls pink with the pale pink soap.
At the end of the day, Tara was so proud that she had balanced and made the whole room pink. She quickly ran over to her mom and said, "Look, Mommy! I balanced and made everything pink!"
Her mom looked around the room with a big smile on her face. "Wonderful job, Tara! You are so talented!"
