Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her toy cars. One day, she found a big box and decided to make a car out of it. She painted it red and put wheels on it. She was very happy with her new car.
But one day, Lily's friend came over to play. She wanted to ride in the car, but it was too small for both of them. Lily wanted to go fast, but it was uncomfortable for her friend. Lily realized that it was more important to share and be kind to her friend than to go fast in her car.
From that day on, Lily always made sure to share her toys and be kind to her friends. She learned that being a good friend was more important than going fast or having the best toys.
