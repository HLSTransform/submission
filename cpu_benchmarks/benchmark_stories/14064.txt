Once upon a time, there was a young lamb called Daisy. She was very playful and loved to explore the world around her. Every day, Daisy used to load up her sack with interesting things she found on her adventures.
One day, Daisy found something special. It was a charming little youth with fluffy white feather wings. She wondered if it could fly, and decided to load it up in her sack and find out.
So Daisy took to the sky with her new friend. The youth flew and soared through the clouds with a playful energy. Daisy and her new friend had a wonderful time, flying around together and playing in the wind. 
When it was time to go, Daisy loaded the youth back into her sack and said goodbye. She waved as the youth flew away. Daisy was ever so happy, and she took her sack of new things and flew happily home.
