Once upon a time, there was a gifted seal named Bob. He was the bravest seal on the beach. Every morning he liked to take a dip in the ocean. One day, Bob decided to take a longer swim and went deeper out to sea.
Bob went so far that he got lost. He tried to find his way back but he just couldn't. As he was swimming, he suddenly heard a voice.
"Hey Bob! You look lost," the voice said. Bob turned around and saw a dolphin. "Who are you?" Bob asked.
"I'm Rex, the dolphin" the dolphin said. "Let me help you find your way home. Follow me."
So Bob followed Rex and they soon reached the shore. Rex said goodbye and went back to the sea. Bob was happy and thanked Rex. He then went and soaked in the sun, happy to be home.
