John and his mom were climbing a mountain. They came to a very steep part of the mountain, and John's mom told him to trust the rope that was holding them up. But John didn't trust it. He said, "No! What if it breaks?"
His mom said that he should trust it, but John refused. He was being very rude.
John's mom said, "Trust is important. If you trust the rope, we will be able to get to the top of the mountain. There's nothing to worry about." John listened and he trusted the rope.
He grabbed onto the rope and started to climb. It was a long climb, but eventually, they made it to the top. John was proud of himself, and realized that sometimes it is important to trust.
