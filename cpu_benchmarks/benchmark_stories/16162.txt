Once upon a time, there was a car. It was wide and red. One day, it was ready to go! The car zoomed away! It went so fast, it made a noise like a bee. 
The car kept on zooming. It went around big buildings, over hills, and by a river. After a while, it stopped. 
The car was at a big store. Inside the store, there was a magazine. It was wide and colourful. The car driver wanted to take a look at it. So the driver went inside the store. 
When the driver opened the magazine, there were lots of pictures and stories to read. He flipped the pages back and forth. He looked at every story and every picture. 
When the driver was done with the magazine he said, "That was fun!" Then, he put the magazine down and the car zoomed away. 
And the car kept zooming away. The driver was happy and the car was happy, too. The end.
