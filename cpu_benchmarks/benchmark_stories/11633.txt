Once upon a time there was a wise old man. He had a special finger. Whenever he laughed, magic sparkles flew out of the finger and made everyone around him happy.
One day a little girl was walking by and saw the sparkles. She laughed and asked the old man if she could try it. He smiled and said yes. She held her finger out and when she laughed, sparkles flew out of her finger too.
The wise old man gave the little girl a big hug and told her that if she shared her laughter with everyone, it would make the world a happier place. She smiled and said she would do her best.
The little girl has kept the old man's lesson close to her heart and laughs often, sharing the special sparkles of happiness with all her friends.
