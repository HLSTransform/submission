Sara and Ben were twins who liked to play on the beach. They made sand castles and dug holes and collected shells. One day, they saw a big boat with a flag and many people on it. They wondered who they were and what they were doing.
"Maybe they are pirates," Ben said. "Maybe they have treasure and swords and parrots."
"Maybe they are kings and queens," Sara said. "Maybe they have crowns and jewels and dresses."
They decided to have a race to see who could get closer to the boat. They ran along the shore, dodging the waves and the rocks. Sara was faster and reached a point where she could see the boat clearly. She stopped and gasped.
"Ben, look!" she shouted. "The boat is sinking!"
Ben caught up with her and saw that she was right. The boat was tilting and water was pouring in. The people on the boat were screaming and jumping into the sea. Some of them had life jackets, but some of them did not.
"What should we do?" Ben asked. "Should we help them?"
Sara nodded. She saw a big stick on the sand and picked it up. She waved it in the air and shouted to the people in the water.
"Over here! Over here! We can help you!"
Some of the people saw her and swam towards her. Sara and Ben helped them get out of the water and onto the sand. They were wet and cold and scared, but they were grateful to the twins.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you," they said. "You saved our lives."
They told Sara and Ben that they were not pirates or kings and queens, but tourists who had rented the boat for a day. They had been wealthy and happy, but the boat had hit a rock and started to sink. They had lost everything they had brought with them, except for their passports and wallets.
"We are so lucky that you were here," they said. "You are very brave and kind."
Sara and Ben felt sorry for them, but also proud of themselves. They had won the race, but they had also done something good. They hugged each other and smiled.
"We are lucky too," they said. "We have each other."
