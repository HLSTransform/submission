Once upon a time there was a dark goat. It lived in a forest far away. One night, the dark goat went to sleep on a big, green hill.
Suddenly, a wolf came out of the shadows. He had a big sack in his mouth. The wolf growled and opened the sack. He wanted to put the dark goat in the sack.
The dark goat was so scared! He ran away as fast as he could. The wolf chased the dark goat, but the dark goat was too fast.
The dark goat ran until he reached his home. The sack was far behind. The dark goat was happy and safe!
