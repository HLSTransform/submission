Sara was lonely. She had no friends to play with at the park. She saw a big dog with a red ball. She wanted to pet the dog and throw the ball. But she was afraid. The dog might bite her or bark at her.
She saw a boy near the dog. He was smiling and talking to the dog. He looked happy. Sara walked to the boy and said, "Hi, I am Sara. What is your name?"
The boy looked at Sara and said, "Hi, I am Ben. This is my dog, Rex. He is very friendly. Do you want to play with us?"
Sara nodded. She liked Ben and Rex. Ben explained, "Rex likes to fetch the ball. You can throw it and he will run and bring it back. He will not bite you or bark at you. He likes to make new friends."
Sara smiled. She took the ball and threw it. Rex ran after it and brought it back. He wagged his tail and licked Sara's hand. Sara laughed. She petted Rex and said, "You are a good dog, Rex. I like you."
Ben and Sara played with Rex for a long time. They had fun. They were not lonely anymore. They became friends.
