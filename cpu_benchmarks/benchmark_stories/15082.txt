Jay had been asking for soup for days, but his mom always repeated the same answer, "No Jay, we don't have soup." 
Finally, his mom caved and said, "Ok, I will make some soup."
Jay was so excited he jumped around in circles. 
But then as she was cooking the soup, Jay heard a noise coming from the cupboard. 
He asked his mom, "What was that noise?" 
His mom replied, "It's just a reliable friend of mine who hides in the cupboard sometimes."
Jay was curious and wanted to see this "reliable friend". But his mom said, "No, you can't see my reliable friend. Now, come help me with the soup."
Jay was a bit disappointed, but he helped his mom prepare the soup. Finally, it was ready, and it was the most delicious soup Jay had ever tasted! 
Jay was so lucky to have a mom that was so reliable and made the best soup ever!
