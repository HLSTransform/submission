Once upon a time, there was a fancy penguin. He seemed so happy and he liked to play all day. One day, he went for a walk and he saw something special. It seemed like a party - there were lots of balloons and people dressed up fancy. He felt so excited. Suddenly, he saw a huge cake! He got very close to have a better look. He noticed that the cake was so big, he could fit inside it - so he did! Everyone cheered loudly when he got inside the cake. So the fancy penguin enjoyed the party and it seemed like he had lots of fun. The End.
