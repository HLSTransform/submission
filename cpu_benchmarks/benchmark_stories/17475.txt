Lila and Ben are twins. They like to play with toys. They have a big box of toys in their room. But they always want the same toy. They fight a lot.
One day, Mom comes home with a big bag. She says she has news for them. She has a surprise in the bag. Lila and Ben are excited. They run to Mom and hug her.
Mom opens the bag and takes out two toys. They are twisty toys. They can twist them into different shapes and colors. They look fun. Mom says they are cheap toys. She got them from the store for a good price.
Lila and Ben are happy. They each take a twisty toy. They say thank you to Mom. They go to their room to play with their new toys.
They twist their toys into animals, flowers, cars, and stars. They show each other their creations. They laugh and smile. They do not fight. They share their toys. They have fun. Mom is glad. She watches them from the door. She thinks they are good twins. She loves them.
