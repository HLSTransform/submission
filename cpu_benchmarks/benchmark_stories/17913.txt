Billy had a drum. He liked to play it. He liked the way it made him feel happy and he liked to drum along to his favourite songs.
One day, Billy's dad was feeling grumpy. He was tired and frustrated. He asked Billy to put away his drum, but Billy didn't want to. He wanted to keep playing his drum.
Billy's dad got cross and told him to remember to put the drum away when he was done playing. Billy nodded, but he didn't think he could remember.
Billy tried his best and soon he did remember. He put away the drum and tried to make his dad happy. His dad's grumpy face disappeared and a smile appeared.
Billy was glad he could make his dad happy, and he was so proud that he remembered. He was looking forward to playing his drum again soon.
