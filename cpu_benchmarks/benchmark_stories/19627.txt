Once there was a little girl, who was very hungry. She had not eaten anything all day. She looked around and saw a daisy in a nearby field and decided she would pick it.
So she skipped over to the field and wandered around, picking the daisy carefully. She plucked off each petal one by one. She grabbed a few more daisies, enjoying the feeling of their soft petals in her hands.
The little girl was so hungry, so she decided to part with the daisies and eat them. She took the petals off each daisy and chewed them up. They were sweet and tasted so good. 
The little girl was no longer hungry. She was so happy! She smiled and looked at the daisy field one last time before heading home.
