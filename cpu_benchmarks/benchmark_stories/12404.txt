One day, a little girl named Lucy saw a zebra in a field. She watched it for a long time and wanted to touch it. Lucy thought that its fur looked soft, but her mom said that it would be too rough. 
Lucy asked her mom, "Can I touch it, please?"
Her mom said, "No, Lucy. It is too rough. I do not want you to get hurt." 
The zebra trotted away and Lucy watched it go. Even though she couldn't touch it, she was happy just to have seen the zebra. She had wanted to see one for a long time, and now she finally did.
