Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, Benny went to play in the forest. While he was playing, he saw a big rock. Benny climbed on top of the rock and jumped off. But when he landed, he hurt his body.
Benny's mom came running when she heard him cry. She covered Benny with a blanket and hugged him. She told him that he should be more alert when he plays. Benny felt better and promised to be more careful next time.
The moral of the story is that we should always be alert and careful when we play, so we don't hurt our body. And if we do get hurt, we should tell our parents so they can help us and cover us with a blanket.
