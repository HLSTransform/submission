Once upon a time, there was a boy named Max. Max loved to play with clay. He would make all sorts of things with it like balls and animals. Max's mom would always prepare a clean space for him to play with his clay. 
One day, Max's friend came over to play. His friend also loved to play with clay. Max's mom prepared another clean space for his friend to play. Max and his friend had so much fun playing with the clay. They made a big castle together. 
After they were done playing, Max's mom prepared a clean-up station for them to clean their hands. They washed their hands and said goodbye to each other. Max was happy that he got to play with his friend and his clay in a clean space.
