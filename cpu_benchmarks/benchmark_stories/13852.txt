One day, a friendly dog named Spot went for a walk. He saw a big box under a tree. Spot thought, "This may be a surprise for me!" He wagged his tail and ran to the box. 
Spot pushed the box with his nose. It moved a little. He heard a voice say, "Hey, who is pushing my house?" A small cat came out of the box. The cat said, "I'm Kitty, and this is my home. Do you want to be friends?"
Spot was happy to have a new friend. He and Kitty played all day. They learned to value each other's company. The surprise under the tree was not a toy, but a new friend. Spot and Kitty were best friends from that day on.
