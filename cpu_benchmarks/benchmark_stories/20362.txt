Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big bush with red berries. They run to the bush and start to pick the berries.
"These berries are mine!" Tom says. He puts some berries in his pocket.
"No, they are mine!" Sam says. He grabs some berries from Tom's hand.
Tom and Sam quarrel. They pull and push each other. They shout and cry. They do not share the berries.
A lady walks by. She has a dog. The dog is deaf. He cannot hear Tom and Sam. He smells the berries. He likes berries. He runs to the bush and eats the berries.
Tom and Sam stop quarreling. They look at the dog. The dog is happy. He wags his tail. He licks his mouth.
Tom and Sam feel silly. They wasted the berries. They say sorry to each other. They hug and make up. They play with the dog. They forget about the berries. They are friends again.
