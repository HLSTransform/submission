Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bake cookies with her mom in the kitchen. One day, Lily's mom asked her to put the cookie dough in the oven. Lily was scared because she didn't know how to use the oven. 
"Don't worry, Lily," said her mom. "I will show you how to use the oven. You can do it!"
Lily listened carefully to her mom's instructions and put the cookie dough in the oven. She waited patiently for the cookies to be ready. Finally, the timer went off and the cookies were done! Lily was so happy that she succeeded in using the oven all by herself.
The moral of the story is that if you listen carefully and try your best, you can succeed in anything you want to do.
