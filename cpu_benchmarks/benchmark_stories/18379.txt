Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toy train. The train had a big engine that went "Choo Choo!" Tim played with his train every day.
One day, Tim noticed that his train was not moving. He looked at the engine and saw that it was dirty. Tim knew that he needed to clean the engine so his train could go "Choo Choo!" again.
Tim took a cloth and wiped the engine clean. When he was done, he put the engine back on the train. The train started to move and went "Choo Choo!" Tim was very happy and played with his train all day long.
