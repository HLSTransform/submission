Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Jenny. Every day, she liked to go to the beach and watch the fishermen. Jenny was very enthusiastic about everything the fishermen did and she often wanted to join in. 
One day, Jenny asked the fishermen if she could come out with them on their boat. “No,” the fishermen said. “You have to sit and watch from the beach.” Jenny was sad.
Just then, her mother came to the beach, and Jenny told her what the fishermen had said. “That’s OK,” her mother said. “If you want to do something, you can sit on the beach and help the fishermen spot the fish.”
Jenny was excited and she immediately started to search the water. It was hard work, but she kept trying and very soon she could spot the fish. The fishermen were pleasantly surprised by how good Jenny was.
The fishermen thanked Jenny and told her that it’s important to never give up. This story teaches us that hard work, determination and enthusiasm are the keys to success.
