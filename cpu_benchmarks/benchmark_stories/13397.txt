Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the pool. He would jump in and splash around with his friends. One day, Timmy's mom told him not to go in the pool because she had to go to the store. Timmy didn't listen and went in the pool anyways.
While Timmy was playing, he accidentally hit his chest on the side of the pool. It hurt really bad, but he didn't tell anyone. When his mom came back from the store, she saw that Timmy was hurt and asked him what happened. Timmy was ashamed and didn't want to tell his mom that he disobeyed her.
Unfortunately, Timmy's chest hurt more and more as the days went by. His mom took him to the doctor and they found out that Timmy had broken a rib. Timmy felt even more ashamed because he knew he shouldn't have gone in the pool. From then on, Timmy always listened to his mom and never disobeyed her again.
