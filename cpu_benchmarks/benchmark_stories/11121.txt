Once upon a time, there was a barber who had a little shop. The barber was very good at cutting hair. One day, a man came into the shop to get his hair cut. The barber set to work, cutting the man's hair very carefully.
The man wanted his hair to look very clear and nice. The barber used his scissors and comb to make the man's hair look just right. The man was very happy with his haircut. The barber was happy too, because he had done a good job.
The barber's shop became very popular. People came from far away to get their hair cut by the barber. The barber set to work every day, making everyone's hair look clear and nice. And they all lived happily ever after.
