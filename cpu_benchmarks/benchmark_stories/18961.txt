Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a light blue dress that she loved to wear. One day, she went to the park with her mom. Lily saw her friend, Tom, playing with a ball.
"Hi Tom!" said Lily. "Can I play with you?"
"Sure, Lily!" Tom said with a big smile. They played and laughed together. But then, the ball rolled under a big tree. Lily tried to get the ball, but she started to worry.
"Tom, I can't reach the ball! What do we do?"
Tom thought for a moment and said, "Let's kneel down and try to get it." So, they both kneeled down and reached for the ball. With a little bit of effort, they got the ball back.
Lily and Tom were very happy. They played with the ball until the sun went down. And from that day on, they knew that they could solve any problem together.
