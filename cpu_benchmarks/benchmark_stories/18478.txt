Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing outside with his toys. One day, Timmy was playing with his marbles when he accidentally scattered them all over the ground. 
Timmy tried to pick up his marbles but then he saw something shiny. It was a steel coin! Timmy was so happy to find it. He put it in his pocket and continued playing. 
Later that day, Timmy's friend came over and asked to play with his marbles. Timmy didn't want to share because he was being selfish with his toys. But then he remembered how happy he was when he found the steel coin. So, he decided to share his marbles with his friend. 
From that day on, Timmy learned that sharing was more important than being selfish and he always remembered to pick up his toys so they wouldn't scatter everywhere.
