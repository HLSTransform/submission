Once upon a time there was a young boy named Jack. He wanted to go to sleep, so he grabbed his favorite blanket, went in his bedroom, and began to tie his blanket tightly around his body.
He asked his mom, "Mommy, why do I have to tie my blanket like this?"  
His mom smiled and said, "Because when you tie your blanket like this, it keeps you nice and warm. That way you can have sweet dreams and be happy".
Jack was satisfied with his mom's answer, and a big smile spread across his face. 
He tightened the blanket onefinal time, and the knot kept it secured. He was happy, snuggled up in his cozy blanket. He soon drifted off to sleep and had the most wonderful dreams.
