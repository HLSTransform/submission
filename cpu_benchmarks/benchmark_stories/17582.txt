Lily wanted to play with her mom's necklace. It was shiny and pretty and had many colors. Mom said it was expensive and she should not touch it. But Lily did not listen. She waited until mom was busy and took the necklace from the drawer.
She put it around her neck and looked in the mirror. She felt like a princess. She smiled and made a pose. Then she heard a snap. The necklace broke and the beads fell on the floor. Lily was scared and sad. She did not know what to do.
Mom heard the noise and came to see. She saw the broken necklace and the beads. She saw Lily with a guilty face. She was angry and said, "Lily, what did you do? This was my expensive necklace. You should not have played with it. You are very naughty."
Lily felt bad and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I just wanted to be pretty like you. I did not mean to break it. Please don't be mad at me."
Mom sighed and said, "Lily, you are pretty without the necklace. You don't need expensive things to be pretty. You need to be good and listen to me. And you need to be careful with other people's things. Do you understand?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, mom. I understand. I'm sorry. I love you."
Mom hugged Lily and said, "I love you too. But you have to help me pick up the beads and fix the necklace. And you have to promise me not to touch it again."
Lily agreed and said, "I promise, mom. I will help you and I will not touch it again."
They picked up the beads and fixed the necklace. Mom put it back in the drawer and locked it. Lily learned her lesson and never played with mom's expensive necklace again.
