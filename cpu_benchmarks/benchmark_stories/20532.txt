A thin girl was in the park. She had a tasty snack in her hand. She opened the snack and began to chew. She smiled while she chewed. She was enjoying her snack very much.
The girl finished her snack and put it away. She kept walking through the park. She saw some pretty flowers, so she stopped to take a closer look. She saw some tall trees, so she stopped to look up.
The girl was having a good time in the park. She looked around and spotted a bird on a branch. The bird was eating a worm. The girl watched the bird as it chewed its snack.
  
The girl smiled and continued walking. She was making a happy memory in the park.
