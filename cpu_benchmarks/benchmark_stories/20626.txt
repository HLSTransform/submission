Once upon a time, there was a furry bag. The bag was so happy, it liked to race! On one sunny day, the bag raced down a hill. It was so fast and it felt so good. The bag raced around trees, over rocks and around a big pond. 
Suddenly, it spotted a 3 year old child. The child was so curious and excited. He wanted to join in and race with the furry bag! 
The child and the bag raced around the pond several times. The child was laughing and having so much fun. They raced faster and faster until they were dizzy. 
Finally the race was over. The child and the furry bag were exhausted and lay down in the warm sunshine. They were both happy and content.
