Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the winter. One day, she went outside to play in the snow. She saw some ice on the ground and she wanted to touch it. She stumbled and fell down. 
"Are you okay?" asked her mom.
"I'm okay," said Lily. "I just stumbled on the ice."
Lily's mom saw that Lily's cheeks were turning red from the cold. "Let's go inside and warm up," said her mom.
Lily and her mom went inside and drank hot chocolate. They talked about how fun it is to play outside in the winter, but also how important it is to be careful and not stumble on the ice.
