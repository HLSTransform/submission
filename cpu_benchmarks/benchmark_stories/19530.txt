Once upon a time, there was a fierce tiger who lived in the jungle. He was a beautiful tiger, with a big neck and shiny fur.
One day, a man came to the jungle and saw the fierce tiger. He taught the tiger some new tricks and the tiger was happy. They became very good friends.
The man taught the tiger to climb up trees, and to help the other animals in the jungle. The tiger loved to learn new things, and he would often stick his big neck out of the trees when the man would come back to the jungle to teach him something new.
The tiger followed all the tricks that the man taught him, and all of the animals in the jungle were happy to have the tiger around. He was a fiercely loyal friend, and he loved helping out his new friends. 
The man and the tiger were the best of friends, and he would often take him on adventures through the jungle to show him all the wonderful things that the jungle had to offer. The tiger was really happy, and he never wanted to leave the jungle ever again!
