Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat cookies, especially the ones her mom made. One day, Lily's mom told her they were going to the store to buy some special ingredients to make the most delicious cookies ever. 
Lily was excited to go to the store, but she looked up at the sky and saw the moon. It was big and bright, and Lily wished she could have a bite of it. Her mom smiled and said, "Maybe one day we can buy you a moon-shaped cookie." 
At the store, Lily helped her mom find all the ingredients they needed. She saw some moon-shaped cookies on the shelf, but they didn't look very delicious. Her mom said, "Don't worry, we'll make our own and they'll be even better." 
When they got home, Lily and her mom started baking. They mixed the ingredients and put them in the oven. As they waited, Lily looked up at the moon again. She smiled and thought about how much she loved her mom's cookies. When the cookies were done, they were the most delicious cookies Lily had ever tasted. She ate them all up and went to bed with a happy tummy.
