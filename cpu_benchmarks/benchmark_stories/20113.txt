Tom and Lily were playing with a big tube in the garden. The tube was white and had a red cap. They liked to crawl inside the tube and pretend it was a spaceship or a tunnel.
"Let's go to the moon!" Tom said, putting the cap on one end of the tube.
"OK!" Lily said, following him inside. They made noises like rockets and stars.
But they did not know that the tube was not a toy. It was a special tube that their dad used for his work. The tube had a button that could make things shrink or grow.
When Tom and Lily were inside, the button got pressed by a rock. The tube started to make a loud sound and a bright light. Tom and Lily felt very scared and tried to get out.
"Help! Help!" they shouted. "We are stuck!"
Their dad heard them and ran to the garden. He saw the tube and realized what had happened. He tried to press the button again, but it was broken. He could not make the tube stop.
He looked inside the tube and saw Tom and Lily. They were very small, like ants. They looked at him with big eyes and cried.
"Dad! Dad! Save us!" they said.
But their dad could not hear them. He could not reach them. He could not help them.
He felt very sad and sorry. He had lost his children. They had shrunk in the tube.
