Once upon a time, there lived a little bunny. Every day, the bunny went outside to spread some happiness.
One afternoon, the bunny hopped up onto a small log. "What are you doing?" asked a friendly snake, poking her head out from underneath the log.
"I'm spreading happiness!" the bunny replied. "Would you like to help me?"
The snake thought for a moment. Then, she gave a little nod.
Together, the bunny and the snake spread more happiness. They hopped and slithered all around the woods, bringing smiles to the forest creatures.
Finally, the bunny hopped right up onto the snake's neck. "You have a small neck," he said, "But I think we can still spread a little bit of happiness!"
The snake smiled. She ducked down low, and the bunny spread the happiness from her neck.
And that is how the bunny and the snake spread a little bit of happiness all around the woods.
