Once upon a time, there was a brave mouse living in a big house.
Every day, the brave mouse would explore the house looking for adventures. One day, he heard a noise coming from the kitchen. He had to be brave and go see what was happening.
When he got to the kitchen, he saw a big, furry cat. The cat was staring at something on the floor - it was a yummy cheese! The brave mouse was getting closer, when suddenly the cat threw the cheese across the room!
The brave mouse was so fast that he was able to catch the cheese before it hit the ground. The cat was very surprised, and decided to leave the brave mouse alone and let him keep the cheese.
The brave mouse was very happy and he enjoyed his yummy cheese. He was so brave and he definitely deserved the reward!
