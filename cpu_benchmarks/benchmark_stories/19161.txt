Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was an obedient child who always listened to his mom and dad. One day, Tim's mom asked him to help her with a special job. She wanted to make a pretty print on the wall.
"Tim, can you help me measure the wall?" asked Mom. Tim nodded and said, "Yes, Mom!" Tim and his mom used a long, long stick to measure the wall. They found out how big the print should be.
Mom started to paint the print on the wall. It was a big, happy sun. Tim watched and clapped his hands. When the print was done, Tim and his mom stood back and looked at the wall. They were so proud of their work. And Tim was happy to be an obedient helper to his mom.
