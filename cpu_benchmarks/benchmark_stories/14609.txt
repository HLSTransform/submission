Once upon a time there was a boy named Ben. He liked to spend time outside playing. One day he was walking in the woods and he saw something very special.
It was a big, open tree with a twisty trunk! He stopped and touched it. The bark was rough and wrinkly like skin. Ben thought it was so cool so he decided to go around it.
He walked around the trunk and as he got to the other side, he noticed something even cooler! There was an open hole with a lot of twigs and leaves around it. Ben got closer and peered inside.
He could see a nest! The nest was made of leaves and twigs and there were eggs inside it. It looked like a safe place for the baby birds to grow up. Ben was so excited he couldn't believe his eyes. 
He carefully stuck his hand inside and gently touched an egg. It was warm and he could feel it twist in his hand. Ben smiled and hopped away. He knew he had found something very special.
