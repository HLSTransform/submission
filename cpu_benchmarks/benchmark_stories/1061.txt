Once upon a time there was a little rabbit called Ted. Ted was always very careful whenever he went out for his adventure. One day, as he was hopping around, he saw a very yummy looking carrot. He said to himself "I must have a bite of this delicious carrot". So Ted hopped closer and took a big bite!
It was the yummiest carrot Ted had ever tasted, but something was different about this carrot. As it slipped down his throat, he felt a strange wetness. So Ted hopped over to a nearby pond to take a look. The pond was full of tasty carrot juices!
He quickly hopped back to the carrot patch and found that all the carrots had soaked up all the water from the pond! "Wow!" Ted said, "I'm so lucky I got here quick. I need to be careful next time!"
Ted hopped away with a full tummy, happy to have had such a great adventure. All thanks to that one special carrot!
