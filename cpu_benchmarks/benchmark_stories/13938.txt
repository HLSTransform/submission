One day, a little boy named Tim went to play near the water. He liked to throw stones in the water and watch the splash. Tim saw a frog near the water too. The frog was jumping and playing around. Tim wanted to play with the frog, so he went closer.
Tim did not know that the frog did not like to be bothered. He was ignorant about it. The frog saw Tim coming and decided to teach him a lesson. The frog jumped into the water and started to splash Tim with water. Tim got all wet, but he started to laugh.
Tim and the frog started to play together in the water. They splashed each other and had a lot of fun. Tim learned that sometimes, it is okay to be ignorant, because you can make new friends and learn new things.
