Once there was a friendly bunny who had a crystal. He liked to pull his crystal and watch it sparkle in the light. One day, the bunny was playing with his crystal and he accidentally pulled it too hard. The crystal broke into pieces and the bunny began to cry. He felt so sad and didn't know how to fix it.
Suddenly, he heard a noise that made him jump. It was a friendly fairy who had come to help the bunny. The fairy asked him what was wrong and the bunny told her about his broken crystal. Then the fairy waved her magic wand and the crystal was instantly mended. The bunny was so happy that he thanked the fair and hugged her tight.
