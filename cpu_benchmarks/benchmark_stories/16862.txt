Once upon a time, there was a big garage. It was a place where cars and trucks could sleep at night. One day, a big storm came and knocked down the garage. The cars and trucks were sad because they didn't have a place to sleep anymore. But then, a kind man came and he said he would restore the garage. The cars and trucks were happy again! 
The man worked hard to fix the garage. He used a hammer and nails and wood to make it strong again. The cars and trucks watched him work and they were excited to have their home back. When the man was finished, the garage looked even better than before! 
The cars and trucks were so grateful to the man for restoring their home. They decided to have a race to show him how much they appreciated his hard work. It was a very competitive race, but everyone had fun. In the end, the man was very happy to see the cars and trucks having fun in their restored garage.
