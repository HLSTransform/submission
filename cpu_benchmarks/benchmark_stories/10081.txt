Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in the living room. They have a big rug on the floor. The rug is soft and colorful. They have a lot of fun on the rug.
One day, their mom says, "It's time to bathe, kids. You are dirty and smelly. Come on, let's go to the bathroom."
Lily and Ben do not want to bathe. They want to play more. They say, "No, mom. We are not dirty. We are not smelly. We want to play on the rug."
Mom says, "Yes, you are. Look at your hands and feet. They are black and sticky. And look at your hair. It is messy and greasy. And you smell like a fat pig. You need to bathe, or you will get sick."
Lily and Ben do not like to be called fat pigs. They do not like to be sick. They say, "OK, mom. We will bathe. But can we bring our toys with us?"
Mom says, "Sure, you can. But only the ones that can get wet. Not the ones that have batteries or fur. And you have to wash them too."
Lily and Ben agree. They pick up their toys that can get wet. They have a rubber duck, a plastic boat, a sponge ball, and a soap bar. They follow mom to the bathroom. They fill the tub with water and bubbles. They put their toys in the tub. They take off their clothes and get in the tub. They splash and scrub and rinse and giggle. They have fun in the tub.
Mom says, "See, bathing is not so bad. It is fun and good for you. You are clean and fresh now. And you smell like flowers and fruits. You are my sweet and lovely twins."
Lily and Ben smile and hug mom. They say, "Thank you, mom. We love you. And we love bathing. Can we do it again tomorrow?"
