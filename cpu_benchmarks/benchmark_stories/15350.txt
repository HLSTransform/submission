Once upon a time there was a little girl named Eliza. She loved to play outside and she was very graceful. She had a red ball that she would bounce. Whenever she bounced it, Eliza would giggle with joy.
One day she decided to take her ball and bounce outside of the house. There was a big fence with a frame around it. Eliza thought it would be fun to bounce her red ball on that frame.
Eliza bounced her ball on the frame. It made a fun noise that she liked. She bounced the ball higher and higher each time. She was feeling so graceful and happy bouncing her ball on the frame.
Suddenly the ball fell down and rolled away. Eliza ran after it, but it had gone too far. She stood looking after it sadly, until she saw a bird with a bright red belly. She felt happy just looking at the bird, and she went back inside. She never found her red ball, but Eliza was still very happy.
