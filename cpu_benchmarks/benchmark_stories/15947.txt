Once upon a time, there was a big bear. The big bear lived in a big cave. One day, the big bear went outside to play. The big bear saw a little rabbit. The little rabbit said, "Hi big bear, can I have a hug?" The big bear said, "Yes, come here little rabbit!" 
The little rabbit gave the big bear a big hug. The big bear was very happy. Then, the little rabbit said, "Big bear, let's play tag!" The big bear said, "Okay, but I'm going to rush and try to catch you!" 
The little rabbit ran as fast as he could. The big bear chased after the little rabbit. They ran and ran until they were both very tired. Then, the big bear said, "That was so much fun, let's do it again tomorrow!" The little rabbit said, "Yes, let's do it again tomorrow!" And they went back to the big cave to rest.
