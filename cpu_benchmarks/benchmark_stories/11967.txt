Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mommy. She saw a pretty white butterfly flying around and wanted to catch it. She ran after it, but it was too fast for her. 
Suddenly, she saw a man in a black robe sitting on a bench. Her mommy told her that he was a judge. Lily didn't understand what that meant, but she saw that he had a gavel, which she thought was a toy hammer. 
She went up to the judge and showed him her butterfly net. He smiled and said, "You can catch that butterfly if you're quick enough!" Lily felt happy and ran off to try again. She finally caught the butterfly and showed it to the judge. He said, "Well done, little one!" and Lily felt proud of herself.
