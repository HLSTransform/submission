Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a big dragon. The dragon had big wings, and he could rise high in the sky. Every day, the dragon would fly and play with his friends, the birds.
One day, while the dragon was flying, he met a little bird who was scared. The little bird said, "Help me, big dragon! I can't rise like you. I want to fly high too." The big dragon felt sad for the little bird and wanted to help him.
So, the big dragon told the little bird, "Don't worry, little bird. I will help you rise high in the sky." The big dragon used his big wings to make a strong wind. The wind helped the little bird rise high in the sky. The little bird was so happy and said, "Thank you, big dragon! Now I can fly high like you!" The big dragon and the little bird became good friends, and they played together every day.
