Once upon a time there was an old lawyer. He was very smart and well liked in the town.
One day, the lawyer put a plan into action to help people in the village. He wanted to make sure everyone had what they needed. But things didn't go as planned.
The lawyer's plan caused a big fight in the village. Everyone was angry about it and wanted him to undo what he had done. But the lawyer refused. He said it was the law and he wouldn't change it.
Eventually, the villagers put together a plan to make the lawyer change his mind. They pooled all their resources and tried to convince him. But in the end nothing worked.
The villagers were angry and disappointed and the lawyer sadly went away. He had tried to do something good, but it only caused more trouble. His plan had a bad ending and it made everyone very sad.
