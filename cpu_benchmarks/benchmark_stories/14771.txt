Lily and Ben were poor. They did not have much food or toys or clothes. But they had each other and they loved to play and sing and dance. One day, they heard about a festival in the town. There would be music and games and food and prizes. Lily and Ben wanted to go, but they had no money.
They asked their mother if they could go. She smiled and hugged them. She said, "I have a surprise for you. I made some cookies and jam. You can sell them at the festival and earn some money. Then you can have fun and buy something you like."
Lily and Ben were happy. They thanked their mother and took the basket of cookies and jam. They walked to the town, holding hands. They saw many people and colors and sounds. They found a spot to set up their basket. They shouted, "Cookies and jam for sale! Only one coin each!"
Soon, many people came to buy their cookies and jam. They said they were delicious and sweet. Lily and Ben smiled and thanked them. They counted their coins. They had enough to buy some food and a balloon and a toy car. They were very happy.
They saw a man with a guitar. He was playing and singing a song. He looked sad and lonely. He had no coins in his hat. Lily and Ben felt sorry for him. They decided to give him some of their cookies and jam. They walked up to him and said, "Hello, sir. We like your song. We want to give you some cookies and jam. Please accept them."
The man looked surprised and touched. He smiled and said, "Thank you, children. You are very kind and generous. I accept your cookies and jam. They are very tasty. Can I play a song for you?"
Lily and Ben nodded and clapped. They sat down and listened to the man's song. It was a happy and funny song. They laughed and sang along. They felt warm and good inside. They had made a new friend. They had shared their cookies and jam. They had enjoyed the festival. They were not poor. They were rich in love.
