Once there was a gentle eye. It lived inside a box that was locked away. Every morning it opened up and looked around. It saw the sun beaming down and the birds singing in the trees. One day, a special key arrived. It was just the right size and shape to unlock the box. So the eye opened and out came a beautiful butterfly. The eye was amazed! It held the butterfly gently in its hands and watched it flutter away. 
The eye felt so happy that it never wanted to be locked away again. So it kept travelling, seeing wonderful new things. Everywhere it showed its gentle face, people welcomed it with open arms. They smiled and said they were happy to have the eye around. 
From then on, the eye was free to explore. And it never forgot the gentle touch of the butterfly that gave it the strength to be brave.
