Once there was a man who was very gifted. He owned a special motorcycle and was proud to display it to all his friends. His friends were also gifted and admired the motorcycle for its speed.
One day, the man was enjoying a ride on his motorcycle when something unexpected happened. He passed too close to another motorcyclist and suddenly, his motorcycle crashed. He was sad because he had been gifted with such a special motorcycle but it was now damaged beyond repair.
The man was upset but determined to buy another motorcycle. He started putting his money aside and soon he was ready to purchase a new motorcycle. But when he went to the store, he found out that the cost was too high and he had saved too little. He was very disappointed. 
The man was forced to walk home, without a motorcycle. He was sad and knew he had been unlucky. His gifted motorcycle was gone forever.
