Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to watch the ceiling. Every day, she liked to lie down on the soft floor and look up at the ceiling. She thought it was so much fun to watch the shapes, colors and lines that were on the ceiling.
The little girl noticed that sometimes the ceiling changed. It could be blue or white or even purple! She thought it was amazing to watch the ceiling change and she was never bored.
One day, the little girl decided to draw on the ceiling. She found a soft crayon and slowly made circles and lines on the ceiling. She was happy because now she could watch a special ceiling that she made herself.
The end.
