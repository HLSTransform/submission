Once upon a time, there was a woodcutter who had a very noisy axe. Every day, he would go to the forest to cut trees. But the noise of his axe would disturb the animals living in the forest. They would run away and hide.
One day, a little rabbit came to the woodcutter and said, "Please, Mr. Woodcutter, can you please use a quieter axe? Your noisy axe scares us and makes us run away."
The woodcutter felt bad and realized that he was causing trouble for the animals. So, he promised the rabbit that he would use a quieter axe from now on. The rabbit was very happy and thanked the woodcutter.
The woodcutter learned that being considerate of others is important. He bowed to the rabbit and promised to be more mindful of his actions in the future. From that day on, he used a quieter axe and the animals in the forest lived in peace.
