Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a girl named Sue. Sue was sad because her toys were dull. She wanted to play with something new and fun. One day, her mom told her she had a surprise for her. 
"Close your eyes, Sue," her mom said. Sue closed her eyes, and her mom put a present in her hands. Sue was so happy! She opened the present and found a new, colorful toy inside. 
Sue played with her new toy all day. She even called her friend, Tom, to come over and play with her. "Tom, come see my new toy!" Sue said on the phone. Tom came over, and they played together all day long. From that day on, Sue's days were never dull again.
