Once upon a time, there was a child. The child loved to spin and spin until they got dizzy. One day, the child spun too much and fell down. They were so dizzy that they couldn't stand up. 
A kind person saw the child and went to give them a hand. They helped the child stand up and asked if they were okay. The child smiled and said they were feeling better. 
The kind person gave the child a toy to play with and watched them happily play. The child was grateful for the toy and thanked the person. From then on, the child remembered to be careful when spinning around.
