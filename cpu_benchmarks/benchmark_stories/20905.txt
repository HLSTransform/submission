Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very stubborn. She wanted to rock in her hoop. All day long she tried, but the hoop wouldn't rock. No matter how hard she pushed it, the hoop never moved.
The little girl became sad and angry, but still she was determined. She wanted to make the hoop rock so badly that she refused to give up. She tried and tried for hours, until she was so tired she could barely stand.
Finally, in one last effort, the little girl pushed the hoop very hard. As she did, the hoop moved and started to rock! She was so excited, she shouted and clapped her hands.
From then on, the little girl and the hoop were best friends. Wherever she went, the hoop rocked along behind her.
