Sara and Tom were very hungry. They wanted to eat pizza. They asked Mom to order pizza for them. Mom said yes and called the pizza place. She told them what Sara and Tom liked.
Sara and Tom were very happy. They waited for the pizza to come. They played with their toys and watched TV. They saw a big cooler in the kitchen. They wondered what was inside. They opened the cooler. They saw ice and drinks and cake. They thought it was for them.
Sara and Tom took out the cake. They cut it with a knife. They ate some cake. It was very yummy. They drank some drinks. They felt very full. They closed the cooler. They went back to the living room.
Mom came back from the bathroom. She saw the pizza man at the door. She paid him and took the pizza. She smelled something sweet. She went to the kitchen. She saw the cooler. She opened it. She saw the cake. It was half eaten. She saw the drinks. They were empty. She was very angry.
She yelled at Sara and Tom. She told them they were very bad. She told them the cake and the drinks were for Dad's birthday. She told them they ruined the surprise. She told them they could not have any pizza. She sent them to their room. Sara and Tom cried. They wished they did not eat the cake and the drinks. They wished they waited for the pizza. They were very sorry.
