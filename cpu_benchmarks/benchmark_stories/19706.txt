Once there was a pupil. He was a 3 year old and quite curious. One day he decided to go exploring. He wondered if he could guess what he would find. As he walked, he noticed a smelly smell. He followed his nose and soon found a strange plant. He guessed it was a special kind of flower but he didn't know why it smelled so smelly. He decided to grab a few of the petals and take them back to show his friends. Later, the pupil showed his friends the resulting smelly petals. Everyone was surprised at the smelly smell the petals gave off! The pupil smiled, proud that he was able to guess what he'd found.
