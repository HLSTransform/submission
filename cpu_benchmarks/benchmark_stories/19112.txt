Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's friend Joey came over to play. Joey wanted to ride Timmy's bike, but he didn't have one of his own. Timmy said it was okay for Joey to borrow his bike.
Joey was so happy and rode the bike all around the yard. But then, Joey accidentally broke the bike's pedal. Timmy wasn't mad though, he knew it was just an accident. He told Joey it was okay and that he would fix it later.
Timmy's dad had some equipment in the garage that could fix the bike. He got the equipment and fixed the pedal. Timmy was happy to have his bike back in good shape. And even though Joey broke it, Timmy knew it was a good thing to share and borrow things with his friends. The end.
