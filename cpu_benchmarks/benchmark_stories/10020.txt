Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved Halloween and was very excited to go to the pumpkin patch with her family. They found a big pumpkin that was perfect for carving. But when they brought it home, they noticed it was filthy! So Lily's mom gave it a good wash.
Later that night, Lily's dad started to carve the pumpkin. He used a sharp knife to make a face, but accidentally pinched his finger! Ouch! Lily was worried, but her dad was okay. They finished carving the pumpkin and put it outside for everyone to see. It looked spooky and cool, and Lily was very proud. The end.
