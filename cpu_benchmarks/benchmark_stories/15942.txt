Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily was playing with her doll when she heard a loud noise outside. She looked out the window and saw a big, red fire truck.
Lily's mommy came into the room and said, "Lily, we need to be alert. There is a fire outside. We need to stay inside and drink some water."
Lily got her sippy cup and took a big drink of water. She asked her mommy, "Why is the fire truck here?" Her mommy replied, "There is a fire and the fire truck needs to put it out."
Lily watched out the window as the firefighters sprayed water on the fire. She was happy that the fire was gone and she could go outside to play again.
