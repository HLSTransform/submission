Lily was sad. She had a big cut on her knee from falling down. It hurt a lot and it was red and wet. Mommy put a band-aid on it and gave her a hug. She said, "Don't worry, Lily. Your cut will heal soon. You are very brave."
Lily wanted to feel better. She liked to sing and dance. She had a stage in her room, made of boxes and blankets. She had a microphone and a dress and a hat. She wanted to put on a show for Mommy and Daddy and her teddy bear.
She asked Mommy, "Can I sing and dance on my stage? Will it make my cut heal faster?" Mommy smiled and said, "Sure, Lily. You can sing and dance on your stage. It might not make your cut heal faster, but it will make you happy. And being happy is good for healing."
Lily was happy. She put on her dress and her hat and grabbed her microphone. She went to her stage and turned on the music. She sang her favorite song and danced with her teddy bear. She felt the pain in her knee go away. She looked at Mommy and Daddy and saw them clapping and cheering. She said, "Thank you for watching my show. I love you very much."
Mommy and Daddy hugged her and said, "We love you too, Lily. You are a wonderful singer and dancer. And your cut is looking much better. It is not so red and wet anymore. It is clear and dry. You are healing very well." Lily was proud and happy. She kissed her cut and said, "Goodbye, cut. Hello, stage."
