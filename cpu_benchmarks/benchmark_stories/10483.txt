George and his mom went to the store. They saw a sign saying there was a new film. 
George wanted to watch it, but mom said it had some harsh scenes. 
So they decided to go to the library instead. 
They looked around and found a fun book about animals. 
George was so excited! He said he wanted to go home and read it. 
Mom said they also needed to buy some food. 
So they went to the grocery store and bought some yummy apples. 
George and his mom went home, and George read his book until bedtime.
