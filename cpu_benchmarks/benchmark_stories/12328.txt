Once upon a time, there was a little puppy called Bob. Bob loved to zoom around the park. He loved to jump, run and play with the other animals. 
One day, Bob wanted to win a race. He asked his friend, a rabbit, if he wanted to race him. The rabbit said yes and also asked a bird to join them. 
Bob was determined to win the race. He zoomed around the track, with the rabbit and the bird close behind him. Everytime the rabbit and the bird tried to pass him, he moved faster and left them behind. 
Finally, Bob was so close to victory. He could feel it in the warm breeze. But then, out of nowhere, a squirrel came out of its hole and crossed the track in front of Bob. Bob ran straight into the squirrel and fell to the ground. 
The bird and the rabbit flew and hopped past Bob, leaving him in the dust. Bob was so sad. He knew he had lost and he could not get back up. The end.
