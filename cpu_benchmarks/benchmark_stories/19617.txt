Once there was a little girl called Katy. Katy went for a walk and she discovered something delicious in the garden. It was a dessert! 
Katy was so happy. She knew she must share the dessert with her family. She took it into the house, and her family said it was so yummy! 
Katy's family asked, "What did you find in the garden?" 
She said, "A harmless dessert."
Mum said, "That was very nice of you, to share the dessert with us".
At the end, they all enjoyed the yummy dessert that Katy had discovered.
