Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big house with a large porch. One day, she was sitting on the porch with her mommy.
Lily said, "Mommy, I'm thirsty. Can I have some juice please?"
Mommy said, "Sure, Lily. I'll get you some juice."
As they were waiting for the juice, Lily saw her neighbor's dog running around. She said, "Mommy, I don't like that dog. He's always barking and I can't play outside."
Mommy replied, "I know, Lily. But we can't complain about the dog. He's just doing what dogs do."
Lily thought about it for a moment and said, "Okay, mommy. But can we play inside instead?"
