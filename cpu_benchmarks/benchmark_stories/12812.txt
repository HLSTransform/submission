Lily was a 3 year old girl who liked to play chess. Whenever she wanted to play she always asked her big sister Judy. Judy was very bossy and never answered her straight away, so Lily had to wait patiently.
One day, Lily ran up to Judy with a Chess game in her hands and said, "Please, can we play Chess?" Judy replied, "No, we can't, I'm too busy".
Lily said, "But I really want to play. Please, can we play?" "No," said Judy.
Lily huffed and said, "Please, can we please play?" Judy looked at Lily and thought for a moment and said, "Okay, you can play, but only for a few minutes."
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you Judy!" and they started playing Chess right away. Lily was so excited and was happy that Judy had answered her.
