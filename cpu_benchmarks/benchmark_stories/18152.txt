Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was an independent girl who liked to do things by herself. Lily loved to play with her toys and wear her favorite top with a big, yellow sun on it.
One day, Lily wanted to reach a toy on a high shelf. She tried to climb but it was too high for her. She said, "Please, can someone help me?" Her mommy heard her and came to help. Mommy got the toy for her and said, "Lily, you are a good girl for asking for help when you need it."
From that day on, Lily knew that being independent was good, but asking for help when needed was important too. She always remembered to say "please" when she needed help. And she always wore her favorite top with the big, yellow sun, because it reminded her of the warm love her mommy gave her.
