Once upon a time, there was a girl named Millie. Millie was very thoughtful and kind. She loved spending time near the sea because the sound of the waves made her feel happy and peaceful.
One day, Millie was walking along the beach when she heard a voice. The voice was coming from a dolphin who was swimming in the sea. The dolphin asked Millie if she wanted to be friends. Millie was so excited and very joyful.
But then the dolphin said that he wanted to trick Millie instead of being friends. He said that he wanted Millieâ€™s help to get some of the fish from the sea. Millie was sad and confused about this. She spoke kindly to the dolphin and told him she wanted to be friends, not to trick the fish.
The dolphin thought about what Millie said and he realized that she was kind and thoughtful. He decided that he wanted to be friends with Millie, and so he stopped his plans to trick the fish. 
Millie and the dolphin said goodbye and she went on her way. Millie was so happy that the dolphin was now her friend and even more thankful for her kind and thoughtful words.
