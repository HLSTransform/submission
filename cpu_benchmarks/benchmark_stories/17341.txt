Anna was restless. She did not want to nap. She wanted to play with her toys and run around the house. But Mommy said she had to nap or she would be grumpy later.
"Please, Mommy, no nap!" Anna said, trying to resist Mommy's arms.
"Sorry, Anna, you need to nap. It's good for you. You can play after you wake up," Mommy said, carrying Anna to her bed.
Anna pouted and kicked. She did not like her bed. It was boring and soft. She wanted to be awake and loud. She saw a pear on the nightstand. She liked pears. They were sweet and juicy.
"Can I have the pear, Mommy?" Anna asked, hoping to get out of napping.
"No, Anna, the pear is for later. You can have it after you nap. Now close your eyes and sleep," Mommy said, tucking Anna in.
Anna frowned. She did not want to sleep. She wanted the pear. She reached for the pear when Mommy left the room. She grabbed it and bit into it. It was yummy. She smiled and ate more.
But then she heard Mommy coming back. She hid the pear under her pillow. She pretended to sleep. She hoped Mommy would not see the pear.
Mommy opened the door and looked at Anna. She saw the juice on Anna's mouth and the lump under her pillow. She knew Anna had the pear.
"Anna, did you eat the pear?" Mommy asked, lifting the pillow.
Anna opened her eyes and saw Mommy holding the pear. She felt guilty. She knew she was naughty.
"Sorry, Mommy," Anna said, looking down.
Mommy sighed. She was not happy. She took the pear and put it in the trash.
"Anna, you should not eat the pear. You should nap. Now you have no pear and no nap. How do you feel?" Mommy asked.
Anna felt bad. She felt tired and hungry. She wished she had napped and saved the pear.
"Sad, Mommy," Anna said, sniffling.
Mommy hugged Anna. She was not angry. She loved Anna.
"It's okay, Anna. I forgive you. But next time, listen to Mommy, okay? Napping and eating at the right time are important. They make you healthy and happy. Do you understand?" Mommy asked.
Anna nodded. She understood. She wanted to be healthy and happy.
"Okay, Mommy. I will listen to you. I will nap and eat at the right time. I love you, Mommy," Anna said.
"I love you too, Anna. Now let's try to nap again. Maybe you will have a nice dream about pears," Mommy said, kissing Anna's forehead.
Anna closed her eyes and cuddled with Mommy. She felt sleepy and calm. She napped and dreamed about pears.
