There was a little girl named Stella. She loved to play dress up. She found an old velvet box in her attic. Inside the box was an ugly bow. It was bright red and had sparkles on it. 
The little girl put on the bow and loved it. She ran around her house wearing it and showing it to everyone. Her aunt and uncle thought the bow was very special.
Stella went to a party with the bow. All of the kids said how wonderful it was. People kept asking her where she got the bow and Stella said her attic. 
The next day, Stella found the box again and put the bow back in it. She promised to take it out again the next day and play dress up. 
The end!
