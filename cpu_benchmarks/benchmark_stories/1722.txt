Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited to go on a trip with her family. They were going to stay in a hotel by the beach. 
When they arrived at the hotel, Lily noticed that her little brother, Max, looked very pale. She asked him if he was feeling okay. Max said he didn't feel well and wanted to go home. 
Lily's parents were worried and didn't know what to do. They decided to take Max to the doctor. The doctor said Max had a fever and needed to rest. 
Lily was sad that they couldn't stay in the hotel and play on the beach, but she was happy that Max would feel better soon. She told him, "Don't worry Max, we'll come back to the hotel another time when you feel better and we'll have lots of fun!"
