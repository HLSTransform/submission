Once upon a time, there was a very little boy. He had a button on his shirt and he liked it very much. One day, the little boy wanted to take a bath. He hopped into the tub and the water was so warm that he smiled. He grabbed the special soap and shampoo and washed himself in the tub. Then he washed his hair until it was all clean. 
When the little boy was finished with his bath, he realized that he had lost his button! He hung his head low and thought to himself, "Oh no! I lost my button!" 
The little boy went around the house asking if anyone had seen it, but no one had. He was feeling very sorry and his head was so low that it almost touched his toes. 
Suddenly, his mom said, "I have a surprise for you!" She was holding the button in her hand and gave it to the little boy. He was filled with joy! He thanked his mom and said, "I'm so sorry I lost it!" His mom smiled and said, "No worries, but remember to take better care of it!" The little boy hugged his mom and promised he would never lose the button again. 
The little boy was so happy to have his button back. He love it and kept it safe forever!
