Once there was a little boy and he really liked to swim. One day, he saw a big piece of cardboard and said "That looks like so much fun!" 
He grabbed the cardboard and ran to the pool. He jumped in the pool and started swimming with the cardboard. It was the best time ever!
As he swam around, he remembered his mom had made him some tasty snacks. He decided to take a break, so he got out of the pool and went to eat.
When he was done, he put the cardboard back in the pool and jumped in. He swam around and around, having so much fun.
At the end, he was so tired but so happy. He smiled and said, "That was the best swim ever!"
