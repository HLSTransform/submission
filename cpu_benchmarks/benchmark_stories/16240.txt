Once there was a brave little girl called Lucy. She always wore her favourite pink dress. One day, Lucy was walking in the park, when she noticed something interesting - a vine had grown over one of the park benches.
The vine was big and green and it was growing very quickly! Lucy was excited and ran over to take a closer look. She touched her fingers to the vine, and felt it vibrate with new life.
"Can I have a go?" she said, looking up at her mum.
Mum smiled, and said "Yes, you can have a go!"
So Lucy ran as fast as she could and threw herself onto the vine. The vine began to move - faster and faster, until it felt like flying! Lucy laughed and laughed, until it was time to go home.
Lucy wanted to come back and experience the vine again, so she promised herself that she would come back soon and try it again. 
Everyday Lucy would come back to the park, to see how the new vine was growing. She would prove how brave she was by running onto the vine and speeding around the park!
