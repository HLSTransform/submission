Anna and Ben were very excited. It was Thanksgiving and they wanted to help Mom and Dad decorate the house. They had a big turkey in the oven and some furry hats and scarves to wear.
"Can we make some pictures for the wall?" Anna asked Mom.
"Sure, you can use these crayons and paper," Mom said. "But be careful not to make a mess."
Anna and Ben took the crayons and paper and went to the living room. They drew some turkeys, some pumpkins, some leaves and some hearts. They used many colors and made their pictures very pretty.
"Look, Mom, we made some pictures for the wall!" Ben said, holding up his paper.
"Wow, they are very nice!" Mom said. "Let's hang them up with some tape."
Mom helped Anna and Ben hang their pictures on the wall. They looked at their work and smiled.
"We decorated the house!" Anna said.
"Yes, we did!" Ben said.
They hugged each other and ran to the kitchen to see the turkey. It smelled very good and they could not wait to eat it. They were very happy and thankful.
