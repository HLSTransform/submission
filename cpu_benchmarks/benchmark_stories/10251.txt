Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and pretend he was a superhero. One day, Timmy's friend Joey came over to play. They decided to play superheroes together.
Timmy pretended he had super strength and Joey pretended he could fly. They were having so much fun until Joey accidentally knocked over Timmy's tower of blocks. Timmy got upset and told Joey to leave.
Joey felt bad and wanted to make things right. He decided to stand up and help Timmy rebuild his tower of blocks. Timmy was happy that Joey cleared up the mess and they became friends again. From that day on, they always played superheroes together and never had another argument. The end.
