Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a leaf on the ground and picked it up. It was very clean and shiny. She showed it to her friend, Timmy.
"Look Timmy, a clean leaf!" said Lily.
Timmy looked at the leaf and said, "Wow, it's so pretty!"
Suddenly, the wind started to blow and it got very cold. Lily started to shiver.
"I'm cold, Timmy," said Lily.
"Don't worry, Lily. Let's go inside and get warm," said Timmy.
They went inside and Lily's mom gave them hot cocoa. Lily learned that it's important to stay warm and take care of yourself. Even a clean leaf can't keep you warm when it's cold outside.
