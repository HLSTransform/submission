Once upon a time, a rich man lived in a big house. He had a beautiful garden full of flowers and trees. Every day, he would use a rake to clean the leaves that fell on the ground. He loved his garden very much.
One sunny day, a little boy came to the garden. He saw the rich man using the rake and asked, "What are you doing?" The rich man replied, "I am cleaning my garden with my rake. I do this every day to keep it pretty."
The little boy wanted to help, so the rich man gave him a small rake. They worked together to clean the garden. When they were done, the rich man said, "Thank you for your help. Now, we must lock the gate to keep the garden safe."
The little boy and the rich man locked the gate together. They became good friends and the little boy would visit the garden often to help the rich man. They had many fun days in the beautiful garden, and the rich man was very happy to have a new friend.
