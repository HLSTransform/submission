One day, Sammy was walking down the street and saw something green. He ran over to it and discovered it was a classroom! He peeked inside and saw a kind teacher inside.
"Hi there!" said the teacher.
"Hi!" said Sammy.
"Would you like to come inside?" asked the teacher.
"Yes!" said Sammy and jumped inside. He looked around and the classroom was filled with fun toys and books.
The teacher smiled. "Would you like me to bring you a snack?"
"Yes please!" said Sammy, and the teacher went to the kitchen and brought back a yummy snack.
Sammy was so happy and ate his snack with a big smile on his face. He had a wonderful time in the green classroom.
