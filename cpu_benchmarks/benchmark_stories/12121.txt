Once upon a time, there was a big lion. The lion was very powerful and he liked to show his power to other animals. One day, a little rabbit saw the lion and got scared. The lion saw the rabbit's face and thought it was funny that the little rabbit was scared of him.
The lion started to chase the rabbit, but the rabbit was too fast for him. The rabbit ran and ran until he got to a big hole. The rabbit jumped into the hole and the lion couldn't follow him.
The rabbit felt safe in the hole, but he was also sad that he couldn't play with the other animals because he was too scared of the lion. Then, a wise old owl appeared and told the rabbit that the lion was not as powerful as he thought. The owl revealed that the lion was actually scared of something else.
The rabbit felt better knowing that the lion was not as scary as he thought. The next day, the rabbit saw the lion again, but this time he wasn't scared. He looked the lion in the face and saw that the lion was actually afraid of the dark. From that day on, the rabbit and the lion became friends and played together without any fear.
