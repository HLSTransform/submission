Once upon a time, there was an old car. The car was very old and it needed gas to move. One day, the car saw a little boy walking on the street. The boy looked very tired and sad.
The car asked the boy, "Why are you sad?" The boy said, "I promised my mom I would be home before dark, but I got lost and now it's dark and I don't know how to get home."
The car said, "Don't worry, I promise I will take you home." So the car drove the boy safely home. The boy was very happy and thanked the car.
The moral of the story is that it's important to keep your promises and help others when they need it. And always make sure your car has enough gas!
