Once upon a time, there was a big, strong dog named Max. Max was mighty and loved to play with his ball. One day, Max went outside to play with his ball, but he accidentally left it in the mud. 
Max's owner, a little girl named Lily, saw that Max's ball was dirty and said, "Max, your ball is dirty. Let's wash it!" 
Max barked happily and Lily grabbed the ball. She washed it with soap and water until it was clean. Max was so happy that he wagged his tail and licked Lily's face. 
From that day on, Max made sure to never leave his ball in the mud again. And Lily always made sure to wash it when it got dirty. The end.
