Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her plastic dolls. One day, she accidentally broke one of her favorite dolls. She was very sad because it was an original doll that her mom gave her. 
Her mom saw how sad she was and told her that it's okay because the doll is still valuable to her. Lily didn't understand what her mom meant by "valuable", but she felt a little bit better. 
The next day, Lily's mom surprised her with a new doll that looked just like her original one. Lily was so happy and hugged her mom tightly. She realized that even though her original doll was broken, it still had value because it meant something special to her.
