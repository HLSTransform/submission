Tim and Jen are playing soccer in the park. They like to kick the ball and run after it. They are on the same team and they wear red shirts.
"Look, Jen, I can kick the ball very far!" Tim says. He kicks the ball with all his might. The ball flies over the fence and lands on the road.
"Oh no, Tim, you kicked the ball too hard!" Jen says. "How will we get it back?"
They run to the fence and look for the exit. They see a gate that says "Exit". They open the gate and go to the road. They see a big truck coming. The truck is very loud and fast.
"Tim, Jen, come back!" their mom shouts. She sees them on the road. She is scared. She runs to the exit and grabs them. She pulls them back to the park. She hugs them and says, "You are safe now. But you should never go to the road without me. The road is dangerous. Do you understand?"
Tim and Jen nod. They are sorry. They say, "We are sorry, mom. We just wanted to get our ball back. We did not see the truck."
Their mom says, "I know, but you have to be careful. Next time, ask me for help. I will get your ball for you. OK?"
Tim and Jen say, "OK, mom. Thank you."
Their mom says, "You are welcome. Now, let's go and find your ball. Maybe it is still on the road. Or maybe someone picked it up. Come on, let's go."
Tim and Jen follow their mom. They hope they can find their ball. They like to play soccer. They are proud of their kicks. But they also know they have to be safe. They will not go to the road again. They will stay in the park. They will listen to their mom. They will have fun.
