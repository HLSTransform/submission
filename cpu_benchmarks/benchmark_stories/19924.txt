Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to wear his red jacket when he went outside to play. One day, Timmy saw a big dog and he got scared. But then, the dog signed to Timmy that he was friendly and just wanted to play. Timmy was happy and not scared anymore. 
Later that day, Timmy went to the park and saw a man doing impressive tricks with a yo-yo. Timmy thought it was so cool and he clapped his hands. The man smiled and showed Timmy how to do some tricks too. Timmy was so happy and impressed with the man's skills. 
When it was time to go home, Timmy's mom asked him how his day was. Timmy signed to his mom about the friendly dog and the impressive yo-yo tricks. His mom was happy that he had such a fun day. Timmy put on his red jacket and went to bed, dreaming about all the fun he had that day.
