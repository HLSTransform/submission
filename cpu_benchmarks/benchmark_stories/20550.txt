Once upon a time, there was a chicken called Sarah. Sarah was walking in a field one day when she got hurt. She was feeling very sad, so she asked the other animals in the field to help her.
First, Sarah asked the cow, but the cow did not know how to help. Then, Sarah asked the rabbit, but the rabbit did not know what to do either.
Finally, Sarah asked the owl. The owl was wise and knew just what to do. He flew to the little farm and fetched a bandage. He came back and gently wrapped the bandage around Sarah's hurt leg.
Sarah felt much better and thanked the owl for helping her. She felt happy that her friends were there for her and that she could be happy again.
