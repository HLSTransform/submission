Once upon a time, there was a fast bunny. He always wanted to go faster and faster. One day, he found a special apron. When he put it on, he could suddenly go in reverse! He was so excited to be able to go much faster. He went faster and faster, but he didn't know how to stop! He had so much fun going backwards that he forgot how to go forwards. 
The rabbit's friends were worried about him, so they found another special apron and invited the bunny over for lunch. When the bunny put on the new apron, he was able to go forward again! The bunny was so happy and thanked his friends for the apron. He never forgot to watch where he was going ever again! The end.
