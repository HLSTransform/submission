Sara and Ben like to play with their toys. They have a big box of toys in their room. Sara likes to play with dolls and Ben likes to play with cars. One day, they find a new toy in the box. It is a set of drums.
"Wow, look at this!" Ben says. "We can make music with this!"
"Can I try?" Sara asks.
"Sure, you can have a turn. But be careful, it is very loud." Ben says.
He gives Sara a drumstick and shows her how to hit the drum. Sara hits the drum and makes a loud sound. She likes it. She hits the drum again and again. Ben hits another drum and they make music together.
But they do not hear their mom calling them from downstairs. She is making lunch and she wants them to come and eat. She calls them again and again, but they do not hear her. They are too busy making music.
Their mom gets angry. She walks up the stairs and opens their door. She sees them playing with the drums. She is very surprised. She did not know they had a set of drums. She did not buy it for them.
"Where did you get this?" she asks.
"We found it in the box." Ben says.
"It is not yours. It is your cousin's. He left it here last week. He is coming to get it today. You have to give it back." she says.
Sara and Ben are sad. They like the drums. They do not want to give them back.
"But we like it. We want to keep it. We can make music with it." Sara says.
"I'm sorry, but you can't. It is not fair to your cousin. He loves his drums. He will be very upset if you take them." she says.
She takes the drums and puts them back in the box. She tells them to come and eat lunch. Sara and Ben follow her. They are hungry, but they are also sad. They wish they had a set of drums of their own. Maybe someday, they will.
