One day, a father took his daughter to the park. He was very anxious; this was the first time his daughter had been to the park by herself. The father watched his daughter explore the park. She ran around and laughed, having fun. 
The father was still anxious, but he was also proud of his daughter. He had taught her to be careful and to stay safe when she was away from him. His daughter seemed to be doing very well on her own. 
The father watched his daughter for a few more minutes before he felt brave enough to leave the park. He hugged his daughter tightly and said goodbye. Then, he waved goodbye to her as he left the park. 
The father was filled with joy. He was happy to see his daughter enjoying the park and feeling brave enough to explore. He felt reassured that he had taught her what she needed to know.
