Tom and Lily were having lunch with their mom. They liked to eat pasta with cheese and tomato sauce. Mom gave them each a fork and a plate. Tom and Lily were playful. They made funny faces with their forks and pasta.
"Look, Mom, I have a fork nose!" Tom said, putting the fork on his nose.
"That's silly, Tom. I have a fork mouth!" Lily said, putting the fork in her mouth.
Mom smiled and said, "You are very funny, but you also need to eat your pasta. It is yummy and good for you."
Tom and Lily nodded and started to eat. They liked the cheese and tomato sauce. They also liked to make slurping noises with their pasta.
Suddenly, they heard a loud bark outside. They looked out the window and saw a big dog. The dog was brown and fluffy. He had a red collar and a blue ball. He was jumping and running in the yard.
"Wow, look at that dog!" Tom said, dropping his fork.
"He is so cute and playful!" Lily said, forgetting her pasta.
They stared at the dog with big eyes. They wanted to play with him. They wondered if he had a name and a home.
Mom saw them staring and said, "That is Max. He is our new neighbor's dog. He moved in yesterday. Maybe we can go and say hello later, if you finish your lunch."
Tom and Lily smiled and said, "Yes, please, Mom. We want to meet Max. He looks like a fun friend."
They picked up their forks and ate their pasta quickly. They hoped Max would like them too. They were excited to play with him.
