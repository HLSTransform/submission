Once there was a little boy who was happily playing in the park. He loved to run and play tag with his friends. But then, the cold wind began to blow and he knew that it was time to go home.
He thanked his friends and ran home. His house was warm and cozy and his mother was waiting with a hug. He thanked her and smiled.
The little boy wanted to play outside again. So the next day, they opened the door and the cold air blew inside. He shivered, but he was ready to play.
He thanked his mother and ran out into the park. He ran and ran and saw his friends waiting for him. All day long he played until he was tired.
At the end of the day, he thanked his friends and ran back home. His house was still warm and cozy and his mother was still waiting for a hug. He thanked her and said goodnight. 
And that was the end of the little boy's day.
