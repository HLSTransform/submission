One day, a little girl stepped outside. The sky was fair, and the sun was warm. She decided it was time to pick some food from the garden.
The little girl stepped over to her cauliflower patch. She bent over and carefully pulled one, delighting as its orange flower tumbled into her hand. She stepped over to the other side of the garden and picked some carrots and potatoes. With a content smile, she carried her harvest back to the house.
The little girl stepped into the kitchen. Her mother was busy chopping up the cauliflower, carrots, and potatoes. The girl watched, happy she had been able to help. Soon, her mother served up a steaming dish of fair food. The little girl smiled, savouring the tasty treat.
