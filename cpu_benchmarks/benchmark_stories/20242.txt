Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toy train. The train had a long rail that Tim could put together. He was very happy when he played with his train.
One day, Tim wanted to pour water on the rail to make it slippery for the train. He thought it would be fun to watch the train go fast. But it was a stupid idea because the train could not go on the wet rail. The train slipped and fell off the rail.
Tim was sad that his train fell off the rail. He learned that pouring water on the rail was not a good idea. Next time, he decided to keep the rail dry and play with his train the right way. And Tim and his train lived happily ever after.
