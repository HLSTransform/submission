Once upon a time, a wise owl and a silly monkey were playing together in the jungle. The owl was very good at games, but the monkey was not. They decided to play a game of twist and turn. 
The owl twisted and turned his body in funny ways, and the monkey tried to copy him. But the monkey kept falling down and laughing. 
After a while, the monkey got frustrated and said, "I'm not a good player like you, Mr. Owl. Can you teach me how to be better?" 
The wise owl replied, "Of course, my dear friend. Let's practice together every day, and soon you will be the best player in the jungle!" 
And so, they continued to play and practice together, twisting and turning until the monkey became a very good player too. The end.
