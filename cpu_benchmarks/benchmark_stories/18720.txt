Once upon a time, there was a friendly dog named Max. Max loved to play with his friends in the park. One day, Max saw a bone near a skull. He wanted to take the bone, but a mean dog was guarding it. The mean dog started to yell at Max.
Max was scared and didn't know what to do. He went to his wise owl friend and asked for advice. The owl told Max that he should always be kind to others, even if they are mean. Max listened to the owl and went back to the mean dog. He asked the mean dog if they could share the bone.
The mean dog was surprised by Max's kindness and agreed to share the bone. From that day on, Max and the mean dog became friends and played together in the park. Max learned that being friendly is always the best way to make new friends.
