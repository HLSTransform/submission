Once upon a time, in a small town, there was an old house. The old house was sad because it was broken and dirty. No one wanted to live in the old house.
One day, a kind man named Tom saw the old house. He said, "I will restore you, old house. I will make you happy and clean." Tom worked very hard to fix the old house. He painted the walls and fixed the roof.
As Tom was working, a rude bird came by. The bird said, "You can't make this old house nice." Tom replied, "I can and I will!" Tom kept working and soon the old house was beautiful again. The rude bird saw that Tom was right and flew away. The old house was happy and thanked Tom for all his help.
