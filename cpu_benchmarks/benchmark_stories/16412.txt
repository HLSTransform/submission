Anna liked to play with her toy cricket. It was green and soft and made a funny noise when she squeezed it. She named it Jim and took it everywhere with her. She slept with it, ate with it, and read stories with it.
One day, Anna went to the park with her mom and Jim. She saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She put Jim on the ground and climbed up the ladder. She was very excited and happy. But when she reached the top, she saw a boy with a mean face. He grabbed Jim and ran away.
Anna was very sad and angry. She shouted at the boy and slid down fast. She chased him across the grass and tried to get Jim back. The boy was faster and stronger. He laughed and said, "This is my cricket now. You can't have it. It's too ordinary for you."
Anna felt like crying. She loved Jim and he was not ordinary. He was special and fun and her best friend. She did not give up. She ran after the boy and saw him stop near a bench. He threw Jim on the bench and went to play with something else.
Anna saw her chance. She ran to the bench and grabbed Jim. She hugged him and said, "I'm sorry, Jim. I missed you so much. You are not ordinary. You are amazing and wonderful and my best friend." She removed the dirt and grass from Jim and made sure he was okay.
She smiled and felt happy again. She looked for her mom and saw her waiting for her. She ran to her and showed her Jim. Her mom smiled and said, "I'm proud of you, Anna. You were brave and smart and you got your cricket back. He is not ordinary. He is very special, just like you." She kissed Anna and Jim and took them home. Anna felt very happy and loved. She played with Jim all day and night. She never let him go again.
