Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim and a girl named Sue. They were very good friends. They liked to play together, laugh, and share their toys.
One day, Tim and Sue found a big, soft ball. They liked to squeeze it with their hands because it was so squishy. They took turns squeezing the ball and giggling at how it changed shape.
As they grew up, Tim and Sue stayed friends. They were always kind and compassionate to each other. When they were older, they decided to have a marriage. They promised to love and care for each other forever. And they lived happily ever after, always remembering to be kind and to share, just like when they were young and played with the squishy ball.
