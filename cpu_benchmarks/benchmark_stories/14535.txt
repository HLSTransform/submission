Billy wanted to play outside, so he put on his comfy shoes and zipped up his jacket. He stepped outside and decided to jog. He ran as fast as he could, jumping over leaves and feeling the fresh air on his face.
Billy was getting a bit tired, so he stopped to take a rest in the garden. He saw some golf clubs in the corner and remembered that his dad had said he could try them when he was big enough. He thought it looked like fun, so he grabbed a club and started to swing it. 
Billy worked hard, trying to hit the golf balls. It was tough but he kept at it and eventually hit a few. He smiled when he heard the ball going 'thwack' as it hit the ground. He felt very proud that he had achieved something so tough. 
Billy had a wonderful time playing golf and wanted to do more. He decided to jog around the garden before going inside. He ran fast, kicking up the leaves in the air and feeling the happy breeze on his face.
