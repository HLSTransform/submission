Once upon a time, there was a messy dog named Spot. He loved to dig and bury his bones in the yard. One sunny day, Spot found a big, juicy bone. He was so happy and couldn't wait to bury it.
Spot dug a big hole in the yard and put the bone inside. Then, he covered it with dirt. "Now, I will wait until later to eat my bone," he thought. Spot went to play with his friend, a little bird named Chirpy.
Chirpy saw the messy dirt and asked, "Spot, what did you do?" Spot told Chirpy about the bone he buried. Chirpy smiled and said, "That's a great idea! Now your bone will be safe." Spot and Chirpy played all day, and when the sun went down, Spot dug up his bone and enjoyed his tasty treat.
