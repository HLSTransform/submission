Once upon a time there was a furry little mouse. He lived under the stairs and he loved to explore. 
One day, he went exploring. He saw something shiny and wanted to catch it. It was shiny gear! 
He tried to get it, but it was stuck on the ground. He tried pushing it and pulling it but it wouldn't budge.
Then he heard a noise behind him. He turned around to see a big cat! The cat was grinning and holding up the gear he was trying to catch!
The cat said, "If you want it back, you have to catch me!" So the little mouse chased after the cat. He ran and ran until he finally caught up with the cat and grabbed the gear from its paws. The cat ran away and the little mouse smiled with joy as he held the shiny gear in his hands.
