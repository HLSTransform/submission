One day, Tilly found a pit in the sand in the park. She was curious and so she stepped into it. Suddenly, she felt helpless and scared because the pit had split and she was stuck. She shouted for her mom and dad but they weren't able to hear her from so far away.
Then, a kind lady who was nearby overheard Tilly. The lady smiled kindly and said, “Little one, don’t worry. You are not helpless. I can help you get out of the pit.” Tilly was relieved and so she nodded her head. The lovely lady gently pulled Tilly out of the pit and Tilly thanked her.
The kind lady then offered to take Tilly to find her mom and dad. She took Tilly’s hand and together they walked to find her mom and dad. When they finally found her mom and dad, they were both so happy and relieved to see Tilly safe.
