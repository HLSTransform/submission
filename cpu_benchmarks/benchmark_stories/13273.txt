Once upon a time, there was a lovely crocodile. He lived in a big pond full of water and fish. Every morning he would swim in the pond and shake his tail to say hello to his friends.
One day he went on an adventure. He slithered on the dry land and felt the warm sunshine on his back. As he moved along the path, he heard rustling in the grass. He was so startled, he shook really hard!
But when he looked around, he saw a little girl playing. She laughed when she saw him and showed him her basket of flowers. The crocodile smiled back at her and gently wagged his tail.
The little girl was so happy to meet him, she named him Crocky. from then on, she visited him every day to bring him lovely flowers and share stories. Over time, the little girl and the crocodile became the best of friends. Their bond was strong and made with love.
