Tom and his dad like to play with cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. Tom's favorite car is a red one that can make loud noises. He likes to pretend that he is a mechanic and fix the car when it breaks.
One day, Tom and his dad were playing with the cars in the living room. Tom was driving his red car on the carpet, making vroom-vroom sounds. His dad was watching him and smiling.
"Tom, you are a very good mechanic," his dad said. "You can fix any car."
"Thank you, dad," Tom said. "I like to fix cars. It is fun."
Suddenly, Tom's red car stopped making noises. Tom tried to push it, but it did not move. He looked at it and saw that one of the wheels was loose.
"Oh no, my car is broken!" Tom cried. "What can I do?"
"Don't worry, Tom," his dad said. "We can fix it together. Bring me the toolbox, please."
Tom nodded and ran to the corner, where the toolbox was. He picked it up and brought it to his dad. His dad opened it and took out a screwdriver and a wrench.
"Look, Tom, this is a screwdriver and this is a wrench," his dad said. "We use them to tighten the screws and the nuts. Can you help me?"
"Yes, dad, I can help you," Tom said. He watched his dad carefully as he used the tools to fix the wheel. He handed him the tools when he needed them.
"There, we did it!" his dad said. "The car is fixed. Try it now, Tom."
Tom took the car and pushed it. It made noises again and moved on the carpet. Tom was very happy.
"Yay, it works!" Tom cheered. "Thank you, dad. You are the best mechanic ever."
"No, Tom, you are the best mechanic ever," his dad said. "You helped me a lot. I am very proud of you."
They hugged and continued to play with the cars. They had a lot of fun. The sun was shining through the window and the sky was clear. It was a good day.
