Chris loved to soar. He loved jumping off the steps near his house and feeling the air rush past his cheeks. He spread his arms wide and pretended he could fly.
One day, he found a big, red kite and thought it might be fun. He asked his mom if he could fly it, and she said yes.
Chris went outside and found a wide, open field. He got down on one knee and started to assemble the kite. He put the pieces together and in no time it was ready to fly.
Chris grabbed the kite string and ran across the field. The wind picked up and the kite began to soar. Chris felt his heart jump for joy as he watched the kite go higher and higher.
He kept the kite up in the sky for a long time, turning it this direction and that. The kite was so useful. It seemed like he could stay up in the sky forever.
