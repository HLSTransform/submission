Once upon a time, there was a jolly little girl named Lily. She loved to bake with her mommy and daddy. One day, they were making pancakes in a big pan. Lily could hear the sizzle and pop of the pancakes cooking. 
After they finished cooking, Lily's mommy and daddy went to take a nap. Lily snuck back into the kitchen to eat more pancakes. She climbed up on a chair and reached for the pan, but it was too heavy for her. The pan fell on the ground with a loud crash and scared Lily. 
Lily's mommy and daddy heard the noise and ran into the kitchen. They saw that Lily was hurt and needed to go to the hospital. They were very sad that Lily got hurt because they loved her so much. From that day on, they made sure to always keep the pan out of reach so that Lily would be safe.
