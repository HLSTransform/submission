Jack and Jill were racing down the street very fast. They ran faster than they ever had before. Suddenly, a big, furry taxi drove up beside them. It drove so fast that Jack and Jill couldn't keep up. The taxi raced away with the two friends looking on. Jack and Jill stopped running, out of breath. "Wow, that taxi was so fast," said Jack. "Yeah, let's race back home," shouted Jill. So they raced each as fast as they could and were back home in no time. They were so happy and giggled the whole way.
