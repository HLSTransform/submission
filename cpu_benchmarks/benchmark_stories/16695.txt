Tom and Lily were best friends. They liked to play in the park and look for treasure. Sometimes they found shiny stones, pretty feathers, or colorful leaves. They put them in a big box and called it their treasure chest.
One day, they saw something very impressive in the park. It was a big balloon with many colors. It was flying in the sky and had a basket with people inside. Tom and Lily waved at them and shouted hello.
"Wow, look at that balloon!" Tom said. "It is so big and bright. I wish we could fly in it."
"Me too," Lily said. "Maybe we can find a balloon treasure in the park. Let's go and look."
They ran around the park, searching for anything that looked like a balloon. They did not find any, but they had fun anyway. They climbed on the slide, swung on the swings, and rolled on the grass.
They were very happy and tired. They sat down on a bench and opened their treasure chest. They looked at their shiny stones, pretty feathers, and colorful leaves. They smiled at each other.
"You are my best friend, Lily," Tom said. "You make me happy."
"You are my best friend, Tom," Lily said. "You make me happy too."
They hugged each other and gave each other a kiss on the cheek. They did not know what a kiss meant, but they felt warm and fuzzy inside. They decided that a kiss was a very nice treasure. They closed their treasure chest and went home, holding hands.
