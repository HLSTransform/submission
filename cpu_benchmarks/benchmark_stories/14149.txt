Once there was a stupid man who went for a walk. All he had with him was an oat. He was walking along until it happened. The oat had vanished! He looked everywhere, but still the oat was gone. He was so sad he started to cry. He hadn't even taken one bite. 
But then something extraordinary happened. A giant appeared out of nowhere and said, "It's okay! I will help you find your oat." 
The man and the giant searched high and low all around the world. But then, at last, they found it! The oat had been stuck in a tree. 
The man was so happy he gave the giant a big hug. He even broke off a piece of the oat for him. They said goodbye and the giant disappeared back into the sky. 
The man was happy to have his oat back. He knew from then on to be more careful and keep a better eye on it.
