Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside on the lawn. One day, Lily was very eager to play with her friends. She asked her mommy, "Can I go play with my friends?" Her mommy said, "Yes, but be careful." 
Lily ran outside to find her friends. They were playing with a ball. Lily was so eager to join in, she ran towards the ball. Suddenly, something strange happened. The ball bounced away and turned into a bird! Lily and her friends were surprised. They said, "Wow, that's amazing!" 
The bird flew away, and Lily and her friends went back to playing. They had so much fun on the lawn, and Lily was very happy. She told her mommy what happened, and her mommy said, "That sounds like a wonderful adventure!" From that day on, Lily and her friends always played on the lawn together, hoping for more magical things to happen. The end.
