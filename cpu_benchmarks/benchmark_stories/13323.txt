Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to pick flowers in her garden. One day, she saw a beautiful red flower. She wanted to pick it, but it was too high for her.
Lily asked her friend, Tom, "Can you help me pick the flower?" Tom said, "Yes, I can help!" So, he tried to pick the flower with his hand. But, the flower was still too high. They both felt uncomfortable because they couldn't reach it.
Then, Lily had an idea. She said, "Let's stand on a chair!" They found a chair and stood on it. This time, they could reach the flower. Tom picked it with his hand and gave it to Lily. They both smiled and were happy.
