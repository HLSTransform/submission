Once upon a time there was an enormous rhinoceros. He lived in the jungle and loved to have fun. One day he was playing when he heard a loud noise in the distance. It was getting closer and closer! The rhinoceros began to rush through the jungle to find out what it was. He raced quickly, pushing past branches and leaping over rocks.
Soon he saw something enormous ahead of him. He stopped in his tracks. It was a gigantic elephant! The rhinoceros was so scared! He didn't know what to do. He was about to run away when the elephant gave a friendly trumpet and walked away.
The rhinoceros was so happy! He felt safe again and continued to rush through the jungle, searching for more adventures. He never forgot the enormous elephant he met that day.
