Once upon a time, there was a mouse who was very tight. Every day, the mouse would look for food, but all the food was gone.
One day, the mouse heard a loud ring. The mouse followed the sound and found a big bell with a string attached. The mouse tugged on the string and the bell rang again. 
The mouse was so excited and tugged on the string again and again. He kept pulling the string until it was very tight. Suddenly, the mouse heard a noise from a nearby bush.
To the mouse's surprise, a bucket of food had been revealed! The mouse jumped for joy and filled his tummy with food.
The mouse was so happy that he had found food, that he ran off and sang a cheerful song. He was glad he had followed the ringing bell because it led him to the yummy food. 
The End.
