Once upon a time there was a little girl called Amy. She was three years old, and she wanted to learn things.
One day, she asked her mummy “Can I go to school?”
Her mum said “No, not yet. When you’re a bit older, then yes.”
Amy asked “What can I do to learn now?”
Mum said “Let me think. You can read books, count numbers, play games and draw pictures, to help you learn.”
Amy was very excited at all the things she could try. She asked her mum “Can I learn now?”
Mum said “Yes, that’s a great idea, but remember to be clear and listen carefully, okay?”
Amy nodded and ran away, ready to learn lots of fun things.
