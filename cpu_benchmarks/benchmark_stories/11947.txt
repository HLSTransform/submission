Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and write on her paper. One day, she was sitting under a big tree, wondering what to draw next. Suddenly, she saw a butterfly flying around her.
"Hello butterfly, what are you doing?" asked Lily.
"I am searching for a calm place to rest," replied the butterfly.
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I have a calm place under this tree. You can rest here with me."
The butterfly happily landed on the tree, and Lily started to draw it on her paper. She was so excited to write about her new friend and wondered what other creatures she could meet in her calm spot under the tree.
