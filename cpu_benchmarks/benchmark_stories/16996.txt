Lila was a little lamb who liked to jog. She jogged in the morning, she jogged in the afternoon, and she jogged in the evening. She jogged with her mom, she jogged with her dad, and she jogged with her friends. She loved to feel the wind in her wool and the sun on her face.
One day, Lila decided to jog by herself. She wanted to be independent and explore new places. She said to her mom, "Mom, can I jog alone today? I want to see what is over the hill."
Her mom said, "Lila, you are too little to jog alone. It is not safe. There are big animals and bad people who might hurt you. You should stay with me or your dad or your friends."
But Lila did not listen. She said, "No, mom, I am big enough. I can take care of myself. I will be back soon. Bye!" And she jogged away.
Lila jogged over the hill and saw a big forest. She thought it looked fun and exciting. She jogged into the forest and saw many trees and flowers and birds. She jogged deeper and deeper into the forest, until she got lost. She could not see the hill or the sun or her home. She felt scared and lonely. She wished she had listened to her mom.
She heard a loud roar and saw a big lion. The lion had sharp teeth and claws and hungry eyes. He wanted to eat Lila. Lila ran as fast as she could, but the lion was faster. He caught up with her and pounced on her. Lila screamed for help.
Luckily, her mom heard her scream. She had followed Lila's tracks and found her in the forest. She ran to Lila and fought the lion. She bit his tail and kicked his nose and scared him away. She hugged Lila and said, "Lila, are you okay? I was so worried about you. You should never jog alone. It is too dangerous. You need to stay with me or your dad or your friends. We love you and we want to protect you."
Lila cried and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I was wrong. I was not independent. I was foolish. I will never jog alone again. I love you and I need you. Thank you for saving me."
Her mom said, "It's okay, Lila. I forgive you. You are my brave and beautiful lamb. Come on, let's go home."
They jogged back to their home, where Lila's dad and friends were waiting for them. They were happy to see them and gave them hugs and kisses. Lila learned her lesson and never jogged alone again. She jogged with her mom, she jogged with her dad, and she jogged with her friends. She still loved to feel the wind in her wool and the sun on her face, but she also loved to feel the love in her heart.
