Anna likes to write in her diary every day. She writes about what she does, what she sees, and what she feels. She has a pink diary with a lock and a key. She keeps it under her pillow.
One day, Anna is very tired. She plays with her friends, she helps her mom, and she reads a book. She wants to write in her diary, but her eyes are heavy. She puts her diary on her bed and lies down. She thinks she will write later.
But she falls asleep. She does not hear her dad come home. He sees her diary on the bed. He is curious. He picks it up and tries to open it. He does not know it has a lock and a key.
Anna wakes up. She sees her dad with her diary. She is angry. She jumps up and runs to him. She shouts, "Dad, no! That is my diary! Give it back!"
Her dad is surprised. He says, "Sorry, Anna. I did not know it was your diary. I just wanted to see what you write. I will not look. Here, take it."
Anna takes her diary. She hugs it. She says, "Thank you, dad. But please do not touch my diary. It is mine. It has my secrets. You can ask me if you want to know something."
Her dad nods. He says, "I understand, Anna. I am sorry. I will not touch your diary again. I am proud of you for writing. You are a smart girl. Do you want to tell me what you write?"
Anna smiles. She says, "Maybe later, dad. I am still tired. I need to rest. But I am fine. I love you."
She puts her diary under her pillow. She lies down again. Her dad kisses her forehead. He says, "I love you too, Anna. Rest well. Sweet dreams."
He turns off the light. He leaves the room. Anna closes her eyes. She is happy. She has her diary. She has her dad. She falls asleep.
