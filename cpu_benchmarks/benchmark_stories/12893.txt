One day, there was a foolish mouse named Max. He decided to go and spin around in circles until he was dizzy. He spun and spun and spun until he got too dizzy and fell down and bumped his head. Max felt a bit silly, but he laughed and decided to keep spinning.
Max spun around and around and soon he was going too fast. He felt like he was on a page in a book, going around and around in circles. He began to spin in bigger circles, but he was moving too quickly. Suddenly, something bad happened. He was going so fast that he flew off the page and out the window!
Max was terrified as he flew away into the night sky. He tried to turn around, but he was too far away to get back. He landed in the forest and was so lost. The foolish mouse had forgotten to be careful.
The moral of the story is to be careful and wise. If Max had taken a moment to think, he wouldn't have made a foolish mistake that almost ended his life. His spinning adventures may have been fun, but sometimes foolish behavior has bad endings.
