Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and go to the park with her aunt. Her aunt was very nice and always made sure Lily was careful when she played.
One sunny day, Lily and her aunt went to the park. They saw a big tree and decided to sit under it. Lily was thirsty, so her aunt gave her a cup to drink some water. Lily was very careful not to spill the water while she drank it.
After they finished drinking, Lily and her aunt played on the swings and the slide. They had so much fun together! When it was time to go home, they held hands and walked back to their house. Lily couldn't wait for the next time she could play at the park with her aunt.
