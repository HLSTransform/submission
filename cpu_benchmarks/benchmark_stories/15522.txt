Once upon a time, there was a little mouse. The mouse wanted to eat a lot of yummy food. So it looked around the house for something tasty to eat. It noticed a trap in the corner and wondered what it was.
The mouse walked towards the trap and sniffed it. It was full of food! The mouse wanted to get the food but it was scared of the trap. It didn't know why the trap was there.
Suddenly, the mouse noticed a string on the trap. When it pulled the string, the trap door opened. The mouse was so excited! It started to eat the food and it tasted so good.
The mouse kept eating the food and it noticed that the amount of food inside the trap was increasing. It didn't know where the extra food came from. But it kept filling up with food so the mouse kept eating!
The mouse was happy. It had lots of yummy food. After the mouse finished eating it ran away, not wanting to get caught in the unknown trap.
