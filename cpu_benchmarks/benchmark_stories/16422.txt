Ben and Lily are playing in the farm. They like to run and jump in the wheat field. The wheat is tall and yellow and soft. They pretend they are lions and tigers and roar at each other.
"Roar! I am a big lion and I will catch you!" Ben says.
"Roar! I am a fast tiger and you can't catch me!" Lily says.
They chase each other and laugh. They are having fun.
But then the sky becomes dark and cloudy. They hear a loud boom. It is thunder. They see a bright flash. It is lightning. They feel drops of water on their faces. It is rain.
"Oh no! It is raining! We have to go back to the house!" Ben says.
"Yes, we have to go! The rain will make us wet and cold!" Lily says.
They run to the house as fast as they can. The rain becomes heavier and heavier. They are wet and muddy. They reach the door and knock.
"Mom! Dad! We are here! Let us in!" Ben says.
"Mom! Dad! We are sorry! We are wet and dirty!" Lily says.
Mom and Dad open the door and hug them. They are not angry. They are happy to see them.
"Come in, come in! You are safe and warm now!" Mom says.
"Let's get you some dry clothes and some hot cocoa!" Dad says.
They close the door and go inside. They are glad to be home. They love their mom and dad. They love the farm. They love the wheat. But they don't love the rain.
