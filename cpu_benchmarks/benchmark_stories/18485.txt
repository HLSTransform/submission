Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was going on a trip with her family and they had to pack their luggage. Lily was very excited to see all the new things they would find on their trip.
As they were packing, Lily's mom said, "Make sure you pack your favorite book, Lily. You never know when you might want to read it." Lily looked at her mom and nodded her head. She knew her mom was very intelligent and always knew what was best.
On the trip, Lily and her family went to a big city. They saw many tall buildings and bright lights. Lily was amazed by all the new things she saw. Then, they went to a museum where they saw many interesting things. Lily's mom said, "Look at all the beautiful art, Lily. It's so amazing!" Lily looked at the art and smiled. She was having so much fun with her family. 
At the end of the trip, as they were packing their luggage to go home, Lily's mom said, "I'm so glad we brought your book, Lily. It was a good idea." Lily smiled and felt proud that she had remembered to pack it. She knew her mom was very intelligent and always knew what to do.
