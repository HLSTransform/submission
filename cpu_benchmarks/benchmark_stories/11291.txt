Once upon a time there was a wide garden where many animals lived. The animals got along very well, and each day was full of fun and laughter. 
Every month, the animals would celebrate a special event together. In the event, they would all bring different perfumes that they had gathered from the garden. 
The perfumes would make the garden smell sweet and wonderful. 
One day, a naughty squirrel took more perfume than the others. When its friends asked why, it said that it did it because it wanted to smell better. 
The animals decided to teach their naughty friend a lesson. 
They reminded the squirrel that it was still important to remember to share with others, even when it's something small like perfume. 
Since then, the animals celebrate together every month and remind each other about the importance of sharing. 
The moral of this story is to always remember to share, no matter how small the thing is.
