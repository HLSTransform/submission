Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat beans, but his mommy said they were bad for him. Timmy didn't seem to care though, he just loved the taste of them.
One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy saw Timmy eating beans and said, "Ew, those look bad!" Timmy replied, "No way, they taste good!"
Billy decided to try a bean and to his surprise, it didn't seem so bad after all. In fact, he liked it! From that day on, Billy and Timmy ate beans together and they both seemed to enjoy them.
Timmy's mommy was happy that her son was enjoying healthy food and Timmy was happy to have a new friend to share his love of beans with. The end.
