Charlie was very proud. He had found a vehicle that he thought was so cool. He showed it to his friend and they agreed it was perfect.
“I can own my own vehicle!” shouted Charlie in delight.
But his friend shook his head. “That’s a foolish decision. You can’t afford it.”
 
Charlie ignored his friend. He had his own vehicle now! It felt so cool to drive.
One day, Charlie was driving his vehicle when he fell asleep. The vehicle drove off the road and crashed.
Charlie was not happy. He had made a foolish decision. His vehicle was destroyed and he knew he would never be able to own it again.
