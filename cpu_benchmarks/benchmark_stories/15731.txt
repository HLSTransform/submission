Once there was a boy called Jack. He wanted to get a goal. He asked his mommy and daddy, "Can I get a goal?" But they said no.
Jack was very sad. He wanted to get the goal. He asked his mommy and daddy again, "Please let me get the goal?" But they said no again. 
Jack felt guilty because he kept asking. He went away and found an old goal lying in the garden. He was excited. He asked his mommy and daddy, "Can I get this old goal?"
His mommy and daddy smiled. His daddy said, "Yes, you can get it!" 
Jack was happy and quickly got the goal. He played with his goal all day and was very proud of himself. He was happy he got his goal.
