Once upon a time, there was a small white bird. The bird wanted to go out and explore the world. 
Today was a special day and the bird wanted to suggest something to his friends. He said, "Let's go on an adventure! It will be fun!"
His friends were excited. They grabbed their coats and followed the white bird out the door.
They scampered through the woods and explored the valley. They were so busy they didn't notice the sun was setting. 
Suddenly, they heard the bird say, "Let's go home. It's too dark outside." His friends agreed and they all trotted back to their nest. 
The white bird had a big smile on his face. His plan for an adventure had been a success!
