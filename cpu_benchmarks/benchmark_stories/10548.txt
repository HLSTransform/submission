Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. He was three-years-old and he was best friends with his Aunt Anna. Jack often asked her to play with him, but one day she said, "No".
Jack was sad, but he asked her why. She said, "Because I have to do a test." Jack didn't understand, so he asked her what a test was.
Aunt Anna answered, "It's something I have to try very hard not to do. I need to resist it."
Jack thought about this for a minute and then said something very stupid. â€œYou can do it, Aunt Anna!"
But she shook her head no and said, "No, Jack. I'm afraid I can't. This test is too hard for me."
Jack didn't understand, so Aunt Anna said, "It's like trying not to eat something yummy."
Jack tried to help, but nothing he said changed her mind. So Aunt Anna had to take the test, and despite all of Jack's help, she failed.
Jack felt sad and scared, but he wanted to help Aunt Anna. So he tried to resist the test with her, but it was too hard. 
In the end, Aunt Anna and Jack had to accept that they had failed the test.
