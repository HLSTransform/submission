Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy car that he loved to zoom around the house with. One day, Timmy's little sister wanted to play with the car too. Timmy didn't want to share his favorite toy and said, "No, it's mine!"
His sister started to cry and their mommy came in to see what was wrong. She asked Timmy why his sister was worried and crying. Timmy said, "I don't want to yield my car to her." Mommy explained that it's important to share and take turns. Timmy thought about it and finally agreed to let his sister play with the car too. They took turns zooming it around the house and had lots of fun together.
