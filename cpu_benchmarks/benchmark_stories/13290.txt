Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to play outside in nature. One day, while playing in the park, she saw a small bird. The bird was sad because it could not find its family. Lucy wanted to help the bird. She knew she had to be brave.
Lucy said to the bird, "Don't worry, little bird! I will help you find your family." The bird was happy to have a friend to help. They looked all around the park, but they could not find the bird's family. Lucy and the bird started to feel sad.
Just then, a big wind came and blew the bird up into a tree. Lucy was scared, but she knew she had to be brave. She climbed up the tree and helped the bird. As they got to the top, they saw the bird's family. The bird was so happy and said, "Thank you, Lucy, for being brave and helping me find my family!"
