Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jim. He was three years old and loved to swing. Every day he would go to the park and swing on the swing. He loved the feeling of the wind on his face and the way it made him go so high. 
Jim would close his eyes and imagine he was flying. As he was swinging, he heard a beautiful sound. He opened his eyes and saw a bright blue bird flying above him. The bird flew around the swing two times and then flew away. 
Jim started swinging again and he could still hear the sound of the bird. He felt so happy. The song of the blue bird was the best sound he had ever heard. He kept swinging until the sun went down. 
Jim knew he would never forget the beautiful blue bird and the sound it made as it flew away.
