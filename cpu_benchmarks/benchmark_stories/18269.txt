Once upon a time, there was a family who went on a trip. They packed all their things in a big bag and went on a plane. When they got to their new home, they had to unpack all their things. It was hard work, but they did it together.
One night, while they were sleeping, there was a loud noise. The ground shook and things fell off the shelves. It was an earthquake! The family was scared, but they held each other tight until it was over.
After the earthquake, it was very dark outside. The family couldn't see anything without a flashlight. They had to be careful not to trip over anything. But they were grateful to be safe and together, even in the dark.
