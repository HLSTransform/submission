Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Jane. She had big, brown eyes that blinked all the time.
One day, Jane was walking outside and she noticed a gentle breeze. It seemed to bring Jane a message. She blinked a few times and then smiled - she understood the message!
The message was that Jane should be kind and gentle with everyone around her. Jane remembered the message and nodded her head.
From that day forward, Jane was very kind and gentle. Whenever someone was sad, she would give them a hug. Whenever someone was upset, she would help them feel better.
Jane was very happy knowing she was making people smile. She kept the message with her in her heart.
