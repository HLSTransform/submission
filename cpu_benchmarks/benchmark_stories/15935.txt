Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy. Mommy and Daddy wanted to take their little boy to the park, so they all hopped in the car.
At the park, they saw a big tree with lots of sparkly leaves. Little Boy wanted to pick some of the leaves, so Mommy said, "Yes, you can pick some leaves!" He went over to the tree and picked some of the sparkly leaves.
Then they saw a swing. Little Boy asked if he could swing, so Daddy said, "Yes, you can swing!" Little Boy hopped in the swing and felt so comfortable. He pushed himself back and forth, higher and higher until he felt like he was flying.
When Little Boy was done, Mommy said, "That was a big victory! I'm so proud of you."
Little Boy smiled and said, "Thanks, Mommy! That was fun."
