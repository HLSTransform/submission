The birds were in the sky, soaring high. They seemed to have no worries in the world. Even so, one bird wasn't quite like the rest. It was a brave bird, an obedient bird.
The brave bird noticed something down below. A dark hole that seemed to have no bottom. He wanted to explore it.
He flapped his wings and soared towards the mysterious hole. He could feel the excitement as he flew closer and closer. He started to slow down and eventually he was directly over the hole.
He hesitated for a moment, but then he took the plunge! He dived into the hole, wings tucked in. It was a bit scary, but he kept going. He kept his wings tucked in tight and eventually, he reached the bottom.
The brave bird was nowobediently exploring the bottom of the mysterious hole.
