Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. She lived on a farm with her family and was always helping out with the animals. One day, when Sarah was collecting eggs from the chicken coop, she had an idea. She thought it would be nice to have a grill, so she could make yummy food for her family.
So Sarah asked her mom if they could buy a grill. Her mom said yes, so Sarah was so very happy. She quickly split the wood and soon they had a pretty new grill. 
Sarah was so excited to try using the grill and asked her mom if she could make something on it. Her mom smiled and said yes. So Sarah quickly gathered some eggs, cheese and bacon. She put them on the grill and soon, it started to smell really good.
When everyone was done eating, Sarah was reminded of a saying her mom had told her earlier. "If you share, you can make many happy moments." Sarah decided to share all of the leftovers with the animals on the farm. 
Sarah's mom was so proud when she saw this. She hugged Sarah and said: "You are so kind and generous! You always make sure that everyone, including the animals, have enough to eat. That is what being a good steward is all about!" 
Moral of the story: Sharing with others makes for a better world!
