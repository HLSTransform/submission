Bob was a guard. He had a wide hat and a big stick. He always watched the gates. One day Bob saw something and he felt sad. He wished he could have done something, but it was too late.
Bob didn't know what he had seen. But he felt like he had done something wrong. He was so sad he started to cry. He regretted what he had done.
Then one day, Bob saw something very special. It was a beautiful butterfly. Bob felt so happy that he stopped crying. He wanted to be a friend and guard the butterfly. So every day, Bob watched the butterfly and kept it safe.
Every day, Bob forgot about his regret and felt more and more happy. He was so happy to be a guard and look after the butterfly. This was all he wanted to do any more.
