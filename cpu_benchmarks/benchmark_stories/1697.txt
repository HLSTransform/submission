Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo loved to swim in the big blue ocean with his fish friends. One day, Nemo got hurt and his tail was broken. He couldn't swim anymore and he was very sad.
Nemo's friend, a kind octopus named Ollie, saw that Nemo was sad and asked him what was wrong. Nemo told Ollie that he couldn't swim anymore because his tail was broken.
Ollie said, "Don't worry, Nemo. I can help restore your tail to perfect condition!" Ollie used his magic powers to fix Nemo's tail and soon Nemo was swimming again with his friends. Nemo was so happy and he thanked Ollie for making his tail perfect again. They swam together in the ocean, laughing and playing all day long.
