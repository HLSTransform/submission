Lily and Tom were going to the park with Mom. They wanted to play on the swings and slide. Mom said they had to prepare first. She gave them a backpack with snacks and water. She also gave them hats and sunglasses to protect their eyes from the sun.
"Are you ready?" Mom asked.
"Yes, Mom!" Lily and Tom said. They put on their hats and sunglasses. They looked very cool.
They walked to the park. It was a mild day. The sun was shining, but not too hot. The sky was blue and the birds were singing. Lily and Tom smiled and held Mom's hand.
They reached the park. There were many other children playing. Lily and Tom ran to the swings. They took turns pushing each other. They laughed and shouted.
"Look at me, Mom!" Lily said. "I'm flying!"
"You're doing great, Lily!" Mom said. "Be careful, Tom!"
Tom was swinging too high. He lost his balance and fell off the swing. He landed on the grass. He cried and rubbed his knee.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tom said.
Mom ran to him. She hugged him and checked his knee. It was not bleeding, but it was red and sore.
"I'm sorry, Tom," Mom said. "Are you OK?"
Tom nodded. He sniffled and wiped his tears. He looked at his sunglasses. They were broken.
"My sunglasses!" Tom said. "They're ruined!"
Mom took the sunglasses. She saw the crack and the missing lens.
"I'm sorry, Tom," Mom said. "We'll get you new ones later. Do you want to go home?"
Tom shook his head. He wanted to play more. He was brave.
"No, Mom," Tom said. "I want to stay. Can I have a snack?"
Mom smiled. She was proud of Tom. She opened the backpack and gave him a cookie and some water.
"Here you go, Tom," Mom said. "You're a good boy. Do you want to try the slide?"
Tom nodded. He ate his cookie and drank his water. He felt better. He put on his hat and followed Mom to the slide. Lily was waiting for them.
"Are you OK, Tom?" Lily asked.
"I'm OK, Lily," Tom said. "Let's play!"
They played on the slide. They had fun. They forgot about the broken sunglasses. They were happy.
