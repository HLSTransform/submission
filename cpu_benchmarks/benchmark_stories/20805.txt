Once upon a time, there was a fair noise coming from a big field. The noise was so loud that it could be heard from very far away. Every day, many people gathered in the field to enjoy the pleasing sound.
One day, a man came to the field with a big saw. He cut down one of the trees that was making the noise. When the tree fell, the noise stopped. Everyone was sad and angry, but the man said he had to do it for a good reason.
The days and weeks went by, and the noise didnâ€™t come back. Eventually, the people in the field realized what the man had done: he had cut down all the trees that made the fair noise. He had ruined the beautiful sound forever, and they felt very sad.
