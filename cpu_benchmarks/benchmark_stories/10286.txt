Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go outside and play in nature. One day, she went for a walk in the woods with her mommy. They saw lots of ordinary animals like squirrels and birds.
Suddenly, Lily saw a pretty flower and wanted to pick it. She tried to pull it out of the ground, but it was too hard. Her mommy explained that it was important to leave nature alone and not disturb it. Instead, they just admired the flower from afar and continued their walk.
Lily learned that even though things may seem ordinary, they are still special and important in their own way. And sometimes, it's better to just enjoy nature without trying to pull or take anything from it.
