One day, a little boy named Tim and his dependable dog, Spot, went to the park. They liked to play together. Tim would push a ball with his knee, and Spot would run after it.
"Go get the ball, Spot!" Tim said, as he pushed the ball with his knee. Spot ran fast and brought the ball back to Tim. They played this game many times, and they were very happy.
Then, Tim saw a girl named Sue who was sad. "Why are you sad?" Tim asked. Sue said, "I lost my ball." Tim wanted to help Sue, so he and Spot looked for her ball. They found it near a tree. Sue was happy, and they all played together. Now, Tim and Sue were friends, and they had a fun day at the park with dependable Spot.
