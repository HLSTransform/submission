Once upon a time, there was a family of four. They had two children, a boy and a girl. One day, the boy wanted to buy something from the store. He asked his parents if he could have it, but they said that it was too expensive for him. 
The boy was so disappointed. He said that it was stupid that he couldn't have it. His sister stepped in and said that she could help. She said that they could separate the price into two halves, that way each of them could pay half. 
The boy and girl were very happy. So, they each gave a half of the price and bought the thing the boy wanted.
The family was joyful and everyone was glad that the sister found a way to help her brother. They hugged each other and felt grateful for their special bond. They would always help each other no matter what.
