Tom and Sam are friends. They like to ride bikes. They have red bikes and blue bikes. They ride fast and slow. They ride up and down. They have fun.
One day, they see a big hill. They want to ride down the hill. It looks fun. But there is a pass on the hill. The pass is dark and scary. There are hairy animals in the pass. They are big and loud. They have sharp teeth and claws.
Tom says, "Let's ride down the hill. We can go through the pass. It will be fun."
Sam says, "No, Tom. The pass is scary. The hairy animals are mean. They will hurt us. Let's go another way."
Tom says, "No, Sam. You are a baby. You are scared of everything. I am not scared. I will ride through the pass. You can stay here."
Sam says, "Tom, please. Don't go. It is not safe. It is not fun. It is bad."
But Tom does not listen. He rides down the hill. He goes fast and faster. He goes to the pass. He sees the hairy animals. They see him. They are angry. They roar and run. They chase Tom. They catch him. They bite him and scratch him. They hurt him. Tom cries and screams. He is sorry. He wants Sam.
Sam hears Tom. He is scared and sad. He wants to help Tom. But he cannot. He is too far. He is too slow. He is too small. He cries and cries. He misses Tom. He is alone.
