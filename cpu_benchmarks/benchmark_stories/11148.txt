Once upon a time, there was a cute little bunny named Benny. Benny was very adorable with his fluffy tail and big ears. One day, Benny saw a hammer lying on the ground. He picked it up and started to play with it. Benny loved the sound it made when he hit it against the ground.
Suddenly, Benny heard a noise coming from behind a bush. He decided to peek and see what it was. It was his friend, a little bird named Billy. Billy was stuck in a tree and couldn't get down. Benny knew just what to do. He used the hammer to break the branch and free Billy.
From that day on, Benny and Billy were the best of friends. They played together every day and Benny always kept his hammer close by, just in case they needed it again.
