Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a big box of gum. He loved his gum very much. Tim was an eager boy who liked to help others.
One day, Tim's friend, Sam, came to play. Sam saw the big box of gum and wanted some too. Tim thought for a moment and decided to lend Sam some gum. Sam was very happy and said thank you.
But Sam did not know how to share. He took all the gum from the box and ran away. Tim was very sad. He had no gum left. The next time, Tim would be more careful about lending his things.
