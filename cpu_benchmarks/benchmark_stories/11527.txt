One day, a boy named Tim and a girl named Sue went to a party. They were very excited to enjoy the yummy cake. The cake was big and original, with many colors and shapes. Tim and Sue couldn't wait to eat it.
At the party, they met a new friend named Max. Max said, "I like cake too! Can I have some?" Tim and Sue said, "Yes, let's all share the cake!" They were happy to share the cake with their new friend.
But then, a big dog came into the party. The dog saw the cake and wanted it too. The dog jumped up and ate the whole cake! Tim, Sue, and Max were sad. They did not get to enjoy the original cake. The party was not fun anymore.
