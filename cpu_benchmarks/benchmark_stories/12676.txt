Once upon a time, there was a big game of soccer. The players were very good and they wanted to win the game. The crowd was very loud and everyone was cheering. The players had to listen to their coach to know what to do. 
The game was tied and there was only one minute left. One player kicked the ball and it went into the goal! The score was now one to zero. The other team was fierce and tried to score too, but they didn't have enough time. 
The winning team was very happy and they celebrated by jumping up and down. The crowd cheered and clapped. Everyone had a good time at the game. The end.
