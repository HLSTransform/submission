Lily and Max were walking with Mom and Dad in the big city. They saw many cars, buses, shops and people. They also saw big pictures on the walls, called billboards. Some billboards had words, some had colors, some had animals.
Lily liked the billboard with a big dog and a little girl. The dog was brown and fluffy, and the girl was smiling and hugging the dog. Lily loved dogs, and she wanted to hug one too. She asked Mom and Dad if they could get a dog.
Mom and Dad said they could not get a dog right now, because they lived in a small apartment. They said dogs needed a lot of space, food and care. They said maybe someday they could get a dog, when they moved to a bigger place.
Lily was sad, and she started to cry. She wanted a dog so much. She felt like the girl on the billboard was lucky, and she was not. She wished she could hug the dog on the billboard.
Max saw Lily crying, and he felt sorry for her. He was her big brother, and he wanted to make her happy. He had an idea. He took Lily's hand, and led her to the billboard. He lifted her up, and helped her hug the dog on the billboard. The billboard was hard and cold, but Lily did not mind. She felt like she was hugging a real dog. She smiled, and stopped crying.
Mom and Dad saw what Max and Lily were doing, and they smiled too. They were proud of Max for being kind and clever. They were happy that Lily was happy. They hugged Max and Lily, and told them they loved them. They said they were a good family, and they did not need a dog to be happy. They said they could always hug each other.
