Once upon a time, there was an adorable baby named Sweets. Sweets loved to play and laugh in the garden with her pet rabbit, Speedy. Sweets spoke to Speedy every day and their conversation always made them both laugh. 
One day, Sweets' mom asked her to help with the laundry. Sweets was sad to leave Speedy, but she agreed to help her mom. She spoke to Speedy and promised to talk to him again soon.
Sweets helped her mom and as they folded the clean laundry, they spoke about how important it was to be helpful. Suddenly, Speedy hopped into the room! He had followed Sweets all the way from the garden. Everyone laughed and they all enjoyed playing together. 
Sweets was so happy to have Speedy back and she happily promised to continue helping her mom with the laundry. They all enjoyed the day and Sweets was reminded of the wonderful feeling of being adorable and helpful.
