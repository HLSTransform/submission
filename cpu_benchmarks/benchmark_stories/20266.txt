Once upon a time, there was a big box. It was a clear box, so you could see what was inside. In the box, there was a book. It was a special book called a novel. The novel had a lock on it. The lock was shiny and pretty.
One day, a little girl found the box. She saw the novel and wanted to read it. But she did not know how to open the lock. She tried and tried, but the lock would not open. The little girl was sad.
Then, she remembered her grandpa had a key. She went to her grandpa and asked if he could help her open the lock. Grandpa used his key, and the lock opened! The little girl was very happy. She sat down and read the novel. It was a wonderful story.
