Once upon a time there was a little boy. He was never very busy, but he still had dreams. Sometimes his dreams were scary nightmares.
One night in his dream he was walking down a long, dark road. Suddenly, he saw a big dragon. He was very scared and started to cry. But then the dragon smiled at him and gave him a hug. 
The dragon said, "It's okay. I just wanted to give you a hug." Then the dragon blew softly on the little boy and made the tears dry. 
The little boy laughed and thanked the dragon. The dragon told the boy to never be scared of his nightmares. With that, the dragon said goodbye and flew away. 
The little boy felt much better and didn't feel so busy anymore. He smiled and went to sleep, knowing that his nightmares weren't as scary as they seemed.
