Tom and Lily liked to play in the park. They liked to slide, swing, and climb. But their favorite thing was to spin on the round thing. The round thing was wide and had bars to hold on to. They would run and push it and then jump on and spin fast.
One day, they met a new friend in the park. His name was Ben. He had a red hat and a blue bike. He wanted to play with them. He asked if he could spin on the round thing too.
"Sure, you can spin with us," Tom said. He was generous and liked to share. "But you have to wait your turn."
Lily nodded. She agreed with Tom. "We spin for a little bit, then we stop and let you spin. OK?"
Ben smiled. He said OK. He waited for Tom and Lily to finish their spin. Then he put his bike on the grass and ran to the round thing. He grabbed a bar and pushed hard. The round thing started to spin. He jumped on and laughed. He liked to spin too.
Tom and Lily watched him. They were happy to have a new friend. They clapped and cheered for him. They took turns to spin on the round thing. They had fun together. They spun until they were dizzy and tired. Then they sat on the grass and talked. They became good friends. They liked to play in the park.
