Sam and Lily were twins who liked to collect things. They collected rocks, shells, stickers, and coins. They had many boxes full of their collections in their room.
One day, their parents took them to a big city for a vacation. They stayed in a hotel that had many rooms and a big pool. Sam and Lily were excited to see new things and collect more stuff.
They went to a park, a museum, and a market. They saw many birds, flowers, paintings, and toys. They collected some feathers, petals, postcards, and magnets. They put them in their backpacks and smiled.
But when they came back to the hotel, they saw that their room was filthy. There was trash, dirt, and bugs everywhere. Their beds were messy and their clothes were torn. Their backpacks were gone and their boxes were empty.
They cried and ran to their parents. Their parents were angry and sad. They asked the hotel manager what happened. The manager said that someone had broken into their room and stolen their things. He said he was sorry and he would call the police.
Sam and Lily hugged their parents and said they were sorry too. They said they had collected too many things and they did not need them. They said they only needed their family and their love.
The manager heard them and smiled. He said they were very smart and kind. He said he had a surprise for them. He gave them a new backpack with some books, games, and snacks. He said they could keep them and share them with other kids.
Sam and Lily thanked him and smiled too. They learned that collecting things was not as important as being happy and generous. They decided to collect only memories and friends from then on.
