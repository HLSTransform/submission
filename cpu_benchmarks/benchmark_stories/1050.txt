Once upon a time there was a clumsy little mouse. He was always getting into trouble and making mistakes because he was so clumsy. But he was happy and cheerful. 
One day he was off running around looking for something fun to do, when he stumbled across a bag of pastels. In his curiosity, he decided to open the bag curious to see what was inside. 
But when he opened the bag, he heard a voice. It was a demanding voice that was very strong and it said "you must keep this bag of pastels safe". The mouse was scared and confused, but he knew that he had to obey the voice's demand. 
He picked up the bag and he decided to hide it in a secret spot. He looked carefully and found an old tree stump, so he put it behind there and he covered it with stones and grass so it was hidden from view. 
 
The mouse breathed a sigh of relief and he hopped away with a smile on his face. He had done what the voice demanded and his secret was safe. 
The End
