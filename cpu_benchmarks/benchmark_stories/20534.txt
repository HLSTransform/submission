Once upon a time, there was a little boy who really wanted a telephone. He asked his mom every single day but she always told him that he was too young to have one.
One day, something magical happened. An old man at the park had a telephone with him and he asked the boy if he wanted it. The boy was so excited, he couldn't believe his luck!
The man showed the little boy how to use the telephone. It was so useful, the boy could now talk to his friends and family! Pause. 
The boy was so happy he ran home with his new telephone and showed it to his mom. She was surprised but also very pleased. She said that the boy could only use it when he was with her so that he could stay safe. 
The boy agreed, and ever since he's made sure to use his telephone in a safe and responsible way. It has been so useful to him, he's been able to talk with his friends and family whenever he likes. And he's never forgotten just how lucky he is.
