Jack was playing in his yard. He was balancing blocks one on top of the other. All of a sudden, he heard a very quiet noise. He looked around but he couldn't see anything.
He slowly walked through the yard, trying to find the source of the noise. He found it in a corner of the yard, near a tree. He saw a little bird.
Jack smiled. He was very excited to meet the bird. He carefully stepped closer to the bird.
Jack said, "Hello! What are you doing here in this quiet yard?"
The bird looked very surprised at first but then it said, "I'm looking for a place to balance my nest. This looks like a good spot. Do you think it's alright if I stay here?"
Jack smiled even more and said, "Yes, of course you can stay here."
The bird was very happy and flew around Jack in circles. Then it flew away, spreading its wings and singing a sweet song.
Jack watched the bird until it was out of sight and then he went back to balancing his blocks.
