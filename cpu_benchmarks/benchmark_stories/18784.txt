Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big white flower in the corner. It was a cauliflower that their mom had planted.
"Let's pick it and eat it," Ben said. He liked cauliflower a lot.
"No, we can't," Lily said. "Mom will be angry. She said we have to listen to her and not touch her plants."
But Ben did not listen. He ran to the cauliflower and pulled it out of the ground. He broke it into pieces and gave some to Lily.
"Here, try it. It's yummy," he said.
Lily felt guilty. She knew they were doing something bad. But she was hungry and curious. She took a bite of the cauliflower. It was crunchy and sweet.
They ate the whole cauliflower and threw the leaves in the trash. They wiped their mouths and went back to their toys.
Soon, mom came home from work. She went to the garden to check on her plants. She saw the empty spot where the cauliflower had been.
"Who did this?" she asked. "Who took my cauliflower?"
Ben and Lily heard her voice and felt scared. They looked at each other and did not say anything. They hoped mom would not find out. But mom was smart. She saw the crumbs on their faces and the leaves in the trash.
She called them to the garden and asked them again.
"Did you take my cauliflower?" she asked.
Ben and Lily nodded. They were sorry. They knew they had been naughty.
Mom was not happy. She told them they had to say sorry and help her plant a new cauliflower. She also said they had to eat their dinner without any dessert.
Ben and Lily said sorry and helped mom. They learned their lesson. They decided to listen to mom and not touch her plants again. They also decided to share their food and not be greedy. They hugged mom and said they loved her. Mom hugged them back and said she loved them too.
