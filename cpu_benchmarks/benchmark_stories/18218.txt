Once upon a time, there was a pretty girl named Lily. She had a notebook that she loved very much. The notebook was blue and had many pages.
One day, Lily wanted to complete her notebook by drawing a big, happy sun. She took her yellow crayon and started to draw. She made a big circle and then added lines all around it.
When she was done, Lily showed her mommy the picture. Her mommy smiled and said, "Wow, what a pretty sun!" Lily felt happy and proud that she completed her notebook with a beautiful drawing.
