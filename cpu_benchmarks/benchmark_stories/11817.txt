Once there was a brave girl named Lucy. One day Lucy decided she wanted to have an adventure, so she built a tent in her backyard. It was an unusual tent, all different colors and shapes.
Lucy brought some of her friends over to play in the tent with her. They all had fun playing hide-and-seek and singing songs in the tent.
At one point they all started to get a bit bored. Lucy had an idea and said, "Who dares to do something really fun?" Everyone cheered and agreed to do something daring.
They all ran out of the tent, laughing and shouting. They ran around the yard for a long time, playing silly games and daring each other to do all sorts of unusual things.
Finally, when it was time to go home, everyone agreed that they had a wonderful time in Lucy's tent. They all said they would never forget their daring adventure together.
