Once upon a time, there was a pretty girl who went on a special journey. She stepped through the door of a magic house and found herself in an attractive world. Everywhere she looked, beautiful colours filled the sky. 
As she continued on her journey, she spotted a shiny object in the distance. She ran to see what it was and discovered a dazzling necklace with a sparkling crystal pendant. She couldn't believe her luck. She quickly put it around her neck and made a wish. 
Suddenly, the crystal pendant began to sparkle and the girl knew her wish had come true. But as she reached out to touch it, the necklace began to vanish! 
The girl was sad, but she understood that all good things must come to an end. She made a promise to herself to go on many more exciting journeys and enjoy the beauty of the world around her.
