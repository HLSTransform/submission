Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. It was her birthday and she was very happy. Her mommy baked a big cake for her and it looked impressive. 
Lily's friends came over to play with her. They played with dolls and blocks. They also played hide and seek. Lily had lots of fun with her friends. 
Later, they all sang happy birthday to Lily and she blew out the candles on her cake. She got lots of presents too. It was the best birthday ever!
