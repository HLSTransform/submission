Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Timmy. He loved going on adventures and solving mysteries. One day, Timmy and his friend Billy were playing in the park when they saw a big sack.
"What's in the sack?" Timmy asked.
"I don't know, let's find out!" Billy said excitedly.
As they opened the sack, they found a mystery inside. It was a missing toy that belonged to a little girl named Sally. Sally had been looking for her toy for days and was very sad.
Timmy and Billy knew they had to help Sally find her toy. They searched high and low until they finally found it in the park. Sally was so happy to have her toy back and thanked Timmy and Billy for their help.
"Thanks for helping me solve the mystery of my missing toy!" Sally said.
Timmy and Billy felt proud of themselves for helping someone in need. They knew that they could always count on each other to solve any mystery that came their way.
