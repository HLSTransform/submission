Once there was a boy who was very proud. Every day he wanted to show everyone how brave he was. One day, he decided to try something amazing - to spring into the surf! He had never been in the water like that before and it made him very excited. 
He looked around and everyone was cheering him on. He sprung up and splashed into the surf. The water felt cool and refreshing on his skin. He was so proud that he had done it!
The boy went on to try more exciting things in the surf. He learned how to float, dive and swim. He was proud of all the new things he had tried. 
Every day the boy spring out into the surf and splash about. He was proud of himself for being brave and showing everyone he can do it!
