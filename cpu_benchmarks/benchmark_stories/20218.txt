Tom and Anna are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a large box in the yard. The box has many colors on it. Tom and Anna want to see what is inside the box.
"Let's pull the box open!" Tom says. He grabs one side of the box and pulls hard. Anna grabs the other side and pulls too. But the box does not open. It is too heavy and strong.
"Maybe we need something to help us," Anna says. She looks around and sees a stick. She picks up the stick and tries to poke a hole in the box. But the stick is too short and weak. It does not make a hole.
"Maybe we need something else," Tom says. He looks around and sees a rope. He picks up the rope and ties it around the box. He gives one end of the rope to Anna and keeps the other end. "Now we can pull together!" he says.
Tom and Anna pull the rope with all their might. The box starts to move. It makes a loud noise. Tom and Anna are happy. They think they will open the box soon. But then they hear a voice from inside the box.
"Hey, stop that! You are hurting me!" the voice says. Tom and Anna are surprised. They stop pulling the rope. They look at each other. They wonder who is in the box.
"Who are you?" Tom asks.
"I am Max, the cat. This is my home. I like to sleep in this box. It is cozy and warm. Please leave me alone," the voice says.
Tom and Anna feel sorry for Max. They did not know he was in the box. They did not want to hurt him. They untie the rope and put it back. They say sorry to Max.
"We are sorry, Max. We did not know you were in the box. We just wanted to see what was inside. We will not bother you again," Anna says.
"Thank you, Tom and Anna. You are nice. Maybe we can be friends. But please do not pull my box. It is mine," Max says.
Tom and Anna nod. They smile at Max. They decide to play with something else. They leave the box alone. Max goes back to sleep. He is happy in his box. It is his home. It has many colors on it. He likes it.
