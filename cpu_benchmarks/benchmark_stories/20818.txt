Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted to find the truth. He was curious to know what it was so he decided to find it.
So the boy began his journey but it was very difficult. He faced a lot of difficulties and he tried his very best to keep going. However, as he was walking along he began to close his eyes. He was so tired of looking that he thought it easier to close them. 
But little did the boy know that he wouldn't be able to find the truth that way. So he kept searching and struggling until one day the truth was revealed to him. The boy was so surprised and happy that he had made it so far and that he had solved the conflict.
