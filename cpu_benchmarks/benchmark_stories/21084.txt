Sara liked to measure things with her ruler. She measured her toys, her books, her bed, and even her cat. One day, she saw a spider on the wall. She wanted to measure the spider, too.
She got her ruler and climbed on a chair. She reached out to the spider, but it moved away. Sara followed it with her ruler, but it moved again. The spider was fast and Sara was slow.
"Stop, spider, stop!" Sara said. "I want to measure you. How big are you?"
The spider heard Sara and stopped. It looked at her with its many eyes. It did not like to be measured. It liked to be free.
"Go away, girl, go away!" the spider said. "I do not want to be measured. I am small and you are big. Leave me alone!"
Sara was surprised. She did not know that spiders could talk. She felt sorry for the spider. She put down her ruler and got off the chair.
"I am sorry, spider, I am sorry," Sara said. "I did not mean to bother you. I was curious. You are very pretty and smart."
The spider was surprised, too. It did not know that girls could be kind. It felt happy for Sara. It smiled with its many teeth.
"Thank you, girl, thank you," the spider said. "You are very nice and brave. I am old and you are young. Let us be friends."
Sara and the spider became friends. They talked and played and learned from each other. Sara did not measure the spider anymore. She measured her love for the spider instead.
