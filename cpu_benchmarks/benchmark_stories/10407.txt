Jim woke up and jumped out of bed. It was a beautiful day and he felt ready for a new adventure. He went to the backyard and saw a stack of toys. Something was wrong with the toys. They were covered in something very dirty - it was filthy.
Jim ran to his mom and said "Mom! Look at the toys! They're all filthy!" 
His mom smiled and replied "Oh, don't worry Jim. We can fix that. Let's get some soap and water and make them clean again."
Jim and his mom worked together to clean the toys. When they finished, the toys looked almost new. Jim was very proud of how he helped to fix the stack of toys. 
He smiled and said, "We did a great job, Mom!"
"Yes, we did!" His mom replied. 
 Jim hugged his mom and ran off to play with the clean toys in the backyard.
