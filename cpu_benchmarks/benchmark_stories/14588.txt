Once upon a time there was a stable. Inside the stable was a big and impressive horse. The horse had a very nice mane, and was very strong. He ignored the other animals and kept to himself. 
One day, a little girl visited the stable. She was very brave, and she wanted to pet the impressive horse. She slowly walked over to him and talked in a gentle and friendly voice. But the horse ignored her! No matter what she said, the horse would look away and not answer.
The little girl didn't give up though. She kept trying to get the strong horse's attention. Finally, after a lot of patience, the horse looked right at the girl and made a sound. The little girl was so happy! She smiled and petted him softly. The horse was very happy too.
From then on, the horse and the little girl were friends. The horse always looked forward to the little girl visiting his stable. He never ignored her again.
