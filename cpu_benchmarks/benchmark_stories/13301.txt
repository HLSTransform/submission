Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tom. He loved cocoa. One day, he wanted to make cocoa fast. So, he ran to the kitchen and asked his mom, "Can we make cocoa fast, please?"
His mom said, "Yes, Tom! Let's make cocoa together." They took out milk, cocoa powder, and a pot. They mixed the milk and cocoa powder in the pot. Tom was so excited, he wanted to make the cocoa faster.
But his mom said, "Tom, we can't spoil the cocoa. We have to cook it slow and careful." Tom listened and they cooked the cocoa together. When it was done, they poured it into cups and enjoyed their yummy cocoa.
