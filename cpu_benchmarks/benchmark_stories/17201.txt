Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy heard a loud noise. He looked up and saw a big plane in the sky. The plane was dropping bombs and Timmy knew something was wrong.
Timmy's mommy and daddy told him that there was a war going on. Timmy didn't know what a war was, but he knew it was bad. His mommy and daddy started to panic and told Timmy they had to get ready to leave. They packed some things and got in the car.
As they drove away, Timmy saw that everything was destroyed. The trees were gone, the houses were gone, and the people were gone. Timmy was scared and didn't understand why this was happening. He wished he could go back to his old life where he could play with his toys and run around outside. But now, everything was gone and Timmy was sad.
