Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play on the beach and build sandcastles. One day, she went to the sea with her mom and dad. They all had fun playing in the water and collecting seashells.
Suddenly, Lily saw a big pile of dirty seaweed on the shore. She said, "Mommy, I hate that dirty seaweed! Can we clean it up?" 
Her mom and dad agreed, so they grabbed some buckets and started to pick up the seaweed. As they worked, Lily sang a song about the sea and how much she loved it. When they finished, the beach was clean again and they all went home happy. 
From that day on, Lily made sure to always keep the beach clean so that everyone could enjoy it.
