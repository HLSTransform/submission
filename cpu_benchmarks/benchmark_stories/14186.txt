Molly and her Mom were in the attic. Molly was excited to see what was there. Mom said the attic might be cool.
Molly looked around and saw lots of boxes and things. Mom said it was time to look for support. They looked together and found lots of things.
Molly felt the walls, and she thought it was cool! Then, she found a box of support in the corner. Mom said it was just what they need.
Molly was so happy to get the support from the attic. Then, they went back downstairs to finish their work.
