Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who lived in a great town. One day, Lily wanted to buy a new dress for her doll. She went to the store and saw a pretty pink dress. She asked the store owner if it would fit her doll.
The store owner said, "Let's see if it's the right size. We need to make sure it's not too big or too small." Lily tried the dress on her doll and it fit perfectly!
Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you! This is the best dress ever!" She went back home and showed her mom the new dress. Her mom said, "Wow, that looks great on your doll!" Lily smiled and played with her doll all day long. The end.
