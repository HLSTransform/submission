Once there was a little boy named Tommy. Tommy was very shy and timid. Every day he would walk past a dark pine tree.
One day, Tommy heard a voice coming from the dark pine tree. He was scared, but curious, so he decided to look closer. 
The voice belonged to a tiny creature who was giggling. The creature was a mischievous pixie who had been teasing Tommy every day as he passed the tree.
Tommy was so excited that he cheered and waved his hands in the air. The pixie was very surprised - he had never met anyone brave enough to talk to him before!
The pixie and Tommy soon became good friends. They would spend hours playing together and running around the dark pine tree. 
Tommy was no longer scared of the dark pine tree - it was now his special place, full of fun and adventure.
