Jessie was feeling worried. It was dark outside and she was all alone. She had lost her watch. She didn't know what to do.
Then she felt a hand on her shoulder. She looked up and saw her mommy. Her mommy knelt down and gave Jessie a big hug.
Jessie felt happy. She knew that her mommy would make it better. She held onto her mommy's hand and they went to look for the lost watch.
They looked everywhere, but they couldn't find it. Jessie started to feel worried again, but her mommy smiled and said they could go to the store and buy a new one.
Jessie smiled. She knew that she wouldn't feel worried anymore. She held onto her mommy's hand and they went to buy a new watch.
