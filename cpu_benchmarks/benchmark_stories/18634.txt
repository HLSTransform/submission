Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite was a stuffed bear named Teddy. One day, Lily's mom offered to take her to the park to play. 
Lily was so happy and said, "Yay! Thank you, Mommy!" Her mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, sweetie. It's a beautiful day outside and I want to spend time with you."
As they walked to the park, they saw a group of kids playing with a ball. Lily wanted to join in but she was shy. One of the kids, a boy named Alex, saw Lily and offered her the ball. "Do you want to play with us?" Alex asked. 
Lily was so happy and grateful for the gift of playing with the other kids. She played with them for the rest of the year and made new friends. She realized that sometimes the best gifts are the ones that are freely offered by others.
