Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the rain, even though his mommy warned him not to. One day, Timmy went outside to play and got all wet in the rain. When he went back inside, his mommy saw him and asked him if he had listened to her warning. Timmy felt guilty and said he was sorry. 
His mommy told him that it was okay to play in the rain, but he needed to wear his raincoat and boots so he wouldn't get too wet. Timmy promised to listen to his mommy's warnings from now on and to always wear his raincoat and boots when he played outside in the rain. And they lived happily ever after. The end.
