Once upon a time there was an ancient hook. It was sitting all by itself and no one knew where it had come from. One day, a little boy came across the hook and he asked, "Where did you come from?". The hook didn't answer, so the boy asked again, "What do you do?". Again, nothing happened, so the little boy decided to take the hook home and see what it could do. 
When the little boy got back home, the hook began to sparkle. He put it on the wall, and it didn't take long before the hook had turned into a magical coat hanger. The little boy was so amazed and he asked the hook, "What can I put on you?". The hook answered by singing out loud, "Hang your jackets and sweaters, your hats and your gloves, hang your scarves, and your raincoats - they'll fit on our curves!".
The little boy was delighted to see the hook had come to life and he put all his clothes on the hook. It made his room look much tidier and he was so pleased that he had asked the hook where it had come from. The end.
