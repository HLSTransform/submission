Lily was a good girl who liked to help her mom. She helped her mom serve food to the people who came to their house. She also helped her mom clean the dishes and the table. Lily was happy to serve others.
One day, Lily's mom gave her a medal. It was shiny and had a star on it. Lily's mom said, "This is for you, Lily. You are a star helper. You serve others with love and kindness. I am proud of you." Lily was very happy. She put the medal around her neck and showed it to everyone.
But not everyone was happy for Lily. Ben, who lived next door, was jealous. He wanted a medal too. He thought he was better than Lily. He said to Lily, "Your medal is ugly. You don't deserve it. You only serve others because you want to be popular. You are not a star. You are a fake." He tried to take the medal from Lily.
Lily was sad and angry. She said, "No, Ben. You are wrong. My medal is beautiful. I deserve it. I serve others because I care about them. I am not a fake. I am a star." She held on to her medal.
Ben and Lily started to fight. They pulled and pushed each other. They shouted and cried. Their moms heard them and came to see what was wrong. They saw Ben and Lily fighting over the medal. They were shocked and disappointed.
They separated Ben and Lily and took them to their houses. They said, "Ben, Lily, you should not fight. Fighting is bad. It hurts others and yourself. You should be sorry for what you did. You should say sorry to each other and be friends. You should share and respect each other. You should learn from Lily. She serves others with love and kindness. That is what makes her a star. That is what makes her medal shine." Ben and Lily felt ashamed. They said sorry to each other and hugged. They became friends. They learned to serve others with love and kindness. They both became stars.
