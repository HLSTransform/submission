Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved candy very much. One day, she went to the store with her mom and saw a big display of candy. It was so colorful and pretty!
Lily wanted to buy all the candy, but her mom told her to only pick one. She chose a lollipop and was very happy. When they got home, Lily put the lollipop in her backpack. She knew it would be very useful later when she needed a sweet treat.
Every time Lily saw her lollipop, she smiled and felt very happy. It was the best candy she ever had, and she loved displaying it on her desk.
