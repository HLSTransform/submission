Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys. But they do not like to sort their toys. They leave them all over the floor. Mom and Dad are not happy.
One day, Mom and Dad have news. They say they are going to have a baby. Lily and Ben are excited. They want to see the baby. Mom and Dad say the baby will come soon. They say they need to make room for the baby. They say Lily and Ben need to sort their toys.
Lily and Ben do not want to sort their toys. They say they have too many toys. They say it is hard to sort them. They say they do not know where to put them. Mom and Dad say they can help. They say they can give some toys to other kids who do not have toys. They say they can keep some toys in a large box. They say they can put some toys in their closet.
Lily and Ben think about it. They decide to sort their toys. They pick the toys they love the most. They put them in their closet. They pick the toys they like a little. They put them in the large box. They pick the toys they do not play with anymore. They give them to Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad say they will take them to a place where other kids can have them.
Lily and Ben feel good. They see their floor is clean. They see they have more space. They see they have done a nice thing. They hug Mom and Dad. They say they are ready for the baby. Mom and Dad smile. They say they are proud of Lily and Ben. They say they have learned to sort and to share. They say they have shown love and kindness. They say they are a happy family.
