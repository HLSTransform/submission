Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a white teddy bear that she loved very much. One day, Lily was playing outside when she accidentally dropped her teddy bear into a muddy puddle. She was very sad because her teddy bear was now dirty and not white anymore.
Her friend, Tom, saw her crying and asked her what was wrong. Lily told Tom what happened and how sad she was. Tom said, "Don't worry, Lily. I have a dependable washing machine at home. We can wash your teddy bear and make it white again." Lily was very happy and accepted Tom's offer.
Tom took the teddy bear home and put it in the washing machine. After a few minutes, he took it out and it was as good as new! Lily was so happy and thanked Tom for being such a good friend. From that day on, Lily and Tom were the best of friends and they always helped each other.
