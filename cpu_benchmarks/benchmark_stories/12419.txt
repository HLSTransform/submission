Once upon a time there was a creative little girl named Ali. She had a favorite toy – a special comb. Ali's mom always said, “That comb needs to be repaired – it looks broken!” But Ali wanted to keep her special comb just the way it was. So she ignored her mom’s advice.
One day, when Ali was playing with her comb, it suddenly flew out of her hands. And when she saw it laying on the ground, she noticed it was broken.
Ali quickly ran to her mom, crying. “Mommy, the comb is broken! Can you repair it?”
Her mom smiled and said, “That’s why I told you it needs to be repaired! Don’t worry, I will repair it.”
The next day, when Ali saw the fixed comb, she was surprised! It was even more beautiful than before!
“Thank you, mommy!” Ali hugged her mom and said.
“You’re creative and clever, Ali.” Her mom smiled. “It’s ok to repair broken things.”
