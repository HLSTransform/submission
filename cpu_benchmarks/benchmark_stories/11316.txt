Once upon a time there was a boy named Bob. Bob was three years old and very curious. One day, Bob was playing in the park. He wanted to catch something, so he ran over to the lake. He looked down at the lake and saw lots of fish swimming around. He got very excited and shouted "I'm going to catch one!"
Bob didn't have a fishing rod, so he had to find a tool. He soon spotted a stick nearby and picked it up. He ran back to the lake and started using it to catch fish. Bob had so much fun using the stick as a tool.
Suddenly he heard a voice say, "What a cool tool!" Bob looked up and saw a man wearing a cap. The man winked at him and said, "You're doing a great job!" Bob smiled and thanked the man. He was happy that he had found such a cool tool to use. 
Bob went on catching fish for a while before heading back home. On the way home he felt proud of himself for finding a tool so cool. He was happy he could catch so many fish with it.
