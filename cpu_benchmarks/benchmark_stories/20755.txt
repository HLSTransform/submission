Once upon a time there was a cheerful magic wand. It belonged to the nicest witch in the world. With a wave of the wand the witch could make all kinds of beautiful things appear.
One day the witch was doing her magic and playing her music when something disturbed her. It was a naughty little fairy who was trying to snatch away her wand! 
The witch quickly said a magic spell to stop the fairy in its tracks. The fairy decided it was no fun and flew away. 
The witch smiled and went back to her magic. She waved her wand and mysterious things began to appear. The whole room was filled with cheerful noises and laughter. Everyone was happy. 
The witch kept on doing her magic until the sun began to go down. Then she said goodbye, put her wand away and went home. All the magic had been a lot of fun!
