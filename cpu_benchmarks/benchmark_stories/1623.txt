Sara and Tom are twins. They like to play with their toys. Sara likes to play with dolls and Tom likes to play with cars. One day, they decide to play restaurant. Sara is the cook and Tom is the waiter.
Sara makes some pretend food with her pots and pans. She puts them on a tray and gives it to Tom. Tom takes the tray and walks to the table. He sees a big teddy bear sitting on a chair. He thinks the teddy bear is a customer. He puts the tray in front of the teddy bear and says, "Here is your food. Enjoy!"
Sara sees Tom talking to the teddy bear. She gets angry. She runs to the table and grabs the tray. She says, "That is not your customer. That is my teddy bear. He is mine. Give me back my food!"
Tom gets angry too. He pulls the tray from Sara. He says, "No, he is my customer. I am the waiter. I serve the food. You are just the cook. You stay in the kitchen!"
Sara and Tom start to fight over the tray. They tug and push and shout. The tray falls to the floor. The pretend food spills everywhere. The teddy bear falls off the chair. Sara and Tom stop fighting. They look at the mess. They feel sad.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to the room. She sees Sara and Tom and the mess. She says, "What happened here? Why are you fighting? Why did you make such a mess?"
Sara and Tom look at Mom. They feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were playing restaurant. But we got angry. We wanted the teddy bear and the food. We did not share. We did not listen. We did not have fun."
Mom says, "I see. Playing restaurant can be fun. But you have to share and listen and have fun. You have to work together. You have to respect each other. You have to be kind. That is how you play well. That is how you make friends. That is how you make Mom happy."
Sara and Tom nod. They say, "We understand, Mom. We will share and listen and have fun. We will work together. We will respect each other. We will be kind. We will play well. We will make friends. We will make Mom happy."
Mom smiles. She says, "That is good. I am proud of you. Now, let's clean up this mess. Then, we can have some real food. I will serve you some cookies and milk. How does that sound?"
Sara and Tom smile too. They say, "That sounds great, Mom. Thank you, Mom. We love you, Mom."
They hug Mom. They help Mom clean up. They have some cookies and milk. They play with the teddy bear. They play restaurant again. But this time, they share and listen and have fun. They work together. They respect each other. They are kind. They play well. They make friends. They make Mom happy. They are happy too. The end.
