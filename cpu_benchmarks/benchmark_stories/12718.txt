Molly was a happy three year old girl. She loved to dance and would often do so around the house. One day, she decided to dance in the bathtub. Her mom warned her not to, but Molly thought it would be a lot of fun.
Molly hopped into the bathtub and started to dance around. She thought it was great! Her mom called from upstairs and asked what she was doing. Molly said she was dancing. Her mom said to stop and get out of the bathtub right away.
Molly started to get out of the bathtub and looked down. To her horror, the bottom of the tub was full of tiny holes! She was so sorry and knew that she had been naughty. She said she was sorry to her mom and promised not to do it again.
