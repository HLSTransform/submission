Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy with a number on it. The number was two. His toy's name was Mr. Two. Tim liked to play with Mr. Two a lot.
One day, Tim took Mr. Two outside to play. They had a lot of fun. But then, it started to rain. Tim and Mr. Two got very wet. They ran back home to get dry.
When they were inside, Tim's mom helped them get dry. She gave Tim a warm towel and dried off Mr. Two. Tim was happy that Mr. Two was not wet anymore. They played inside for the rest of the day.
