Once upon a time, there was a wild girl. She was very polite and friendly. Everyone liked her around town. 
One day, the wild girl found something special and decided to sell it at the market. Everyone was so excited to see what the wild girl was selling. She had a big smile on her face as all the people around her bought her items. 
When the wild girl counted her money, she found out she had made a lot of money. She was so happy because all her hard work had paid off! She was polite to the customers and thanked them for buying something from her. 
The wild girl was so proud of herself! She celebrated by having a yummy ice-cream and everyone was thrilled to see her so happy. From then on, the wild girl happily sold items at the market every weekend.
