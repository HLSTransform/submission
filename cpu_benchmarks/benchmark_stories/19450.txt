Once upon a time, there was a fair. At the fair, there was a slide.
The little girl was so excited to go down the slide and play. She eagerly ran up the slide and then she started to dance at the top. She moved her arms and her feet, spinning in circles and laughing.
When she got to the bottom, the little girl was so happy. She jumped off and started to spin around and around in circles.
She wanted to do it all again, so she headed back up the slide. As she went up, she waved her arms around and sang.
At the top of the slide again, she started to dance. This time she moved her feet from side to side and hopped up and down.
When she was done, she hopped off the slide with a smile on her face. The little girl knew it was time to go home, but she had so much fun dancing at the fair.
