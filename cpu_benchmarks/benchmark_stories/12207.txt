Once upon a time, there was an owl who lived in the forest. He was a very restless owl, but he loved to slide. Every day he would slide around the trees and have lots of fun.
One day, a young girl saw the owl sliding around and she wanted to join in. She walked up to the owl and said: "Can I slide with you?". The owl looked at her, surprised, but said: "Of course you can! Let's go!".
 
The owl and the girl had lots of fun sliding around the trees in the forest. They would ran and slide around, giggling and laughing all afternoon.
When it started to get dark, the girl thanked the owl and went home. But she wasn't the only one who enjoyed it. From then on, the restless owl could always be seen sliding around the trees in the forest.
