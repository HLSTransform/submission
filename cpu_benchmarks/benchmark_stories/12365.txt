Once there was a girl who wanted to join a club. She asked her friends for their opinion but none of them had any advice. The girl was disappointed, but then she noticed a poster for a new club available at school.
The girl asked her mom, “Can I follow the club?” Her mom said, “No, I don’t think this club is a good idea.” 
The girl was sad. She wanted to join the club so badly. Then, her mom said, “Why don’t you ask your teacher? They might have a better opinion.”
The girl followed her mom’s advice and asked her teacher. Her teacher said, “Yes, this club can be a great opportunity for you. I think you should join!”
The girl followed the teacher’s opinion and joined the club. She had lots of fun and learned many new things. 
The moral of the story is that it’s important to always consider different opinions before making decisions. We can learn something from everyone.
