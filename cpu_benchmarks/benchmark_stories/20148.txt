Tom and Lily are going on a big trip with Mom and Dad. They are very happy and excited. They pack their bags and toys and get in the car. Mom and Dad drive to the airport.
At the airport, they see many people and planes. They have to wait in a long line. Then they have to show their passports to a man. A passport is a small book with your name and picture. It tells where you are from and where you can go.
"Can I see your passport, please?" the man asks Tom.
"Here you go," Tom says. He opens his passport and gives it to the man. The man looks at it and smiles.
"Very good, Tom. You have a reliable passport. It is not old or broken. It is valid and safe. You can go on the plane," the man says.
"Thank you," Tom says. He takes his passport back and puts it in his pocket.
"Can I see your passport, please?" the man asks Lily.
"Here you go," Lily says. She opens her passport and gives it to the man. The man looks at it and frowns.
"Oh no, Lily. You have a problem. Your passport is not reliable. It is old and torn. It is not valid and safe. You cannot go on the plane," the man says.
"What? No!" Lily says. She starts to cry. She does not want to stay at the airport. She wants to go on the big trip with Tom and Mom and Dad.
"Don't worry, Lily. We will fix this. We will get you a new passport. It will be fast and easy. Then you can go on the plane," Mom says. She hugs Lily and wipes her tears.
"Really?" Lily says.
"Really," Mom says.
They go to another place where they can get a new passport. They take a picture of Lily and fill out a form. They pay some money and wait for a little while. Then they get a new passport for Lily. It is shiny and new. It has her name and picture. It is reliable.
"Here you go, Lily. You have a new passport. It is reliable. It is valid and safe. You can go on the plane," the lady says.
"Thank you," Lily says. She opens her new passport and smiles. She is happy and excited again.
They go back to the line and show their passports to the man. The man nods and lets them go. They walk to the gate and board the plane. They find their seats and buckle their belts. They are ready for the big trip.
"Are you happy, Lily?" Tom asks.
"Yes, I am happy, Tom. I have a reliable passport. I can go on the big trip with you and Mom and Dad," Lily says.
"Me too, Lily. Me too," Tom says.
They hold hands and look out the window. They see the plane take off and fly in the sky. They are going on a big trip. They are very happy and excited.
