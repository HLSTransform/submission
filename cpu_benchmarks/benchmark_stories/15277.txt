Once there were two friends, Jack and Jim. They both had one special thing in common, a strong desire for adventure. 
So one day the two friends decided to explore a maze together. To make sure they had lots of fun, Jack lent Jim a toy to take with them on their adventure.
As the two friends carefully navigated the maze, Jim was very happy. Everywhere they went, his toy was bouncing around and making funny noises. Jack was always one step behind, watching and lending a hand when needed.
 
The journey was full of twists and turns, but the two friends were finally able to find their way out. After such a strong adventure, they were exhausted and ready for a break. They were happy they got to explore the maze together!
