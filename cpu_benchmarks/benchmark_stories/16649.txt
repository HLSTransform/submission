Once upon a time, there was a small dog named Max. Max lived in a small house with his family. One day, Max went to visit a lab. The lab was a big building with lots of rooms. Max was very curious and wanted to explore the lab. 
As he was walking around, he suddenly felt the need to sneeze. "Achoo!" Max sneezed loudly. Everyone in the lab heard him and looked at him. Max felt embarrassed and wanted to leave. 
But then, a kind scientist came over and petted Max. "Don't worry, little one," she said. "Everyone sneezes sometimes." Max felt better and stayed to play with the scientist. From that day on, Max loved going to the lab to visit his new friend.
