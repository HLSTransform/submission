Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a grandpa who was bald. One day, Timmy and his grandpa went to a park to play. Timmy saw a tasty apple on the ground and picked it up. He took a bite, but it tasted bad. 
Timmy said, "Grandpa, this apple tastes yucky. Can we wash it?"
Grandpa replied, "Sure, let's go to the fountain and wash it there."
As they walked to the fountain, they saw a squirrel who also wanted the apple. The squirrel said, "That apple looks tasty. Can I have a bite?"
Timmy said, "No, it tastes bad. We're going to wash it."
The squirrel got angry and said, "That's not fair! I want a taste too!"
Timmy and his grandpa explained that they needed to wash the apple first. The squirrel understood and waited patiently. After washing the apple, they all shared it and it tasted much better. Everyone was happy and the conflict was resolved.
