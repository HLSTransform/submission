Lily and Tom were very happy to move to a new house. They had many boxes to unpack. They wanted to see their new toys and books. They ran to their room and opened a big box.
"Look, Lily, I found my train!" Tom said. He took out his train and put it on the floor. He pushed a button and the train made a loud noise. "Choo choo!"
"Wow, Tom, that's a nice train!" Lily said. She looked for her doll in the box. She found her doll and hugged it. She pushed a button and the doll said "I love you!"
They played with their toys and made a lot of noise. They did not hear their mom calling them.
"Kids, come downstairs, please! We need to unpack the kitchen stuff. It's very useful. We need to make dinner!" Mom said. She waited for Lily and Tom, but they did not come.
Mom went upstairs to check on them. She saw their room full of toys and noise. She was very angry.
"Lily and Tom, what are you doing? You are making a big mess and a lot of noise! You are not helping at all! You are very naughty!" Mom said. She took away their toys and put them back in the box. She told them to go downstairs and help.
Lily and Tom were very sad. They did not want to lose their toys. They did not want to help. They wanted to play. They cried and said "Sorry, Mom!"
But Mom did not listen. She was too mad. She said "No more toys for you today! You have to learn to be useful and quiet!"
Lily and Tom had a bad day. They did not like their new house. They did not like their mom. They wished they could go back to their old house. They wished they had their toys. They wished they had fun.
