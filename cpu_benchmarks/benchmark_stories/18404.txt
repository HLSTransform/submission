Once upon a time, there was a little duck named Ducky. Ducky loved to swim in the stream all day long. One day, Ducky saw a big, grumpy cat sitting by the stream. Ducky didn't like the cat because it always made a frown on its face.
Ducky wanted to swim in the stream but was scared of the cat. So, Ducky thought of a plan. Ducky went to his friends, the fish, and asked for their help. The fish were happy to help and swam around the cat, making it dizzy.
The cat got so dizzy that it fell asleep, and Ducky could swim in the stream again. Ducky was happy and thanked his fish friends. From that day on, the cat never bothered Ducky again, and they all lived happily ever after.
