Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine and listen to the birds sing. One day, she heard a loud noise coming from her neighbor's yard. It was a harsh sound that made her ears hurt.
Lily went to investigate and saw her neighbor digging a big hole in the ground. She asked him a question, "What are you doing?" The neighbor replied, "I am digging a hole to plant a tree."
Lily watched as the neighbor carefully placed the tree in the hole and covered it with dirt. She wondered why he went through all that trouble just to plant a tree. But as the days went by, Lily saw the tree grow taller and taller, providing shade and beauty to the neighborhood. She realized that sometimes hard work and harsh sounds can lead to something wonderful.
