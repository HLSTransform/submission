Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her toys. She had a big lion toy that she named Leo. Leo was soft and furry and had a long tail. Lily liked to hug Leo and make him roar.
One day, Lily and Leo were having a tea party. Lily had a pink cup and Leo had a blue cup. Lily poured some water into the cups and pretended it was tea. She gave Leo a cookie and said, "Here you go, Leo. You must be hungry."
Leo took a bite of the cookie and said, "Thank you, Lily. This is yummy." He drank some water from his cup and said, "This is good tea." He smiled at Lily and said, "You are a good friend."
Lily smiled back and said, "You are a good friend too, Leo. I love you." She hugged Leo and made him roar. Leo roared back and said, "I love you too, Lily. You are the best."
They finished their tea party and played some more. They had a lot of fun together. Lily and Leo were happy.
