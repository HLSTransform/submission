Anna and Ben were excited to go to the zoo with Mom and Dad. They had never seen lions, monkeys, and elephants before. They got ready and put on their hats and coats. Mom and Dad called a taxi to take them to the zoo.
The taxi came and they got in. The taxi driver was nice and said hello. He drove fast and honked the horn. Anna and Ben looked out the window and saw many cars, buses, and people. They asked Mom and Dad many questions about what they saw.
But then the taxi stopped. There was a big traffic jam. Many cars were stuck and could not move. The taxi driver said sorry and tried to find another way. But there was no other way. They had to wait.
Anna and Ben were bored and sad. They wanted to see the animals. They did not want to sit in the taxi. They started to cry and whine. They said they wanted to quit and go back home.
Mom and Dad tried to calm them down. They said they would get to the zoo soon. They said they could play a game or sing a song. They said they could look at the pictures of the animals in the book they brought.
Anna and Ben stopped crying and listened to Mom and Dad. They decided to give the zoo another chance. They played a game of I Spy and sang Old MacDonald. They looked at the pictures of the lions, monkeys, and elephants. They got excited again.
After a while, the traffic jam cleared. The taxi driver said hooray and drove on. He reached the zoo and parked the taxi. He said goodbye and wished them a fun day. Anna and Ben thanked him and got out. They ran to the gate with Mom and Dad. They were happy and ready to see the animals. They did not quit. They made it to the zoo.
