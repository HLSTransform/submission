Once upon a time there lived two friends, Sarah and Jake. Jake was the grumpiest bear in the whole of the forest and Sarah was the happiest hedgehog ever.
Sarah was always trying to cheer Jake up and make him happy but his grumpy nature wouldn't let him. One morning, Sarah said to Jake, 
"Let's go out and explore nature today and I will support you!"
Jake rolled his eyes and agreed, so they set out into the forest. 
While exploring, Sarah saw a big, tall tree. She said to Jake, "I bet you can't climb that tree!"
Jake was very determined and he managed to climb the whole way up to the top of the tree! Sarah was so proud of her friend and shouted,
"Look at you, Jake! You did it with my support!"
Jake felt proud and suddenly, he wasn't so grumpy anymore. Instead, he was proud of himself and smiling all day!
