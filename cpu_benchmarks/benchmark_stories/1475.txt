Mummy and Daddy decided to buy a pizza. It was a big one. It had lots of yummy cheese and tomato on it. Mummy and Daddy wanted to share it. They were so excited! 
They sat down on the sofa and waited for the pizza to arrive. They heard a knock at the door and rushed off to answer it. It was the pizza man with a big box.
Mummy and Daddy opened the box and it was their pizza. The slices looked big and delicious. Mummy and Daddy clapped their hands. They were very happy.
Mummy and Daddy each took a slice of pizza. They chewed it slowly, savouring the taste. There was so much cheese and tomato juice that it was dribbling down their chins. Mummy and Daddy smiled at each other.
After they had finished their pizza, they both gave a big burp. It was the best pizza they had ever had. Mummy and Daddy were filled with joy.
