Once upon a time, there was a little train. It loved to travel on its track all day long. One day, the train saw a shiny bell and it wanted to ring it. It was so curious about what sound it would make. 
The train chugged and chugged until it arrived at the bell. It rang it with all its might and it made a loud noise. The train was so happy that it rang the bell again and again. 
As the train continued on its track, it saw many other things that made it curious. It saw a bright red apple, a fluffy white cloud, and a big blue bird. The train wanted to explore everything and ring every bell it could find. And so, it continued on its journey, always curious and always ringing.
