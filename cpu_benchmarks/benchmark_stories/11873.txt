Once upon a time, there was an old man who lived in a very small village. The elderly man was very wise and loved spending time with the young children.
One day, the old man decided to lead the children to the nearby forest. The children followed him very carefully and were excited to explore and see what was there.
However, when they reached the forest, they were met by a scary and large black bear! The children were scared and ran away, while the old man stood his ground and bravely faced the bear.
The old man courageously stared at the bear and made loud noises to scare it away. Eventually, the bear left and the old man had prevented any harm coming to the children.
The children were amazed and thanked the elderly man for keeping them safe. From that day forward, the old man became known as the village protector, leading the children each week on adventures and protecting them from danger.
