Once upon a time there was a clever bird. The bird liked to whistle at the top of a tall olive tree. She was so proud of her skills that she boasted about it all the time.
But one day, the bird mixed her words, even though she was so clever. She said she could whistle better than anyone else.
An older, wiser bird from another tree heard what she said. He laughed and explained that he, too, could whistle.
The younger bird was embarrassed and challenged the older bird to a whistle-off at the top of the olive tree. The older bird accepted the challenge and both birds flew to the top of the tree.
But soon the younger bird realized that her challenge was too much for her. She had bitten off more than she could chew. The older bird showed off his expert whistling, while the younger bird's was barely passable. 
The moral of the story is: don't compete with others and overestimate your abilities. It can lead to a bad ending.
