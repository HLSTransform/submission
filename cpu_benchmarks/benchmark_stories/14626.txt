Once there was a little girl who loved sunshine. Every day she would go outside and learn about the world. She loved to watch the distant birds flying in the sky.
One day, the little girl found a family of foxes playing in the grass. The girl was so excited she forgot all about the sunshine. Over time, the little girl kept learning more about the foxes and their home in the grass.
Then one day, it began to rain. All the animals ran away, and the little girl ran back home. She was sad that she could not stay and learn more about the foxes.
But soon the rain stopped and the sun came out again. This time, the little girl was ready to learn. She went back to the foxes and they taught her new things. She felt so happy in the sunshine, learning something new and distant.
