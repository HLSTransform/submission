Once upon a time there were two owls that didn't like each other very much. They used to quarrel a lot. One day it got worse and they started to fight. They both held tight to their branches so that they wouldn't fall out of the tree.
The other animals in the forest had never seen anything like it before. They ran away and hid in their homes. They were scared of what the quarrelsome owls would do next.
After some time, the owls realised that they didn't like fighting and they decided to be nice to each other instead. They let go of their branches, flew around the tree a few times and made friends.
From then on, the two owls stayed friends and never quarrelled again. They both lived happily ever after in the forest.
