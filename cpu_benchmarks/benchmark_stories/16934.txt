Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and blocks. But today they have a problem. They both want the same red car.
"I saw it first!" Tim says.
"No, I did!" Sam says.
They pull the car from each other. They fight.
"Stop!" a voice says. It is Mom. She is the judge. She can solve the problem.
"What is going on here?" Mom asks.
"Tim took my car!" Sam says.
"Sam took my car!" Tim says.
Mom looks at the car. It is a regular car. It is not special.
"Boys, this is a regular car. There are many cars like this. Why don't you share?" Mom says.
"But I want it!" Tim says.
"Me too!" Sam says.
Mom thinks. She has an idea.
"OK, how about this. You can take turns with the car. Tim, you can play with it for five minutes. Then you give it to Sam. Sam, you can play with it for five minutes. Then you give it back to Tim. And so on. Is that fair?" Mom says.
Tim and Sam think. They nod.
"OK, Mom. We can do that." Tim says.
"Me too." Sam says.
They stop fighting. They start playing. They share the car. They are friends again. Mom smiles. She is a good judge.
