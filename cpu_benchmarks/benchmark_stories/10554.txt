Willow and her dad were up very early one morning. Willow was so excited as she had never seen a sunrise before.
Willow's dad said, "Willow, look! It's so beautiful!"
Willow gasped. The yellow and orange sky was so bright and cute.
The both stood there in amazement, just soaking up the view.
They both heard the birds start to sing, and enjoyed the fresh morning smell.
"I love the sunrise, dad" said Willow.
"I'm very glad you do" dad replied, squeezing her hand.
They were both so happy and they knew they would always remember the sunrise together.
