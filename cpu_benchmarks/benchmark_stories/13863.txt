One day, a big cat and a little dog were playing in the park. They were having a lot of fun running and jumping. The big cat found a jar of butter under a tree. The little dog wanted the butter too, so they started to get angry with each other.
The big cat said, "I found the butter, so it is mine!" The little dog said, "No, I want the butter too!" They both wanted the butter so much that they started to fight. They were very angry and sad.
A kind bird saw them fighting and said, "Stop being angry. You can both share the butter." The big cat and the little dog stopped fighting and thought about it. They decided to share the butter and be friends again. They gave each other a big hug and ate the butter together. From that day on, they always shared and played together happily.
