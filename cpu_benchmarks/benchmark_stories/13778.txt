Tim and Mia are playing in the snow. They make a big snowman with a hat, a scarf and a carrot nose. They look for something to give him eyes and a mouth.
"Look, I found some coal!" Tim says. He picks up two black pieces and puts them on the snowman's face. "Now he can see us!"
"Good job, Tim!" Mia says. She finds a small stick and makes a smile under the carrot. "Now he can be happy!"
They stand back and admire their snowman. He looks very nice and friendly.
Suddenly, they hear a loud crunch. They turn around and see a big dog. The dog is chewing on the snowman's nose.
"Hey, stop that!" Tim shouts. He runs towards the dog and tries to pull the carrot away.
But the dog is stronger and faster. He runs away with the carrot in his mouth.
"Oh no, our snowman!" Mia cries. She runs after Tim and the dog.
They chase the dog across the field, but they can't catch him. The dog disappears behind a fence.
Tim and Mia are sad and angry. They go back to their snowman. He has no nose and one of his eyes is missing.
"He looks so funny now!" Mia says. She starts to giggle.
Tim looks at her and smiles. He picks up another piece of coal and puts it where the nose was.
"There, now he has a new nose!" he says. He giggles too.
They hug their snowman and laugh. They don't mind that he is a bit icy and broken. They still love him.
