Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very eager to play. She found a cool thing that she wanted to keep. She held it tightly in her hands and ran around, so happy to have it. 
But then, her older brother saw her. He was very jealous of the thing she was holding. He tried grabbing it out of her hands, but she wouldn't let go. Eventually, he got angry and made her drop the thing. 
The little girl was very sad. She cried and cried, wanting her thing back. Suddenly, her older brother felt bad for making her drop it. He quickly found the thing and placed it back in her hands.
The little girl smiled, happy again. The two of them hugged, and the older brother promised never to be jealous again. And they never were, living happily ever after.
