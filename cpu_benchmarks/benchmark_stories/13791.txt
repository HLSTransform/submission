Anna and Ben were hungry. They wanted to eat pizza. Mom said she would make pizza for them. She put some cheese and sauce on bread and put it in the oven.
"Can we watch the pizza, Mom?" Anna asked.
"Sure, but be careful. The oven is very hot. Don't touch it," Mom said.
Anna and Ben sat on the floor and looked at the oven. They saw the cheese melt and the bread turn brown. They smelled the pizza. It smelled good.
"Is it ready, Mom?" Ben asked.
"Not yet. It needs to change a little more. Wait for the timer to beep," Mom said.
Anna and Ben waited. They heard the timer beep. Mom opened the oven and took out the pizza. She cut it into slices and put them on a plate.
"Here you go, kids. Enjoy your pizza. But be careful. It's very hot. Blow on it first," Mom said.
Anna and Ben took a slice each. They blew on it and took a bite. It was yummy. They smiled and said, "Thank you, Mom. We love pizza."
Mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, kids. I love you."
