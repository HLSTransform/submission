Sara and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. They liked to skip, swing, slide and run. One day, they saw a big sign that said: "Skip Race Today! Win a Medal!"
Sara and Ben wanted to join the race. They loved to skip and they wanted a medal. They went to the sign and saw a man with a whistle and a box of medals.
"Hello, kids. Do you want to skip in the race?" the man asked.
"Yes, please!" Sara and Ben said.
"OK, then. Go to the start line and wait for my whistle. The first one to skip to the finish line gets a medal. Ready, set, go!" the man said and blew his whistle.
Sara and Ben skipped as fast as they could. They skipped past the trees, the flowers, the swings and the slides. They saw the finish line and the man with the medals.
But then, Sara saw a big dog near the finish line. The dog was barking and jumping. Sara was fearful of dogs. She stopped skipping and hid behind a bench.
Ben saw Sara stop and hide. He was confused. He wanted to win the medal, but he also wanted to help Sara. He stopped skipping and ran to Sara.
"Sara, what's wrong? Why did you stop?" Ben asked.
"I'm scared of the dog. He's loud and big. I don't want to skip anymore," Sara said.
"Don't be scared, Sara. The dog is nice. He's just happy to see us. He won't hurt you. Come on, let's skip together. We can share the medal," Ben said.
He took Sara's hand and helped her stand up. He smiled at the dog and said: "Hello, dog. We're skipping in the race. Do you want to skip with us?"
The dog wagged his tail and followed Ben and Sara. They skipped to the finish line and the man gave them a medal.
"Wow, you two are great skippers! And you have a new friend, too. Here's your medal. You can share it or take turns wearing it. Well done!" the man said.
Sara and Ben thanked the man and hugged the dog. They were happy and proud. They put the medal around the dog's neck and skipped back to the park. They had fun playing with the dog and their medal. They were not fearful anymore. They were brave and kind.
