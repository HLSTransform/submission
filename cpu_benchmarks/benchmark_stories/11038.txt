One day, a little girl named Lily was playing in the forest with her doll. She saw a big house made of candy and wanted to eat some. She ran to the house and broke off a piece of chocolate. But then she heard a loud voice.
"Who is eating my house?" the voice said. It was a witch who lived in the candy house. She came out and saw Lily with the chocolate. She was very angry and grabbed Lily by the arm. "You are a naughty girl! You will be my dinner tonight!" the witch said.
Lily was very scared and cried. She tried to run away, but the witch was too strong. She dragged Lily to the house and locked her in a cage. She said, "I will load you into my oven and cook you. Then I will eat you with some honey and nuts."
Lily was very sad and wished she had not eaten the chocolate. She was ashamed of herself for being greedy and foolish. She prayed for someone to help her.
Luckily, a boy named Max was walking in the forest. He heard Lily's cries and followed them. He saw the candy house and the witch. He was brave and smart. He waited until the witch was busy loading some wood into the oven. Then he sneaked to the cage and opened it. He freed Lily and said, "Come on, let's run away!"
Lily was very happy and hugged Max. She said, "Thank you, you are my hero! I'm sorry I ate the witch's house. I will never do that again."
Max said, "You're welcome. I'm glad you're safe. Let's go home and tell our parents what happened."
They ran out of the house and into the forest. The witch saw them and shouted, "Stop, you little thieves! You will pay for this!" She chased them, but they were faster. They reached their village and told their parents everything. The parents were relieved and proud of Max. They scolded Lily, but also forgave her. They gave them some cookies and milk and hugged them. The witch never bothered them again.
