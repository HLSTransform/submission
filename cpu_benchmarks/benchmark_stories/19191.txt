Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved cookies very much. One day, her mommy baked some cookies and put them on the table to cool down. Lily saw the cookies and wanted to touch them, but her mommy said, "No, Lily. You can't touch the cookies yet. They are still hot."
Lily felt sad and jealous because she wanted to eat a cookie. She said, "Mommy, I want a cookie now!" But her mommy said, "Not yet, Lily. You have to wait until they cool down." 
Lily waited and waited, but she was still jealous of the cookies. Finally, her mommy said, "Okay, Lily. You can have a cookie now." Lily was so happy and she ate the cookie with a big smile on her face. From that day on, Lily learned to be patient and wait for things she wanted.
