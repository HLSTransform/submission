Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to walk in the park with her mommy and daddy. One day, they saw a big piano on the sidewalk. Lily's mommy said it looked difficult to play. 
Lily wanted to try, so she walked up to the piano and touched the keys. She played a few notes and smiled. It wasn't difficult at all! Her mommy and daddy were so proud of her. 
From that day on, Lily would walk by the piano every time they went to the park. She would play a little tune and everyone who walked by would stop and listen. Lily was very happy that she could play the piano and make people smile.
