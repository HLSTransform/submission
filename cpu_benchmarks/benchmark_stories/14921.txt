Once upon a time, there was an otter that loved to soar high in the sky. The otter's friends watched longingly as she glided above and around them, far and wide.
One day, the otter's friend, a bunny said, "I wish I could soar in the sky like you do."
The otter replied, "Maybe one day you will, too!"
So, the bunny practiced and practiced until she was able to glide high above the clouds. She felt so happy and amazed.
The otter and bunny soared together and had lots of fun discovering the world from above. They laughed and smiled as they flew over the wide fields and over the tall trees.
They had such a good time soaring above that when it was time for them to come down, they stayed up there a little longerâ€”just to squeeze in a few more adventures in the sky!
