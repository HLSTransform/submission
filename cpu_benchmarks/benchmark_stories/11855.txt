Once upon a time there was a boy named Tom who loved to swing. He would go to the park everyday and swing on the swing set for hours. As he swung are higher and higher, Tom felt so happy and free!
One day, Tom was surprised when he received a very special gift in the mail. Inside, was a beautiful new swing! Tom was so excited and couldn't wait to try it out. He quickly set it up in the backyard and went to give it a try.
Tom started swinging around and around, feeling the freedom and joy it gave him. As he swung, Tom got a little careless and the next thing he knew, he was flying off the swing! But Tom quickly got up and just laughed and smiled. He knew that even though he had gotten a little careless, he was still having so much fun.
