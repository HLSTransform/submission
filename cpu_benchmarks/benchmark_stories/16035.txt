Once upon a time, there was a girl called Jenny. She wanted to go on an adventure. So one day, she went to the hotel. 
When she got there, she saw a fragile window. Without thinking, she opened the window and stuck her head out. Suddenly, something hit her forehead.
“Ouch! Who did this?” shouted Jenny.
A voice came from a room near hers, “I did. I’m sorry. I didn’t expect you to open the window."
Jenny was confused. She stepped closer to the window and said, "Why did you do that?"
The voice replied, “I wanted to show you something special. Looking out of this window is like seeing the world in a new way.”
Jenny shrugged, said goodbye and closed the window. Little did she know that this was just the beginning of her adventure.
