Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to take pictures with her camera. One day, she went for a walk with her mom and dad. They saw a beautiful flower and Lily wanted to take a picture of it. But, suddenly it started to rain and Lily's camera got wet. She was sad because she thought her camera was broken. 
Her dad said, "Don't worry, we will dry it off and it will be okay." Lily was happy to hear that. Her mom added, "We can't control the weather, but we can control our reaction to it." Lily didn't understand what that meant, so her mom explained, "Sometimes things don't go as planned, but we can still find a way to be happy and enjoy the moment." 
Lily learned that it's important to love and appreciate what we have, even if things don't always go as planned. She was grateful for her family who helped her dry her camera and for the beautiful memories they made together.
