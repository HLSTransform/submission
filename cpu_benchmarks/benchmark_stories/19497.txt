Once there was a little boy named Jack. He wanted to borrow his mom's boot to go play in the snow. His mom said yes, so Jack rushed outside and put on the boot. He laughed with joy as he made the first big snow angel. Suddenly Jack fell and he got hurt. He started to cry as he rubbed his hurt knee. 
Jack's mom heard him crying and rushed outside. “What happened, Jack?” she asked. Jack pointed to the boot and told his mom that he feel down because he was wearing the boot. 
His mom hugged him and said, "Jumping in the snow is lots of fun but you should always be careful. Let's go inside and put a bandage on that little knee.” 
Jack smiled and felt better. And he decided that next time he would borrow his mom's boot, he'd be extra careful not to get hurt again!
