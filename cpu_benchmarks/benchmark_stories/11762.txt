Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very shy. She loved to explore the world but sometimes she just needed to stay at home. One day as she was exploring her house she found a special ornament. It was a beautiful color and it sparkled in the sunlight. She decided to take the ornament outside with her to see what adventures she could have with it. 
She enjoyed walking around the park and looking at the trees, birds and flowers. She took the ornament with her everywhere she went. She laughed and smiled as she explored and had fun. 
When it was time to go home she was happy but a little bit shy. She was afraid to go back to her house so she stayed a little bit longer. Finally, she decided to take the ornament home with her as a reminder of the fun she had. She kept the ornament in her bedroom and enjoyed it every day.
