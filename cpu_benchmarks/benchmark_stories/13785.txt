Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play cowboys and robbers. They had a toy pistol that made a loud noise when they pulled the trigger. One day, they found a real pistol in their dad's closet. It was filthy and rusty, but they thought it looked cool.
"Let's play with this pistol," Tom said. "It will be more fun than the toy one."
"No, Tom, we can't," Sam said. "Dad said we should never touch his pistol. It is dangerous and can hurt us or someone else."
"Come on, Sam, don't be a baby," Tom said. "I know how to use it. It will be fun. I will encourage you to be brave and try it."
Tom took the pistol and pointed it at a can on the fence. He pulled the trigger, but nothing happened. He tried again, but still nothing. He got angry and shook the pistol.
"Stupid pistol, why won't you work?" he shouted.
Suddenly, the pistol went off with a loud bang. The bullet hit the can and made a hole in it. Tom and Sam were shocked and scared. They dropped the pistol and ran inside the house.
They heard their dad coming home and saw him find the pistol and the can. He was very angry and worried. He called them and asked them what they had done.
"We're sorry, Dad," Tom and Sam said. "We found your pistol and wanted to play with it. We didn't know it was real and could shoot."
Dad hugged them and said, "I'm glad you're not hurt, but you did a very bad thing. You should never touch a pistol or any other weapon. They are not toys, they are tools for grown-ups who know how to use them safely and responsibly. You could have hurt yourselves or someone else. You should always listen to me and follow the rules. Do you understand?"
"Yes, Dad, we understand," Tom and Sam said. "We're sorry, we won't do it again."
Dad said, "I forgive you, but you have to promise me you will never touch a pistol or any other weapon again. And you have to do some chores to make up for your mistake. Now go and wash your hands, they are filthy from the pistol."
Tom and Sam nodded and went to wash their hands. They learned their lesson and never played with a pistol or any other weapon again. They also learned to encourage each other to do good things, not bad things.
