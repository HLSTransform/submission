Once upon a time there was a little boy. He wanted to go outside and play with his friends. But his mom said no. 
The little boy was sad. He asked his mom, "Why can't I go outside?" 
His mom said, "There's no one around here to play with. You can't go outside unless someone comes to play with you." 
The little boy looked out of his window, hoping that someone would come quick. Suddenly, he saw someone! He shouted, "Mom! Someone is available to play with me!" 
His mom smiled and said, "Alright, go ahead my dear. Have fun!" 
The little boy cheered, jumped out of his chair, and raced outside. He was so happy that someone had come to play with him. The two of them played all types of games, laughed, and had fun until the sun went down.
