Once upon a time, there was a rabbit named Rosie. She loved to eat radishes. One day, she saw a big, red radish in a garden. She went to take it, but the farmer caught her. 
The farmer said, "Rosie, you can't take my radish. It's not nice to take things that don't belong to you." 
Rosie felt bad and said, "I'm sorry. I just wanted the radish because it looked so yummy." 
The farmer smiled and said, "That's okay. I forgive you. Let's be peaceful and share the radish together." 
They ate the radish together and Rosie felt happy. She learned that it's always better to share and be peaceful than to take things that don't belong to you. 
From that day on, Rosie always asked before taking anything and made sure to share with others. And she never forgot the time she learned the peaceful way to be a good rabbit.
