Mum suggested that they turn off the lamp in the living room. Dad said it was time for bed and they needed to get some rest. So they did as mum suggested and the room went dark.
Mum said they needed something to make them feel comfortable and cosy. She had a suggestion! She suggested they get a soft blanket to cover themselves.
Dad agreed and they both went to the bedroom to find a special blanket. Mum found a lovely one that was soft and bright pink. She cuddled it in her arms and said it was perfect.
With the soft blanket in their arms, they headed back to the living room and spread it on the sofa. They both snuggled in and felt warm and cosy. Dad turned on the soft lamp and mum said it was just the perfect amount of light for this special night.
