Once upon a time, there were two brothers named Jack and James. They were playing catch with a ball in the garden, when suddenly their mother came running towards them. She wanted to prevent them from staying outside too long, so she called out: "Jack and James, it's time to come inside now and wait for dinner!" 
The boys reluctantly stopped their game, but Jack said: "Oh, please can we wait a little bit longer until the game is finished? We were having lots of fun!" 
But their mother just shook her head, and said: "No, you must come inside now. Come on, time to go!"
The boys did as they were told, and followed their mother into the house. Soon, the delicious smell of dinner cooking filled the air and made them all very happy. They all enjoyed their dinner, and both boys had lovely, contented smiles on their faces.
