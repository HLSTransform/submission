Once upon a time, there was a round orange ball who wanted more than anything to reach the top of the hill. He tried and he tried, but the hill was so big and he was so small that he couldn't do it on his own.
He saw a dependable old friend of his and asked for his help. The friend said yes, and together they started to struggle up the hill. The round orange ball kept slipping because the hill was so steep, but his friend kept pushing him along bit by bit.
Finally, the round orange ball made it to the top of the hill. He was so happy and thanked his dependable friend for helping him. With a smile, the two of them ran back down the hill, never to forget their struggle up the hill that day.
