Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play together at the park. One day, they saw a big sign that said: "Fun Fair Today! Games, Rides, Prizes!" They ran to their moms and asked if they could go.
"Sure, but you have to stay with us and be careful," their moms said. "And don't spend all your money on the games. They are very hard to win."
Lily and Ben nodded and followed their moms to the fair. They saw many colorful things and heard many loud noises. They rode on the merry-go-round, the slide, and the train. They ate cotton candy, popcorn, and ice cream. They had a lot of fun.
Then they saw a game that looked very easy. It was called "Ring Toss". There were many bottles on a table and many rings on a hook. The man who ran the game said: "Throw a ring and win a prize! Any ring, any bottle, any prize! Only one dollar a try!"
Lily and Ben wanted to play. They each had one dollar left. They looked at the prizes. There were dolls, cars, balls, and books. But there was one prize that they both wanted more than anything. It was a big, fluffy, rainbow unicorn. It was the most beautiful thing they had ever seen.
"Can we have the unicorn if we win?" Lily asked the man.
"Sure, if it's available," the man said. "But it's very popular. Someone might take it before you."
Lily and Ben hoped that no one would take the unicorn. They gave the man their dollars and took their rings. They threw them as hard as they could. But none of their rings landed on a bottle. They all bounced off or fell on the ground.
"Oh no, we lost!" Lily said.
"Sorry, kids, better luck next time," the man said. "But you can have a consolation prize. Choose any of these small toys."
Lily and Ben looked at the small toys. They were not very nice. They were cheap and broken and dirty. They did not want them. They wanted the unicorn.
They looked at the unicorn. It was still there. No one had taken it. It was still available.
"Please, mister, can we have the unicorn instead?" Ben asked.
The man looked at them. He saw their sad faces and their hopeful eyes. He felt sorry for them. He smiled and said: "You know what, kids, you can have the unicorn. You tried very hard and you were very polite. You deserve a special prize."
Lily and Ben could not believe it. They were so happy. They thanked the man and hugged the unicorn. They shared it and played with it. They named it Sparkle. It was their favorite toy.
They learned that sometimes, even if you lose, you can still win. And sometimes, the best prizes are the ones that you hope for.
