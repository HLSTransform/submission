Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a friendly dog named Spot. Spot loved to play outside and taste all the yummy treats his owner gave him. He liked to chase birds and run around in the park.
One day, Spot saw a big truck. It was stuck in traffic. The truck had a big box in the back. Spot was curious and wanted to see what was inside the box. He thought it might be full of treats for him to taste.
Spot went to the truck and the driver opened the box. Inside, there were lots of friendly puppies! They all jumped out and played with Spot. They tasted treats together and had a great time. The traffic cleared and the truck drove away, but Spot and his new friends played all day long.
