Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to sing and dance. She wanted to be in a band with her friends, but they didn't have any instruments. One day, Lily's mom gave her a thick book about how to make musical instruments with things around the house.
Lily and her friends read the book and decided to make their own instruments. They used pots and pans for drums, rubber bands for guitars, and a tissue box for a microphone. They practiced every day and soon they were really good.
One day, the town was having a big parade and Lily and her friends wanted to play their music. They marched down the street and everyone loved their band. They were so happy that they could do something they loved and make other people happy too. From that day on, Lily and her friends played in their own band and had lots of fun.
