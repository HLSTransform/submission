Once upon a time, there was an angel. He flew through the sky with soft wings. His name was George. He loved to fly around the world and make people happy. 
One day, George wanted to find someone special to play with. So he flew to a sunny meadow and saw a little girl. She had big brown eyes and curly hair. Her name was Annabel.
George and Annabel had lots of fun. They played tag and hide and seek. Annabel told George all about her family and he listened with a smile. They were great friends!
But then it was time for Annabel to go home. She said goodbye and George promised to come back and visit soon. But days went by and he didn't come back. Annabel started to miss George and wondered when he would come back.
Finally, George returned and Annabel ran to give him a big hug. George was the special angel she had been missing and he was so soft and kind. From that day on, they were best friends forever.
