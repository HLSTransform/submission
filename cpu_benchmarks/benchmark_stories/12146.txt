Once upon a time there was a boy called Bob who lived in a small village. He was very poor and so he worked hard every day. One day, Bob decided he wanted to be rich. He heard that at the top of the hill, there was a creek with a lot of gold in it. So he decided to go up the hill and try his luck.
Bob entered the creek and started looking for gold. He rummaged about for a long time but did not find anything. He decided to keep searching and then suddenly he felt something! It was a large lump of gold! He picked it up and he was so excited.
Bob made his way back down the hill, still holding his lump of precious gold. But then, just as he reached the bottom of the hill, he noticed a figure coming towards him. It was a robber! The robber was pointing a sharp knife at Bob and shouting, "Give me that gold! Give me that gold or else!"
Bob had no choice so he gave the robber the gold. The robber then ran away with it, leaving Bob all alone. Bob was feeling sad and disappointed, he had wanted to be rich but now he was back to being poor.
