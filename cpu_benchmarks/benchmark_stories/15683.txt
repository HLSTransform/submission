Once upon a time there was a beautiful dragon. He lived in a magical forest, and very rarely did people ever come by.
One day, a little girl named Susie was exploring the forest. She stumbled upon the dragon, who was sleeping in a cave. Susie was so curious that she decided to talk to the dragon. She spoke softly, “Excuse me, Mr. Dragon.”
The dragon slowly opened his eyes and responded, “What do you want?”
Susie thought for a bit, and then answered, “I want to store something special in your cave. Could I do that?”
The dragon laughed, “Oh, sure. Go ahead and store anything you want!”
So Susie went to the nearby meadow and gathered some pretty flowers. She brought them back to the dragon’s cave and carefully stored them. The dragon watched her carefully and smiled.
After Susie finished storing the flowers, she said goodbye to the dragon and thanked him. He simply replied with a kind nod.
Susie was so glad that she got to store something special in the dragon’s cave. She was sure she would always remember how beautiful the dragon looked that day.
