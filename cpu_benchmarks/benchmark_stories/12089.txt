Once upon a time, there was a big party. There was music playing and everyone was dancing. But then, two friends wanted to dance with the same person. They both felt competitive and wanted to be the best. One of them started to shout at the other. 
The music stopped and everyone looked at them. They were both very angry. The person they both wanted to dance with felt sad and left the party. 
After a while, they both realized that shouting was not the right thing to do. They said sorry to each other and started to dance together. The music started again and everyone joined in. They all had so much fun dancing together and forgot about the argument. The end.
