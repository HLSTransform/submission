Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Max. Max liked to jog in the park with his owner. One day, Max's owner saw a ball and threw it far away. Max ran to get it, but he saw a cat on the way. The cat said, "I am flexible, I can lie down and sleep anywhere." Max thought that was cool, so he lied down next to the cat and took a nap. When Max woke up, he saw that the ball was gone. He barked and searched for it, but he couldn't find it. Max and his owner went back home, but Max couldn't stop thinking about the ball. The next day, Max went back to the park and found the ball lying in the grass. He was so happy that he wagged his tail and ran back to his owner.
