Once upon a time there was a boy. He liked to make lots of crazy signs. He would do circles in the air and whistle and buzz like a bee. He made the craziest signs!
One day he saw a funny thing. It was a box with crazy signs all over it. He wondered what was inside the box. He had never seen such a crazy thing before.
So he decided to try it. He signed the box and opened it up. When he opened it, he was very surprised! Inside the box was lots of candy. He smiled and signed with joy.
He held up the candy and said, "Look at my crazy signs!" Everyone laughed. He was so happy he had signed the box and opened it up. It was a very special thing!
