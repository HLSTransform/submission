Once upon a time, on a Wednesday, there was a chubby cat. The cat saw a flower that was about to bloom. The cat was very happy because it liked to watch flowers bloom.
The cat said to the flower, "Hi flower, I can't wait for you to bloom!" The flower did not say anything because flowers cannot talk. But the cat did not know that. The cat waited and waited for the flower to bloom.
But then, a big wind came and blew the flower away. The chubby cat was very sad. It cried and cried because it could not see the flower bloom. The end.
