Once upon a time, there was an old man who lived alone in a small house. He loved to collect gems and keep them safe in a box. One day, he decided to mail a letter to his friend who lived far away.
As he walked to the mailbox, he felt something strange. He looked around and saw a shiny gem on the ground. He picked it up and put it in his pocket. He thought it was his lucky day.
He mailed the letter and went back home. As he opened his gem box, he noticed that one of his gems was missing. He searched everywhere but couldn't find it. Suddenly, he remembered the shiny gem he found on the ground. He realized that it was not his lucky day after all.
