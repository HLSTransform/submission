Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, Lily found a shiny penny on the ground. She picked it up and put it in her pocket.
Later that day, Lily and her friends were playing on the swings. Lily noticed that the sky was getting gloomy and dark. She didn't like it when it was dark outside. She felt scared.
Suddenly, Lily's friend shouted, "Let's jump off the swings!" Lily was hesitant at first, but then she remembered the penny in her pocket. She knew it was lucky and would keep her safe. So, she took a deep breath and jumped off the swing. It was so much fun! From then on, Lily wasn't scared of the dark anymore.
