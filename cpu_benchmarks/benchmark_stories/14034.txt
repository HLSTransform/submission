Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to run and play. One day, Max saw a big, red ball. The ball was amazing! It was the most amazing ball he had ever seen. Max knew he had to get that ball.
Max ran and ran to catch the ball. He ran to the west, where the sun goes to sleep. As he ran, he saw a big tree. Max knew he had to pause and rest. He was very tired. But he did not forget about the amazing ball.
After his rest, Max ran some more. He ran and ran until he found the amazing ball. He was so happy! He played with the ball all day long. And from that day on, Max and the amazing ball were always together.
