Once upon a time, there was a little bird who loved to sing and be happy. It was so cheerful that it made everyone smile. One day, the little bird wanted to escape its cage. It had been longing for freedom for some time!
The little bird tried to open the door of the cage but could not find the way out. Just when it was about to give up, the bird had an idea. It remembered someone had told it that wisdom could help you find a way out.
The little bird thought and thought, and finally came up with an idea. It found a tiny hole in the cage and started to cheep and chirp. Suddenly the door opened and the bird flew away, flapping its wings with joy.
The little bird was free at last! Everywhere it flew it brought with it the gift of cheerful singing.
The amazing little bird now reminds us all that wisdom can help us escape any trouble.
