Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was very playful and loved to run in the park. One day, Max's owner gave him a treat and told him to stay. Max sat down and waited patiently for his owner to come back. 
While Max was waiting, he saw some other dogs playing with their owners. Max wanted to play too, but he knew he had to stay until his owner came back. Finally, his owner returned and Max got to play with his favorite ball. 
Max was so happy that he wagged his tail and licked his owner's face. His owner gave him another treat for being such a good boy and staying when he was told to. From that day on, Max knew that if he stayed when he was told to, he would always get to play and get treats too.
