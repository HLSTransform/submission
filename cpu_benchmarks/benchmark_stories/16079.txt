Once upon a time there lived a playful fox called Max. Every day Max would go out to explore the forest, looking for something to do.
One day, as he walked by a berry bush, he noticed a curious little bird. The bird was sitting on a branch and seemed to be studying something very intently.
“What are you doing?” asked Max.
The bird replied, “I’m studying the different kinds of berries. I’m trying to learn which ones taste the best!”
Max was fascinated as the bird nibbled on one berry after another, always paying close attention to the taste and texture. He was so interested that he decided to join in and study the berries as well.
For the rest of the day, the fox and the bird had a lot of fun exploring the different types of berries in the bush. They tasted sweet, tart, and juicy berries, and they laughed and played in the berry patch until it was time to go home.
