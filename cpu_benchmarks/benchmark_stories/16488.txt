Sam liked to record his voice on the computer. He had a big microphone and a button that made his voice sound funny. He liked to make silly noises and songs and listen to them later.
One day, his sister Lily wanted to use the computer too. She had to do her homework and she needed to type some words. She asked Sam to stop recording and let her use the computer.
"No, I want to record more!" Sam said. He did not want to share the computer. He thought it was his and he could do whatever he wanted.
"Please, Sam, I need the computer for school. You can record later." Lily said. She tried to be nice and patient. She knew that Sam was younger and he liked to play.
But Sam did not listen. He kept recording and making loud noises. He did not care about Lily's homework. He thought it was boring and he wanted to have fun.
Lily got angry and sad. She did not know what to do. She needed the computer but Sam would not let her. She thought that Sam was being mean and selfish.
Then, she had an idea. She went to the kitchen and got some cheese. She put the cheese under the microphone and waited.
Soon, the cheese became smelly. It smelled very bad and it made Sam's nose wrinkle. He did not like the smell at all. He stopped recording and looked for the source of the smell.
He saw the cheese under the microphone and he realized what Lily had done. He felt ashamed and sorry. He knew that he had been wrong and he had hurt Lily's feelings.
He took the cheese away and went to Lily. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was not nice to you. You can use the computer now. I will record later."
Lily smiled and hugged Sam. She said, "Thank you, Sam. I'm sorry I put cheese under your microphone. That was not nice either. I'm glad you are my brother."
They both learned a lesson that day. They learned to share and to respect each other's needs. They learned that being kind and generous is better than being greedy and rude. They learned that cheese is not a good toy.
