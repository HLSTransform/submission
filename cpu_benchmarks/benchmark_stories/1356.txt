Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was wise beyond her years. She was always asking questions and exploring the world around her. One day, she decided to explore the woods near her home. She marched into the woods and started to discover all the wonderful things that were hidden there.
The girl found a secret path which she quickly followed. She discovered many beautiful plants, insects and fascinating creatures. The girl felt so happy and excited that she even started singing and dancing along the path.
At the end of the path, the girl found a big tree. The tree had a hole in the trunk and her curiosity got the better of her. The girl got on top of a log and climbed into the hole. To her surprise, she discovered a wondrous place filled with glittering lights and many magical things.
The girl felt wise for finding the hidden world inside the tree. She wanted to explore more, but the sun was setting and it was time for her to go home. The girl carefully climbed out of the tree and returned home, feeling pleased and happy with all she had discovered.
