One day, a taxi was driving down the street. The taxi was rough and bumpy. It made a lot of noise. Inside the taxi, there was a little girl named Lily and her mom.
Lily said, "Mom, I am tired. I want to sleep." Her mom smiled and said, "Okay, Lily. Close your eyes and sleep."
As the taxi drove on, Lily closed her eyes. She tried to sleep, but the rough taxi made it hard. She tossed and turned in her seat. Lily's mom held her hand to help her feel safe.
Soon, the taxi stopped at their house. Lily woke up and looked around. She was happy to be home. She said, "Thank you, mom, for the fun ride." Her mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, Lily. Now, let's go inside and get some rest."
Lily and her mom got out of the rough taxi. They went inside their house and got ready for bed. This time, Lily slept in her soft, warm bed.
