"Come here my little one!" said mum, gently lifting her small daughter. The little girl was three and her name was Molly.
Molly sighed and said "I worry about lots of things!"
Mum smiled and said "But why? You're so young, there's nothing much to worry about!"
Molly shrugged.
Mum held her close and said "Let's get you a massage. That always helps when we're feeling anxious or worried."
They walked to the massage parlour where mum had booked an appointment. Inside the room, there were lots of red cushions and soothing music playing. The therapist said "Good morning! Let's get you lying down on this soft cushion and we'll soon get your worries away."
Molly lay down and the therapist started to give her a special massage. As she slowly massaged Molly's back, she could feel the tension start to ease away.
When the massage was finished, Molly said "That felt so nice! I'm not so worried anymore."
Mum smiled and said "See, that's my little girl - strong and brave!"
