Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to enjoy playing outside. One hot day, she saw a letter on the ground. The letter was pretty and colorful. Sue picked up the letter and wanted to see what it said.
Sue took the letter to her mom. Her mom read the letter out loud. The letter said, "If you enjoy this hot day, you will find a big surprise." Sue got very excited. She wanted to find the surprise.
Sue and her mom looked all around the yard. They looked under rocks, in the bushes, and behind the tree. They could not find the surprise. Sue felt sad. The hot day was not fun anymore. The letter did not tell the truth. Sue and her mom went inside, and they did not find the surprise.
