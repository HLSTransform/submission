Once upon a time, there was a big orange lion. He lived in a jungle with many trees and plants. One day, the lion saw a tiny ant walking on the ground. The ant was carrying a big piece of food.
The lion wanted to eat the food, but the ant said, "No, it's mine!" The lion roared loudly, but the ant didn't get scared. Instead, the ant said, "I am small, but I am strong."
The lion realized that the ant was right. He apologized and walked away. From that day on, the lion and the ant became friends and shared their food with each other.
