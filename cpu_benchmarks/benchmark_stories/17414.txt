Lily was very enthusiastic about her new baby brother. She wanted to hug him, kiss him, and play with him all the time. But Mommy and Daddy said she had to be gentle and careful with the baby, because he was very small and fragile.
One day, Mommy and Daddy had to go out for a while, and they asked Grandma to look after Lily and the baby. Grandma was very nice and kind, and she let Lily help her with some chores. Lily helped Grandma make some cookies, fold some clothes, and water some flowers. She was very proud and happy.
Then, Grandma said, "Lily, do you want to read a story with me and the baby?" Lily nodded eagerly. She loved stories, especially the ones with animals and princesses. Grandma picked up the baby from his crib and sat on the couch. She told Lily to sit next to her, and handed her a big book with colorful pictures.
Lily opened the book and pointed to a picture of a lion. She said, "Look, Grandma, a lion! He is big and strong and loud. Roar!" She made a roaring sound and laughed.
Grandma smiled and said, "Yes, Lily, that's a lion. He is the king of the jungle. But he is also very gentle and loving with his family. Just like you are with your baby brother." She kissed the baby's head and said, "Do you want to hold him for a little while?"
Lily nodded again. She was very excited. Grandma carefully placed the baby in Lily's arms and said, "Hold him close and softly, Lily. He likes to feel your warmth and hear your heartbeat. You are a very good big sister."
Lily felt the baby's soft skin and hair, and his tiny fingers and toes. She looked at his face and saw his eyes open. He looked at her and made a cooing sound. Lily felt a warm and fuzzy feeling in her chest. She said, "Hi, baby. I love you. You are my brother. I will always take care of you." She kissed his cheek and hugged him gently.
Grandma watched them with a tender smile. She said, "You are very sweet, Lily. I love you too. You make me very happy." She hugged them both and said, "Now, let's read the story together, shall we?" She opened the book and began to read. Lily listened and looked at the pictures, while holding the baby close. She felt very happy too. She thought, "This is the best day ever."
