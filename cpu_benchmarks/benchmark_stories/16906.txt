Ben and Mia like to play with their toy boat in the bathtub. They pretend to be sailors and go on adventures. They have a green flag with a star on their boat.
One day, they hear a knock on the bathroom door. It is their mom. She says, "Time to get out, kids. Dinner is ready."
Ben and Mia pause their game. They do not want to stop playing. They want to sail more.
"Can we play a little more, mom?" Ben asks.
"Please, mom?" Mia adds.
Mom smiles and says, "Okay, but only five more minutes. Then you have to dry off and come to the table."
"Yay, thank you, mom!" Ben and Mia say. They hug mom and then go back to their boat.
They sail to a new island. They see a monkey and a parrot. They say hello to them. They share some bananas and crackers. They have fun.
Then they hear mom call again. "Time's up, kids. Come on, dinner is getting cold."
Ben and Mia pause their game again. They say goodbye to the monkey and the parrot. They promise to come back soon.
They take their boat and their green flag. They get out of the bathtub. They dry off and put on their clothes. They run to the kitchen.
They see mom has made pizza and salad. They smell yummy. They say thank you to mom. They sit down and eat. They tell mom about their adventure.
Mom listens and smiles. She is happy they have a good imagination. She is proud of her little sailors.
