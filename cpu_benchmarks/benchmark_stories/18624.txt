Once upon a time, there was a big kangaroo. He was very strong and could jump really high. One day, he saw a little bird with a broken wing. The bird was very fragile and couldn't fly. The kangaroo felt sad and wanted to help the bird.
He went to the nearby pond to get some water for the bird when he saw a hunter. The hunter had a gun and was trying to shoot the kangaroo. The kangaroo quickly jumped away and ran towards the bird. He knew he had to protect the fragile bird from the hunter.
The hunter tried to shoot the kangaroo again, but he missed. The kangaroo jumped higher and higher until he was out of sight. The bird was safe and the kangaroo was a hero. From that day on, the kangaroo and the bird became best friends and lived happily ever after.
