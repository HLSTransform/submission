Once upon a time there was a mom and a dad who wanted to have a successful mystery hunt fun day with their little girl, who was three years old. 
So they set up a scavenger hunt in the backyard, filled with clues and little funny things to find. They also put a few special treats around the garden for when she finished the hunt.
The little girl was so excited! She ran around looking for clues with her little basket. She was having so much fun! 
When she found the final clue she ran to her mom and dad to show them. 
"Mom, Dad, I did it! I caught the mystery!" The little girl said joyfully. 
Her mom and dad were so proud of her. They praised her for being so successful. 
The family hugged and said their congratulations. Finally, the little girl received the special treat she had been waiting for. 
The end.
