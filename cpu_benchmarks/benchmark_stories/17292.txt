Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to look up at the stars in the sky. He would lay down on his comfortable blanket and stare at the universe above him.
One night, Timmy saw a shooting star. He was so excited and shouted, "Wow! Look at the star! It's so pretty!" His mom heard him and came outside to see what was happening.
"What are you looking at, Timmy?" his mom asked.
"I saw a shooting star! It was rocking in the sky!" Timmy said.
"That's amazing, Timmy! Did you make a wish?" his mom asked.
"Yes, I did! I wished for a toy rocket to play with!" Timmy said.
His mom smiled and said, "I hope your wish comes true, Timmy." And they both continued to lay on the comfortable blanket and look up at the beautiful universe above them.
