Once there was a little boy named Joe. He was only three years old and loved to tell jokes. One day, Joe and his mom were walking home from the park when they saw a huge hot air balloon. 
“Look, Mommy,” Joe said, pointing at the balloon. “It’s so big.”
“Yes, it certainly is,” said his mom. “Let’s guess how high it is.”
Joe thought for a moment and then he said, “I think it’s one thousand feet.”
His mom laughed. “That’s too high, Joe.”
Joe was disappointed, but he wanted to prove he was right. He remembered the joke he heard at the park earlier.
“I know a joke that will tell us,” he said excitedly. He recited the joke he remembered, making his mom laugh.
Suddenly, the balloon began to drift away. It was getting higher and higher. 
Joe and his mom ran to catch up to it, but the balloon moved too fast. Joe looked at his mom and said, “I guess I was right - it is one thousand feet high!”
Joe’s mom smiled and said, “You were right, Joe. That’s one hot joke
