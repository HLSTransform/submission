Once upon a time, there was a very unusual kid. His name was Jack and he was three years old. He had a special power: he could lift things up with his mind!
One day, he was walking along the street and saw something strange. It was a lung, the organ that helps people breathe. He was amazed and he wanted to take a closer look.
Jack thought about his special power, then he took a deep breath. He closed his eyes and concentrated. Suddenly, the lung lifted up off the ground. Jack opened his eyes in surprise. He had done it!
He laughed in delight and waved goodbye to the lung as it sailed into the sky. With his special power, Jack knew he had something really unusual.
