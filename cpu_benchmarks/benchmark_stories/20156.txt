Sam and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big truck. The truck has many boxes. The truck is moving to a new house.
"Look, Sam, a truck!" Mia says. "It is very big and loud."
"Yes, Mia, it is. Maybe someone is moving to a new house. Do you want to see?" Sam says.
They run to the truck. They see a man and a woman. The man is carrying a box. The woman is holding a cat.
"Hello, we are Sam and Mia. We live in the park. Who are you?" Sam says.
"Hello, we are Ben and Anna. We are moving to this house. This is our cat, Fluffy. We are happy to meet you." Ben says.
"Can we be your friends? Can we play with Fluffy?" Mia says.
"Of course, you can. Fluffy likes to play. But be careful, he has sharp claws. We are glad to have new friends. Do you want to help us move?" Anna says.
"Yes, we do. We are strong. We can carry small boxes. We can also visit your house when you are done." Sam says.
They help Ben and Anna move. They carry small boxes and toys. They also play with Fluffy. They have fun. They are happy. They make new friends.
