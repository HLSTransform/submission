Once there was a fish who loved to bounce. Every day he would jump out of the water and bounce as high as he could. He was always so happy when he bounced.
One day the fish decided it would be fun to explore the world outside of the water. He jumped up and bounced out onto the land. He looked around and everything was so new and exciting.
Soon the fish got bored. Everything was so boring. He wanted to bounce again. So he found a big bendy tree and he bounced up and down it. It was so much fun bouncing on the tree and it made the fish smile. 
Eventually the fish had to go back to the water. He bounced into the water and felt so happy again. He knew he would always enjoy bouncing and exploring.
