Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys in his room. One day, he decided to perform a magic show for his stuffed animals. He set up a stage in his chamber and put on a hat and cape.
Timmy's dog, Max, watched him perform his magic tricks. Max was very impressed! Timmy felt proud of himself for being so independent and putting on a show all by himself. After the show was over, Timmy and Max snuggled up in bed together. Timmy fell asleep dreaming of his next big performance.
