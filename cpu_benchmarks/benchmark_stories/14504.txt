Jimmy had a hockey stick. He liked to play with it. One day, his dad took out a pair of scissors. 
He made a loud noise when he cut the hockey stick. Jimmy was scared. He started to cry.
But then he saw that his dad had made the hockey stick shorter. He clapped his hands and laughed. Now Jimmy could play with the hockey stick better!
They went outside and Jimmy was running with the hockey stick. He heard a loud noise again. It was his dad. He was cutting another piece of the hockey stick. 
Jimmy smiled. His dad had made the stick even shorter! Now it was the perfect size for Jimmy to play with.
