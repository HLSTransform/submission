Lily and Ben were twins who liked to do different things. Lily liked to bake cakes and cookies with Mom. Ben liked to paint pictures and cars with Dad. One day, Mom and Dad had to go out for a while. They told Lily and Ben to be good and not make a mess.
Lily wanted to bake a cake for Mom and Dad. She found a recipe book and some ingredients in the kitchen. She put them in a big bowl and mixed them with a spoon. She poured the batter into a pan and put it in the oven. She set the timer and waited.
Ben wanted to paint a picture for Mom and Dad. He found some paint and brushes in the garage. He took them to the living room and spread a newspaper on the floor. He got a big piece of paper and started to paint. He used red, blue, yellow and green. He made a rainbow and a sun and a house.
Lily heard the timer beep. She ran to the kitchen and opened the oven. She saw a big, fluffy cake. She was very happy. She took it out and put it on a rack to cool. She looked for some frosting and sprinkles to decorate it.
Ben finished his picture. He was very proud. He looked for a place to hang it. He saw a nail on the wall. He climbed on a chair and tried to reach it. He was too short. He saw a stool in the corner. He got down and dragged it to the wall. He climbed on it and reached the nail. He hung his picture.
Lily found some frosting and sprinkles in the cupboard. She took them to the cake. She saw Ben's picture on the wall. She did not like it. She thought it was ugly and messy. She wanted to take it down. She climbed on the stool and pulled the picture. She heard a rip. She saw a hole in the paper. She gasped.
Ben heard Lily gasp. He ran to the living room. He saw Lily on the stool and his picture on the floor. He saw the hole in the paper. He was very angry. He shouted at Lily.
"Hey, that's my picture! You broke it! You are mean!"
Lily shouted back at Ben.
"No, that's my wall! Your picture is bad! You are silly!"
They started to fight. They pushed and pulled and yelled. They knocked over the stool and the chair. They spilled the frosting and the sprinkles. They made a big mess.
Mom and Dad came back. They saw Lily and Ben and the mess. They were very serious. They said to Lily and Ben.
"What is going on here? Why are you fighting? Why did you make a mess?"
Lily and Ben stopped fighting. They looked at Mom and Dad. They felt sorry. They said to Mom and Dad.
"We are sorry. We wanted to make you a cake and a picture. But we did not like each other's things. We were not good. We were not nice."
Mom and Dad looked at the cake and the picture. They saw the love and the effort. They smiled. They said to Lily and Ben.
"Thank you for the cake and the picture. They are both beautiful. We love them. And we love you. But you need to learn to respect and appreciate each other's things. And you need to clean up this mess."
Lily and Ben nodded. They hugged Mom and Dad. They hugged each other. They said to each other.
"I'm sorry. I like your cake. I like your picture. You are good. You are nice."
They cleaned up the mess. They ate the cake. They looked at the picture. They were happy.
