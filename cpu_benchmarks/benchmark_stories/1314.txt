Once there was a little girl called Daisy. She was three years old. One day, Daisy and her family went out for dinner. Daisy was very tired when they arrived at the restaurant.
When Daisy's food arrived, she realised that she had forgotten to bring a napkin. She began to look around the restaurant and act very worried. Her dad then came over and gave Daisy a big napkin to use! Daisy was very happy and gave her dad a big smile. 
After finishing her dinner, Daisy was feeling much better and more energetic. She acted up and ran around the restaurant, making everyone laugh. 
Daisy's dad was very happy to see his daughter feeling more lively. He gave Daisy the napkin and said, "Let's go home now so you can get a nice rest!" Daisy smiled, kissed her dad, and ran to the car.
