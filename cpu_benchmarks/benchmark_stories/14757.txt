Anna loves to sing. She sings in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. She sings to her toys, to her mommy, and to her daddy. She sings happy songs, sad songs, and silly songs.
One day, Anna and her daddy go to the park. They see a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. Anna wants to play with everything. She runs to the slide and slides down. Whee! She runs to the swing and swings high. Wow! She runs to the sandbox and makes a castle. Yay!
Then, she sees a bird on a tree. The bird is red and yellow and blue. It is very pretty. The bird opens its mouth and sings. Tweet, tweet, tweet! Anna likes the bird's song. She wants to sing with the bird. She opens her mouth and sings. La, la, la!
The bird hears Anna's song. It looks at her and tilts its head. It sings back. Tweet, tweet, tweet! Anna smiles and sings again. La, la, la! The bird and Anna sing together. They make a beautiful music.
Daddy watches Anna and the bird. He is very proud of his little girl. He thinks she is very intelligent. He walks to her and hugs her. He says, "You are a wonderful singer, Anna. You and the bird are friends. I love you very much." Anna hugs him back. She says, "I love you too, daddy. You are the best daddy in the world." They kiss and laugh. They are very happy.
