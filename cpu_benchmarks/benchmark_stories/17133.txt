Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a wagon that he loved to play with. It was red and shiny, and he used it to carry his toys around.
One day, Timmy saw an ugly monster in the park. The monster was big and scary, but Timmy wasn't afraid. He waved at the monster and said hello.
To Timmy's surprise, the monster smiled and waved back. The monster wasn't so scary after all. Timmy even let the monster ride in his wagon, and they became friends. From that day on, Timmy and the monster played together every day in the park.
