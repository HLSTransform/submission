Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a ball and a kite. They run and laugh and have fun.
But then, Lily sees a big dog. She is scared of big dogs. She drops the ball and runs away. The big dog chases the ball. Ben tries to get the ball back, but the dog is faster.
"Hey, that's not fair!" Ben shouts. "That's our ball!"
The dog does not listen. It runs away with the ball. Ben is sad and angry. He sits on the grass and cries.
Lily comes back. She sees Ben crying. She feels sorry for him.
"I'm sorry, Ben," she says. "I was scared of the dog. I didn't mean to drop the ball."
She kneels next to him and hugs him. "It's okay, Lily," Ben says. "I know you were scared. But I wish we had our ball back."
"Maybe we can find another ball," Lily says. "Or we can fly the kite. Or we can go home and have lunch. Mom made sandwiches and cookies."
Ben smiles. He likes sandwiches and cookies. He likes Lily. He is not sad and angry anymore.
"Okay, Lily," he says. "Let's go home and have lunch. And then we can play some more. You are my best friend."
Lily smiles too. She is happy. She is not scared anymore. She holds Ben's hand and they walk home. They are friends.
