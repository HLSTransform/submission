Once upon a time there was a friendly bunny. He was walking through the forest one day when he saw something strange. It was a small white towel lying on the ground!
The friendly bunny went to take a closer look and he noticed that it was moving. Suddenly, the towel came alive! It unfolded itself and hopped away.
The friendly bunny chased after the towel. They ran together through the forest, playing hide and seek amongst the trees.
Suddenly, the bunny heard a voice. It was a little girl laughing and calling out to the towel. She had come looking for it!
The friendly bunny said goodbye and ran off, leaving the little girl with the towel. She was so happy, and hugged the towel tight in her arms.
Theend.
