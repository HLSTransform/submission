Once upon a time there was a girl named Lucy. She was three years old and very happy. One day, her mother told her that she needed to take the key and go to the store. Lucy was worried because she was not sure if she could remember to bring the key back home.
So her mother reminded her to put the key in her pocket so she would not forget it. Lucy was excited! She ran to the store and had lots of fun looking around the store.
When Lucy came home, she showed her mother the key. Her mother was very happy and hugged her. She reminded Lucy that it was very important to remember to always take the key with her.
Lucy was very proud that she was able to remember and that her mother was happy. She smiled and promised her mother that she would never forget the key again.
