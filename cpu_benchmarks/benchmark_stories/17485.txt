Lily and Ben were playing near the river. They liked to throw stones and watch them splash in the water. They saw some big green things lying on the shore. They looked like logs, but they had teeth and eyes.
"Look, Ben, crocodiles!" Lily said. "They are scary and mean. Let's strike them with stones and make them go away."
"No, Lily, don't do that!" Ben said. "They are not mean, they are beautiful. They have shiny scales and strong tails. They are part of nature, like us. We should not hurt them, we should be kind to them."
"But they might bite us, Ben!" Lily said. "They have big mouths and sharp teeth. They are not like us, they are different. We should be careful of them."
Ben shook his head. He wanted to show Lily that crocodiles were not so bad. He picked up a stick and walked slowly towards one of the crocodiles. He reached out his hand and touched its back gently.
"See, Lily, it's not hard, it's soft. It's not cold, it's warm. It's not angry, it's calm. It's a beautiful crocodile." Ben said.
Lily watched Ben with wide eyes. She was curious, but also afraid. She saw the crocodile move its head and open its eyes. She saw it look at Ben with a hungry gaze. She saw it open its mouth and snap at Ben's hand.
"Ben, watch out!" Lily screamed. "It's going to bite you!"
Ben jumped back and dropped the stick. He ran to Lily and hugged her. They both looked at the crocodile, who hissed and slid into the water.
"Are you okay, Ben?" Lily asked. "Did it hurt you?"
"I'm okay, Lily. It didn't hurt me. But it was scary." Ben said. "Maybe you were right, Lily. Maybe crocodiles are not so beautiful. Maybe we should leave them alone."
Lily nodded. She felt sorry for the crocodile, but also glad that Ben was safe. She took his hand and they walked away from the river. They decided to play somewhere else, where there were no crocodiles.
