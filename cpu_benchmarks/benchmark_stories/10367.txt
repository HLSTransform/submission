Lila was a famous dancer. She danced on a big stage with many people watching. She wore a pretty dress with many colors and sparkles. She liked to dance and make people happy.
One day, before her show, she saw that her dress had a hole. Oh no! She needed to fix it fast. She looked for a pin to close the hole. She asked her friend Mia, who was also a dancer, if she had a pin.
"Sorry, Lila, I don't have a pin. Maybe you can ask Tom, he is good at sewing." Mia said.
Lila ran to Tom, who was in charge of the costumes. He was busy with many clothes and scissors and needles. She showed him her dress and asked him for a pin.
"Hi, Lila, you are a famous dancer. You need a good dress. I don't have a pin, but I can sew your dress. Give it to me, it will only take a minute." Tom said.
Lila gave him her dress and waited. She hoped he would be fast. She did not want to miss her show. She heard the music start and saw the other dancers go on the stage. She was nervous.
Tom finished sewing her dress and gave it back to her. He smiled and said, "Here you go, Lila, your dress is good as new. You are ready to dance. Go and shine!"
Lila thanked him and put on her dress. She ran to the stage and joined the other dancers. She danced with joy and grace. She felt happy and proud. The people watching clapped and cheered. She was a famous dancer.
