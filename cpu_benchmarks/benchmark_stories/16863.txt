Once upon a time, there was a big clock that tick-tocked all day and all night. The clock was very mighty and never stopped ticking. One day, a little bird flew into the clock and got stuck. The bird was scared and didn't know what to do.
Luckily, a kind boy saw the bird and knew what to do. He gently took the bird out of the clock and set it free. The bird was very happy and flew away.
The boy felt proud of himself for helping the bird. He learned that it's important to answer when someone needs help, no matter how small they are. The clock kept ticking, but the boy felt mighty too for doing a good deed.
