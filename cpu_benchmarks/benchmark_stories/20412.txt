Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Lily. She had a small case that she loved to carry around with her everywhere she went. One day, Lily was playing outside when she heard a small noise. She looked around and saw a small bird sitting on a branch of a tree. The bird was chirping a small song. Lily wanted to talk to the bird, but she didn't want to scare it away. So, she decided to whisper to the bird. She whispered a small hello and the bird chirped back. Lily was so happy that she opened her small case and took out some small seeds to give to the bird. The bird happily ate the seeds and flew away. From that day on, Lily always carried some small seeds in her small case, just in case she met another small bird.
