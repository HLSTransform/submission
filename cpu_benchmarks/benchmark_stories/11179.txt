Once upon a time, there was a big store. The store had many staff who worked there. The staff were very creative and made many things to sell. 
One day, a little girl went to the store with her mom. She wanted to buy a toy, but her mom said they didn't have enough money to spend. The little girl was sad and started to cry. 
The staff saw the little girl crying and wanted to help. They made a special toy just for her and gave it to her for free. The little girl was so happy and hugged the staff. 
From that day on, the little girl always went to the store and played with her special toy. She loved the staff and their creative ideas. There was no more conflict, only happiness. The end.
