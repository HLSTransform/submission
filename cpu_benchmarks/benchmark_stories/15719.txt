Once there was a poor girl named Sarah. She had a blouse, but it was all dirty. Sarah went to see her mom and asked, "Mom, can you help me wipe my blouse clean?"
Her mom said, "Sure, Sarah. Wiping will make it nice and clean again."
So she took a wet cloth and wiped the blouse all over. She wiped it on the front and on the back. She wiped it on the arms and around the neck. Then, she wiped it one more time to make it extra clean.
When she was finished, Sarah said, "Thanks, Mom. Now my blouse looks so nice and clean!"
Her mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, Sarah. Now it looks as good as new!"
