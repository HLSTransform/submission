Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the park with her mom and dad. One sunny day, they went to the park and Lily's dad forgot his sunglasses at home. He was squinting and rubbing his eyes all day.
Later, Lily saw a man walking towards them wearing sunglasses. She pointed and said, "Look, daddy! That man has sunglasses!" Her dad was confused and asked, "What man?" But when he turned around, the man had disappeared.
A few minutes later, the man appeared again, but this time he was holding Lily's dad's sunglasses! Lily's dad was so happy and thanked the man. From that day on, Lily always kept an eye out for people wearing sunglasses, just in case they had her dad's things.
