The sun was shining, and the birds were chirping. But Dave was not in a happy mood. Dave was feeling sad. 
“Dave, let’s go for a jog!” said Mom. 
“No way, it’s too wet outside,” said Dave. 
Mom smiled. “Dave, I promise it won’t be too wet. You’ll feel much better after some fresh air.”
But Dave wasn’t convinced. “I don’t want to,” he said again. 
Mom didn’t give up. “You know what? We can splash in the puddles together - it will be fun!”
Dave thought about it, and he finally smiled. “Alright, I guess I’ll go.”
So the two of them went outside and had a great time splashing in the wet puddles. By the end, Dave was feeling much better. He realized just how fun a simple jog in the rain can be.
