Once upon a time, there was a generous rabbit that lived in a castle. He loved to chew on delicious carrots, and he always made sure to leave some for his friends in the castle.
Every day the rabbit would chew on a big, juicy carrot, and then take little nibbles for the other animals in the castle. He was so generous with his carrots, that he became known as the Carrot King!
All of the other animals in the castle were very happy to have the Carrot King around. He was a kind and gentle rabbit, always willing to share and help others.
When the other animals needed help, they would come to the Carrot King and ask for carrots. He was always happy to share, and would give them as many carrots as they wanted.
The Carrot King was loved and respected by all the animals in the castle. He was the king of generosity!
