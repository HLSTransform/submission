Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends were playing hide-and-seek. Lily was hiding behind a big tree when she heard a loud noise. She looked up and saw a dark cloud in the sky. 
Lily ran to her friends and said, "Look! There's a dark cloud coming. We should go home!" But her friends didn't want to leave yet. They said, "It's just a little cloud. We can keep playing." 
Lily felt troubled. She knew that the cloud was getting bigger and faster. She said, "Please, let's go home. We don't want to get caught in the rain." 
But her friends still didn't listen. They kept playing and laughing. Suddenly, the wind started to speed up and the sky turned very dark. Lily's friends finally realized that they should go home. They all ran home as fast as they could, and just in time too, because it started to rain heavily. 
When they got home, Lily's friends said, "Thank you for warning us about the dark cloud, Lily. You were right. We should have listened to you." And Lily felt very happy that she was able to help her friends.
