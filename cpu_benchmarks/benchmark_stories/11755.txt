Once there was a family who loved each other very much. Mama and Papa had an adorable daughter, Anna. Every Sunday, the family got together for dinner. 
One day, Anna asked Mama if she could help in the kitchen. Mama said yes and gave her a mixer to use. 
When Mama checked on Anna she saw that Anna was mixing the potatoes in a very special way. 
Mama said, "Anna, why are you behaving like this?"
Anna smiled and said, "Mama, I wanted to make a special dish for dinner tonight. I wanted to make it special and delicious for you and Papa."
Mama was so surprised and proud that she gave Anna a hug. She said, "That's so adorable Anna! You can help me make dinner every Sunday from now on."
The family was so happy that night. Anna's potatoes were the most delicious thing!
