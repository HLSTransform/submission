Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was walking by a beach. She looked down and saw something. It was an oyster! It was thick. The little girl was very curious. She bent down and tried to open the oyster. But, it was too hard. She looked around and saw a nearby rock. She placed the oyster on the rock and smacked it with a stick. Suddenly, the oyster opened and a pearl was inside! The little girl was so excited. She was so happy. She ran home to show her mom the special pearl. The end!
