Once upon a time, there was an old man who loved to dream. Every night, he would imagine the most incredible things. One night, he dreamed of a giant container of cream. He imagined how rich and sweet it would be.
Meanwhile, in a nearby house, there also lived a small three-year-old girl. Just like the old man, the girl also loved to dream. She dreamed of things such as puppies, unicorns, and big containers of cream.  
One day, the old man and the girl met. As soon as they saw the cream, they became very jealous of each other. The old man wanted it all for himself, while the little girl wanted the cream all to herself.
"It's all mine! Give it back!" the old man shouted.
"No, I dreamed of this first!" the little girl cried.
The two argued back and forth until the old man said, "Let's make a deal. We both get to have some of the cream, so that we can both enjoy it." 
The little girl was so happy. She smiled and said, "Yes! That sounds like a wonderful plan!" 
And so, the old man and the little girl enjoyed the cream together, happy that they both got some of their dream.
