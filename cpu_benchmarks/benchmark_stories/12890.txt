Once upon a time there was a little bear named Boo. Boo always loved to explore the world and see what wondeful things he could find.
One day Boo found an enormous hill. He couldn’t believe his eyes! He bounced around a bit and then he saw it; a big path. He started to follow it and it soon rose all the way to the top of the hill.
When Boo arrived at the top of the hill he saw something magical. It was like a carpet made of all kinds of textures! One was soft as a cloud, another was rough as sand and one was sparkly like stars! Boo was so excited he started to dance on the carpet. Suddenly, everything started to spin and he felt so dizzy!
“Oh no!” Boo exclaimed.
A friendly voice answered him, “Let go and trust yourself, then you will rise”.
Boo was confused. Who said that? He looked around but he couldn’t see anyone. Then he looked down and noticed that he was no longer standing on the ground. He was floating in the sky! He smiled and waved goodbye to the mysterious voice and bounded off into the clouds.
