Tom and Anna are big people. They love each other very much. They like to drink wine when they eat. Wine is a drink that is red or white and comes from grapes. Wine makes them happy and warm.
One day, Tom and Anna go to a farm. The farm has many grapes. The farmer says they can pick some grapes and make wine. Tom and Anna are excited. They pick many grapes and put them in a big bucket. They wash their hands and feet and then they jump in the bucket. They squash the grapes with their feet. It is fun and messy.
The farmer helps them put the grape juice in a bottle. He says they have to wait for a long time until the juice becomes wine. He gives them a sticker with their names and the date. He says they can come back and get their wine when it is ready.
Tom and Anna thank the farmer and go home. They put the bottle in a dark and cool place. They wait and wait and wait. They wonder how their wine will taste.
After many days, the farmer calls them. He says their wine is good and they can come and get it. Tom and Anna are happy. They go to the farm and get their bottle. They open it and smell it. It smells good. They sip it and taste it. It tastes good. They smile and hug each other. They say they love their wine and they love each other. They drink their wine and eat some cheese and bread. They are happy and warm. They say this is the best wine ever.
