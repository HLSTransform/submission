Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the park with his friends. One day, as they were playing hide-and-seek, Timmy saw a ghost. He was very scared and ran away.
Timmy's mom noticed that he was upset and asked him what was wrong. Timmy told her about the ghost he saw. His mom listened carefully and then said, "Don't be afraid, Timmy. I will teach you how to be careful and not be scared of ghosts."
The next day, Timmy's mom took him to the library and they read books about ghosts. She taught him that ghosts are not real and that they cannot hurt him. Timmy felt much better and was no longer afraid. He was grateful to his mom for teaching him how to be careful and not be scared of ghosts.
