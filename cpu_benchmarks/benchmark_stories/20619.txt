Once upon a time there was a hunter. He was looking for something mysterious. He didn't know what he wanted to find but he kept looking. He kept looking all day and all night. 
One day he noticed something in the distance. He was so excited because he guessed it was what he was looking for. He ran to see what it was. As he got closer he could see it was a big bird!
The hunter got a little scared but he was still excited. The bird was very mysterious. He didn't know if it was friendly or not. He wanted to see what it was up to so he slowly walked closer. 
When the bird saw him she flew away. She was scared of him too! The hunter was a little sad but he was also still curious. He didn't know why the bird was so mysterious. He watched it fly away into the sky with a smile on his face. He was so happy he got to guess what the bird was!
