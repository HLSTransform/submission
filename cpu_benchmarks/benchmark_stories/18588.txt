Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was walking in the park, but she got lost. She felt very scared and sad. Suddenly, a kind lady saw her and said, "Welcome little one, are you lost?" Lily nodded her head and started to cry. The lady picked her up and hugged her tightly to comfort her. 
After a while, Lily stopped crying and the lady asked her name. Lily told her and the lady said, "That's a serious situation, but don't worry, we will find your mommy." They walked around the park together, and soon they found Lily's mommy. She was very happy to see her little girl and hugged her tightly. 
From that day on, Lily always remembered the kind lady who welcomed her and comforted her when she was lost. She knew that if she ever got lost again, she could always find someone to help her.
