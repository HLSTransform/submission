Andy was very excited. He was going on a camping trip with his family. As they were unpack in the woods, he noticed something very unusual. It was a big, thick, gray lung! It was so big that it almost filled up the whole tent!
Andy was scared but he was also very curious. He asked his mom, "What is that?" His mom smiled and said, "It's a lung, Andy. It helps us to breathe fresh air when we're camping."
Andy was a bit confused. He didn't like the lung being so close to them. He said, "Can't we move it away from the camp?". His dad said, "No, it's very important that we leave the lung alone. It will help us breathe while we're camping!"
Andy was still not happy. He really didn't want to leave the lung there. He tried to think of a way to get rid of it, but his parents had already made up their minds. In the end, Andy had to accept the situation and leave the thick lung where it was.
