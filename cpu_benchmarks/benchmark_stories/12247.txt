Mommy wanted to show Kate something special. She suggested to Kate that they go to the garden. 
Kate was very excited and ran outside. She saw a big wall – the flowers looked so nice! She asked Mommy what was behind the wall.
Mommy smiled and said, “Let’s go and find out!” Kate put her hand on the wall, and felt a cool surface. She was so excited!
Mommy opened the gate, and showed Kate a surprise. Kate saw a lot of colorful birds and trees. She said, “Oh wow! How nice!”
Mommy smiled and said, “Let’s take a look around and explore!” They had a lot of fun and Kate couldn't stop smiling.
