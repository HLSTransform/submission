One day, a mechanic named Tom worked on a car. The sun was harsh and hot. Tom was very sweaty. He needed water to cool down.
Tom saw a big tub of water. He decided to soak his feet in it. The water was cold and nice. It made Tom happy. He said, "This feels so good!"
Then, a little girl named Lily came to Tom. She asked, "Can I soak my feet too?" Tom said, "Yes, come join me!" Lily and Tom soaked their feet together. They laughed and had fun in the cold water. The harsh sun did not bother them anymore.
