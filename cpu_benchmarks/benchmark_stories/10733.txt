Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside on his favorite bench. One day, his mom asked him to go to the store to buy some milk. Timmy was very serious about this task and promised to be careful. 
He walked to the store and bought the milk. But when he was walking back, he saw a bird with a broken wing. Timmy felt sad for the bird and wanted to help. He remembered that his mom had a friend who worked at a bird hospital. 
Timmy decided to send a message to his mom's friend, asking for help. He used his mom's phone to send the message. The friend replied and promised to come and take care of the bird. Timmy felt happy that he could help the bird and went back to his favorite bench to wait for the friend to arrive.
