Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Jack. He was very happy, as he had a lovely toy car. He loved to push the car around and make it go fast. He pushed it so fast that he almost couldn't keep up! He was having so much fun.
Then one day, he was playing with his car when it ran over a stamp. The stamp was very special, so Jack became very upset. He started to cry and couldn't stop.
But then he had an idea. He went to his toy box, and found a smaller stamp. He stuck it to his car and what do you know - it made his car go even faster!
Jack laughed, and he was no longer upset. He was so happy that he raced his car around again, going even faster than before. And he lived happily ever after.
