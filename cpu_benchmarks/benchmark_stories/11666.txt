Once there was a famous trumpet. It was a special instrument that made wonderful sounds. 
One day a little bug decided to crawl onto the trumpet. The bug wasn't paying attention and quickly got stuck on the trumpet! It was in a tight spot and it couldn't move away.
The trumpet wasn't happy about the bug and it tried to blow the bug away with a loud noise. But the bug wouldn't budge! The bug was determined to stay on the trumpet. 
The trumpet was frustrated and tried over and over again to blow the bug away. Finally, the bug was so scared that it ran away from the trumpet and back outside.
The bug was safe, but the trumpet was still famous for its beautiful sound.
