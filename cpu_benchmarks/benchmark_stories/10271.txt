Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to ride her pink bicycle around the park. One day, she saw her friend Timmy riding a shiny new bike. 
"Wow, Timmy! Your bike is so cool! Where did you get it?" asked Lily.
"I gained it from my uncle. He gave it to me for my birthday," replied Timmy.
Lily felt a little sad that she didn't have a new bike like Timmy, but she still loved her pink bicycle. 
"I may not have a new bike, but my pink bicycle is still my favorite," said Lily. 
Timmy smiled and said, "That's great, Lily! It's not about having the newest or fanciest bike, it's about having fun and enjoying the ride." 
Lily agreed and they rode their bikes together, enjoying the sunshine and the fresh air.
