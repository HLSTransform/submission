Mum and Dad were in the kitchen together. Mum was cooking some food in a big pot, and there was a delicious smell coming from it. Dad was watching, and said she was doing a good job! 
Then Dad put his hand in his pocket and brought out a red wallet. Out of the wallet, he took a few coins, and put them in the pot. Mum smiled and gave Dad a big kiss!
Next, Mum took the pot off the stove and poured the food into a bowl. The food looked so yummy and had some coins in it - like a special surprise. Dad and Mum shared the food, and it tasted even better than it smelled!
They were so happy they had cooked something delicious, and Dad said he loved Mum very much.
