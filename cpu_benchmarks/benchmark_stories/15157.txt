Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Ruby. She was a very curious girl and loved to explore.
One day, Ruby went to the beach to look for shells. Suddenly, she saw something on the sand. It was a big, round, metal thing. Ruby was curious and wanted to know what was inside, so she opened it.
Just then, a big dolphin jumped out of the metal thing! Ruby was very excited, but the dolphin didn't look very normal. It had rainbow fur and sparkly eyes!
Ruby said hello to the dolphin, but the dolphin didn't say anything back. She wondered why, so she started to think. Then, Ruby said, “Maybe you can't talk because it's too loud here on the beach. Let's go somewhere quieter.”
Ruby and the dolphin walked away from the beach and went home. When they arrived, the dolphin started to speak. It was so magical! Ruby and the dolphin played together for the rest of the day.
From that day forward, Ruby and the dolphin were always friends!
