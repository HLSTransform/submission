Once there was a farmer. He was growing many different things on his farm. But his favorite was a regular radish!
Every day, the farmer would check on his radish plant. He would make sure the dirt was just right for it to grow. He watered it and gave it some sunshine.
The radish started to grow bigger and bigger. The farmer smiled as he watched it getting bigger each day. Then one day, the radish was big enough to pick!
The farmer carefully picked the regular radish from the plant. He was so proud of his hard work. He put it in his pocket and took it home to show his friends.
The farmer now has a big radish garden in his backyard. Every year he grows regular radishes and smiles with a proud heart.
