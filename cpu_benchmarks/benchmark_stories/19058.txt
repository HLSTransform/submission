Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play at the park and swing on the swings. One day, a stranger came to the park. He had a gentle voice and asked Lily if she wanted to play with him. 
Lily was happy to have a new friend, but she didn't know the stranger was bad. He asked her to balance on the edge of the slide, but she fell and hurt herself. The stranger didn't help her, he just ran away. 
Lily cried and cried until her mommy came to take her home. She told her mommy about the stranger and how he hurt her. Her mommy was very angry and called the police. They caught the stranger and put him in jail. Lily learned that she should never trust strangers and to always be careful when playing.
