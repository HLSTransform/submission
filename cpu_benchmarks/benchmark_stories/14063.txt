Jack went to the beach with his family. He felt excited and happy but also a little scared. He saw some small waves in the sea and he wanted to explore. He could hear the birds chirping and the sound of the wind.
As Jack walked closer to the sea he began to feel scared. There were large shadows moving in the water and he heard a loud sound like somebody was yelling. Then he realised it was a shark!
Jack shrieked and he tried to run back to the shore. The shark seemed to be getting closer and it was bigger than he'd expected. He tried to scream for help, but he couldn't quite remember how. But the shark was getting closer!
The small waves and the noise of the birds became distant as the fierce shark kept chasing Jack. He was getting exhausted and he knew he couldn't keep running. Suddenly the shark was right in front of him and he had nowhere to hide. He yelled out loud but nobody could hear him. Finally, the shark ate Jack and he was never seen again.
