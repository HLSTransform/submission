Once upon a time, there was a big elephant named Ellie. Ellie loved to eat lots of yummy fruits and vegetables. She was very heavy and weighed a lot!
One day, Ellie wanted to take a nap in the shade of a big tree. She found a nice spot and closed her eyes. It was so peaceful and cool in the shade.
Ellie had a dream that she was successful in finding the biggest banana she had ever seen! When she woke up, she decided to go on a search for the banana. She walked and walked, but couldn't find it. Even though she wasn't successful in finding the banana, she was happy to have had a nice nap in the shade.
