Tom likes to sleep. He likes to have dreams. Dreams are like stories in his head. Sometimes he dreams of flying, or playing with animals, or eating cake. He feels happy when he dreams.
But every morning, he has to rise. Rise means to get up from his bed. His mom comes to his room and says, "Tom, it's time to rise. You have to go to school." Tom does not like to rise. He wants to stay in his bed and dream more.
One day, Tom has a very good dream. He dreams that he is a superhero. He can run fast, jump high, and help people. He wears a red cape and a blue mask. He feels strong and brave. He likes his dream a lot.
But then, he hears his mom. She says, "Tom, it's time to rise. You have to go to school." Tom does not want to rise. He wants to stay in his dream. He says, "No, mom. I want to be a superhero."
His mom smiles. She says, "You can be a superhero, Tom. But you have to rise first. You have to go to school and learn new things. Then, you can come home and play superhero with your friends. And you can dream of being a superhero again at night."
Tom thinks about it. He likes to learn new things. He likes to play with his friends. He likes to dream of being a superhero. He decides to rise. He says, "OK, mom. I will rise. I will go to school. I will be a superhero."
He gets out of his bed and puts on his clothes. He hugs his mom and says, "Thank you, mom. You are the best." His mom hugs him back and says, "You are welcome, Tom. You are the best, too." They go downstairs and have breakfast. Tom feels glad. He is ready for a new day.
