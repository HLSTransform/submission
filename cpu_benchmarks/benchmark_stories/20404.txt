Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw circles with her crayons. One day, her mommy said, "Lily, it's time to clean up and shut your crayon box." 
Lily replied, "But mommy, I'm not finished yet. Can I draw just one more circle?" 
Mommy said, "Okay, but make it quick. We need to go to the store and we don't want to be late." 
Lily drew a slow circle, taking her time to make it perfect. Then she shut her crayon box and went with her mommy to the store. They had lots of fun shopping together.
