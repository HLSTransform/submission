Once upon a time, there was a farm with lots of animals. There were cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep. The sheep were very fluffy and cute. They liked to eat grass and play together.
One day, a big bad wolf came to the farm. He wanted to eat the sheep! The sheep were troubled and scared. They didn't know what to do. 
But then, the farmer came to save the day. He had a plan to include the sheep in a special pen where the wolf couldn't get them. The sheep were safe and happy again. They thanked the farmer with lots of "baa"s and "meh"s. The end.
