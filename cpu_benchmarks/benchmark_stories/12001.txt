Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw pictures with her crayons. One day, she found a red crayon that was famous because it could draw really well.
Lily was so happy to use the famous crayon to make a beautiful picture. She drew a big flower with petals that were pink and yellow. But, when she looked at the picture the next day, she saw that the flower had started to rot. Lily was sad because she loved her picture.
But, then she had an idea! She used the famous red crayon to draw a butterfly that could fly over the rotting flower. Now, Lily had a new and even more beautiful picture.
