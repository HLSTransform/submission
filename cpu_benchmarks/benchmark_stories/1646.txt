Once upon a time, there was a big, big watermelon. It was enormous! The watermelon was so big that it could feed a lot of people. 
One day, a little girl went to the park. She saw a swing and wanted to play on it. She ran to the swing and started to swing back and forth. She was having so much fun!
Suddenly, she saw the enormous watermelon. She ran to it and took a big bite. It was so juicy and sweet! She ate the whole watermelon and felt very happy.
