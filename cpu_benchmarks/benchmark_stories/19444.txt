Once upon a time, there was a family who lived near a pond. The family had a steam engine which they used to deliver things to the people who lived near the pond.
One day, the family noticed that the engine was making strange noises and was not running very well. They were ashamed to tell their neighbours that it was broken.
Then, one evening, a kind fairy appeared from the sky and made the engine better with her magic. She waved her wand and suddenly the engine was full of steam and ready to deliver the things again.
Everyone in the family was so happy that the kind fairy had saved their steam engine. From then on, they were able to deliver things to their neighbours and make their lives much easier.
