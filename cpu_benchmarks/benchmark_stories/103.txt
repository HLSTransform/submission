Once upon a time, there was a jolly rabbit named Benny. Benny loved to hop and play in the meadow with his friends. One day, Benny saw some sparkly things on the ground. He went to investigate and found shiny rocks that sparkled in the sun. Benny wanted to gather them all up and show his friends.
Benny hopped around the meadow and gathered up all the shiny rocks he could find. His friends were so happy to see the sparkly rocks and they all played with them together. They had so much fun that they decided to gather more things from the meadow.
They gathered flowers, leaves, and even some berries. Benny and his friends made a beautiful bouquet and gave it to their mommies. Everyone was so happy and jolly that they danced and sang together. From that day on, Benny and his friends always gathered things from the meadow and made beautiful gifts for their loved ones. The end.
