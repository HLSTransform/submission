Lily and Tom were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs and worms. They had a big bin where they put all the things they found.
"Look, Lily, I found a shiny rock!" Tom said, holding up a pebble.
"Wow, that's pretty! Can I see?" Lily asked, reaching for the rock.
Tom nodded and gave it to her. She rubbed it with her fingers and saw something sparkle.
"Tom, there's something inside the rock!" she said, excited. "Maybe it's a treasure!"
They ran to the porch, where they had a hammer and a chisel. They put the rock on the ground and hit it with the hammer. The rock cracked open and revealed a shiny crystal.
"Wow, it's beautiful!" they both said, admiring the crystal.
They heard their mom calling them from the kitchen.
"Kids, it's time for lunch! Come inside, please!"
They picked up the crystal and the bin and ran inside. They showed their mom what they had found.
"That's amazing, kids! You found a geode, a rock with crystals inside. How did you find it?" she asked.
"We were digging in the dirt and we found it in the bin!" they said.
"That's very lucky! You can keep it as a souvenir. Now, wash your hands and sit down. I made you some sandwiches and juice."
They washed their hands and ate their lunch. They were very happy with their discovery. They put the crystal on the shelf in their room, next to their other treasures. They were very sleepy after playing so much. They took a nap and dreamed of finding more geodes.
