Molly was a silly girl. She liked to jump and dance everywhere! She even sometimes danced around the house.
One night, Molly wanted to do something special. She asked her mom for a candle. So her mom gave her a special one. It was huge and bright.
Molly put the candle in the middle of the room and danced around it. It was so much fun! She laughed and smiled as she twirled and spun. It felt like she was flying.
Molly danced around the candle until it flickered off. Then it was time to go to bed. Molly said good night to the candle and thanked it for the wonderful dance.
