One day, three children decided to march down the street. They could hear a beautiful score being played in the distance. The children were so excited!
As they marched, the children were met with a beautiful surprise. Everywhere they looked were colorful, twinkling lights. Streamers were strung all around them, giving the street an extra bit of cheer.
The children kept marching, determined to find the source of the music. As they turned the corner, they spotted a marching band on the other side of the street. The band was playing a lively score while they marched, and the children felt like they were in a dream.
The children soon forgot about marching, and started running and dancing around the band. The entire street was filled with color, laughter, and music. After hours of playing and singing, the children still weren't ready to stop. 
Eventually, the band had to move on, but the children could still hear the score echoing in their minds. They vowed to come back and march again, to feel that same twinkling wonder all over again.
