Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to dig holes and look for bugs. They had a big bucket of water to wash their hands.
"Look, Lily, I found a worm!" Ben said, holding up a long, slimy thing.
"Wow, Ben, that's cool!" Lily said. "Can I see?"
Ben gave the worm to Lily. She touched it gently. It tickled her fingers.
"Where did you find it?" Lily asked.
"Over there, by the well," Ben said, pointing to a round hole in the ground with a wall around it. "There are lots of worms there."
Lily and Ben ran to the well. They looked inside. It was dark and deep. They could hear water dripping.
"Be careful, Lily, don't fall in," Ben said.
"I won't, Ben, don't worry," Lily said.
They leaned over the well and shouted. Their voices echoed.
"Hello, hello, hello!" they said.
Suddenly, they heard another voice.
"Hello, hello, hello!" it said.
Lily and Ben gasped. Who was that?
"Who are you?" they asked.
"I'm a fairy," the voice said. "I live in the well."
Lily and Ben were amazed. A fairy in the well?
"Can we see you?" they asked.
"Sure, I'll come up," the voice said.
They waited. A few seconds later, a tiny figure with wings and a dress flew out of the well. She had a wand in her hand and a smile on her face.
"Hello, I'm Faye," she said. "You're Lily and Ben, right?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They couldn't believe their eyes.
"How do you know our names?" they asked.
"I know a lot of things," Faye said. "I'm a magic fairy. I can grant wishes."
Lily and Ben were excited. They had so many wishes.
"Can you make me a princess?" Lily asked.
"Can you make me a superhero?" Ben asked.
Faye laughed. She shook her head.
"I'm sorry, I can't do that," she said. "Those are big wishes. I can only grant small wishes. And only if you're honest and kind."
Lily and Ben were disappointed. But they understood.
"What kind of small wishes can you grant?" they asked.
Faye thought for a moment.
"Well, I can make you a flower crown, or a cape, or a cookie, or a balloon, or a song, or a hug, or a joke, or a friend," she said.
Lily and Ben smiled. Those were nice things.
"Can we have a hug and a friend?" they asked.
"Of course," Faye said. "You're very sweet. Come here."
She flew to them and gave them a hug. It felt warm and soft.
"Thank you, Faye," Lily and Ben said.
"You're welcome, Lily and Ben," Faye said. "And you're welcome to visit me anytime. I'm always here in the well."
Lily and Ben were happy. They had met a fairy. They had made a new friend. They waved goodbye to Faye and ran back to their bucket of water. They had a lot to tell their mom and dad.
