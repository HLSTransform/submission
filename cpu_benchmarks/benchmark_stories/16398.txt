Sara and Ben were twins who liked to bake. They had a big book of recipes that their mom gave them. They wanted to make a cake for their dad's birthday. They looked at the book and found a recipe for a chocolate cake. They needed eggs, milk, flour, sugar, butter, and cocoa.
They asked their mom if they could use the kitchen. Their mom said yes, but they had to be careful and clean up after. She also said she had to go to the building where she worked for a while. She would be back soon. She gave them a hug and a kiss and left.
Sara and Ben got all the ingredients and put them in a big bowl. They mixed them with a spoon. They poured the batter into a round pan. They put the pan in the oven. They set the timer for 30 minutes. They were very excited.
They decided to make a card for their dad while they waited. They got some paper, crayons, and stickers. They drew a picture of their family and wrote "Happy Birthday Dad" on it. They decorated it with stickers. They were very proud.
They heard the timer beep. They put on oven mitts and took out the cake. It smelled good and looked yummy. They let it cool on a rack. They wanted to frost it with chocolate icing. They looked at the book and found a recipe for icing. They needed more butter, sugar, cocoa, and milk.
They checked the fridge and the pantry. They had enough butter, sugar, and cocoa, but they had no milk. They used all the milk for the cake. They were very sad. They wondered what to do.
They heard a knock on the door. They opened it and saw their mom. She had a big smile and a clear jug in her hand. She said, "I forgot to tell you, I bought some extra milk for the cake. I thought you might need it. Here you go." She gave them the jug.
Sara and Ben were very happy. They hugged their mom and thanked her. They made the icing and spread it on the cake. They put some candles on it. They hid the cake and the card in their room. They waited for their dad to come home. They had a big surprise for him. They knew he would love it.
