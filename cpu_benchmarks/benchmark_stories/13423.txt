Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play hide-and-seek with her friends. One day, she found a room that she had never seen before. It was very big and had lots of toys inside. Lily was very excited to play in this room, but she wanted to peek inside first. 
When Lily peeked inside the room, she saw that the toys were all very old and special. They were the original toys that her mommy and daddy used to play with when they were little. Lily thought that was very cool. She decided to play with the toys and have lots of fun. 
Lily's friends came to find her, but they couldn't see her anywhere. They looked all around the house, but they couldn't find her. Finally, they peeked inside the special room and saw Lily playing with the original toys. They were so happy to join her and play together. From that day on, Lily and her friends loved to play in the special room with the original toys.
