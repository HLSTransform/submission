Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who liked to go for walks with his mom. One day, they decided to go for a walk in the forest. Timmy's mom warned him that the backpack was heavy, but Timmy wanted to carry it himself. 
As they walked, they saw a big, scary bear. Timmy's mom told him to be quiet and they slowly backed away. When they were safe, Timmy's mom asked him if he saw the bear. They discussed how they could avoid bears in the future. 
After their scary adventure, they continued their walk and found a beautiful stream. Timmy's mom took out snacks from the heavy backpack and they enjoyed a picnic by the stream. Timmy was happy he carried the backpack and they both enjoyed the rest of their walk.
