Once upon a time, in a beautiful garden, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play with her toys and run around with her dog, Spot. One day, while they were playing, Lily noticed something shiny on the ground.
Lily picked up the shiny thing and saw it was a coin. She knew it had value because her mom and dad used coins to buy things. She felt happy to find the coin and wanted to show it to her mom and dad.
Lily and Spot ran back to their house to show the beautiful coin to her mom and dad. They were very proud of Lily for finding it. They put the coin in a special box to keep it safe. Lily and Spot went back to the garden to play and look for more treasures.
