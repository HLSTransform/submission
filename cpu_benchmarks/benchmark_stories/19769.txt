Once there was a humble girl named Polly. She loved school and couldn't wait to get to class. She loved to balance things and make them stay still. 
One day in class, the teacher asked the students to balance a pile of books. At first, Polly felt a little overwhelmed, but she knew she could do it. She took the books one by one and balanced them up high.
The other students were impressed! Polly had successfully balanced all the books and made them stay still. Everyone cheered for her and clapped. 
The teacher gave Polly a big smile and said, "Well done Polly! Your balance and hard work is an example to us all." Polly smiled too and felt proud of what she had achieved. She knew that with a little bit of patience and balance, anything is possible.
