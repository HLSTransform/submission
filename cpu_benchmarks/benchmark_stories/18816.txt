Tom and Sam were two little birds who lived in a big tree. They liked to play and sing with their friends, but they did not like to learn. Their mother always told them to learn how to fly, how to find food, and how to be safe, but they thought it was boring.
One day, they saw an elderly bird sitting on a twig near their nest. He looked sad and tired. They flew over to him and asked, "Hello, what is your name?"
The elderly bird smiled and said, "My name is Ben. I used to live in this tree, but now I have no home and no friends."
"Why?" Tom and Sam asked.
"Because I did not learn when I was young. I did not learn how to fly well, so I fell and hurt my wing. I did not learn how to find food, so I was always hungry. I did not learn how to be safe, so I was chased by cats and dogs. Now I am old and alone, and I wish I had listened to my mother."
Tom and Sam felt sorry for Ben. They said, "We are sorry, Ben. We do not want to be like you. We want to learn and be happy. Can you teach us what you know?"
Ben nodded and said, "Yes, I can. I can teach you some of the things I learned the hard way. But you have to listen and practice, and not be lazy or naughty."
Tom and Sam agreed. They followed Ben and learned how to fly better, how to find food, and how to be safe. They also learned how to be kind and helpful, and how to make friends. They invited Ben to stay with them in their nest, and they became a family.
Their mother was very proud of them, and said, "You have learned a lot, my children. You have learned not only from me, but also from Ben. He is a wise and good bird, and you are lucky to have him. You have learned that learning is not boring, but fun and useful. You have learned that learning can make you happy and strong."
