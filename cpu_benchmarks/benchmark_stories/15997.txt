Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit named Peter. Peter wanted to grow a garden, but it was very difficult. Everyday he went out to the garden to try and water his plants and make them grow, but nothing seemed to work.
One day, Peter's friends told him to look for a special barrel in the forest. Peter went to find the barrel and eventually found it in a deep, dark corner of the forest. When he opened the barrel he found magical seeds inside. He knew this was the secret to growing his garden.
Peter planted the magical seeds in his garden, but he still had one big problem. Every day he needed to pour water over the seeds so they could grow. This was very difficult as there was no river or stream anywhere near.
But Peter was not one to give up so easily. He looked in the forest and building himself a special pipe so he could bring the water he needed to his garden. It took a lot of work, but Peter eventually managed to make the pipe.
Once the pipe was built, Peter was finally able to water the garden and the magical seeds started to grow into beautiful flowers. Peter was so happy he was able to his garden. Now, every day he waters his garden and every day his garden grows more beautiful.
