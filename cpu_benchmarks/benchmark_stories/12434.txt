Once there was a smart little rabbit. He loved to dance. Every day he would go out into the meadow and dance to the sound of the birds singing. He was so happy and proud of himself when he danced.
One day, he met a little squirrel who wanted to join in. The rabbit was so excited that someone else wanted to dance with him. They danced together around the meadow, jumping and spinning and twirling.
The rabbit was so excited to have a friend to dance with now. But then he had a great idea. He said to the little squirrel, “Let’s have a dance competition! Whoever can dance the best will get a special reward.”
The little squirrel was so excited at the thought of a reward, so they started to practice. The rabbit was getting better and better at his dancing and the little squirrel was too.
Finally, they had their competition and they both danced so well that they both got a reward. They had danced so well that they both felt like they had won. And from then on, they were the smartest, best dancers in the whole meadow.
