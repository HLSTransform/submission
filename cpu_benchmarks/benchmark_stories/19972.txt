Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to look for things and make up stories. They saw a big box under a tree. It was brown and had a lock on it.
"What is in the box?" Lily asked.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a mystery," Ben said.
They tried to open the box, but it was too hard. They looked for a key, but they could not find one.
"Maybe someone left it here for us to find," Lily said.
"Maybe it has a treasure inside," Ben said.
They decided to make up a story about the box. They pretended it was a magic box that could take them to different places. They took turns to say where they wanted to go.
"I want to go to the moon," Lily said.
"Okay, close your eyes and count to three," Ben said.
They closed their eyes and counted. Then they opened them and looked around.
"Wow, we are on the moon!" Lily said.
She saw rocks and stars and a big round ball. She picked up a rock and threw it in the air. It went very high and came down very slow.
"Look, I can fly!" she said.
Ben laughed and joined her. They had fun jumping and flying on the moon.
They heard a voice from the box.
"Time to go back," the voice said.
They ran to the box and got inside. They closed their eyes and counted again. Then they opened them and looked around.
They were back in the park. The box was still under the tree.
"That was silly," Ben said.
"But it was fun," Lily said.
They hugged and smiled. They remembered their adventure on the moon. They wondered what other mysteries the box had. They decided to come back another day and find out.
