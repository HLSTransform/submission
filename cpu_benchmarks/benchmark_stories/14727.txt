Once upon a time, there was a furry hill. It had never been filled. Every day, a new creature would come to try to fill the hill. A rabbit tried hopping up the hill, but he could not fill it. An elephant tried to trample the hill, but he could not fill it. Then one day, a mouse came along. He was small and furry, like the hill. He filled the hill with dirt and rocks, until it was nice and full. All the animals cheered and thanked the mouse for filling the hill. They were all so happy that the hill was full! The end.
