Sam and Lily are twins. They like to play outside when it is hot. Mom gives them a big melon to share. She says, "Be nice and behave. Do not make a mess with the melon."
Sam and Lily take the melon to the yard. They cut it with a knife. They see the red and juicy inside. They say, "Yum!" They each take a big piece and bite it. The melon is sweet and cold. It makes them happy.
But then Sam sees that Lily has a bigger piece than him. He feels mad. He says, "That is not fair. Give me some of your melon." Lily says, "No, this is mine. You have enough." They start to fight. They pull and push the melon. They make a lot of noise.
Mom hears them and comes outside. She sees the melon on the ground. She sees the juice and seeds on their clothes and faces. She sees their angry and sad eyes. She says, "Oh no! What have you done? You did not behave. You wasted the melon. You made a mess. You hurt each other. You are not nice."
Sam and Lily feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were greedy and mean. We did not share. We did not behave. We love the melon. We love each other. Can we have another melon, please?" Mom says, "No, you cannot have another melon. You have to learn your lesson. You have to clean up the mess. You have to hug and say sorry to each other. You have to be nice and behave. Maybe next time you can have another melon, if you are good." Sam and Lily do what Mom says. They hope they can have another melon soon. They hope they can be nice and behave.
