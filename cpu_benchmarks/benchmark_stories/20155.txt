Sam and Lily were friends. They liked to play with dolls and cars. One day, they went to the park with their moms. They saw a big slide and a swing. They wanted to get on them.
"Let's play on the slide first," Sam said.
"OK," Lily said. They ran to the slide and waited for their turn. Sam went first. He climbed up the ladder and slid down. He laughed and said, "That was fun!"
Lily followed him. She climbed up the ladder and slid down. But she slid too fast and fell off the slide. She hurt her knee and cried. "Ow, ow, ow! That was terrible!"
Sam ran to her and helped her up. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. Are you OK?"
Lily nodded. She said, "It's OK, Sam. It's just a scratch. Let's play on the swing instead."
They went to the swing and took turns pushing each other. They had fun and forgot about the slide. They played until their moms called them. They said goodbye and hugged each other. They were still friends.
