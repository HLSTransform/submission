Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she saw a nosy squirrel peeking out from a bush. 
"Hello, little squirrel!" Lily said. "What are you doing in there?"
"I'm hiding my acorns," the squirrel replied. "I don't want anyone to find them."
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "I can help you clean up the area around the bush so you can hide your acorns better."
The squirrel was happy to have some help and together they cleaned up the area around the bush. After they were done, the squirrel thanked Lily and went back to hiding his acorns. From that day on, Lily and the squirrel became good friends and they would often play together in the park.
