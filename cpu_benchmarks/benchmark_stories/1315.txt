Once upon a time, there were two friends, Sarah and Jake, who liked to play together. One day, they wanted to draw a triangle. But Sarah was feeling slow and she was delaying. Jake was getting a bit annoyed and was making noisy sounds. He said, "Come on! We donâ€™t have all day!" Sarah finally started drawing slowly and soon they had a big, beautiful triangle. They were so happy and shouted out loud, "Yay!" Sarah and Jake smiled and hugged each other. They knew they had made the perfect triangle!
