Once upon a time, there was a bear. He was always very hungry and wanted something sweet to eat. He decided to search all around the forest to find something yummy. He looked high and low but he just couldn't find what he was looking for.
Suddenly, he saw a dark tree and had an idea. He climbed up the tree and saw a beehive. He knew that this was the solution to his problem. He carefully opened up the hive and started to search inside. He was so happy when he found some honey!
He ate all the honey he could find and was very full. He also decided to take some of the honey with him, so he could eat more later. He put the honey in his pocket and headed home. 
From that day on, the bear always searched for honey in the dark tree. Whenever he was hungry, he remembered the delicious honey he had found in the tree and went back for more.
