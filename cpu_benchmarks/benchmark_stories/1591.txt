Sara likes to play with her blocks. She has many blocks of different colors and shapes. She likes to match the blocks that are the same. She makes towers and walls and bridges with her blocks.
One day, Sara wants to make a very tall tower. She puts one block on top of another, and another, and another. She matches the colors and shapes of the blocks. She is very careful not to make the tower fall.
She looks up and sees the ceiling. The ceiling is white and smooth. She wonders if she can reach the ceiling with her tower. She wants to try. She gets a red block. It is her favorite block. It is a square and it is bright.
She puts the red block on top of the tower. The tower is very high now. She stands on her toes and stretches her arms. She tries to touch the ceiling with the red block. She is almost there.
But then, the tower wobbles. It is too high and too thin. It cannot stand. It falls down with a loud crash. The blocks scatter on the floor. Sara is sad. She worked hard to make the tower. She wanted to touch the ceiling with her red block.
She cries. She wants her red block back. She looks for it on the floor. She sees it under the table. She crawls under the table and gets it. She hugs it. She is happy. She still likes to match the blocks. But she does not want to make a very tall tower again. She learned her lesson. The ceiling is too far.
