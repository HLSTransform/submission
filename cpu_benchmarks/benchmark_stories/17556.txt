Tim and Lily were best friends. They liked to play outside in the park. One day, it was very cold and windy. Tim's mom said, "You need to wear a sweater, Tim. It will keep you warm and cozy." Tim did not like sweaters. He said, "No, mom. Sweaters are itchy and ugly. I don't want to wear one." Tim's mom said, "OK, Tim. But you might get sick if you don't wear one." Tim did not listen. He ran outside to meet Lily.
Lily was wearing a sweater. It was pink and soft. She said, "Hi, Tim. Do you like my sweater? My grandma made it for me. She said it is a great sweater. It has a heart on it. See?" Tim said, "No, Lily. I don't like your sweater. It is too girly and silly. You look like a baby. Sweaters are dumb. You should take it off." Lily felt sad. She said, "But, Tim. My sweater is warm and nice. It makes me happy. Why are you so mean?" Tim said, "Because sweaters are stupid. Come on, let's go play on the swings."
Tim and Lily went to play on the swings. The wind blew harder. Tim felt cold and shivery. He wished he had a sweater. He saw Lily swinging high and fast. She looked happy and snug. He said, "Lily, can I have your sweater? I am cold and sick." Lily said, "No, Tim. You can't have my sweater. You were mean to me and my sweater. You said you don't like sweaters. You should have listened to your mom. She knows what is best for you." Tim felt sorry. He said, "You are right, Lily. I was wrong. I am sorry. I should have been nice to you and your sweater. Can you forgive me?" Lily said, "Yes, Tim. I can forgive you. You are my friend. But you still can't have my sweater. You need to learn your lesson. Next time, wear a sweater when it is cold. It will make you feel better. I recommend it." Tim said, "OK, Lily. I will. Thank you for being a good friend. And for having a great sweater."
The moral of the story is: You should listen to your mom and wear a sweater when it is cold. You should also be kind to your friends and their sweaters. Sweaters are not dumb. They are warm and cozy and sometimes have hearts on them.
