Lily and Ben were playing in the backyard. They liked to pretend they were animals and make noises. Lily was a cat and Ben was a dog. They chased each other around the grass and the trees.
"Meow, meow, I'm a cat!" Lily said.
"Woof, woof, I'm a dog!" Ben said.
They ran and jumped and had fun. But then they saw something big and black and shiny. It was the grill. Dad used it to cook food sometimes. It had a lid and a handle and wheels. Lily and Ben were curious. They wanted to see what was inside.
They walked closer to the grill. They heard a hiss and a sizzle. They smelled something good. They saw smoke coming out of the lid. They wondered what Dad was cooking.
"Let's look inside!" Ben said.
"OK!" Lily said.
They reached for the handle. But then they heard a loud voice.
"Hey, kids, stay away from the grill! It's hot and dangerous!" Dad said.
Lily and Ben were fearful. They let go of the handle. They felt the heat from the grill. They saw Dad coming towards them. They did not want to get in trouble.
They turned around and ran away. But they did not run fast enough. Dad caught them by their shirts. He lifted them up and hugged them.
"I'm sorry, Dad, we were just curious," Ben said.
"We didn't mean to touch the grill," Lily said.
"I know, I know, but you have to be careful. The grill can burn you and hurt you. You have to stay away from it when I'm cooking. OK?" Dad said.
"OK, Dad, we're sorry," Lily and Ben said.
Dad smiled and kissed them. He put them down and held their hands. He led them to the picnic table. He showed them what he was cooking. It was burgers and hot dogs and corn. It looked yummy.
"Here, you can have some of these. They're not hot anymore. They're just right. But remember, never touch the grill. It's not a toy. It's a tool. OK?" Dad said.
"OK, Dad, we understand. Thank you for the food. It smells good. Can we still play animals?" Lily and Ben said.
"Sure, you can play animals. But only on the grass and the trees. Not near the grill. And be nice to each other. Cats and dogs can be friends. OK?" Dad said.
"OK, Dad, we will. We love you. You're the best," Lily and Ben said.
They hugged Dad and took their plates. They ate their food and enjoyed it. They were happy. They went back to playing animals. They crawled and barked and meowed. They were careful and safe. They had fun.
