One day, a big dog named Max found a thick rod in the park. He picked it up with his mouth and started to shake it. Max liked to play with rods and sticks. He was very happy.
Max saw a little girl named Amy. Amy was playing with a ball. Max wanted to play with Amy. He walked to her and wagged his tail. Amy saw Max and said, "Hi, Max! What do you have?"
Max dropped the thick rod near Amy's feet. He barked and wagged his tail. Amy picked up the rod and said, "Do you want me to throw this?" Max barked again. Amy threw the rod far away. Max ran fast to catch it. They played together all day and had lots of fun.
