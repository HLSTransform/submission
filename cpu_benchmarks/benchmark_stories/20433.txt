Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear her favorite purple dress and play outside in the sun. One day, she was playing with her friend Timmy when they saw a lot of cars on the road. 
"Wow, there's so much traffic today," said Timmy. 
"I believe it's because of the big parade," replied Lily. 
As they watched the cars go by, Lily pointed to a purple car and said, "Look, that car is purple just like my dress!" 
Timmy laughed and said, "You're right, Lily. It's a purple car! Do you believe we'll see more purple cars today?" 
Lily smiled and said, "I believe we will. Let's keep watching!" 
And so, they spent the rest of the day watching the traffic and looking for purple cars, happy to be together and enjoying the simple joys of childhood.
