Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and sing songs. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help her make cookies in the kitchen. Lily was so excited to help!
As they were making cookies, Lily noticed that her sock was not fitting right. It was too tight and made her foot feel funny. She told her mom about it and they went to her room to find a new sock that would fit better.
After finding a new sock, Lily went back to the kitchen and continued to help her mom make cookies. They mixed the ingredients together and put them in the oven to bake. When they were finished, Lily and her mom enjoyed their yummy cookies together.
