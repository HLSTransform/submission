Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and watch the birds fly in the sky. One day, Timmy saw a big aeroplane in the sky. It was very high up and Timmy wanted to follow it.
Timmy asked his mom, "Can we follow the aeroplane?" His mom said, "No, we can't follow the aeroplane. It's too far away and we don't have a plane." Timmy was sad but he understood.
Later that day, Timmy went outside to play in the mud. He made a messy mud pie and showed it to his mom. His mom said, "Wow, that's a messy pie!" Timmy laughed and said, "I know, it's messy like the aeroplane in the sky."
