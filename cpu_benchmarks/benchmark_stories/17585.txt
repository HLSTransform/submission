Lily and Ben went to the farm with Mom and Dad. They saw many animals, like cows, pigs, chickens and sheep. They also saw a pony in a big field. The pony was brown and had a long mane and tail.
"Can we pet the pony, Mom?" Lily asked.
"Sure, but be gentle and careful. The pony might be scared of strangers," Mom said.
Lily and Ben walked slowly to the fence. They reached out their hands and said hello to the pony. The pony looked at them with big eyes and sniffed their fingers. Then it nuzzled their palms and let them stroke its fur.
The pony was very soft and warm. Lily and Ben smiled and giggled. They liked the pony very much.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a tractor. The tractor was driving fast and making a lot of dust. The pony got scared and ran away from the fence. It tripped over a rock and fell down. It tried to get up, but it couldn't. It was hurt and helpless.
Lily and Ben observed the pony. They felt sad and worried. They wanted to help the pony.
"Mom, Dad, the pony is hurt! It needs help!" they shouted.
Mom and Dad heard them and ran to the field. They saw the pony lying on the ground. They called the farmer and the vet. They told Lily and Ben to stay back and not to touch the pony.
The farmer and the vet came soon. They checked the pony and gave it some medicine. They said the pony had a sprain, but it would be okay. They lifted the pony and put it in a trailer. They said they would take the pony to a safe place where it could rest and heal.
Lily and Ben watched the pony go. They waved goodbye and said they hoped the pony would feel better soon. They thanked the farmer and the vet for helping the pony.
Mom and Dad hugged Lily and Ben. They said they were proud of them for being kind and brave. They said they could come back to the farm another day and see the pony again.
Lily and Ben nodded and smiled. They loved the pony and they were happy it was safe. They learned a lot from the farm and the animals. They had a great day.
