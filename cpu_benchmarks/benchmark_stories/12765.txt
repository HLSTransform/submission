Once upon a time, there was a cute bear. He loved to explore the woods and was very brave. One day, he came across a huge billboard. It was so tall and scary that it made the bear shiver. He asked a fox nearby why the billboard was so tall and the fox replied, "They're getting married today!" The bear was puzzled and asked the fox, "Who's getting married?". The fox said, "It's two birds! They love each other very much and they're getting married today. We better go and watch the wedding, it's going to be very exciting!"
So, off they went to the wedding of the two birds. The trees were all decorated with colourful streamers and the two birds sang love songs together. Both the bear and the fox were very happy for the two birds and wished them all the best. The bear and the fox clapped when the two birds officially said "I do to each other! At the end of the wedding, the birds flew off together to start their lives together. The bear and the fox stood together and smiled at each other, both of them feeling very content.
