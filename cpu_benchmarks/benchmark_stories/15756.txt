Once upon a time there was a doll called Molly. She had lots of pretty dresses in her big wardrobe. One day, Molly wanted to play hide and seek. She looked through her dresses, trying to find one to hide in.
When Molly saw the large pink dress, she was so excited. She put it on quickly and ran off to hide. She hid behind the sofa and waited.
"Molly, where are you?" shouted Molly's toys.
"Oh no, I'm hiding!" Molly whispered.
But it was too late. The toys had spotted the large pink dress and came to find her.
Molly couldn't believe it. Although she had worn a large dress, she had been found out. But Molly didn't mind, she had had lots of fun!
