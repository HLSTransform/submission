On a bright sunny day, Sarah went to the park with her mom. She saw lots of things to do at the park, which included playing on the swing, seeing the ducks, and running around. Sarah was so excited! 
After a while, Sarah and her mom got hungry, so they stopped at the store. Sarah saw lots of things to choose from, but her favorite was a big, juicy red peach. She couldn't wait to take a bite! 
When they got home, Sarah's mom cut up the peach and gave it to her. Sarah was so excited to eat it, but when she had taken the first bite, she noticed that the peach was spoiled. Even though the peach wasn't good, Sarah still enjoyed it and she could still eat the parts that were ok. 
Sarah and her mom laughed and smiled, happy that they got to spend time together. Sarah made sure to remember her special trip to the park with her mom and the not-so-good-but-ok-to-eat spoilt peach.
