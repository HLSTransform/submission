Once upon a time, there was a woolen sheep. He lived in a big, green field and was very lazy. Every day, he would just sit in the sun and watch the clouds go by.
One day, the sheep saw a little girl walking in the field. She had round, rosy cheeks and she was smiling. The sheep thought she was so lovely and he wanted to be her friend. He smiled at her and she waved back.
The little girl came closer and sat near the sheep. She told him her name was Jane and then she gave him a big hug. The sheep was very happy and he smiled even bigger.
After that, every day Jane would come back to the same spot in the field and play with the sheep. Most days they were just happy being together, but sometimes they would take a nap in the sunshine or give each other a big tickle with the soft wool.
Every time Jane came, the sheep would smile. They were the best of friends and he knew they always would be.
