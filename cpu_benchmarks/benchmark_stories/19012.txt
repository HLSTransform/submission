Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys outside. He would throw his ball up into the sky and watch it come back down. One day, Timmy's little sister came outside to play with him. She was very messy and spilled juice all over Timmy's toys. Timmy was very sad because his toys were now messy. 
Timmy's sister didn't know how to clean up the toys, so she tried to help by picking them up and throwing them around. She accidentally destroyed one of Timmy's favorite toys. Timmy was very upset and started to cry. His sister felt bad and tried to make it up to him by giving him a hug. 
Timmy's mom saw what happened and came outside to help clean up the toys. She said it was okay and that accidents happen. Timmy felt better and started to play with his sister again. They threw the ball up into the sky and watched it come back down. Timmy was happy again, even though his toys were still a little messy.
