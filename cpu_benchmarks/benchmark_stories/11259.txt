Once upon a time, there was a family who lived in a big house. They had a daughter that was three years old and generous.
One day, the father asked the daughter to turn off the lights after dinner. The daughter said no and the father got angry. He raised his voice and said to the daughter, “Turn off the lights right now!”
The daughter started to cry. She was scared and didn’t want to do it. But then the mother came over and said, “It’s alright. I will help you.” The mother was very generous with her daughter and didn’t want her to be scared. The mother and daughter turned off the lights together.
The father saw how generous the mother was and understood that it was better to talk calmly. He thanked the mother for her help and apologized to his daughter. He told her that it was wrong to raise his voice.
The daughter smiled and was happy that the conflict was solved. From now on, the parents talked to each other with kindness and generosity. They all had a happy ending.
