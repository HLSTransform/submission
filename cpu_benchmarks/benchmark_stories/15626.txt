Tom and Anna liked to go on the subway with Mom. They liked to see the big trains and the people and the lights. Mom said the subway was fast and fun.
One day, they went on the subway to visit Grandma. They got on the train and found a seat. Tom looked out the window and saw a tunnel. It was dark and scary. He held Mom's hand.
"Mom, where are we?" he asked.
"We are under the ground, Tom. The subway goes through tunnels to get to different places. Don't be afraid, it will be over soon," Mom said.
Anna looked at the ceiling and saw something shiny. It was a sticker of a star. It was yellow and bright. It made her smile.
"Look, Tom, a star!" she said. "It glows in the dark!"
Tom looked up and saw the sticker. He liked it too. It made him feel better.
"It's a sweet star, Anna. Maybe Grandma has some stars at her house," he said.
Mom hugged them and said, "Maybe she does. We'll find out soon. The subway is almost there. Are you ready to see Grandma?"
Tom and Anna nodded and said, "Yes, Mom. We love Grandma!"
They held hands and waited for the train to stop. They were happy and excited. They liked the subway and the star. They liked Mom and Grandma. They liked each other.
