Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot had a blue collar. One day, Spot saw a big, dangerous cat. The cat had big, sharp teeth.
Spot blinked at the cat and said, "Go away, dangerous cat! I don't want you to hurt me." The cat blinked back at Spot and said, "I won't hurt you, little dog. I just want to play."
So, Spot and the dangerous cat played together. They ran and jumped and had lots of fun. In the end, they both found out that they could be friends, even if one of them looked dangerous. And they lived happily ever after.
