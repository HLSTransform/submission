There was a giant in the forest. He was so big and so tall that he could look over the trees. He was an enormous giant! One day, a baby bunny came to the forest. He wanted to peek at the giant, but he was scared he might get into trouble. He hid in the grass and peered through the leaves to peak at the giant. The giant didn't even know he was there. The bunny saw the giant's enormous feet, and decided he had seen enough. He hopped away and ran back home to his family, thankful he had been able to peek at the giant without getting into trouble.
