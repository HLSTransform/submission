Once upon a time there was a little girl called Sophia. Sophia was always very polite. She said please and thank you and always treated others with respect. 
One night, Sophia was in her bedroom, and feeling a little scared. It was dark and she couldn't see. Suddenly, her mum appeared in the doorway. She held a warm, glowing lamp in her hand. 
Sophia smiled and said, "Mummy, what is that?"
Her mum smiled back and said softly, "It's a lamp, my love, it will make everything feel better."
Sophia believed her. She felt so much better with the lamp. She could read her books and play with her toys. She was no longer scared of the dark, because the lamp was there to keep her safe.
The next morning, Sophia's mum came in to check on her. Sophia was very polite and thanked her for bringing in the lamp. Her mum smiled, gave her a big hug, and said, "It's always good to believe in yourself, and in others too."
