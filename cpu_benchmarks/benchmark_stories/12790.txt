A little girl was running around the park on a beautiful day. She suddenly stopped in her tracks when she saw a white rabbit in the corner of the grass. She had never seen a rabbit like this before.
The bunny looked very magical and the little girl slowly walked closer until she was face-to-face with it. He was wearing a hat and a bowtie, and the little girl couldn't help but smile.
"Hello strange bunny," she said quietly.
The bunny looked up and spoke back to her. "Good morning, little girl. My name is Mr. Rabbit and I'm here on a very important mission," he said.
The little girl was surprised but also eager to hear more. "What mission, Mr. Rabbit?"
"I'm here to urge you to do something magical," he said.
The little girl felt embarrassed at first, but she was also excited by the idea. She worried about what other people might think, but she eventually decided to take the plunge and waved her hands in the air, speaking words she had never said before.
Within seconds, the park filled with tiny rainbow-colored bubbles and the little girl clapped her hands in excitement.
Mr. Rabbit smiled. "You did it, little girl! You used your own magic and it was wonderful!" He hopped away, leaving the little girl with a feeling of joy and amazement.
