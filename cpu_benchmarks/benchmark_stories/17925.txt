Once upon a time, there was a boy called Tom. Tom was 3 years old and was very fast. He liked to run around and have lots of fun.
One day, Tom wanted to do something different. He heard about a special race that was being held in the town. A judge was there to decide who was the fastest of them all.
Tom thought he could win the race and decided to join it. He received lots of cheers from the crowd and waited for the race to begin.
Tom ran so fast that he won the race! The judge was so impressed with his speed that he gave Tom a big trophy! Tom was so happy and ran around with his trophy for everyone to see.
Tom goes to the race each year and still loves to receive his big trophy. He loves to run around and have fun and is the fastest of them all!
