Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She liked to jog every day. One day, while jogging, she found a book on the ground. The book was a novel. It had a pretty cover with a delicate flower on it.
Lily wanted to read the novel, but she had a problem. Her little brother, Tim, wanted to play with her. He did not like to wait. Tim took the novel from Lily and tried to read it too. But he was too young to understand the words.
Lily was sad because she wanted to read her novel, and Tim was sad because he wanted to play. Then, Lily had an idea. She decided to read the novel out loud to Tim while they sat under a big tree. Tim listened to the story and imagined all the fun things in it. They both were happy and enjoyed the story together.
