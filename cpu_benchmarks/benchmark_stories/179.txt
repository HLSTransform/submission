Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to play with his toys. He had a favorite old teddy bear that he always carried with him. One day, Timmy's friend Jimmy came over to play. Jimmy saw the old teddy bear and said, "That toy is not cool. I don't like it."
Timmy felt sad and said, "I disagree. My teddy bear is very special to me. It has a lot of value because it was a gift from my grandma."
Jimmy thought about it and said, "You're right. I'm sorry for saying that. Maybe I can play with your teddy bear too."
Timmy smiled and said, "That's okay. We can share it." They played together happily with the old teddy bear and had a lot of fun. From then on, Jimmy understood the value of old toys and never disagreed with Timmy again.
