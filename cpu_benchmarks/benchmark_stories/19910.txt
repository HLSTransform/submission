Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved shiny things and always wore a pretty necklace with a jewel on it. One day, Lily's necklace broke and the jewel fell off. She looked everywhere for it, but couldn't find it.
Lily was very sad and didn't know what to do. Her mom told her about a modern machine that could help find lost things. So, they went to the store to get it. Lily used the machine and it showed her where the jewel was. But, the jewel was on a high shelf and Lily couldn't reach it.
She tried and tried, but couldn't get it. Then, her mom helped her by lifting her up and she was finally able to reach the jewel. Lily was so happy and put the jewel back on her necklace. She learned that sometimes it's okay to ask for help when you need it.
