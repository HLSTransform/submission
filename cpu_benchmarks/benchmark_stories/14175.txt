Once upon a time there were two animals. One was a bunny and the other a cow. The bunny wanted to go to the farm, but the cow said it was not safe. The bunny begged and begged. Finally, the cow agreed to go to the farm with the bunny. 
When they arrived, they saw lots of other animals. They made friends and explored the farm. They even had a big meal together!
At the end of the day, the bunny and cow realised how important it was to stay safe. They learnt that when someone says it is not safe, it is better to listen. They thanked the cow for taking care of them and went back home. 
The bunny and the cow had a very important lesson that day. No matter where they go, it is always most important to be safe.
