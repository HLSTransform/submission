Once upon a time, there was a giant named Bob. He was very big and strong. Bob lived in a big house on a big hill. He had many friends, but he was sad because he wanted a pet.
One day, Bob decided he would find a pet. He looked everywhere. He looked under rocks, in trees, and behind bushes. He found many animals, but they were all too small for him. Then, he met a persistent dog named Max. Max was a little dog, but he was not afraid of the giant.
"Hi, giant!" said Max. "I want to be your pet."
Bob smiled and said, "Okay, Max. You can be my pet." Max was very happy. He wagged his tail and jumped up and down.
From that day on, Bob and Max were the best of friends. They played together, ate together, and slept together. Bob was happy to have a pet, and Max was happy to have a giant friend. And they lived happily ever after.
