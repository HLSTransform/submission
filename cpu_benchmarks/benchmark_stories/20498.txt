Once upon a time there was a girl named Lily. Lily loved to design things. Today, she decided to design a fun lunch.
She pulled out all the tasty food for her lunch. There were juicy peaches, crunchy carrots, and soft bread. It all looked very yummy! Then, with a smile on her face, Lily found some pretty pink paper. She cut out fun shapes and patterns and decorated her lunch with them.
She was finished! Lily's lunch looked very special and pretty with its pink designs. She ate all of her lunch, every last bite. It was very tasty and she was very happy!
