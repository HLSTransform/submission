Lily and Ben like to play in the sand. They make a big castle with a bucket and a shovel. They put shells and sticks on the castle to make it pretty. They are happy with their castle.
But then a big dog comes. The dog is friendly, but he does not know about the castle. He runs and jumps and barks. He knocks over the castle with his paws. Lily and Ben are sad. They cry and hug each other.
The dog's owner sees what happened. He is sorry. He says, "I'm sorry, kids. My dog did not mean to ruin your castle. He just wanted to play. Can I help you make a new one?"
Lily and Ben are shy. They do not know the man or the dog. They do not say anything. They just nod.
The man and the dog help Lily and Ben make a new castle. They make it bigger and prettier than before. They have fun together. The dog is gentle and careful. He does not touch the castle. He licks Lily and Ben's faces. They laugh and pet him.
When they finish, they cover the castle with a towel. They do not want another dog to knock it over. They say, "Thank you, sir. Thank you, dog. You are nice. We like you."
The man and the dog say, "You're welcome, kids. You are nice, too. We like you. Have a good day."
They wave goodbye and leave. Lily and Ben smile and hug each other. They are happy with their new castle and their new friends.
