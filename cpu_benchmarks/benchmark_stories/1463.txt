Once upon a time there was a girl who loved to skip. She had an incredible chain that she wore around her neck. It was her favourite thing in the world.
One day, she went to the park to skip with her chain on. She didn't know that it would come off. She skipped and jumped and choreographed leaps through the grass.
Before she knew it, the chain was gone. She looked everywhere, but it was not to be found. She became very sad, realising that her chain was lost.
But then, something incredible happened. As she looked back at the park, a bright light shone from a chain in the grass. The girl rushed over and couldn't believe her eyes. It was her chain! It was still there! 
The girl quickly put it back around her neck and vowed never to lose it again. She was so incredibly happy.
