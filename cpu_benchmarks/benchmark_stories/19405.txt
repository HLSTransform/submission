Once there was a little girl who was worried. She was worried because her team had to compete in a modern race. Everyone was worried except the little girl's mom, who was very brave.
The little girl's mom said that if they worked together, they would win the race. Everyone agreed and started to practice. They practiced really hard and really fast.
When race day came, the little girl was very nervous. She was worried that she wouldn't run fast enough. But with lots of cheering from her mom and the rest of the team, the little girl was able to run her fastest. 
In the end, the team won the race! Everyone was so happy, especially the little girl. She didn't worry anymore, because her team and her mom were so brave and worked so hard!
