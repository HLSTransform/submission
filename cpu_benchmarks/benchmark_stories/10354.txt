Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play in the park. They had a red ball, a blue bike and a yellow bowl. They shared their toys and had fun together.
One day, a big dog came to the park. It was black and brown and had a loud bark. Tom and Lily were scared of the dog. They ran to their mom and hid behind her.
"Mom, mom, there is a big dog in the park! It is scary and noisy! Can we go home?" they cried.
Mom looked at the dog and smiled. She knew the dog. It was Rex, the dog of her friend Sara. Rex was a friendly and harmless dog. He just wanted to play.
"Tom and Lily, don't be afraid of Rex. He is a good dog. He won't hurt you. He likes children and toys. Why don't you say hello to him and give him your yellow bowl? He loves to play fetch." Mom said.
Tom and Lily were not sure. They liked their yellow bowl. They did not want to lose it. But they also wanted to be brave and kind. They decided to try.
They walked slowly to Rex and said hello. Rex wagged his tail and licked their faces. He was happy to see them. He saw the yellow bowl and barked. He wanted to play fetch.
Tom and Lily threw the yellow bowl and Rex ran after it. He brought it back and dropped it at their feet. He wanted them to throw it again. Tom and Lily laughed and played with Rex. They had a lot of fun.
Mom and Sara watched them and smiled. They were proud of Tom and Lily. They learned to overcome their fear and make a new friend. They learned that not all dogs are scary and that some are harmless and playful. They learned to share their toys and be generous. They learned a valuable lesson in the park.
