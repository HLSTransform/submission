Once there was a little fox named Sam who was very curious. Every day he would explore the forest, looking for new and exciting places to play. One day, he came across a strange tree. It was so strange that he climbed up it without even thinking twice about it. 
When Sam got to the top of the tree, he was amazed. There was a big surprise inside the tree waiting for him - a big bowl full of treats! Sam was so excited that he quickly grabbed a few of the treats and started to eat them. 
Suddenly, he heard a voice. It was the tree! It said "Welcome, little fox. I am the guardian of this tree, and I want to reward you for being brave enough to explore new places. Please, take a few more treats - they are my special reward for being curious." Sam was so happy that he thanked the tree and continued to munch on his treats.
The moral of this story is that if we stay curious and explore new things, we can sometimes be rewarded!
