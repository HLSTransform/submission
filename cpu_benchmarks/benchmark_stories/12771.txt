Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Joe. He had a humble life but he was very happy. Every morning, Joe would wake early and go to the garden. He always brought his rope with him. Today, Joe arrived in the garden filled with excitement.
Joe looked around and noticed the birds hopping from branch to branch. Joe smiled and then grabbed his rope. He began to make a swing, stretching it out between two tall trees. As he was tying the rope, he heard a voice.
"What are you doing?" The voice asked.
Joe looked around and saw a little cat. Joe sat down and said, "I'm making a swing. Do you want to join?"
The little cat thought for a moment and then said, "Yes!"
So Joe and the little cat spent the whole morning playing on the swing. Joe felt very happy and even the little cat seemed to be smiling. When it was time to go home, Joe thanked the little cat and said goodbye.
Back at his home, Joe was very proud of himself. He had made a swing with just his rope and had made a new friend!
