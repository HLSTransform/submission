Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park near her house. One day, she saw a big fountain in the middle of the park. She was so excited to see it!
Lily wanted to touch the fountain, but her mom told her not to. She said it was lucky to throw a coin into the fountain and make a wish. Lily didn't understand why it was lucky, but she listened to her mom.
As they were leaving the park, Lily saw a boy who threw a whole handful of coins into the fountain. She thought it was silly, but the boy said he was hoping to get rich. Lily turned to her mom and said, "I don't think that's how luck works."
Her mom smiled and said, "That's right, Lily. Luck isn't about getting rich. It's about being grateful for what you have." Lily felt lucky to have such a wise mom.
