Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun and run around with her friends. One day, she fell down and hurt her knee. Her mom saw that she had a little cut and needed a stitch. 
Lily was scared, but her mom held her hand and told her it would be okay. The doctor put a bandage on her knee and said she needed to rest for a few days. Lily felt weak and sad that she couldn't play with her friends.
After a few days, Lily's knee was feeling better. Her friends came over to visit and they clapped when they saw she was feeling better. Lily smiled and felt happy that her friends cared about her. She knew she was lucky to have such great friends and a loving family.
