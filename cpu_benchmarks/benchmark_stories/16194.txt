Once upon a time, there was a duck. The duck wanted to find a place to fit in, but it was a struggle. Everywhere the duck went, he was chased away.
One day, the duck saw a beautiful porch. The porch was open and the duck thought he could fit in there. So he hopped onto the porch. But then something strange happened.
Suddenly it started to rain. The rain got heavier and heavier. The duck was getting wet and scared.
The duck never imagined such a thing was possible. He didn't know that rain could ruin his peaceful place on the porch.
Luckily, the duck was saved by his friend, a dog. The dog helped the duck escape to a safe and dry place.
The moral of the story is that sometimes it is best to find a safe and dry place. One never knows when the weather can change and it can be dangerous. So it is important to be careful and look out for our friends when they are in trouble.
