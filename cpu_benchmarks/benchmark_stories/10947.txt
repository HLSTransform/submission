Once upon a time, there was a soft, little lamb named Lily. She had lots of wool on her body. Lily lived on a big farm with other animals. She liked to play with her friends and eat green grass.
One day, Lily saw a big box in the farm. It was closed. Lily wanted to open it, but she was too small. She asked her friends for help. The big cow, the strong horse, and the tall giraffe tried to open the box, but they could not do it. They all felt sad.
Then, a tiny ant came to Lily and said, "I can help you open the box." The other animals laughed at the ant. But Lily let the ant try. The ant found a small hole in the box and went inside. The ant opened the box from inside. All the animals were happy and said sorry to the ant for laughing. The moral of the story is to never judge someone by their size, as even the smallest ones can do big things.
