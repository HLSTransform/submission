Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her garden. She planted flowers and watched them grow. One day, Lily wanted to plant some vegetables. She thought it would be difficult because she had never done it before.
Lily asked her mom for help. Her mom showed her how to plant the vegetables and take care of them. Every day, Lily watered the garden and pulled out the weeds. She watched the vegetables grow bigger and bigger.
Finally, the vegetables were ready to eat. Lily was so happy and proud of herself. She realized that even though something may seem difficult, with help and hard work, she could do it. The moral of the story is to never give up and always try your best.
