Papa was an independent man. He had a helicopter which he loved to fly. Every day he would hang the helicopter in a tree.
One day, Papa asked his 3 year old child if they wanted to come with him and fly the helicopter. The child said yes. Papa helped the child climb up the tree and hang the helicopter by the branches.
Then they flew the helicopter up in the sky, higher and higher. It was so much fun! The child was laughing and smiling the whole time.
They came back home when it was time for dinner. Papa said he was proud of the child and that they were very independent.
The next day, Papa was surprised to see that the helicopter was already hanging in the tree. The child had put it there all on their own! Papa was so happy to see the child was so independent.
