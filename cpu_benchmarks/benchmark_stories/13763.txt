Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play with their toys. They had many toys, but they always wanted more. They did not like to share or say thank you to anyone. One day, their mom told them they were going to visit their grandma for Thanksgiving. Tom and Lily were not happy. They did not want to leave their toys or see their grandma.
When they got to grandma's house, they saw a big turkey on the table. It smelled good, but Tom and Lily did not care. They ran to the living room and looked for toys. They found some old books and puzzles, but they did not like them. They threw them on the floor and made a lot of noise. Grandma heard them and came to see what was wrong. She was sad to see the mess and the rude twins.
She said, "Tom and Lily, why are you so noisy and mean? Don't you know that Thanksgiving is a time to be thankful and kind? You should be happy to see me and enjoy the food I made for you. You should also respect the toys I have, even if they are not new. They are special to me, because they remind me of your mom and dad when they were little. They used to play with them and say thank you to me. They were good and sweet children. You should learn from them."
Tom and Lily felt ashamed. They realized they had been selfish and ungrateful. They said sorry to grandma and helped her clean up the mess. They hugged her and said thank you for the turkey and the toys. They also said thank you to their mom and dad for bringing them to grandma's house. They decided to be more thankful and kind from then on. They ate the turkey with grandma and enjoyed the books and puzzles. They had a happy Thanksgiving after all.
