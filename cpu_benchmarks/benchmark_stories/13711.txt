Once upon a time, there was a little flower. It was very small and didn't have any power. But it wanted to be big and strong like the other flowers. One day, the sun came out and shone on the flower. The flower started to bloom! It grew bigger and bigger until it was the fanciest flower in the garden. 
All the other flowers were amazed at the little flower's power. They asked the flower how it became so big and fancy. The little flower replied, "I just needed some sunshine and love." And from that day on, the little flower was the happiest and fanciest flower in the garden.
