Once upon a time, there was a troubled little girl. Her name was Janie. She lived with her mom and dad in a small house. 
One day, Janie was looking for her mom's wallet. She searched all over the house, but she could not find it. She was getting more and more sad and troubled.
Just then, Janie's mom appeared. She had a big smile on her face. In her hand was the missing wallet! Janie was happy to see her mom and the wallet. 
Her mom hugged her and said, "I found your wallet in a special place where I keep it safe." Janie was relieved and they hugged each other. 
The end.
