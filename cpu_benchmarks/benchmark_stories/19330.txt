Once there was a wild figure. She was made of fire and she loved to burn.
She burned through a forest and people watched as she ran by. She ran across the sky and burned through the clouds.
The figure burned until she ran out of energy. She could not burn anymore. Then she found a big pond. She jumped in and played in the cool water. 
The people watching were so happy that the wild figure was happy and safe. They cheered and clapped as she splashed around. 
The little figure smiled and felt better after her long journey of burning.
