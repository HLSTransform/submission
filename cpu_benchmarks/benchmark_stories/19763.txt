Once there was a bald man who lived in a big house. He looked out his window each day and saw the waste that was all around. There was lots of rubbish and things that he wanted to throw away.
So the bald man decided he wanted to do something about the waste. He came up with a plan to tidy it all up.
He gathered lots of friends together from all around the world and asked everyone to help. Some swept up the rubbish, some put it in bags and some recycled the things that could be reused.
After hours and hours of hard work, they had finished cleaning up and they all looked around to see the amazing job they'd done. Everyone was excited - they had turned the waste into something beautiful and the bald man was so proud. Everyone clapped and applauded their hard work.
