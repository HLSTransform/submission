Once upon a time, in a big valley, there was a hairy monster. This monster was big and green. He lived in a little cave. He had a big box that he kept locked.
One day, a little girl named Lucy came to the valley. She saw the hairy monster and was not scared. She wanted to be friends with the monster. The monster liked Lucy and wanted to be friends too. They played and had fun together.
Lucy saw the big box and was curious. She asked the monster what was inside. The monster said, "It's a secret. You can't unlock it." But Lucy really wanted to know. When the monster was asleep, Lucy found the key and unlocked the box.
Inside the box, there were many bees. The bees were angry and flew out of the box. They started to sting Lucy and the monster. The monster woke up and was very sad. He knew the bees would hurt them. Lucy and the monster had to run away from the valley, and they were not happy anymore.
