Once upon a time, there was a furry dog named Max who lived on a ranch with his owner, Timmy. Max loved to play outside and chase rabbits. One day, while Max was playing, he saw a cat.
"Hi there, cat!" said Max.
"Hello, dog," said the cat. "I am looking for a new home. Do you know of any good ranches around here?"
Max thought for a moment. "Well, you can stay here with me and Timmy," he said.
The cat was happy to hear this, but then a problem arose. Max and the cat started to fight over who would get the best spot on the ranch. Timmy had to step in and remind them that they were both welcome and there was enough room for everyone. From that day on, Max and the cat lived happily ever after on the ranch.
