Once upon a time, there was a very smart cat named Max. Max loved to collect things. He had a big box full of shiny rocks, colorful buttons, and even some old coins. Max was very proud of his collection.
One day, Max saw a little mouse with soft brown fur scurrying across the floor. Max knew he had to catch the mouse to add its fur to his collection. So, Max used his intelligent brain to come up with a plan. He pretended to sleep, waiting for the mouse to come closer.
Finally, the mouse came close enough and Max pounced! But instead of catching the mouse, Max found himself face to face with a big dog. Max quickly realized that collecting things wasn't as important as staying safe. From that day on, Max didn't try to collect anything dangerous. He was still a very intelligent cat, but he learned to be careful.
