Once upon a time, there was a very messy circle. The circle was covered with toys and paper and clothes. In the middle of the circle was a puppy. He was stuck and couldn't move.
The little puppy was scared and called for help. A nice boy heard the puppy's cry and rushed to the circle. He started picking up the toys and clothes and putting them in a pile.
The boy scooped the puppy up into his arms and gave him a big hug. The puppy licked his face and smiled. Together they walked away from the messy circle.
The boy and the puppy were best friends from then on. The boy had rescued the puppy from the messy circle and the puppy was very happy.
