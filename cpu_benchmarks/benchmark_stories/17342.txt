Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big tree with many leaves. They want to climb the tree and see what is up there.
"Come on, Ben, let's go up the tree!" Anna says.
"OK, Anna, but be careful. The tree is very old and the bark is rough," Ben says.
They hold on to the branches and go up the tree. They see many birds and squirrels and bugs. They also see a hole in the trunk. They are curious and look inside.
"Wow, look, Ben, there is a book in the hole!" Anna says.
"A book? In the tree? Let me see!" Ben says.
They take out the book and open it. The book has many pages with strange words and pictures. The pages are yellow and torn. The cover is leather and has a metal lock.
"This book is very old, Anna. Maybe it is ancient. I wonder who put it here and why," Ben says.
"Maybe it is a magic book, Ben. Maybe it has secrets and spells and stories," Anna says.
They look at the book and try to read it. They do not understand the words, but they like the pictures. They see dragons and fairies and castles and stars.
"This book is amazing, Anna. I wish we could keep it," Ben says.
"Me too, Ben. But maybe someone is looking for it. Maybe it belongs to someone who loves it very much," Anna says.
They think for a while. Then they decide to put the book back in the hole. They close the cover and lock it with the metal lock. They hope the book is safe and happy in the tree.
"Goodbye, book. Thank you for letting us see you," Anna says.
"Goodbye, book. Maybe we will see you again someday," Ben says.
They climb down the tree and go back to their parents. They do not tell anyone about the book. They keep it as a secret in their hearts. They always remember the book and the tree and the adventure they had.
