Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily's mommy told her to clean up her toys. But Lily didn't want to clean up, she wanted to play. 
Lily's mommy got upset and said, "If you don't clean up your toys, you can't go upstairs to your room." Lily didn't want to miss out on playing in her room, so she quickly cleaned up her toys. 
After a while, Lily wanted to play with her dolls upstairs. But when she went to go upstairs, she saw that her mommy had covered the stairs with a big blanket. "Mommy, can you please move the blanket so I can go upstairs?" Lily asked. 
But her mommy said, "No, you didn't clean up your toys like I asked. You can't go upstairs now." Lily felt sad and didn't know what to do. She sat on the floor and cried. 
From that day on, Lily learned that it's important to listen to her mommy and daddy. And she never forgot to clean up her toys again.
