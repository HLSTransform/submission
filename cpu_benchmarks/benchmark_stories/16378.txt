Once upon a time, in a big garden, there was a pretty flower named Lily. Lily was a very nice flower who loved to play with her friends, the bees, and the butterflies. They would dance and sing all day long. Everyone was glad to be friends with Lily.
One day, a naughty boy came to the garden. He saw Lily and her friends playing. The boy wanted to join them, but he did not know how to play nicely. He pulled on Lily's petals and scared her friends away. Lily felt sad and hurt.
Lily's friends, the bees and the butterflies, saw what the boy did. They decided to punish the boy so he would learn to be nice. The bees buzzed around him and the butterflies tickled his nose. The boy said sorry to Lily and promised to be nice. From that day on, the boy played nicely with Lily and her friends, and they were all glad to be friends with each other.
