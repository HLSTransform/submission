Once upon a time, there was a big parade in town. Everyone was excited to see it. The parade was very popular, and lots of people came to watch. 
A little girl named Lily was there with her family. She was so happy to see all the colorful floats and balloons. Suddenly, she saw a clown walking by. He looked very funny with his big red nose and silly hat. 
Lily wanted to say hello to the clown, but she was too shy to speak. So, she just smiled and waved. The clown noticed her and came over to say hello. He gave her a balloon animal and they became friends. 
After the parade, Lily was sad to say goodbye to her new friend. But the clown promised to come back next year for the parade. Lily was so excited to see him again and couldn't wait to speak to him. And just like the clown promised, he came back the next year and they had even more fun together.
