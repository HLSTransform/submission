Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play outside, but it was very cold outside. She needed a scarf to keep her warm. 
Lily asked her mommy, "Please, can I have a scarf?" Her mommy said yes and gave her a soft, warm scarf. 
But then, Lily's scarf flew away in the wind! Lily felt helpless and sad. 
Luckily, a kind man saw Lily's scarf fly away and ran to help. He caught the scarf and gave it back to Lily. Lily was very happy and said, "Thank you!"
