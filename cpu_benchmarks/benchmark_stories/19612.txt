Once upon a time, there was a little bird who loved to sing. Everywhere the bird went, it sang a lovely song. All the other animals in the forest enjoyed the bird's song.
One day the bird was singing when it saw a flower. The bird stopped singing and looked at the flower. It was so pretty that the bird couldn't help but to sing a special song. It was a song of love and kindness, just for the flower.
The flower smiled and said, "Thank you for your lovely song!" The bird was so happy. It sang its song even louder, and all the other animals in the forest clapped and cheered.
From that day on, the bird would go to the flower every day to sing its song. The flower liked it so much that it even gave the bird a special present, a bright yellow ribbon. The bird flew away with the ribbon around its neck, singing its lovely song.
