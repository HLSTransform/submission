Once there was a very wealthy man. He had so many luxuries that it was impressive! Every day, he would bounce from one luxury to the next. He had it all, and he was very happy.
One day, he decided to go for a new luxury. He was so excited that he started to bounce around the store! He was so focused on finding his new luxury that he had soon spent all his money.
The wealthy man was very sad now that he had no more money. His luxuries were gone. But then he remembered why he had gone to the store in the first place. He had gotten a new luxury before he ran out of money! So he bounced home with a smile.
The wealthy man's new luxury was a trampoline. And every day, he bounced on his trampoline! It was his favorite thing. He even made some new friend s that liked to bounce with him. 
From then on, he learned to save his money and not go on so many shopping trips. But he definitely didn't regret getting the trampoline! He was always bouncing, and it made him so happy!
