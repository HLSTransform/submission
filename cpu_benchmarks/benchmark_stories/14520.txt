Once there was a bear who liked to look around. One day, he went out and what he saw made him so crazy he couldn't believe his eyes. Everywhere he looked there were wild birds! The bear was so excited he just stood there, watching them for a long time. After a while, he said to himself, "This is too much fun! I have to tell all my friends about this!" So he got up and ran off to find them. When he arrived, his friends were just as amazed as he was. They spent the whole day looking at the crazy birds!
