Once upon a time, there was a gray cat named Tom. Tom liked to think a lot. He would sit under a big tree and think about fun things to do.
One day, while Tom was thinking, he saw a little red ball. He wanted to play with the ball. He ran and gave the ball a big rub with his head. The ball started to roll, and Tom chased after it.
Tom and the red ball played all day long. They had so much fun together. When the sun went down, Tom went back to his big tree. He thought about how much fun he had with the red ball. Tom couldn't wait for another day to play with his new friend.
