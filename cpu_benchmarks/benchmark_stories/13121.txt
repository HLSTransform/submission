Once upon a time there was a girl named True. True was a very special fruit because it was both sweet and spicy. One day, True decided to go on an adventure and wander the world.
True went through forests and over oceans. Everywhere she went, True's delicious flavor brought joy to everyone she met.
But then, late one evening, True suddenly heard a noise. It was loud and scary and it made True panic. She didn't know what to do. So she did the only thing she could: she ran!
For hours True ran until finally she came to a safe place. It was a bright, friendly place and True soon realized it was home. Her adventure was over!
True had learned that even in the most frightening moments, a sweet and spicy flavor can make all the difference.
