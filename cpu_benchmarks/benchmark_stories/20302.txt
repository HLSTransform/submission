Lila and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to pretend they were animals. Lila was a leopard and Tom was a monkey. They ran and jumped and climbed on the trees and slides.
"Roar!" Lila said. "I am a fast and strong leopard. I can catch you, monkey!"
"Ooh-ooh-ah-ah!" Tom said. "You can't catch me, leopard. I am a smart and funny monkey. I can swing and hide from you!"
They chased each other for a long time. They had a lot of fun. But then they got tired and dizzy. They felt like they were spinning and falling.
"Stop, stop!" Lila said. "I am too dizzy to run. Let's finish the game."
"Okay, okay!" Tom said. "I am too dizzy to swing. You win, leopard. You are the best animal."
They sat down on the grass and drank some water. They smiled and hugged each other.
"You are a good friend, monkey," Lila said.
"You are a good friend, leopard," Tom said.
They rested for a while and then they played another game. They were happy.
