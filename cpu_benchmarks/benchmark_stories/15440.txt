Once upon a time there was a little girl named Abby. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. Today her mommy was making something special. She was pouring bright red strawberries into a bowl. Abby watched as the colorful strawberries fell into the bowl. 
Next, Abby's mommy added some sugar and cream. She started stirring the mixture with a spoon. Abby loved how it smelled. "Can I try it?" she asked. Her mommy said yes and gave Abby a spoon to share. 
As Abby took a spoonful of the creamy strawberry mixture, she was surprised. It was so sweet! She smiled and took another bite. Finally, her mommy poured the mixture into a pan and popped it into the oven.
Soon the smell of the strawberry treat filled the room. After a while, it was ready to eat. Abby couldn't believe how delicious it was. She thought it was the best treat she had ever tasted!
