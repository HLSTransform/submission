Sue was an alert little girl. She loved to swing in her backyard. She played on her swing for hours.
One day, Sue’s daddy came to the yard. He had a big smile on his face. He was carrying a bucket and a cloth. Sue was excited.
Daddy said, “I am going to polish the swing. That way, it will be shiny and look like new!” 
He got to work and started polishing the swing. Dingy spots became shiny. It took a while, but eventually the swing was sparkling.
Sue was so happy. She thanked her daddy for making her swing look so nice. They both sat down in the swing and had a great time. Sue loved her daddy and her shiny new swing.
