Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books about animals. One day, she went to the park and saw a goose. The goose was big and had feathers that were white and gray.
Lily went up to the goose and said, "Hello, Mr. Goose. Do you want to hear a story?" The goose just looked at her and honked. Lily took that as a yes and started to read her book.
As she read, she noticed that the goose was getting closer and closer. Suddenly, the goose took a bite of Lily's apple. Lily made a sour face and said, "Hey, that's my apple!" The goose just honked and waddled away.
Lily learned that not all animals like to listen to stories and some of them can be a little bit sour. She went home and told her mom all about her adventure with the goose. From that day on, Lily made sure to keep her snacks close by and to always ask before sharing her stories.
