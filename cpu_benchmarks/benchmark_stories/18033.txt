Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was very happy because his mommy gifted him a toy car. The toy car was so shiny, Timmy wanted to polish it. He took a cloth and started polishing the car.
Suddenly, Timmy's sister fell down and got hurt. She had to go to the hospital. Timmy was sad because he couldn't go with her. But he remembered that he had polished his toy car and it looked just like new. He thought that maybe his sister would feel better if he gifted her the shiny toy car.
When Timmy's sister came back from the hospital, he gave her the toy car. She was so happy and hugged him tightly. Timmy felt good because he knew he had gifted his sister something that made her happy.
