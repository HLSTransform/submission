Once upon a time, there was a chubby lady who loved to take nice walks. One day, she was walking and noticed a little girl watching her. The lady waved at the little girl, who came up to her. The little girl said her name was Sue. 
The lady smiled and asked Sue why she was so happy. Sue said she wanted to play with the lady. The lady said she would love to, and asked what they should do. Sue suggested they go to a nearby park. 
The lady and Sue went to the park and they played tag, they laughed a lot. After they had finished playing, the lady noticed how happy Sue was. She realized that all Sue needed was someone to spend time with. The lady was so glad that Sue had found her. 
The two embraced and said goodbye. The lady had a big smile on her face as she watched Sue got away. She looked forward to seeing Sue again soon.
