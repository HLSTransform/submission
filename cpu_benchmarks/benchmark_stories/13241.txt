Once there was a little girl called Claire. Claire was a very troubled girl, and she often felt things that she didn't really understand. One day, she was feeling particularly sad. She wanted to find something that would make her happy. 
So, she went to her mum, who gave her a big hug and a special mug. It was a very special mug. On it were the words 'Everything will pass'. 
Claire didn't know what that meant, but she liked the way the mug looked. She took a sip from it and it tasted sweet, like a little bit of love. 
Claire realised that nothing lasts forever and that even when she felt particularly troubled, it would pass. She finished her drink, giving it a little kiss. Then, with a smile, she passed the mug to her mum.
