Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play in her garden. She had a beautiful poppy that she loved to water and take care of every day. One day, her friend Timmy came to visit and asked if he could play with her poppy. Lily said yes, but warned him to be careful not to spoil it.
Timmy played with the poppy for a while, but then he accidentally stepped on it and broke it. Lily was very sad and started to cry. Timmy felt miserable and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to spoil your pretty flower." 
Lily wiped away her tears and forgave Timmy, but she still felt sad about her broken poppy. Timmy promised to help her plant a new one, and they spent the rest of the day digging in the dirt and planting seeds. Lily was happy again, and she knew that her new poppy would be just as beautiful as the old one.
