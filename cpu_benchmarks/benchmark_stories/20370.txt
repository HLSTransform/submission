Ben was a big dog who liked to chase cats. He thought it was fun to make them run and hide. He did not care if they were scared or hurt. He was proud of being fast and strong.
One day, he saw a new cat in the yard. It was small and gray, with a white spot on its nose. Ben barked and ran towards it, ready to catch it. But the cat did not run away. It stood still and looked at Ben with big green eyes.
Ben was surprised. He slowed down and sniffed the cat. The cat did not smell like fear. It smelled like milk and grass. The cat did not hiss or scratch. It rubbed its head against Ben's nose and purred.
Ben felt something new. He felt warm and soft. He felt curious and friendly. He licked the cat's ear and wagged his tail. The cat licked his cheek and curled up next to him.
Ben heard a voice. It was his owner, Tom. Tom was angry. He shouted at Ben and pulled him away from the cat. He said Ben was a bad dog. He said Ben should be ashamed of himself. He said Ben had to surrender the cat and never chase it again.
Ben did not understand. He did not want to leave the cat. He did not want to be bad. He did not want to be ashamed. He wanted to be with the cat. He wanted to be happy.
He looked at the cat. The cat looked at him. They both felt sad. They both wanted to be together. They both hoped Tom would change his mind.
