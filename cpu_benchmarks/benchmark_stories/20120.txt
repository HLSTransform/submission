Lily was a little girl who liked to pray. Every night, she would kneel by her bed and talk to God. She would thank Him for her family, her friends, and her toys. She would also ask Him to help people who were sad or sick or poor.
One night, Lily heard a loud noise outside her window. She looked and saw a big fire. The fire was near the church where she went on Sundays. She saw people running and shouting. She saw smoke and flames. She felt scared and sad.
She ran to her mom and dad, who were watching the news on TV. They hugged her and told her not to worry. They said the firemen were trying to put out the fire. They said the church was strong and God was with them.
Lily wanted to help. She asked her mom and dad if she could pray for the church and the people. They said yes, of course. They said prayer was a powerful way to show love and care.
Lily went back to her room and knelt by her bed. She closed her eyes and prayed. She asked God to protect the church and the people. She asked God to stop the fire and heal the hurt. She asked God to bless the firemen and the helpers.
As she prayed, she heard a sound. It was the bell of the church. It was ringing loud and clear. It was telling everyone that the fire was out and the church was safe. It was thanking God and the people for their faith and courage.
Lily smiled and opened her eyes. She felt happy and peaceful. She thanked God for answering her prayer. She thanked God for the bell. She said amen and went to sleep.
