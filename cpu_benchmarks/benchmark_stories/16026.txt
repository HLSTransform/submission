One day, Alex and his grandpa were out for a walk. As they walked along, they saw something strange on the ground. It was a skull.
Alex asked, "Grandpa, what is that?"
His grandpa looked down and said, "It looks like a skull." Then, he smiled and said, "Bones become skulls over time."
Alex asked, "What's time?"
Grandpa replied, "Time is when one thing becomes something else."
Alex thought for a minute. Then, he said, "I wish I could become comfortable now!"
Grandpa laughed and said, "Let's go home. I'll make you something comfy to sit on."
So, the two of them went home and Alex became comfortable in his new chair.
