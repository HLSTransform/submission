Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny lived in a cozy burrow in the woods with his family. One day, Benny went out to play and got lost in the woods. He looked around but couldn't find his way back home. Benny felt worried and scared, he didn't know what to do.
As Benny was walking, he saw a big pile of wood. He thought it might be a good idea to climb on top of it and see if he could spot his burrow from there. Benny climbed up the wood pile and looked around. He still couldn't see his burrow, but he felt a little bit better because he was higher up and could see more of the woods.
Benny's family had been worried sick about him and had been searching for him all day. Just as the sun was setting, they heard Benny calling out for them. They followed his voice and found him on top of the wood pile. They were so happy to have found him and Benny was overjoyed to be reunited with his family. From that day on, Benny never wandered too far from his burrow again, and his family never stopped watching out for him.
