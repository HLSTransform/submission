Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with chalk on the sidewalk outside her house. One day, when she was drawing a big flower, a boy came by and stepped on it by accident. Lily was sad and angry.
The boy said sorry, but Lily didn't forgive him. She thought he was weird because he didn't seem to care about her drawing. The next day, Lily saw the boy drawing with chalk too. He was making a big rainbow and it was really pretty. Lily admired his drawing and realized that he wasn't so weird after all.
Lily went over to the boy and they started to draw together. They made a big picture with flowers, rainbows, and even a castle. They were both happy and had fun. From that day on, Lily and the boy became friends and drew together every day.
