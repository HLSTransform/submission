Once upon a time, there was a big parade. Lots of people were walking and dancing in the street. They were all happy and singing a song. The song was very catchy and made everyone want to dance.
One person in the parade had an impressive costume. It was bright and colorful. They looked like a big bird. They were marching in time with the music. The children watching the parade were very excited and clapped their hands.
After the parade, the person in the impressive costume took off their mask. It was actually their mom! The children were surprised and happy. They hugged their mom and said, "You looked so cool marching in the parade!"
