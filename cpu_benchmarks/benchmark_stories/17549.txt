Tom was a humble boy who liked to help his mom and dad on the farm. He loved to feed the chickens, milk the cows and pick the apples. But his favorite thing was to ride his horse, Brownie. Brownie was a gentle and friendly horse who let Tom sit on his back and trot around the field.
One day, Tom wanted to ride Brownie, but he could not find him. He looked in the barn, in the stable, in the meadow, but Brownie was nowhere to be seen. Tom felt sad and scared. He wondered if Brownie had run away or got lost. He started to cry.
"Tom, what's wrong?" his mom asked, when she saw him crying. She hugged him and wiped his tears.
"I can't find Brownie, mom. He's gone. I miss him so much," Tom sobbed.
"Don't worry, Tom. Brownie is not gone. He's just visiting his friend, Daisy, the horse from the next farm. He'll be back soon. He loves you, and he knows you love him," his mom said.
"Really, mom? Brownie has a friend? And he'll come back?" Tom asked, feeling a little better.
"Yes, really, Tom. Brownie has a friend, and he'll come back. He's a loyal and humble horse, just like you are a loyal and humble boy. Come on, let's go and make some cookies. Maybe we can share some with Brownie and Daisy when they come back," his mom said.
Tom smiled and nodded. He followed his mom to the kitchen, still thinking about Brownie. He hoped he would see him soon. He knew Brownie was his best friend.
