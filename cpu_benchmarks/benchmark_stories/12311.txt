Once upon a time, there were two kids named Tommy and Lucy. They were both very excited to go to the park because they heard there was a long slide trail. 
When the kids arrived at the park, they could not believe their eyes. In front of them was a long slide trail filled with twists and turns. 
Tommy said “Let’s go on the slide trail.” 
Lucy replied “Ok. You go first.”
Tommy was clumsy, so he was a bit unsteady as he stepped onto the slide trail. But he began to slide down the trail. 
Lucy, feeling a bit more confident, stepped onto the slide trail and immediately began to slide. However, she was moving too fast and could not control her speed. 
At the end of the trail, where Lucy was supposed to stop, there was a hole. Lucy slid right into the hole and got stuck there. She was so scared and began to cry. 
Tommy tried to help her but it was too late. Lucy was stuck and could not move. 
The kids had a very bad ending to their day. They learned that it is important to be careful when sliding to avoid accidents.
