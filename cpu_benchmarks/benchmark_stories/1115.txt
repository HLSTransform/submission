Bella wanted to have some fun. She picked up a crayon and began to draw. Everywhere she drew, the colors were so bright and spicy. Suddenly, an idea lead her outside. 
The sun was shining in the sky and the birds were singing in the trees. Bella looked around and soon spotted a new path. She knew she had to follow it. Bella lead herself down the pathway, crayon in hand.
She found a secret garden. The flowers in the garden were the most beautiful colors - there were reds, blues, pinks, purples, and so many more. Some of them smelled so spicy! Bella decided to draw the garden on the pathway with her crayon. 
Bella's picture was stunning. The colors were so tall and bright that it looked like it might come alive. She was glad she had the courage to lead herself to the secret garden and draw what she saw. It was the best afternoon ever!
