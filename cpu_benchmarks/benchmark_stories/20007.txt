Sara and Tom were at the beach with their mom and dad. They liked to play in the sand and look for shells and rocks. Sara found a big, shiny shell that was closed. She wanted to see what was inside.
"Look, Tom, I found a shell!" Sara said, holding it up.
"Wow, that's a big one!" Tom said. "Maybe there is a pearl inside!"
Sara tried to open the shell, but it was very hard. She used her fingers, then her teeth, then a stick, but the shell did not open. She started to feel angry and sad.
"I can't open it!" Sara said, throwing the shell on the ground. "It's too hard!"
Tom picked up the shell and looked at it. He saw a small hole on one side. He had an idea.
"Maybe we can use this hole to open it," Tom said. "We can blow air into it and make the shell pop open!"
Sara liked Tom's idea. She took the shell and put her mouth on the hole. She blew as hard as she could, but nothing happened. She blew again and again, but the shell did not move.
"I can't do it!" Sara said, giving the shell to Tom. "You try!"
Tom took the shell and put his mouth on the hole. He blew as hard as he could, and suddenly, the shell opened with a loud snap. Sara and Tom were surprised and happy. They looked inside the shell and saw a soft, slimy thing.
"What is that?" Sara asked, poking the thing.
"That's an oyster," Tom said, remembering what their dad had told them. "It's a kind of animal that lives in the shell. Sometimes, they have pearls inside."
Sara and Tom looked for a pearl, but they did not see one. They saw a lot of colorful bits of sand and rock that the oyster had collected.
"Wow, look at all the colors!" Sara said, admiring the bits. "They are so pretty!"
"They are like jewels," Tom said, smiling. "We can make a necklace with them!"
Sara and Tom took the bits and the shell and ran to their mom and dad. They showed them their treasure and told them their story. Their mom and dad praised them for their cleverness and creativity. They helped them make a necklace with the bits and the shell. Sara and Tom wore the necklace and felt very proud. They had found a special oyster and had a lot of fun.
