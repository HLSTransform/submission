Mum and Dad said it was time to go on an adventure. But their little girl was scared. She didn't want to leave the house. She shook her head and said, "No!"
Mum and Dad told her it would be fun and showed her the special passport that they had. It was shiny and new. The little girl looked at it and a tiny smile spread across her face.
Mum and Dad said they needed to leave soon. But the little girl wanted to stay home. She started to cry. Mum told her they would be back soon and not to mind.
The little girl hugged Mum and Dad and watched them walk away. She knew they would come back soon and that made her feel a bit better. Now she just had to mind until they were back.
