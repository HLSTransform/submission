Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and look at the pretty flowers. One day, Timmy saw a big, silly dog. The dog looked at Timmy and Timmy looked at the dog. 
Timmy wanted to pet the dog, but the dog bit him! Timmy cried and cried. His mommy came outside and saw what happened. She took Timmy to the doctor and he got a shot. 
Timmy learned that he should never try to pet a dog he doesn't know. He also learned that some dogs can be silly and some can be mean. From that day on, Timmy was very careful when he saw a dog.
