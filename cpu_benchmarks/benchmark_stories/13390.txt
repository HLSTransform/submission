Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to hop and play in the meadow with his friends. One day, Benny saw a shiny saw lying on the ground. He picked it up and started playing with it.
Benny's friends warned him that the saw was dangerous and he should put it down. But Benny didn't listen and accidentally cut off his foot. He was so ashamed that he tried to hide from his friends.
Benny's friends searched for him and found him hiding in a bush. They were sad to see Benny hurt and took him to the doctor. But the doctor couldn't fix Benny's foot and he had to hop on three legs for the rest of his life. Benny learned his lesson and never played with dangerous things again.
