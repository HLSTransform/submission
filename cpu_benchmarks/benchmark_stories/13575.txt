Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat oatmeal every morning for breakfast because it was her favorite food. One day, Lily's mom bought her a present and told her to wait until her birthday to open it.
Lily was very curious about what was inside the present. She wondered if it was something she had always wanted. She could hardly wait for her birthday to come.
Finally, the day arrived and Lily's mom gave her the present. Lily carefully unwrapped the present and was so happy to see a tough and cuddly teddy bear inside. She hugged the bear tightly and thanked her mom for the wonderful gift. From that day on, Lily and her teddy bear were inseparable friends, and they would always eat oatmeal together every morning.
