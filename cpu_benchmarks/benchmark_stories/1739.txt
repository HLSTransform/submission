Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She had a pretty yellow dress with lots of buttons. She liked to wear it because it felt very tight around her.
One day, Amy decided to go for a walk. She ran down the street and across the park. It was so much fun! She was laughing and playing along the way.
Finally, she reached a big hill at the end of the park. Amy walked up to the top of the hill. When she got there, she saw a huge button right in front of her! It was bigger than any button she had ever seen before.
She reached out and pressed the button. Suddenly, everything around her started to move! The hill began to get tighter and tighter, like it was squeezing her!
Amy was so scared! But just when she thought she couldn't take it anymore, the tightness around her loosened up and she was able to take a big breath of fresh air.
Amy was so relieved â€“ and she learned a valuable lesson about being careful when playing around a big hill!
