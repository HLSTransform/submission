Once there was a man named Sam. Sam liked to build things. Every day he gathered some supplies, watched how-to videos on YouTube, and made a plan.
One day Sam decided he wanted to build a big airplane. He was excited but also a little bit worried. He didn't know if he could make it all by himself.
But then Sam got an idea. He asked his friends and family for help. They were helpful and excited to help. Together they got to work. They gathered materials and set up a plan.
With everyone's help, they were able to start to build the airplane. They worked hard each day, until finally it was finished. Sam and his friends flew the airplane around and enjoyed the success of their work.
