One day, a boy named Tim found a box of junk in his room. In the box, he saw a fragile toy car. It was red and shiny. Tim wanted to race the toy car with his friends. He thought it would be fun.
Tim went outside to play with his friends. They all had toy cars too. They wanted to race their cars to see who was the fastest. But Tim's toy car was fragile. He was scared it might break if he raced too fast.
The race began, and all the cars went fast. Tim's fragile car went slow at first, but then it went faster and faster. In the end, Tim's car won the race. His friends were happy for him. Tim learned that even a fragile car can win a race if you believe in it.
