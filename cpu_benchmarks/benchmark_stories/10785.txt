Once upon a time, there was a sleepy cat named Kitty. She loved to keep her fur clean. One day, she found a bar of soap.
Kitty used the soap to wash her fur. She rubbed it all over her body. The soap made lots of bubbles. Kitty liked the bubbles. They were fun to play with.
After Kitty was all clean, she felt very sleepy. She yawned and stretched. Kitty curled up in her soft bed and went to sleep. She had happy dreams about her clean fur and the fun bubbles.
