Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved riding the elevator up and down in her building. One day, she met a kind lady named Mrs. Smith in the elevator. 
"Hi there!" said Mrs. Smith. "What's your name?"
"My name is Lily," said the little girl. "I love riding the elevator!"
"I do too," said Mrs. Smith. "I'm going up to the tenth floor. Would you like to come with me?"
Lily was very patient as they rode up to the tenth floor. As they got higher, Lily noticed that the buildings outside were getting smaller. "Wow!" she said. "The buildings are getting smaller! The elevator is making us increase!"
Mrs. Smith smiled. "Yes, that's right. The elevator is taking us higher and higher. It's amazing how much we can see from up here." 
Lily was so happy to have a new friend like Mrs. Smith. They rode the elevator up and down together many times after that day.
