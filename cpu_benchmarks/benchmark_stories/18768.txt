Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play with blocks and build towers and houses. One day, they found a big box of masks in the attic. They were very excited. They wanted to try them on and pretend to be different animals and people.
Lily picked a mask that looked like a cat. She put it on and said, "Meow, meow, I am a cat. I can jump and run and catch mice." Ben picked a mask that looked like a pirate. He put it on and said, "Arr, arr, I am a pirate. I can sail and fight and find treasure."
They had fun playing with the masks. But then, they saw a mask that looked very special. It was shiny and colorful and had feathers and jewels. It was a rare mask. They both wanted to wear it.
"I saw it first," Lily said. "I want to wear it. It is so pretty."
"No, I saw it first," Ben said. "I want to wear it. It is so cool."
They started to pull the mask from each other. They were angry and sad. They did not want to share.
"Stop it, stop it," a voice said. It was Grandma. She came to the attic and saw them fighting. She was not happy.
"What are you doing?" she asked. "Why are you fighting over a mask? It is just a thing. It is not worth losing your friendship."
She took the mask from them and put it back in the box. She said, "This mask is very old and fragile. It belongs to your great-grandmother. She wore it on a special day. It is a rare mask. But you know what is more rare and precious? Your friendship. You should not fight over things. You should be kind and share and play together."
Lily and Ben felt sorry. They hugged each other and said, "We are sorry, Grandma. We are sorry, friend. We do not need the mask. We have each other."
Grandma smiled and said, "That's good. Now, why don't you go and build something nice with your blocks? And you can use the other masks if you want. But be careful and gentle with them. They are also old and special."
Lily and Ben nodded and said, "Okay, Grandma. Thank you, Grandma." They took their blocks and their masks and went to build and play. They were happy and friends again.
