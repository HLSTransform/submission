Friendly Gregory was walking home from school. He saw a slide in the park and he couldn't help but to climb on it. Suddenly he heard a voice behind him. 
"Hi! Would you like to slide with me?"
Gregory turned and saw a little girl named Sarah. She was smiling in a friendly way. 
Gregory replied, "Yes, I love to slide!"
The two of them started to slide and laugh together. They became good friends.
Later that day, Gregory invited Sarah to his house for a meeting with his Mom. Sarah came over and brought some cookies. They all talked, shared stories and laughed. They had a really friendly meeting and Gregory and Sarah decided to be BFFs! 
From then on, Gregory and Sarah were always together and shared many more fun sliding adventures.
