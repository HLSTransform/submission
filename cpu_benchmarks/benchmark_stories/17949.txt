Once upon a time, in a dark forest, there lived a big lion. The lion liked to roar very loud. One day, the lion found a piece of paper on the ground. He did not know what it was, so he picked it up with his paw.
A little bird saw the lion and flew down to him. The bird said, "Hello, Mr. Lion! What do you have there?" The lion replied, "I found this paper, but I don't know what it is. Can you help me?" The bird nodded and said, "Yes, I can help. That is paper. You can draw on it."
The bird found a stick and showed the lion how to draw on the paper. The lion drew a big sun and a tree. He was very happy with his drawing. The lion said, "Thank you, bird, for helping me. Now we can draw together and be friends." From that day on, the lion and the bird were best friends, and they always played together in the dark forest.
