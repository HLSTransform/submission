Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and always wore her buckle shoes. One day, Lily went to the park and met a boy named Timmy. Timmy asked if he could play with her and she said yes.
They played on the swings and the slide for a long time. But then Timmy said, "I have to go home now." Lily said, "Okay, bye!" But then she noticed that Timmy had taken her favorite toy car. She asked him about it, but he lied and said he didn't take it.
Lily was very sad and went home without her toy car. She told her mom what happened and her mom said, "I'm sorry, Lily. Sometimes people do bad things." Lily felt better knowing that her mom was sorry, but she still missed her toy car. She learned that sometimes people lie and do bad things, but it's important to tell the truth and be kind to others.
