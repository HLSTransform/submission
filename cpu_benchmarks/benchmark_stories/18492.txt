Kim and Lee were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big kangaroo hopping near the swings. They were curious and wanted to touch it.
"Hello, kangaroo!" Kim said. "Can we rub your fur?"
The kangaroo stopped and looked at them. It nodded and let them come closer. Kim and Lee rubbed its soft fur and felt its strong muscles. They were happy and smiled.
"Thank you, kangaroo!" Lee said. "You are very nice and friendly."
The kangaroo smiled back and made a funny noise. It sounded like a laugh. Kim and Lee laughed too.
But then, they heard a loud voice. It was the park ranger. He was angry and ran towards them.
"Hey, you two! Get away from that kangaroo!" he shouted. "It's dangerous and wild! You could get hurt!"
Kim and Lee were scared and ran away from the kangaroo. They hid behind a tree and watched. The park ranger tried to catch the kangaroo, but it was too fast and smart. It hopped away and escaped.
Kim and Lee felt embarrassed. They did not know that the kangaroo was not supposed to be in the park. They thought it was a friendly animal that wanted to play.
"Sorry, kangaroo," Kim whispered. "We did not mean to cause trouble."
"Maybe we can see you again someday," Lee whispered. "But not in the park."
They hoped that the kangaroo was safe and happy. They learned to be careful and respectful of wild animals. They also learned to listen to the park ranger. He was not mean, he was just doing his job.
