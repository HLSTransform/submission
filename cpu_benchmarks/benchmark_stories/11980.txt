Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and her favorite toy was a glass ball. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help with the dishes. Lily was not happy because she wanted to play with her dolls. But when she saw the amazing bubbles in the sink, she decided to help her mom.
As they were washing the dishes, Lily's mom accidentally dropped a glass. Lily was surprised and asked, "What happened, Mommy?" Her mom replied, "I dropped a glass, but don't worry, it's okay."
Lily helped her mom clean up the broken glass and then went back to playing with her dolls. She thought it was amazing how the glass made a loud noise when it broke. From that day on, Lily always helped her mom with the dishes and they had fun making bubbles together.
