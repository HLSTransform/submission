Once upon a time, there was a print. It was a very happy print because it was being taken on an exciting adventure. The print was going to the police station!
When it arrived at the station, it saw many police. They were all wearing their blue uniforms and looking very busy. The print was a bit scared, but the police were friendly so it wasn't too scared.
Suddenly, the print heard a loud noise! It was a man shouting because he was hurt. The police ran over to help the man and the print was glad that they were there to look after him.
The police were able to help the man and make sure he was okay. The print was very happy it got to see how kind the police were. It learned that the police are always there to help people who are hurt. What an important lesson!
