Once upon a time there was a little girl. Her name was Suzy and she had a very special igloo. She set it up in her backyard, and she liked to play inside it every day. 
One day, Suzy noticed something smelling yucky inside the igloo. She thought it must be something smelly, and she didn't like it at all. 
So she decided to take a look and see what was causing the smell. She peeked around inside the igloo until she spotted a smelly old skunk. He was hiding in one of the corners and he looked very unhappy. 
Suzy thought it would be best to get rid of the skunk, so she opened the door of the igloo and very gently shooed him away. He quickly ran off with his smelly tail between his legs and Suzy was very happy! 
She was able to go back to playing in her igloo without the smelly old skunk. She had set up her igloo again, and she was ready to have all sorts of fun.
