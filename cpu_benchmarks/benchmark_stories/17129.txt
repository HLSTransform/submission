Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a shiny iron that she loved to use to make her clothes smooth. One day, while she was ironing her dress, her favorite toy, a little bear, vanished! She looked everywhere but couldn't find it. She was sad and cried a lot. 
Suddenly, she heard a noise coming from her toy box. She opened it and there was her little bear! It had been hiding there all along. She was so happy and hugged it tightly. She realized that sometimes things can vanish but they can also reappear just as quickly. From then on, she made sure to keep her little bear close by and never let it vanish again.
