Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and look at the moon. One night, she was playing with her friend Timmy.
"I miss my mommy," Lily said sadly.
"Why don't we look at the moon together?" Timmy suggested.
Lily looked up at the moon and smiled. "It's so pretty," she said.
Suddenly, Timmy did a foolish dance and made Lily laugh. "You're so silly," she said, giggling.
They continued to play and look at the moon until it was time to go inside. Lily hugged Timmy and said, "Thank you for making me happy."
"You're welcome," Timmy replied with a smile. "I'll see you tomorrow."
