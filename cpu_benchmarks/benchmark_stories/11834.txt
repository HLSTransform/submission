Molly was a brave girl, and she loved to try new things. She asked her daddy, "Can I dare to do something?"
Her daddy smiled and said, "Of course! What did you want to do?"
Molly thought for a moment. She wanted to try something fun. After a few seconds, she said, "I want to fly!"
Her daddy nodded. He said, "Well, let's look outside to see what's out there. Maybe something will give you a chance to fly!"
They both went to the window and looked outside. Molly saw a tree with some branches just right for her.
Her daddy said, "I think this tree looks like a good dare for you. Are you ready?"
Molly felt a little scared, but she was also very glad. She nodded and said, "Yes, I'm ready!"
Her daddy said, "Alright, then let's do it! Just remember to be careful, okay?"
Molly nodded and reached for the tree branch. She grabbed on tight and jumped. She was flying!
Molly was so proud of herself. She had done it! Daddy clapped and said, "Well done, Molly! I knew you could do it!"
Molly smiled and she felt glad. She had dared to try something new, and it was amazing!
