Tom and Lily wanted to play in the park. They put on their shoes and coats and ran outside. They saw a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. They were very happy.
"Let's go on the slide first!" Tom said. He climbed up the ladder and slid down. "Whee! This is fun!"
Lily followed him. She liked the slide too. Then they went to the swing. They pushed each other and laughed. They felt the wind in their hair.
"Let's go to the sandbox now!" Lily said. She loved to make sand castles and dig holes. She ran to the sandbox and picked up a shovel.
But Tom stopped. He smelled something bad. He looked at the sandbox and saw a lot of trash. There were banana peels, egg shells, and old socks. They were very smelly.
"Yuck! This sandbox is dirty!" Tom said. He did not want to play there. He refused to go near it.
"But I want to play in the sand!" Lily said. She did not care about the trash. She thought it was fun to use it as equipment for her castle. She put a sock on top of a pile of sand and said, "Look! This is my flag!"
Tom shook his head. He thought Lily was silly. He said, "No, thank you. I don't like smelly things. Let's go back to the slide or the swing. They are clean and fun."
Lily frowned. She did not want to leave the sandbox. She liked smelly things. She said, "No, thank you. I don't like boring things. I want to stay here and play with my flag."
Tom and Lily could not agree. They both wanted to play different things. They were not happy anymore. They did not play together. They played alone.
