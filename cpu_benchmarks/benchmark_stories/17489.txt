Lily liked to write. She had a big book with many pages. She wrote her name, her family, her friends, and her toys. She wrote with crayons, pencils, and stickers. She wrote every day.
One day, Lily wanted to write something new. She looked around her room. She saw her bed, her lamp, her rug, and her window. She thought they were boring. She wanted to write something fun and exciting.
She saw her mom's car keys on the table. She had an idea. She took the keys and ran outside. She opened the car door and climbed inside. She found a pen and a paper in the glove box. She started to write on the paper. She wrote "Lily's car" and drew a smiley face.
She was happy. She put the paper on the dashboard. She wanted to write more. She looked at the car buttons. She saw a big red one. She wondered what it did. She pressed it.
Suddenly, a loud noise came from the car. It was a siren. It went "wee-woo-wee-woo". Lily was scared. She dropped the pen and the paper. She tried to stop the noise. She pressed the button again. It did not work.
She heard people shouting outside. She saw her mom running to the car. She saw a man in a blue suit. He had a badge and a hat. He was a police officer. He looked angry. He knocked on the car window.
Lily started to cry. She wanted to go back to her room. She wanted to write in her big book. She did not like the car. She did not like the noise. She did not like the police officer.
She saw another car coming. It was white and had a red cross. It was an ambulance. It also had a siren. It went "wee-woo-wee-woo". Lily did not like the ambulance. She did not like the noise. She did not like the white car.
She wished she had never pressed the button. She wished she had never taken the keys. She wished she had never written on the paper. She wished she had never left her room.
She learned a lesson. She learned that writing was fun, but not in the car. She learned that the car was not boring, but dangerous. She learned that the button was not fun, but scary. She learned that the noise was not exciting, but loud.
She said sorry to her mom. She said sorry to the police officer. She said sorry to the ambulance driver. She said sorry to the car. She said sorry to the paper.
She went back to her room. She hugged her big book. She wrote "I am sorry" and drew a sad face. She wrote "I love you" and drew a heart. She wrote "I will be good" and drew a star.
She was happy. She liked to write. She liked her big book. She liked her room. She liked her mom. She liked the quiet. She liked the peace.
