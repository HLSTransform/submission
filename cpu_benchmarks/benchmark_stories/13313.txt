Once upon a time, there was a big red radish. The radish lived in a garden with many other plants. One day, the radish saw a boat sail on a pond near the garden. The radish wanted to sail too.
The radish asked a bird, "Can you help me sail on the pond?" The bird said, "Yes, I can help you." So, the bird picked up the radish and put it in a small boat. The radish was very happy.
The boat began to sail on the pond. The radish felt the wind and saw the water. The radish said, "Thank you, bird, for helping me sail. It is fun!" The bird smiled and flew away. The radish sailed all day, until it was time to go back to the garden.
