Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to ride her bike in the park. One day, she saw a hoop on the ground. It was big and round and looked like a lot of fun. Lily picked it up and started to spin it around her waist. It was so good! She laughed and twirled until she got dizzy. Then she put the hoop down and rode her bike again. Lily had a good day in the park. The end.
