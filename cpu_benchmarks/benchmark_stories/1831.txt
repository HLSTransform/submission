One day, a family decided to go to the park. They had a lot of fun running around and playing, but the little girl was most excited to see the furry model at the park. She had heard about it from her friends, and couldn't wait to see it up close. When they reached the model, the little girl was too scared to go near it—it looked so big!
But with a little encouragement from her family, she was able to take a few steps closer. She carefully reached out her hand and touched the furry model—it felt so soft! She started to laugh, and before she knew it, she was running around the model, shouting and playing games.
The family stayed at the park for hours, until the sun started to set. But the little girl went home with a smile, because she had conquered her fear and found a new furry friend.
