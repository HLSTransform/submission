One day, a boy named Tom found a big, impressive hat. He put it on his head and went outside to show his friends. He walked to the park, where his friend Sue was playing.
"Look at my hat!" said Tom. Sue looked at the hat and said, "Wow, that's a big hat!" They played together and had fun. But then, an old man came to the park. He looked at Tom's hat and said, "That's my hat! You took it!"
Tom did not want to give the hat back, so he told a lie. "No, this is my hat. I got it from my mom." The old man was sad and walked away.
Later, Tom's mom found out about the lie. She was very angry and took the hat away from Tom. Tom was sad and learned that lying is not good. The old man never got his hat back, and Tom did not get to keep the impressive hat.
