Once upon a time, there was a little bird who loved playing in the park. One day, the bird was perched on a branch, looking around. Suddenly it saw something in the park that made it very alert. It was a cat! The bird didn't want to get too close to the cat, so it stayed on the branch. It resisted the urge to fly away.
The cat began walking around the tree, slowly getting closer and closer to the bird. But the bird was ready. It spread out its wings and spread them wide. It was prepared to fly away if it had to. The cat kept on coming closer and closer, but the bird stayed alert and held its ground.
Eventually, the cat got too close, and the bird flew away! It flew all the way to the other side of the park, where it was safe again. And the bird lived happily ever after, always alert and always ready to resist any danger that came its way!
