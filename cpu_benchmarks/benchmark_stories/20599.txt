Once upon a time, there were two best friends, Ted and Carlos. They loved to play together everyday.
One day, Ted had a great idea. He wanted to go on an adventure in the jungle. It sounded very exciting!
So, Ted and Carlos set off on their adventure. As they walked through the jungle, everything was so quiet. Suddenly, something caught their eye. It was a shiny key!
Ted picked it up and said it must unlock something special. With the key in his hand, Ted and Carlos kept walking.
Soon they came across a big door. Ted put the key in the lock and looked at Carlos with a smile. He turned the key and... The door unlocked!
Ted and Carlos jumped in joy. Inside they could see a bright, happy world full of playful animals. They had never seen anything like it before!
The two friends ran around and played with all the animals. They had the best adventure ever!
