Once upon a time, there was a swan who lived in a big pond. The swan was very pretty with white feathers and a long neck. One day, a little girl came to the pond to see the swan. She was very eager to say hello to the swan. 
The swan saw the little girl and swam over to her. The little girl was so happy to see the swan up close. She wanted to give the swan a hug, but the swan quickly zipped away. 
The little girl was sad that the swan didn't want to play with her. But then, she saw the swan swimming back towards her. The swan had a surprise for the little girl - a beautiful feather! The little girl was so happy and thanked the swan. From that day on, the swan and the little girl were friends and the swan would always zip over to say hello.
