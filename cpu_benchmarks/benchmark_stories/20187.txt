Tom and Lily were playing in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat, a scarf and a carrot for a nose. They were very happy.
"Look, our snowman is so nice!" Lily said.
"Yes, he is. But he needs something else. He needs eyes and a mouth," Tom said.
They looked around for some stones or sticks. They saw a big red car arrive. A man got out of the car. He had a big red nose and a big red smile.
"Hello, children. I am Mr. Claus. I have some presents for you," he said.
Tom and Lily were surprised and excited. They ran to the car.
"Wow, thank you, Mr. Claus. You are so kind," they said.
Mr. Claus gave them a big bag of toys. They opened the bag and saw dolls, cars, books and games. They hugged Mr. Claus.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you," they said.
Mr. Claus laughed. He touched his red nose.
"You are very welcome, children. But I have to go now. I have more presents to deliver. Merry Christmas," he said.
He got back in his car and drove away. Tom and Lily waved goodbye.
They looked at their snowman. He had a big red nose and a big red smile, just like Mr. Claus.
They smiled too. They had the best Christmas ever.
