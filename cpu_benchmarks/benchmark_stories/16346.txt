Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily had a very special plate. It was a delicate plate with a picture of a cat on it. She loved her plate very much and used it every day.
One day, her friend Sam came to play. Lily's mom told them to behave and be careful with the delicate plate. They played with toys and ate snacks from the plate. "This plate is so pretty," Sam said. "Yes, but we must be gentle with it," Lily replied.
But they didn't listen to Lily's mom. They started to play a game of catch with the plate. They threw it back and forth, laughing and having fun. But then, Sam threw it too hard and the plate fell to the ground. It broke into pieces. Lily and Sam were very sad. They knew they should have behaved better and listened to Lily's mom. Now, the delicate plate was gone forever.
