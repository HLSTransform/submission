Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys in the living room. In the living room, there was a big, pretty vase. Lily's mom always told her to be careful around the vase.
One day, Lily was playing with her ball. She threw it and it hit the vase. The vase fell and broke. Lily felt sad and scared. She did not want her mom to be mad at her. So, she told a lie. She said that the cat broke the vase.
Her mom knew that Lily was not telling the truth. She said, "Lily, it is foolish to lie. It is better to tell the truth and say sorry." Lily felt bad for lying. She told her mom the truth and said sorry.
Her mom hugged her and said, "It is okay, Lily. We all make mistakes. But it is important to always tell the truth." From that day on, Lily learned to always tell the truth, even when she was scared. And she was more careful when playing near the vase.
