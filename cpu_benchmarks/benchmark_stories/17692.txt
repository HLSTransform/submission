Once upon a time, there was a crane, who was fair and strong. He was the best crane driver around. Every day, the crane drove a big truck filled with heavy rocks. One day, he saw a fair horse in the field and wanted to take him for a ride. The crane drove the truck very slowly, so the horse could keep up. 
The horse followed the crane as they drove through the forest and across the stream. They watched the clouds sail by, until the sun began to set. 
They drove back to the field, with the horse trotting alongside the truck. When they arrived, the crane and the horse said goodbye and the crane drove off in the truck. 
The crane thought to himself how much fun it was to drive with a fair horse.
