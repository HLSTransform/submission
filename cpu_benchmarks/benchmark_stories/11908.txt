Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved rockets and dreamed of going to space one day. One day, Timmy saw a rocket in a store and asked his mom to buy it for him. But his mom disagreed, saying they didn't have enough money.
Timmy was sad and went to his room to play with his toys. Suddenly, he heard a knock on his door. It was his kind neighbor, Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson had overheard Timmy and his mom talking and wanted to give Timmy a rocket as a gift.
Timmy was so happy and thanked Mr. Johnson. He played with his new rocket all day long and even invited his friend over to play with it too. They had so much fun together. Timmy realized that sometimes people disagree, but there are always kind people who are willing to help.
