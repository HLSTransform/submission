Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She liked to play outside in her big yard. One day, Mia found a small bush near her house. She was very glad to see it. Mia thought the bush was pretty.
Mia wanted to show her mom the bush. But, she forgot where it was. She looked and looked, but could not find it. Mia was sad. She called out, "Mom, I can't find the bush!"
Her mom came outside and said, "Don't worry, Mia. Let's look for it together." They looked all around the yard. At last, they found the bush. Mia was glad again. She said, "Thank you, Mom!"
From that day on, Mia and her mom took care of the bush. They watered it and watched it grow. And Mia never forgot where the bush was again. They were both very happy.
