Once upon a time there was a lion called Lou. Lou lived in a zoo and was always very friendly. Every day he would greet all the visitors and roar hello.
One day, Lou decided to see what was beyond the zoo's walls. He spotted a rail by the edge of the zoo, so he climbed up it and jumped over the wall. Everything looked weird outside the zoo. Lou was a bit scared but he kept walking.
Suddenly, he heard someone yelling very loudly. It was a big angry man! He yelled at Lou to get off his property. Lou became very scared. He tried to escape, but the man kept on following him.
Lou started to run, but the man was still very close. So Lou opened his mouth and let out a big roar. It was so loud that the man fell over! This allowed Lou to keep running until he got back to the zoo. He realized how dangerous it was outside the zoo and decided never to do it again.
