Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to make pastry with her grandma. They would mix flour, sugar, and eggs together and roll it out with a rolling pin. Lily was always excited to help her grandma in the kitchen. 
One day, Lily's grandma surprised her by bringing out a big box of sprinkles. Lily was so excited to use them on their pastry. They made cookies and cupcakes and sprinkled them with colorful sprinkles. Lily's grandma said they looked beautiful and tasted delicious. 
After they finished baking, Lily's grandma gave her a special treat. It was a pastry shaped like a heart. Lily was so excited and happy that she gave her grandma a big hug. They sat together and enjoyed their yummy treats. From that day on, Lily knew that making pastry with her grandma was the best thing ever.
