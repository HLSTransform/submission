Once upon a time there was an attractive girl who lived in a small house. She wanted to measure the size of her house and so she went outside and got a ruler. She measured from one corner to the other and discovered that her house was very small.
Once she had finished measuring, the girl noticed a bright point of light in the sky. At first she was confused but then she realized it was a big and beautiful star. The star seemed so attractive to her that she decided to measure how big it was.
So began her pursuit of the star. She ran and ran and ran but no matter how hard she tried, she could never get any closer to the star. She realised that it was impossible to measure the star and that star was completely out of reach.
The girl was very sad as her dream of measuring the star had come to an end. She went back home and dreamed about the star all night. Unfortunately, she never got the chance to measure the star.
