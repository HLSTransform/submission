Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs and worms. They had a big bucket to put their finds in.
"Look, Lily, I found a shiny rock!" Tom said, holding up a small pebble.
"Wow, Tom, that's pretty! Can I see?" Lily asked, reaching for the rock.
Tom gave her the rock and they both admired it. Then they heard their mom calling them from the kitchen.
"Tom, Lily, it's time for a snack! Come inside and wash your hands!"
Tom and Lily ran to the house, leaving their bucket behind. They were hungry and wanted to see what mom had made for them.
They washed their hands in the sink and dried them with a towel. Then they went to the table, where mom had put some plates with cookies and milk.
"Yum, cookies!" Tom said, grabbing one and taking a big bite.
"Thank you, mom!" Lily said, smiling and picking up a cookie too.
They ate their snack and drank their milk, feeling happy and full.
Meanwhile, in the garden, a squirrel had discovered their bucket. It smelled something interesting and climbed inside. It found some bugs and worms and started to eat them. It also saw the shiny rock and decided to take it. It put the rock in its mouth and ran away, leaving the bucket empty and dirty.
