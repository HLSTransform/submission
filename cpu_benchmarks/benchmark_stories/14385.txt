Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden. One day, she saw a big, juicy berry on a tall bush. She wanted to eat it, but she couldn't reach it.
Lily's mom came outside and saw her daughter was frustrated. "What's wrong, Lily?" she asked. "I want to eat that berry, but I can't lift myself up to reach it," Lily said.
Her mom smiled and lifted her up so she could get the berry. "Thank you, Mommy!" Lily said happily as she ate the delicious berry. From that day on, whenever Lily wanted to reach something high, she would ask for help instead of getting frustrated.
