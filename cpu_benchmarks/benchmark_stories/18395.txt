Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her puzzle. One day, Lily's mommy made some hot soup for her. Lily tasted the soup and said, "Yummy, it's hot!" 
Lily's mommy said, "Be careful, it's hot. Blow on it to make it cooler." 
Lily blew on the soup and then said, "Mommy, can I kiss you?" 
Lily's mommy smiled and said, "Of course, you can kiss me. But first, let's finish your soup." 
Lily finished her soup and then gave her mommy a big kiss on the cheek. They both smiled and continued to play with Lily's puzzle.
