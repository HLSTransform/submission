Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very alert. She was always on the lookout for fun things to do. One day, she decided to try something new. She went to her kitchen, got out a spoon, and sat down on the floor.
She took some things from around the kitchen - a jar of jelly, a few apples, some raisins, and some cereal. She mixed them all together in a bowl. To make it taste even better, she added a spoonful of sugar. Then, she stirred the mixture with her spoon.
The little girl was excited. She had made a delicious snack. She ate it with a big smile. Then, she took her spoon and added a little more sugar. The snack was even more yummy now.
The little girl was very proud of herself. She had made something delicious with just a spoon and a few simple things from the kitchen. She was so alert that she knew just what to add to make it taste even better.
