Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play in her backyard. One day, she found a big box that was locked. She tried to open it, but she couldn't. She asked her mom for help, but her mom didn't have the key.
Lily was sad because she really wanted to see what was inside the box. She went to bed that night feeling disappointed. The next morning, she woke up to a surprise. Her mom had found the key and unlocked the box! Inside, there was a lot of yummy food that Lily had never tried before.
Lily was so happy and excited to try the new food. She ate until she was full and then went outside to play. As she was playing, the sky started to get dark. Lily remembered that her mom had told her to come inside before it got too dark. She ran inside and turned on the light, feeling safe and happy. From that day on, Lily always made sure to come inside before it got too dark.
