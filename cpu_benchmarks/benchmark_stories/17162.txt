Once upon a time, there was a cute little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to drink cocoa every day. He would drink it slowly and savor every sip. One day, Benny's friend, a speedy squirrel named Sammy, came to visit him. Sammy was always in a hurry and he didn't have time to drink cocoa with Benny.
Benny tried to convince Sammy to slow down and enjoy the cocoa with him, but Sammy didn't listen. He drank his cocoa quickly and ran away. Benny felt sad and lonely. He realized that he missed out on spending quality time with his friend.
The moral of the story is that it's important to slow down and enjoy the little things in life, like drinking cocoa with friends. Being speedy all the time may cause you to miss out on the important things in life.
