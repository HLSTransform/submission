Lily liked to play sport with her friends. She liked to run, jump, kick and throw. She was very good at sport and always had fun.
One day, a new boy came to play with them. His name was Max. He said he liked sport too, but he wanted to play by himself. He did not want to follow the rules or join a team. He said he was independent and did not need anyone.
Lily and her friends tried to be nice to Max. They asked him to play with them and share the ball. But Max said no. He said he wanted to do his own thing and not listen to anyone.
Lily felt sad. She wanted to be friends with Max, but he did not want to be friends with her. She wondered why he was so independent and did not like to follow.
She decided to talk to him. She went to where he was playing and said, "Hi, Max. Why do you not want to play with us? We like sport and we like you. We can have more fun together."
Max looked at Lily. He saw that she was smiling and kind. He felt a little sorry. He said, "Hi, Lily. I do not want to play with you because I do not like to follow. I like to be independent and do what I want. I do not need anyone."
Lily nodded. She said, "I understand. But you know, being independent does not mean you have to be alone. You can be independent and still have friends. You can follow some rules and still do your own thing. You can share and still have fun. Do you want to try?"
Max thought about it. He realized that Lily was right. He did not have to be alone to be independent. He could be independent and still have friends. He could follow some rules and still do his own thing. He could share and still have fun. He said, "Okay, Lily. I want to try. Can I play with you?"
Lily smiled. She said, "Of course, Max. You can play with us. Come on, let's go. We are playing soccer. You can kick the ball with us."
Max smiled too. He followed Lily to where her friends were playing. He joined the team and shared the ball. He followed some rules and did his own thing. He had fun and made friends. He learned that being independent and following can go together. He was happy.
