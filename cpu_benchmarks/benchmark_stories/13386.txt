Once upon a time, there was a little duck who loved to play in the pond. One day, the little duck saw a shiny rock in the pond and wanted to play with it. But when the little duck tried to pick up the rock, it slipped out of its beak and sank to the bottom of the pond.
The little duck was sad and wanted its shiny rock back. But then, a kind frog saw the little duck crying and offered to help. The frog dove into the pond and retrieved the shiny rock for the little duck.
The little duck was so happy to receive its shiny rock back and thanked the frog. From that day on, the little duck learned to be careful with its toys and not to take things for granted. It also learned to be grateful and say sorry when it made a mistake.
