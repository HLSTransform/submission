Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and she always had her notebook with her. One day, while playing outside, she accidentally dropped her notebook and it broke. Lily was sad because her notebook was her favorite thing.
Lily's friend, Max, saw that she was sad and asked her what was wrong. Lily told Max that her notebook was broken and she didn't know what to do. Max said, "Don't worry, we can fix it. Let's go inside and dry the pages."
They went inside and Max helped Lily dry the pages of her notebook. After a few minutes, the pages were dry and the notebook was fixed. Lily was so happy and she thanked Max for helping her. From that day on, Lily always made sure to be careful with her notebook.
