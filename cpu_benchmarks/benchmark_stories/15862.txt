Teddy was a small bear who liked to rock on his chair. One day, he saw a big fence outside his window. He was very curious and wanted to know what was behind the fence.
He asked his mom, "Mom, what's behind the fence?"
His mom smiled and said, "Let's go find out!"
So Teddy and his mom went outside, and sure enough, there was a big garden behind the fence. Teddy was so excited! He loved playing in the garden and seeing all the different kinds of flowers and plants.
But when he tried to get back into his house, he couldn't figure out how to get over the fence. He felt confused and didn't know what to do.
His mom smiled and said, "Come on, Teddy. Watch me, I will show you how to get over the fence." She showed him how to use the rocks to climb up and over the fence.
Teddy was so happy! He was now able to rock over the fence and come back into his house. He felt so brave and excited to have figured out how to get over the fence by himself.
