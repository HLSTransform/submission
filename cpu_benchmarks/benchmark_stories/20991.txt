Once upon a time, there lived a cat and a mouse. The mouse wanted some food, but she was scared to go out alone. So she asked the cat if he would take her with him.
The cat said, “Yes, of course! Let’s go.” And so off they went.
They walked for what felt like a long time until they found some food. But it was an old, tough piece of cheese. The cat took it and offered it to the mouse.
The mouse looked at it and said, “That looks tough. I don’t think I can eat it.”
The cat smiled. “Don’t worry,” she said. “I’ll take it away and find something else.”
And so that’s what they did. Eventually, they found some fresh, tasty food and they were both very happy. The mouse could eat and the cat could watch her eat. It was a wonderful day.
