Mummy and Sam were playing in the park. Mummy said to Sam, "Let's go for a ride!" Sam clapped his hands and said "Yay!"
They got on the round swing and mummy pushed Sam. Sam went higher and higher and said, "Whee!"
After a few minutes, Sam was feeling tired. Mummy said, "Time to stop now, it looks like you're tired."
Sam said, "Yes, I'm tired."
Mummy carried Sam off the swing, gave him a big hug, and they went home.
