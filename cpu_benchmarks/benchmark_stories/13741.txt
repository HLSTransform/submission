Anna loved to swim in the pool. She liked to splash and kick and blow bubbles. She wore a light pink swimsuit with a flower on it. She always swam with her mom or dad, who held her and helped her float.
One day, Anna saw a big yellow duck in the pool. It was a toy duck, but it looked real. It had a red beak and a blue hat. Anna wanted to swim with the duck. She asked her mom if she could go and get it.
"Okay, but be careful," her mom said. "Don't go too far. I'll watch you from here."
Anna nodded and smiled. She let go of her mom's hand and swam slowly towards the duck. She reached out to touch it. It was soft and squeaky. She hugged it and laughed.
But then, she felt something pull her down. It was the duck's hat. It had a string attached to it. The string was tied to a heavy rock at the bottom of the pool. Anna was scared. She tried to let go of the duck, but it was too late. She was sinking.
She opened her mouth to scream, but only water came in. She felt cold and dizzy. She couldn't see her mom. She couldn't breathe.
Suddenly, she felt a strong arm around her waist. It was her dad. He had seen her from the other side of the pool. He had jumped in and swam to her. He untied the string and lifted her up. He brought her to the edge of the pool, where her mom was waiting.
"Anna, Anna, are you okay?" her mom asked, hugging her and rubbing her back.
Anna coughed and gasped. She nodded. She was okay. She was safe.
Her dad looked angry. He held the duck and the rock in his hand. He threw them away.
"Who did this?" he asked. "Who put this trap in the pool?"
Anna didn't know. She didn't care. She just wanted to get out of the pool and drink some juice. She was thirsty and tired. She never wanted to swim with the duck again.
