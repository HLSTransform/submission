Once upon a time there was a family who went out to buy some ice cream on a hot summer day. But when they got to the store, they saw that the weather was not nice at all; it was very cloudy and stormy.
The mom of the family, being very stubborn, insisted that they still buy the ice cream. But the kids knew that their mom was wrong. They thought it would be a good idea to go home instead.
Connor, the oldest son, stepped up and asked his mom to listen to reason. He said that if they bought the ice cream, it wouldn’t be nice anymore by the time they got home.
Finally, the mom listened and decided not to buy the ice cream. She thanked Connor for his good advice and praised him for being so brave.
The moral of this story is that it’s often better to be brave and listen to your own thoughts than to be stubborn.
