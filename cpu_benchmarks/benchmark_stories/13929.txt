Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint and make pretty pictures. One day, Lily found a big piece of paper and decided to paint a big, beautiful rainbow.
As she was painting, her little brother Tommy came into the room. Tommy wanted to play with Lily, but he was too little and didn't fit at the table. He tried to climb up, but he slipped and fell. When he fell, he grabbed the big paper with the rainbow and it started to tear.
Lily was sad that her rainbow was torn. But then, she had an idea. She took the two pieces of the torn paper and put them next to each other. Now, there were two rainbows! Lily and Tommy smiled and decided to paint together. They found a smaller table where Tommy fit, and they both painted happy pictures all day long.
