Once upon a time, there was a daisy. It made Jack and Mary laugh. It was very funny. Every day, the daisy played games with the children. But then one day, something changed. The daisy started to rot. The children were very sad. They tried to fix the daisy, but it did not work. Finally the children decided to bury the daisy in the ground. They said goodbye and planted a new daisy in its place. From then on, they made sure to take good care of the daisy.
