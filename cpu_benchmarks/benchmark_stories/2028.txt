Once upon a time there was a boy who was very eager. He wanted to play and tease everyone he saw because he thought it was fun. 
One day, the boy decided to tease an old man who was sitting at a park. The old man didn't look happy about it. He just stared back at the boy in silence. 
The boy thought the old man didn't understand his teasing. So he kept coming closer and closer to the old man and continued to tease him. 
Finally, the old man stood up. He was bigger and stronger than the boy had thought. He looked very mad and said, "Don't tease me anymore." 
The boy was scared and ran away. He was sad and wished he had stopped teasing the old man sooner. He learned a lesson that day: never tease the old man because he is hard to deal with.
