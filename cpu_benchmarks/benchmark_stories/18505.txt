Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play in the yard. They find a lot of junk in the yard. They make a fort with the junk. They are happy.
But then, Ben comes. Ben is mean. He wants to play in the fort too. He does not ask. He pushes Tom and Sam. He takes their junk. He breaks their fort. He laughs. Tom and Sam are sad and angry.
They want to get their fort back. They think of a plan. They find a big sign. The sign says "Keep Out". They put the sign on the fort. They hide behind a bush. They wait.
Ben sees the sign. He does not care. He thinks he is mighty. He goes to the fort. He tries to move the sign. But the sign is heavy. It falls on Ben. It hurts him. He cries. He runs away.
Tom and Sam come out. They see Ben is gone. They see their fort is safe. They fix their fort with the junk. They put the sign back. They smile. They are happy. They play in the fort. They are friends.
