Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He loved going for adventures! One day, the boy wanted to explore something new. He decided to go for a fast ride on his bike. He sped quickly down the path.
Soon, the little boy came to a deep pit in the road. He tried to go faster and jump over the pit. He didn't quite make it and his bike fell into the deep, gloomy hole!
The little boy started to cry. But then he had an idea. He tackled the pit with a jump rope. He quickly looped it around the pit and was able to pull himself and the bike out of the pit.
The little boy was very happy. He had saved his bike! He sped quickly away and soon forgot all about the deep, gloomy pit.
