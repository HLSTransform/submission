Once upon a time, there was a happy family. They lived in a big house with a dishwasher in the kitchen. The dishwasher made their plates and cups clean so they could eat yummy food.
One day, the mom asked the little girl to help her in the kitchen. They sang a song while they cooked dinner. The little girl loved to sing and dance. She felt safe with her mom.
After dinner, they put the dishes in the dishwasher. It was safe to use because it had a lock. The little girl loved to press the buttons and watch the dishwasher do its job. She felt like a big helper.
