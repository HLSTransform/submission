Once upon a time, there was a naughty little man called Sam. He was always playing tricks and getting into trouble. One day, his mother was cleaning the windows and she asked Sam to climb the ladder and help her.
Sam was scared of the ladder but he didn't dare to disobey his mother. He took a deep breath and started climbing carefully. He was almost at the top when he heard his mother calling his name.
"Sam! What are you doing? You're being naughty again!"
Sam was embarrassed but he knew he had to tell the truth.
"I'm trying to clean the window like you asked me," he said.
His mother smiled and said,
"I'm glad you were trying to help. Let's finish this job together."
So Sam and his mother finished cleaning the windows together. Sam was very happy that he was able to help and his mother was very proud of him.
