Lily liked to bounce on her big ball. She bounced up and down, left and right, all over the yard. She bounced so high that she could see the truck on the street. The truck was red and shiny, and it made a loud noise. Lily wanted to see the truck up close.
She bounced off her ball and ran to the gate. She opened the gate and ran to the street. She did not look for cars or bikes. She only looked at the truck. She was very close to the truck when she heard a horn. It was a car behind her. The car stopped and the driver got out. He was angry and scared.
He shouted at Lily, "What are you doing? You could have been hurt! You have to be careful on the street! Where are your parents?" Lily was scared too. She did not like the angry man. She did not like the loud horn. She did not like the street. She wanted her ball and her yard.
She ran back to the gate and closed it. She ran to her ball and hugged it. She cried and cried. She did not want to bounce anymore. She did not want to see the truck anymore. She wanted her mom and dad.
Her mom and dad heard her cry and came out. They saw her ball and the gate and the truck and the car and the man. They understood what happened. They hugged Lily and said, "It's okay, Lily. You are fine. You made a mistake, but you are fine. We are here. We love you. The truck and the car and the man are gone. You can bounce again, but only in the yard. And always look for cars and bikes on the street. Do you understand?" Lily nodded and said, "Yes, mom and dad. I understand. I'm sorry. I love you too. Can I bounce again?" They smiled and said, "Yes, Lily. You can bounce again. But only in the yard." Lily smiled and bounced on her ball. She was fine.
