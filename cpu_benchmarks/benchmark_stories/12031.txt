Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden. One day, she saw a worm in the soil. She picked up the worm and put it in her hand. Lily thought the worm looked hungry, so she gave it a leaf to eat.
Suddenly, her friend Jack came over and saw the worm in her hand. He wanted to eat the worm! Lily told him that it was not nice to eat worms and that it was selfish. Jack felt bad and said sorry. They both put the worm back in the soil and continued playing together. From that day on, they always shared their toys and never did anything selfish again.
