Tom and Lily were playing in the yard. They had a big box of toys and a green rag. Tom liked the green rag. He used it as a cape, a scarf, and a flag. Lily wanted the green rag too. She tried to grab it from Tom.
"Give me the rag!" Lily said.
"No, it is mine!" Tom said.
They pulled and pulled the rag. They did not share. They did not listen. They did not care.
Then, something bad happened. The rag tore in half. Tom and Lily each had a piece of the rag. They looked at the rag. They looked at each other. They felt sad and sorry.
"I am sorry, Tom. I should have asked you nicely." Lily said.
"I am sorry, Lily. I should have let you play with it too." Tom said.
They hugged and said sorry. They decided to be friends again. They decided to share the rag. They used it as a bandage, a belt, and a bow. They had fun with the rag. They learned to be kind.
