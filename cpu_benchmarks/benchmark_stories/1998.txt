Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She had a hand and she used it to walk. She was bored of just walking. She wanted to do something more fun. 
One day, her mom told her that she could go to the park. She was so excited to go! She put on her shoes and grabbed her mom's hand. She squealed with joy. 
When they arrived, she ran around and had a lot of fun. Then, her mom said "Let's go to the lake." The little girl was confused. She didn't want to walk it, especially since the lake was far away. 
Her mom smiled and said, "We can take the car to get there! Would you like that?" The little girl was so excited. She nodded and laughed, "Yes, I would!" 
So, the little girl and her mom walked to the car, hopped in and drove to the lake. She was so happy that she wasn't bored anymore. Now, she could have a fun time at the lake.
