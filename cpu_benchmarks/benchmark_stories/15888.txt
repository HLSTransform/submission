Mama and Papa were playing games in their backyard. Mama said, "Let's release the balloon!" Papa said, "That sounds fun!"
They blew up the balloon and released it. Up and away it flew! 
Mama said, "Shhh! I hear something." Papa said, "It's a nosy squirrel. He's trying to find the balloon!" 
The squirrel hopped over and said, "Where did it go?" Mama said, "The balloon is gone, far away." The squirrel said, "Oh no! I wanted to play with it!"
Mama said, "Don't worry. We can get more balloons, yet!" Papa said, "Yes, as many as you'd like!" The squirrel said, "Yay! That sounds fun!"
