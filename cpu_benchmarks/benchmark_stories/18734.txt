Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his toys and going outside to play. One day, Timmy's dad took him to the golf course. Timmy had never played golf before, but he was excited to try.
Timmy's dad showed him how to hold the golf club and how to hit the ball. Timmy swung the club with all his might and the ball went flying through the air. But, the ball didn't go very far because Timmy wasn't very strong.
Timmy's dad helped him attach a special tool to his club to make him stronger. With the tool attached, Timmy swung the club again and this time the ball went far, far away. Timmy was so happy and proud of himself for playing golf.
