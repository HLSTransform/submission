Once upon a time, there was a fat sailor who wanted to take a boat ride. He stepped on board and began to twist the ropes. He pulled them tight and the boat began to sail. The sailor laughed as the wind blew in his face.
The boat sailed along the river and the sailor looked at the tall trees and bright flowers. The sun sparkled in the sky, and the sailor smiled. The boat floated on and on, until the sailor felt tired and wanted to rest.
The sailor looked around and noticed the boat was close to the shore. He twisted the boat towards the land until it gently touched the ground. He hopped off the boat and walked away. The fat sailor smiled as he climbed up the hill, away from the river and the boat.
