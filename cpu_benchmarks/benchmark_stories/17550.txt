Lila and Ben were friends who liked to play in the garden. They saw many flowers, bugs and birds. They also saw a big plant with green beans. Lila liked beans and wanted to pick some.
"Look, Ben, beans!" Lila said and pointed to the plant. "Let's get some for lunch."
Ben shook his head. "No, Lila, we can't. Those are not our beans. They belong to Mr. Fox. He is very mean and will be angry if we take his beans."
Lila did not listen to Ben. She thought Mr. Fox was not home and would not know. She ran to the plant and pulled some beans. "Come on, Ben, these beans are great. Don't be scared."
Ben was scared. He saw Mr. Fox coming back from the woods. He had a big basket of food. He also had sharp teeth and claws. He saw Lila and Ben near his plant. He was very angry.
"Hey, you little thieves! What are you doing with my beans?" Mr. Fox shouted and ran to them. "Give them back or I will eat you!"
Lila and Ben were very sorry. They dropped the beans and tried to run away. But Mr. Fox was faster and caught them. He put them in his basket and took them to his house. He cooked them with his beans and ate them for lunch.
The moral of the story is: Do not take what is not yours. Listen to your friends who warn you. Or you may end up in a bad place.
