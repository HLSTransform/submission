Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she found a lost letter on the ground. It had a stamp on it and said "Please deliver to Grandma."
Lily knew that letters had to be mailed, so she asked her mommy to help her. They went to the post office together and Lily put the letter in the mailbox. The postman told her that it was important to mail letters so they can reach the right person.
Later that day, Lily's mommy had to have an operation at the hospital. Lily was sad and scared, but the doctors and nurses were very kind and took good care of her mommy. When they went home, Lily felt grateful for the doctors and nurses who helped her mommy.
Lily learned that it's important to help others and to be grateful for those who help us. She also learned that mailing letters is important so they can reach the right person.
