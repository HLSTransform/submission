One day, a grumpy cat named Tom found a big motorcycle in the park. He wanted to ride it, but he was too small. Tom saw his friend, a little bird named Tim, sitting on a tree branch.
"Tim, can you help me ride the motorcycle?" asked Tom.
Tim thought for a moment and said, "Yes, I have an idea! Let's cut a long stick to help you reach the buttons."
So, Tom and Tim worked together. They found a big stick and cut it to make it the right size. Tom used the stick to press the buttons on the motorcycle. Vroom! The motorcycle started moving.
Tom was so happy riding the motorcycle with Tim flying next to him. They had a fun day at the park, and Tom was not grumpy anymore.
