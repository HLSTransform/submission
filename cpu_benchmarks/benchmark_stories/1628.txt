Jill and Tom went to the beach with Mom and Dad. They liked to play in the sand and look for shells. They found many pretty shells of different colors and shapes. They put them in a bucket to take home.
"Look, Tom, I found an oyster!" Jill said, holding a big, gray shell. "Maybe there is a pearl inside!"
"Wow, let me see!" Tom said, running over to Jill. He wanted to see the pearl too.
They opened the oyster carefully, hoping to find a shiny, round pearl. But there was no pearl inside. Instead, there was a tiny crab, hiding in the oyster.
"Hello, little crab!" Jill said, smiling. "You are not a pearl, but you are cute!"
The crab waved its claws at Jill and Tom, as if to say hello back. Then it scuttled out of the oyster and into the water.
"Bye, little crab!" Tom said, waving. "Have fun in the sea!"
Jill and Tom were not sad that they did not find a pearl. They were happy that they made a new friend. They put the oyster back in the sand and looked for more shells. They were ready for more adventures.
