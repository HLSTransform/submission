Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her toys. One day, she found her toy car and wanted to drive it around her room. But when she tried to make it go, she saw that it was broken. 
Lily was sad and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, she heard a knock on her door. It was a clown! The clown had a big smile and asked Lily why she was sad. Lily told the clown about her broken toy car. 
The clown said, "Don't worry, I can fix it for you!" The clown took the toy car and drove it around the room. Lily was so happy to see her toy car working again. She thanked the clown and they became friends. From that day on, Lily and the clown would drive around in Lily's toy car and have lots of fun together.
