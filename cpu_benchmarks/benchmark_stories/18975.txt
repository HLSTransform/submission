One day, a little boy named Tim found a tasty apple. He wanted to eat it, but he saw a big switch on the side of the apple. Tim was curious and asked his friend, Sally.
"Should I squeeze the switch?" Tim asked.
Sally shook her head. "No, don't do it! Something bad might happen."
But Tim didn't listen. He squeezed the switch and the tasty apple turned into a big, scary monster. The monster roared and chased Tim and Sally.
"Help!" cried Tim and Sally as they ran away.
They hid behind a tree and thought of a plan. Tim remembered the switch and decided to try squeezing it again. He bravely ran up to the monster and squeezed the switch. The monster turned back into a tasty apple. Tim and Sally were safe and happy. They learned to be careful with switches and shared the tasty apple.
