Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big, smelly dog named Max. Max loved to play outside and get dirty. One day, Lily's mom gave her a leather backpack to carry her toys in. Lily loved her new backpack and wanted to fill it with all her favorite toys. 
But when she put her toys inside the backpack, she noticed a smelly odor coming from it. She looked inside and saw that Max had chewed on the leather straps of the backpack. The leather was torn and it smelled really bad. 
Lily didn't want to throw away her new backpack, so she decided to fix it. She got some glue and patched up the leather straps. Now her backpack was good as new and didn't smell anymore. She filled it with her toys and went outside to play with Max. They had so much fun together and Lily was happy to have her new backpack with her. The end.
