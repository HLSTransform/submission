Once upon a time there was a mighty cable. The cable was bright and shiny and it belonged to everyone in the world. It went through cities, towns, fields and rivers. All the people on the planet belonged to the cable.
The cable connected everyone and everything. People could talk to each other, share secrets and exchange thoughts no matter how far apart they were. The cable was strong and mighty and it kept everyone together.
One day, a giant storm came in. The cable was shaken and it started to break apart. Everyone was scared and the whole world was in danger.
But luckily, the people all banded together. Everyone started to fix the cable and soon it was back to its mighty and strong state. Everyone rejoiced, because they all belonged to the cable once again.
