Once upon a time, in a small house, a girl named Lily wanted to bake a cake. She asked her mom, "Can we bake a cake today?" Her mom said, "Yes, let's bake a cake together."
As they started to bake, Lily saw a mysterious box on the table. She opened the box and found a big, shiny bulb inside. "What is this?" Lily asked her mom. Her mom smiled and said, "That's a special bulb. When it gets dark, we can put it in a lamp and it will make light."
Lily and her mom finished baking the cake. They put the bulb in a lamp and turned it on. The room was filled with a warm, bright light. They sat down and enjoyed a big slice of cake together, happy in the light from the mysterious bulb.
