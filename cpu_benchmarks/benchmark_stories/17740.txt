Once upon a time, there was a lovely hero. This hero had a super-special power. He could zoom!
He would zoom over mountains, and he would zoom across fields. He was so fast that everyone wanted to be his friend. Everywhere he zoomed people smiled and laughed. It was so lovely. 
The hero was brave and strong. He served justice to those in need. He always won the day and made everyone feel happy. 
The hero zoomed into the sunset, a happy hero on a lovely day. He zoomed around the world, bringing smiles and love to all he met. 
The lovely hero's zooming days kept coming, and everyone cheered for the hero's lovely adventures. 
The end.
