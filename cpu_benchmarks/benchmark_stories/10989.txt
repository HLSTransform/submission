Sara and Tom are twins. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books. They also have a big fan on the ceiling.
One day, Sara has an idea. She says to Tom, "Let's play a game. We can spin the fan and pretend it is a windmill. We can be farmers and grow healthy food."
Tom likes the idea. He says, "OK, Sara. How do we play?"
Sara says, "We need to turn on the fan and make it spin fast. Then we can use our blankets and pillows to make a farm. We can pretend they are fields and animals. We can also use our blocks and cars to make a barn and a tractor."
Tom says, "That sounds fun, Sara. Let's do it."
They turn on the fan and make it spin fast. They use their blankets and pillows to make a farm. They pretend they are farmers and grow healthy food. They use their blocks and cars to make a barn and a tractor. They have a lot of fun.
But then, their mom comes in. She sees the fan spinning fast and the room messy. She says, "Sara and Tom, what are you doing? You should not spin the fan so fast. It is dangerous. And you should not make such a mess in your room. You need to clean up."
Sara and Tom feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, mom. We were playing a game. We were farmers and we grew healthy food."
Their mom says, "I see. That is a nice game. But you need to be careful and tidy. You can play the game again, but you need to spin the fan slower and put away your things when you are done."
Sara and Tom say, "OK, mom. We will do that. Thank you for letting us play the game."
Their mom says, "You are welcome, Sara and Tom. I love you. You are good and healthy children."
She hugs them and kisses them. Then she helps them clean up their room. They finish the game and have a snack. They are happy.
