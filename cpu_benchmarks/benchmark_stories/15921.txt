Once there was a wide tree. It was the only tree around and everyone loved it, especially the birds.
The farmer was very sad one day when he saw that someone had destroyed the tree. He was so ashamed he couldn't look anyone in the eye. He asked everyone he saw if they knew who had done it, but nobody had seen anything.
He asked the birds if they knew who had done it. The birds just looked sadly around. They had seen a scary monster come out of the woods and attack the tree.
The farmer was very sad. "Who would do such a thing?!", he cried. The birds shook their heads sadly, but said nothing. He hugged the tree and said "I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe".
The farmer was so sad and he decided to plant a new wide tree, so that the birds would have a safe place to come to.
