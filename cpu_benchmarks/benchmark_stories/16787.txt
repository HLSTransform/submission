Tom and Ben like to play golf. They have a small golf set with balls and sticks. They go to the park with their dad and find a nice spot to hit the balls. They are very happy and have fun.
But there is a big problem. The park is full of trash. There are cans and bottles and bags everywhere. Some of the trash is old and smelly. It makes the grass and the flowers rot. Tom and Ben do not like the trash. They think it is ugly and dirty.
They see a man who works at the park. He has a big truck and a rake. He is trying to clean up the trash. He looks tired and sad. Tom and Ben want to be helpful. They go to the man and say, "Hello, sir. Can we help you?"
The man smiles and says, "Thank you, boys. That is very kind of you. You can help me by picking up some of the trash and putting it in the truck. But be careful, some of the trash is sharp or sticky. And do not touch the rotten stuff. It can make you sick."
Tom and Ben nod and say, "OK, sir. We will be careful." They take a big bag and start to pick up the trash. They are proud and happy to help the man. They think they are doing a good thing.
But they are not careful enough. They do not see a rotten banana peel on the ground. It is brown and slimy and full of worms. Tom steps on it and slips. He falls down and hits his head on a rock. He cries out in pain and blood. Ben runs to him and screams. The man hears them and comes to help. He calls for help on his phone. He is scared and sorry.
Tom and Ben do not play golf anymore. Tom has a big scar on his head. He has bad dreams and headaches. He is sad and angry. Ben is sad and scared. He blames himself for what happened. He does not like the park anymore. He does not like golf anymore. He does not like anything anymore.
