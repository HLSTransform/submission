Once upon a time there were two friends named Bob and Sarah. Bob and Sarah decided to build a big fort together. They grabbed pieces of wood and started to build the fort. When they were almost finished building the fort, a big wreck happened. The wreck suddenly destroyed the fort, leaving it empty. Poor Bob and Sarah were so upset. They had worked so hard to build the fort and it was all gone. The two friends sadly looked at the empty ruin of their fort. In the end there was nothing left for them to do but go home.
