Tom and Jen are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a big box in the park. It has a red ribbon on it.
"Wow, look at that!" Tom says. "What is in the box?"
"I don't know. Let's open it and see!" Jen says. She runs to the box and pulls the ribbon.
"Wait, Jen! Maybe it is not for us. Maybe it is for someone else." Tom says. He is afraid of getting in trouble.
"No, it is for us. I can feel it. It is a surprise!" Jen says. She opens the box and looks inside.
"Wow, wow, wow!" Jen says. She sees a lot of toys in the box. There are dolls, cars, books, and more. She is very happy.
"Hey, those are my toys!" A voice says. It is Sam, the boy who lives next door. He is angry. He sees Tom and Jen with his box.
"Give me back my box! It is my birthday today. My mom gave me those toys. They are mine!" Sam says. He runs to the box and tries to take it from Jen.
"No, they are ours! We found them first. They are our surprise!" Jen says. She holds the box tight and does not let go.
Tom and Jen and Sam start to fight over the box. They pull and push and shout. They are not friends anymore. They are very sad.
