Once there was a little puppy named Alfie. He was searching for a place to be comfortable and relax. He wandered for a long time and then he saw a big, tall house. It was very wealthy looking with beautiful trees and a pond in front. Alfie thought it might be the perfect place to relax, so he bounded up to the front door of the house.
Alfie knocked on the white door with his paw and a woman appeared. She was an old woman with a friendly face. Alfie asked her, “Can I please relax here?”
The woman looked at Alfie and said, “My, my. What a cute puppy. Of course, why don’t you come inside and join us?” Then the woman opened the door and let Alfie inside.
The house was wonderful and Alfie was so happy that he could relax! He curled up on a warm blanket in front of the fire and fell fast asleep.
The woman smiled and said, “Now that’s the perfect way to relax!”
