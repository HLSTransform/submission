One day, James was taking a walk around the park. He saw a vehicle and wanted to run after it. His dad warned him, saying it was getting dark outside. But James was very eager and he didn't listen. He ran as fast as he could, but the vehicle was too fast. He kept running and running until he got tired.
James stopped to catch his breath. He looked up to find that the vehicle was gone and the park was very dark. He started to panic, but then he heard his dad calling him.
“James! Where are you?” his dad said. 
James popped his head up, “I'm here, dad!”
His dad smiled and said, “Don't ever run after vehicles when it's dark, ok? It's not safe!”
James nodded his head and promised he would never do it again. He grabbed his dad's hand and they walked back home.
