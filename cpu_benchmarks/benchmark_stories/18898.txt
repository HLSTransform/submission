Lily and Ben were very happy. They were going to the theater with Mom and Dad. They liked to watch funny shows and sing songs. They put on their coats and hats and got in the car.
"Are we there yet?" Lily asked.
"Soon, sweetie. The theater is not far," Mom said.
They saw a big sign with lights and colors. It said "Theater". They parked the car and walked to the door. There were many people and noises.
"Stay close to us, okay?" Dad said. "The theater is very big and busy."
Lily and Ben nodded. They held Mom and Dad's hands. They went inside and found their seats. They waited for the show to start.
But then, something bad happened. There was a loud boom and smoke. People screamed and ran. Lily and Ben were scared. They did not know what was going on.
"Mom, Dad, what is that?" Ben cried.
"I don't know, honey. We have to get out of here. Come on, follow us," Mom said.
They tried to get to the door, but there were too many people. They pushed and shoved. Lily and Ben lost Mom and Dad's hands. They were alone in the crowd.
"Mom! Dad! Where are you?" Lily shouted.
"Help! Help!" Ben sobbed.
They looked around, but they could not see Mom and Dad. They could not see the door. They could only see smoke and fire. They were trapped in the theater. They were not safe. They were very sad.
