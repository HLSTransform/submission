Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He promised his mom that he would act like a big boy and get ready for bed all by himself. Timmy was so excited to show his mom that he was ready to be a big boy. 
He put on his pajamas and brushed his teeth all on his own. But then he realized he forgot to give his mom a goodnight kiss! Timmy quickly ran to his mom and gave her a big kiss. She was so proud of him for keeping his promise and acting like a big boy. 
Timmy went to bed feeling happy and proud of himself. He knew that if he kept acting like a big boy and keeping his promises, he would make his mom very happy.
