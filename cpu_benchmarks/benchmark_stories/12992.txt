Once upon a time there were two little friends named Jill and Bob. They were playing all day long in the park.
That day, they decided to take a break and got very thirsty. So they went to the nearby cafe and asked for juice.
When they got the juice, they saw that it was thick. Jill and Bob wanted to fight to see who will get the thickest juice. So they started to fight.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was coming from the nearby toilet! They went to see what it was and found out that there was a big toilet monster inside!
They got very scared, but then realized that they were brave and decided to fight the monster. They asked the monster why it was in the toilet and the monster said it came to steal the thick juice.
So Jill and Bob bravely fought off the toilet monster and ran away with the thick juice. In the end, they had a big celebration with the juice and decided to never fight again!
