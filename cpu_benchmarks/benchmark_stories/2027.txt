Once upon a time there lived a little weatherfish called Flipper. He lived in a reef in the middle of the sea. Every day, Flipper would swim around looking for food. Most of all, he loved to wrap food in seaweed and eat it! 
One day, Flipper noticed some other fish swimming towards him. They were a popular kind of fish, and they were carrying a package. Flipper greeted them and said, 'Hello, what do you have there?' 
The fish smiled and said, 'We have a special package for the reef. We want to wrap it around the reef so that it can protect it from the wind and the waves.' 
Flipper was excited. He asked, 'How can I help?' 
The fish replied, 'We need your help to wrap it around the reef. Will you join us?' 
Flipper agreed and he started wrapping the package around the reef. He was very careful and wrapped it tightly. 
The other fish thanked Flipper and said, 'You did a great job! Now the reef is safe and protected.' 
Flipper was very happy and swam away in the sea. He was glad he could help protect his reef!
