Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved watching films. One day, she went to the cinema with her mom to watch a new film. She was very excited and couldn't wait to see it.
When they got to the cinema, they bought some popcorn and sat down in their seats. The lights went out, and the film started. Lily was so excited that she couldn't stop talking about it.
During the film, Lily's mom asked her if she had forgotten to go to the bathroom before the film started. Lily realized that she had forgotten, so they quickly went to the bathroom and came back to watch the rest of the film. After the film, Lily told her mom how much she loved it and couldn't wait to see another one.
