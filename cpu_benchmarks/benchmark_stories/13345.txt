Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had long, pretty hair that she loved very much. One day, Lily's mom said it was time for a haircut. Lily didn't want a haircut because she was afraid her hair would break and she wouldn't look pretty anymore. But her mom promised her that she would still look beautiful.
At the hair salon, Lily's hairdresser was very generous and kind. She gave Lily a lollipop and told her how pretty she looked with her new haircut. But when they got home, Lily looked in the mirror and saw that her hair was shorter than she wanted. She started crying and said that her hair was broken.
Her mom hugged her and explained that hair can't really break like a toy, but it can be cut. She also told her that it's okay to be sad about things that change, but that change can be good too. Lily realized that her hair still looked pretty and that she didn't need long hair to be beautiful. The moral of the story is that sometimes change can be scary, but it can also be good.
