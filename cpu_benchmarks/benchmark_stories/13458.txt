Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy lived on a farm with his mommy and daddy. One day, Timmy's daddy asked him to help carry a big barrel of apples. It was very difficult for Timmy to lift the barrel, but he wanted to help his daddy. 
As they walked to the barn, Timmy asked his daddy why they needed the barrel. His daddy said they were going to make apple juice. Timmy didn't really understand what that meant, but he knew it must be important if his daddy cared enough to ask for his help. 
When they got to the barn, Timmy's daddy showed him how to put the apples in a machine that squished them into juice. Timmy thought it was really cool and he was happy he could help. From that day on, Timmy always felt important when he could help his family with things that were difficult.
