One day, a big earthquake hit the town. It made the ground shake and the people were scared. Tim, a little boy, was playing with his toys when it happened. He ran to his mom and said, "Mom, what is happening?"
His mom said, "It is an earthquake, Tim. We need to be safe." They went under the table to hide from the shaking.
In the town, there was a selfish man named Mr. Grump. He did not want to help others. When the earthquake struck, he only thought about saving his things. He did not care about the people who were scared.
The people in the town were angry with Mr. Grump. They said, "You need to help us, Mr. Grump. Don't be selfish!" Mr. Grump felt bad and decided to change. He started to help the people in the town.
After the earthquake, the town worked together to fix everything. Mr. Grump learned to be kind and not selfish. Tim and his mom were safe, and they were happy that everyone helped each other.
