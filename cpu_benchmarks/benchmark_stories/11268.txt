Jill was walking in the park when she saw a barrel. She went over to take a look and saw that it was full of hot water. She was surprised.
"What is this?" Jill said as she questioned the barrel.
Suddenly, a voice came from the barrel.
"I'm Mario, the hot water fairy," said the voice.
Jill was so amazed. She couldn't believe it! She asked "What are you doing in the barrel?"
Mario replied, "I'm here to give you a magical gift. Put your hand in the hot water and you'll find a surprise!"
Jill smiled and carefully put her hand in the barrel. When she felt something at the bottom, she pulled it up - it was a shiny starfish!
Jill was so happy. She thanked Mario for his magical gift and he flew away.
Jill was on her way home and she thought about Mario the hot water fairy. She knew it was a special day she'd never forget.
