Lily and Ben were playing a game. They had to roll a ball and knock down some cans. Lily was very good at the game. She knocked down many cans. Ben was not so good. He missed a lot of times. Lily laughed at him. She said he was bad at the game. She said she was the best. She said she would win.
Ben felt sad and angry. He did not like Lily's words. He wanted to show her he could play too. He tried harder and harder. He rolled the ball with all his might. He knocked down some cans. He knocked down more cans. He knocked down all the cans. He was happy. He had won. He had a victory.
Lily was shocked. She did not expect Ben to win. She felt bad. She had been mean to him. She had hurt his feelings. She had been too proud. She wished she had not laughed at him. She wished she had been nice. She wanted to say sorry. But Ben did not look at her. He did not talk to her. He walked away. Lily felt helpless. She could not fix what she had done. She regretted her words. She had lost a friend.
