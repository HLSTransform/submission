Robbie had just turned three and was so excited. His dad took him to the park to play. When they got there, his dad spread out a big, red blanket. Robbie spotted a sparkly butterfly nearby fluttering its wings. It looked so beautiful, he wanted to catch it. 
Robbie said "Dad can I catch it?". His dad smiled and said "sure, but be careful, it looks really fragile". 
Robbie carefully spread out his hands and the butterfly landed on one of them. As Robbie watched it, the sparkle of its wings reminded him of tiny stars. He felt so happy. 
Suddenly, the butterfly's sparkle started to spread. Soon, a wave of sparkles was moving all around them, making the park look like a festival. Everyone around was so excited, even the birds were singing a happy tune. Robbie was no longer bored. Instead, he felt alive and free.
