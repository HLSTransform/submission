One day, an ordinary boat appeared on the sea. There was an anchor on the boat. The boat started to move and it went to a special place. When it arrived, something amazing happened. A beautiful mermaid appeared. She was wearing a shell necklace and had sparkly fins. She was singing a special song and the boat bobbed up and down. Everyone smiled and waved at the mermaid. After that the boat sailed away, but they never forgot the mermaid they saw. It was a special adventure.
