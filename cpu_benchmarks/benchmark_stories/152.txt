Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play in the rain. She would jump in all the puddles and get very wet. One day, Lily saw a cute little frog hopping around in the rain.
"Hello little frog! What are you doing in the rain?" asked Lily.
"I like the rain because it helps create more puddles for me to swim in," replied the frog.
Lily smiled and said, "That's so cool! I love playing in the rain too. Do you want to play with me?"
The frog hopped up and down with excitement and said, "Yes, let's play together and create lots of fun puddles to jump in!"
So, Lily and the frog played together in the rain, creating lots of wet puddles to jump in. They had so much fun and became the best of friends. From that day on, whenever it rained, Lily and the cute little frog would play together and create new adventures.
