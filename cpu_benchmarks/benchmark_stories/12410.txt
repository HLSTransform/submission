Once upon a time, there was a little girl name Lisa who loved to dance. One day, Lisa saw a structure in the forest and wanted to dance on it.
Lisa ran up to the structure but when she got close, she became frightened. It was bigger than she thought and she felt scared.
Suddenly, Lisa heard a voice coming from inside the structure.
"Don't be frightened," the voice said. "It's just me. Why don't you come in and dance with me?"
Lisa was surprised but agreed. She stepped inside the structure and saw a beautiful fairy. The fairy took Lisa's hand and the two of them started to dance. They danced for hours, until the sun went down.
When the night was over, Lisa thanked the fairy for teaching her to dance. As Lisa said goodbye, the fairy smiled.
"It was my pleasure," said the fairy. "Whenever you're scared, just dance. It will make you strong and brave."
And with that, Lisa waved goodbye and ran home. She was no longer afraid and knew that with some practice, she could dance better than ever!
