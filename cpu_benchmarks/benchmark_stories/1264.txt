Once there were two best friends - John and Sarah. They were really good buddies and loved playing together.
One day, the two friends were in their toy room and saw something special at the back - an exciting exit! They knew that it would be fun to explore and so John decided to pull it open.
As soon as he opened the door, they saw that they were in a new and strange place they had not seen before. They were a bit troubled because they weren't quite sure what to do.
As they looked around, they spotted something amazing - a magic carpet! Sarah suggested they get on and pull the rope to fly away. They each grabbed ahold of the rope and pulled. Then, up into the sky they flew! 
John and Sarah were so happy to explore these new lands with their magic carpet and they were never troubled again!
