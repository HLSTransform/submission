Once upon a time, there was a small dog named Spot. Spot was very rambunctious and wasn't scared of anything. One day, Spot was walking through the park, full of energy and happiness. Suddenly, Spot saw a small bone on the path. He wanted the bone, so he quickly ran to it. But when he tried to grab it, it was stuck to the ground.
Spot let out a small whine, trying to get it free. Just then, he heard a voice. "Do you want the bone?" it said. Spot looked up and saw the most giant dog he had ever seen. The big dog said, "Don't worry, I can help you get it. It looks like it is stuck."
Spot nodded his head vigorously. The big dog gently pulled the bone free, and gave it to Spot. Spot thanked the big dog, then happily trotted away with his bone. He would always remember this day and the kindness of the big dog.
