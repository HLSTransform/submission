Once upon a time, there were two friends called Sam and Phil. Sam was so strong, and Phil was so brave. One day they decided to go on an adventure. 
Sam and Phil came across a big, black port. Sam wanted to explore it but Phil was too scared. 
“Don’t be scared,” said Sam. “We can fight anything together.”
So Sam and Phil listened carefully and entered the port. It was dark and eerie, but they continued walking. Suddenly, they heard a loud growl coming from the darkness.
“Let’s hold hands and be brave,” said Sam.
The two of them held hands and stepped forward. Suddenly, two black cats appeared. Sam and Phil were so scared.
“Let’s fight!” shouted Sam.
So, together, Sam and Phil fought the cats. They growled and swiped their paws, but in the end Sam and Phil emerged victorious! 
They celebrated by giving each other a big hug, and Sam and Phil explored the port together.
