Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Jack. One day he was playing in his garden when he heard something strange—frustrated angry sounds.
He carefully crept out from his garden to investigate. To his surprise, he found a big, strong bull.
Jack gasped. The bull was stuck in the mud and seemed exhausted from all of the trying to pull himself out. Jack felt sorry for him and wanted to help.
"Are you hurt?" Jack asked softly.
The bull looked up at him. "Yes! I need help, my hooves won't budge and I'm really tired," he said.
The little boy thought for a while, then he had an idea. He quickly ran back to his house and brought out some pieces of string. He carefully stitched the string around the bull's hooves, and then he pulled as hard as he could.
Soon enough, all his hard work paid off. The bull was free and safe.
The bull thanked Jack and gave him a big hug. “You’re such a brave boy! I'm so glad you were here to help me,” the bull said. Then he yielded away back to the fields.
Jack waved goodbye and smiled. It felt good to have helped someone in need.
