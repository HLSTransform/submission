Once upon a time, there was a gifted little girl called Lacey. She loved playing with her uncle, and one day they decided to try something new.
“Let’s push the swing together!” said Lacey’s uncle.
Lacey was excited and they started pushing the swing together. Back and forth they went, but suddenly Lacey’s uncle slipped and the swing stopped.
“We can’t push it together anymore!” said Lacey sadly.
Lacey’s uncle tried to push the swing by himself, but it wouldn’t move.
“Let’s try one more time,” he said.
Lacey and her uncle pushed the swing together and with a final push, the swing started going again! Lacey cheered with joy.
“You are so gifted!” said Lacey’s uncle.
The two laughed and kept on pushing the swing together until it was time for Lacey to go home.
