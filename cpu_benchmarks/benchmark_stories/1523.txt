Once upon a time there was a mom and a dad who wanted a baby. They hoped and wished for a long time, and finally their wish came true!
One day their baby came. The mom and dad were so happy. They loved to cuddle with their baby and give her lots of hugs and kisses.
The baby began to grow, and one day she noticed something in the sky. It was a fat news bird! The baby pointed to the bird and smiled.
The mom and dad smiled too and said that the news bird had a special message for her. The bird flew away while they watched.
The mom and dad understood the special message. They told the baby that it was time for her to grow even more and that they were so happy to have her. The baby was happy too, and they all hugged and gave kisses. 
 
The end.
