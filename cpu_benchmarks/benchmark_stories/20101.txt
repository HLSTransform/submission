Zoe likes to count. She can count to ten with her fingers. She knows zero is when you have no fingers up. She likes to hold zero in her hand and pretend it is a ball.
One day, Zoe goes to the park with her mom. She sees a big slide. She wants to go on it. She holds zero in her hand and runs to the slide. She climbs up the steps and sits on the top.
But then she feels scared. The slide is too high and too fast. She wants to go back down. She cries and calls for her mom. She squeezes zero in her hand.
Her mom hears her and comes to the slide. She tells Zoe to be calm and brave. She says she will catch her at the bottom. She says zero will help her too.
Zoe listens to her mom. She takes a deep breath and lets go of the slide. She slides down and feels the wind in her hair. She smiles and laughs. She lands in her mom's arms. She hugs her mom and shows her zero. She says zero is her friend. Her mom says she is proud of her. They go to play some more.
