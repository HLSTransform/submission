Once there was a lazy bear called Bessie. She lived by a river and loved to take her kayak out onto the water. One day, Bessie was back in the woods near the river when she saw a rabbit.
"Hello rabbit!" said Bessie.
"Hello!" said the rabbit with a smile.
"You look so happy!" said Bessie.
"I am! I love to kayak," said the rabbit.
Bessie was so pleased to have a new friend. She smiled happily and said, "Can I join you kayaking sometime?" 
"Of course!" said the rabbit. "But be prepared to move quickly, I'm a very fast paddler!" 
Bessie excitedly jumped up and down, then laughed at herself for being so lazy. She couldn't wait to go kayaking with her new friend!
