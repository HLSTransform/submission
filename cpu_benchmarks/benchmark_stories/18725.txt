Once upon a time, there was a little bird. The bird was very happy and liked to sing all day. One day, the bird saw an arrow on the ground. The bird was curious and went to see the arrow. The arrow was sharp and dangerous. 
Suddenly, a big cat appeared. The cat wanted to catch the bird. The bird tried to fly away, but the cat was too fast. The bird laid down on the ground, hoping the cat would be gentle. 
But the cat was not gentle. The cat caught the bird with its sharp claws. The bird could not fly away anymore. The bird was very sad and could not sing anymore. The end.
