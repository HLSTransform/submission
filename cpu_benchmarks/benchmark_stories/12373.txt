Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three years old and liked to play outside. 
One day, Lucy was playing in the garden when it started to rain. She became cold and started to shiver.
"Oh no," she said, worried. She looked around but couldn't find anywhere to shelter. 
Suddenly, she remembered that she had a case in the house. Lucy ran as quickly as she could and grabbed it. She opened it up to find a rough and scratchy blanket inside. She wrapped herself in it and stopped shivering. 
The blanket kept Lucy warm until the rain had gone. She was so happy and grateful for the case and the blanket inside. From that day onwards, Lucy kept the case close by, in case the rain started again.
