Once upon a time there lived a gentle boy. He was kind and always wanted to help others. He loved to give hugs to all his friends.
One day, he went to the store and saw an exciting box of cereal. He thought it was the perfect present for his friend who was feeling sad. But instead of buying the cereal, he used his pocket money to buy a one-of-a-kind gift.
He gave his friend the present and it made her happy. Then the gentle boy put his arms around her and said, "I want to heal your sadness and make you happy." His hug healed the sadness in his friend's heart.
From that day onward, the gentle boy and his friend ate cereal together whenever they wanted to heal their worries and sadness. They ate it with big smiles on their faces and hugged each other whenever they felt down.
