Once upon a time, there was a monkey who lived in the forest. One day, the monkey got stuck in a big hole and couldn't get out. He felt very helpless and sad. 
Along came a kind boy who saw the monkey in the hole. The boy wanted to help the monkey, so he decided to take action. He found a long stick and used it to help the monkey climb out of the hole. 
The monkey was so happy and grateful to the boy for helping him. He gave the boy a big hug and they became friends. From that day on, the monkey would always wave to the boy whenever he saw him in the forest. The boy felt happy that he was able to help the monkey and make a new friend.
