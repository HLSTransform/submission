Ben liked rockets. He had a toy rocket that he played with every day. He made zoom and blast sounds with his mouth. He pretended to fly to the moon and the stars.
One day, Ben saw a big rocket on TV. It was shiny and red. It had a fire at the bottom. It was going to space. Ben wanted to see the rocket. He asked his mom, "Can we go see the rocket, please?"
His mom said, "No, Ben. The rocket is very far away. We can't go there. We can watch it on TV."
Ben was sad. He wanted to see the rocket up close. He wanted to touch it and feel it. He wanted to go inside it and fly with it. He said, "Please, mom. Please, please, please. I want to see the rocket."
His mom said, "Ben, stop. You are being lazy. You have a toy rocket. You can play with it. You can use your imagination. You can have fun with it. You don't need to see the real rocket."
Ben was angry. He did not like his mom's words. He did not want to play with his toy rocket. He wanted to see the real rocket. He threw his toy rocket on the floor. He said, "No, mom. I don't want to play with this. I want to see the real rocket. You are mean."
His mom was upset. She did not like Ben's words. She did not like Ben's action. She said, "Ben, you are being naughty. You are not listening to me. You are not respecting your toy. You are not being grateful. You need a time out."
She took Ben to his room. She closed the door. She said, "You can stay here until you calm down. You can think about what you did. You can say sorry to me and to your toy rocket. Then you can come out and watch the TV with me."
Ben was alone in his room. He felt bad. He knew he was wrong. He knew he hurt his mom and his toy rocket. He wished he could see them. He wished he could hug them. He wished he could say sorry to them. He wished he could watch the rocket on TV with them. He learned his lesson. He said, "Please, mom. Please, toy rocket. Please, forgive me."
