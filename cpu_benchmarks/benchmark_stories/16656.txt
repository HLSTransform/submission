Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his teddy bear named Teddy. One day, Timmy was playing with Teddy when he accidentally broke the zipper on Teddy's back. 
Timmy was very sad because Teddy's zipper was broken and he couldn't close it anymore. He tried to fix it with some tape, but it didn't work. Then, something strange happened. Teddy started to shrink! 
Timmy was scared and didn't know what to do. He picked up Teddy and hugged him tightly. Suddenly, Teddy grew back to his normal size and Timmy was so happy. But then, he noticed that Teddy's back still hurt where the zipper was broken.
Timmy knew he had to do something to help Teddy feel better. So, he decided to take Teddy to the toy doctor to get his zipper fixed and his back healed. And from that day on, Timmy made sure to be extra careful with Teddy and all of his other toys.
