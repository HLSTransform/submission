John and his mom went to the church. It was a big, tall building that made John feel small. In the church, he saw how honest the people were. They said nice things and helped each other. 
John's mom ordered him to sit down in a special seat. He had to be very quiet and still. He stayed like that for a long time. After the church service was done, they left and went home. 
John was very happy and he said prayers to God every night because he liked the church and the honest people.
