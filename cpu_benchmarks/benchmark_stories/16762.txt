Tom and Lily were twins. They liked to play in the garden with their toys. One day, they found a small bird on the grass. It was not moving. It had no feathers. It was an infant bird.
"Look, Tom, a baby bird!" Lily said. She picked it up gently. "It is cold and soft. Maybe it fell from the nest."
Tom looked at the bird. He felt sad. He wanted to help it. "Maybe we can bury it, Lily. Then it can sleep and be happy."
Lily nodded. She liked the idea. They got a shovel and dug a hole under a big tree. They put the bird in the hole and covered it with dirt. They said a prayer for the bird. They felt better.
But then they heard a loud noise. It was their dog, Rex. He had seen them bury the bird. He was curious. He ran to the hole and started to dig. He wanted to see what was inside.
"Rex, no!" Tom shouted. He ran to the hole and tried to stop Rex. But Rex was too strong. He pushed Tom away and kept digging. He found the bird and took it in his mouth.
Lily saw what Rex did. She was angry. She loved the bird. She did not want Rex to hurt it. She screamed and threw a stick at Rex. "Bad dog, bad dog! Drop the bird, drop the bird!"
Rex was scared. He dropped the bird and ran away. He did not understand why Lily was angry. He just wanted to play.
Tom and Lily looked at the bird. It was dirty and wet. It had bite marks. It was not cold and soft anymore. It was ruined.
They cried. They hugged each other. They wished they had not buried the bird. They wished they had left it alone. They learned a hard lesson.
