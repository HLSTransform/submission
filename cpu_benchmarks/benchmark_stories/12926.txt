Once upon a time there were two good friends named Sunshine and Moonbeam. They loved playing together and had lots of fun.
One day the two friends decided to have a picnic by a river. The river was steaming in the hot sun and the two friends couldn't wait to dive in!
They started playing in the water, splashing and laughing. Suddenly Sunshine noticed some steam coming from the river. At first, Moonbeam was scared but then he noticed the steam looked like a big white cloud and couldn't help but be happy! 
He said to Sunshine, "Look it's a big white cloud! Let's have a picnic with it." Sunshine thought this was a good idea and they both decided to try it.
The two friends had the best picnic underneath the steam cloud! They played games, ate snacks and raced each other in the water. After a while, they said goodbye to the steam cloud and were both very happy.
