Once upon a time there were two little bears and they were best friends. One day they wanted to go for a walk. As they started walking, they spotted a big hill. The bears wanted to go to the top! The path to the top was steep and difficult, they could only climb it in reverse.
So, the two little bears got down on all fours and started walking backwards up the hill. Bit by bit they made their way to the top. When they got to the peak of the hill, they saw a beautiful, peaceful view.
They stopped for a rest and then, to have a snack. The bears took a plate out of their picnic basket and put some yummy cakes on it. They enjoyed the cakes and the peaceful view from the top of the hill.
When the bears were all done, they carefully put their plate back in the picnic basket and started reversing their way down the hill. When they got back to the bottom, they were so proud of themselves for walking all the way up in reverse!
