Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very quick. He loved to run and play with his friends. One sunny day, Tim and his friends were playing with a ball in the park.
Tim's friend, Sam, threw the ball high in the sky. Tim had to be very careful, so he did not fall. He jumped and tried to pass the ball back to Sam. The ball went so high that it touched the clouds.
Tim and his friends played until the sun went down. They were all happy and tired. They went home to eat dinner and rest. Tim was proud of how careful and quick he was today. And they all had fun playing together.
