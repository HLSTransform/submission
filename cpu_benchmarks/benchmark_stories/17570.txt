Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park with their dog, Max. One morning, they go to the park with Mom. The park is full of mist. Lily and Ben can't see very far.
"Where is Max?" Lily asks. She looks around, but she can't find him.
"Maybe he is hiding," Ben says. He runs to a big tree and calls, "Max, come here!"
But Max doesn't come. He is busy. He sees a big duck near the pond. The duck has bread in its mouth. Max wants the bread. He runs to the duck and tries to take the bread.
"Quack, quack!" the duck says. It is angry. It flaps its wings and pecks at Max.
"Ow, ow!" Max says. He runs away from the duck. He is scared.
Lily and Ben hear Max. They follow his voice. They see him near the pond. He is wet and dirty.
"Max, what are you doing?" Lily asks. She hugs him.
"I was hungry," Max says. "I wanted to feed on the bread."
"But that is the duck's bread," Ben says. "You can't take it. That is not nice."
"I'm sorry," Max says. He looks sad.
Mom comes to the pond. She sees Max and the duck. She laughs.
"You are a crazy dog, Max," she says. "But we love you. Come on, let's go home. I have some treats for you."
Lily, Ben, and Max go home with Mom. They are happy. They don't mind the mist. They had fun in the park.
