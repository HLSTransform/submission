One day, two friends decided to explore the reef and find out what it was. They dove down deep, past the rocks and corals and they saw all kinds of strange creatures.
The friends kept looking around until they noticed something strange. It was a big box, and it seemed like it was stuck. All they had to do was solve the puzzle, and the box would open.
So they thought hard, and they finally figured out the solution. The box opened, and inside was a huge treasure! They had solved the mysterious reef and found a wonderful surprise!
