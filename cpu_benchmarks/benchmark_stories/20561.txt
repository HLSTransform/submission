Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Maggie. She was only three years old and she liked to have adventures. She had an blue teddy bear called Teddy. 
One day, Maggie decided to go for a walk in the forest. She took Teddy with her and they had lots of fun. They played hide and seek and Maggie laughed aloud.
At the end of their adventures, Maggie and Teddy stumbled across a huge bowl of orange juice. It smelled very sweet! Maggie was really thirsty and she took a big sip, right away. 
She quickly realized that it tasted delicious. She took some more sips and Teddy drank the juice too. Soon the bowl was gone. 
Maggie then realized that the juice was very special and that it filled her with happiness. She and Teddy had a great adventures and they loved the sweet juice of the forest.
