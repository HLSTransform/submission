Once upon a time, there was a naughty jet. It zoomed around the sky, causing trouble for everyone. Everyone in the town tried to figure out how to stop it, but nothing seemed to work.
Then one day, a kind man came to town with a plan. He told everyone to raise their hands, and then magic happened! As everyone raised their hands into the air, the naughty jet was lifted high into the sky. It flew away, never to be seen again.
Everyone cheered with joy, happy that the naughty jet was finally gone. But they never forgot the kind man who helped them, and his raising-hands trick.
