Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweetie. Tweetie had a job to do every day. His job was to peek into people's windows and see what they were doing. One day, Tweetie saw a man with a big gray bag walking towards his house. 
Tweetie flew to his friend, a little mouse named Squeaky, and told him about the man with the big gray bag. Squeaky was scared and asked Tweetie if they should hide. Tweetie said no, because he had a plan. 
The man with the big gray bag knocked on the door and said, "I'm here to fix your roof." Tweetie and Squeaky peeked through the window and saw that the man was telling the truth. They felt relieved and happy that they didn't have to hide. From that day on, Tweetie and Squeaky learned that sometimes things aren't always what they seem, and it's important to peek before making a decision.
