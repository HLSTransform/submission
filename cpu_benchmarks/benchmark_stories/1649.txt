Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy tools. He had a hammer, a screwdriver, and a saw. One day, Timmy was playing with his tools when his friend Billy came over to play.
"Wow, those tools look fun! Can I play with them?" asked Billy.
"Sure, but be careful. The saw is really sharp and could bite you," warned Timmy.
Billy picked up the saw and tried to use it, but it was too big for him. "This tool doesn't fit me very well," he said.
Timmy laughed and showed him how to use the hammer instead. They played together for hours, building and fixing things with their toy tools. And they never forgot to be careful and watch out for the biting saw.
