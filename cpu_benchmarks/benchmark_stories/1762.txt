Once upon a time there was a small girl who loved puzzles. But the girl was not very good at solving them. One day the girl decided it was time to try and solve her latest puzzle. She stared at it for a long time and tried very hard but still couldn't figure it out.
Suddenly, a small bird landed on the window sill outside. The girl watched as the bird easily put the pieces of the puzzle together. She quickly opened the window to thank the bird, but it was already gone.
The girl learned an important lesson that day: if you can't do something on your own, it's ok to ask for help. Even if that help comes from a small bird!
