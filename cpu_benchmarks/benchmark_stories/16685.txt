Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was a teddy bear named Mr. Snuggles. One day, Lily's mom lit a candle in the living room. Lily thought the candle was weird because it smelled like flowers.
Later that night, Lily was playing with Mr. Snuggles when she heard her mom say, "I have to leave for a little while, but I'll be back soon." Lily didn't want her mom to leave, but she knew she had to go.
As soon as her mom left, Lily noticed that the candle was getting bigger and bigger. She tried to blow it out, but it wouldn't go out. Suddenly, the candle fell over and set the curtains on fire! Lily was scared and didn't know what to do.
Luckily, her mom had taught her what to do in case of a fire. Lily quickly grabbed Mr. Snuggles and ran out of the house to call for help. The firefighters came and put out the fire, and Lily and her mom were safe. From that day on, Lily knew that candles could be dangerous and she always made sure to blow them out before leaving the room.
