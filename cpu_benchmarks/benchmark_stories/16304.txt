Once upon a time, there was a big elephant with a long trunk. The elephant was walking in the forest when he saw a group of monkeys playing. The elephant wanted to play too, so he joined in.
The monkeys started to count how many times they could jump over the elephant's trunk. The elephant was so calm and patient, he let the monkeys count and jump as many times as they wanted.
When the game was over, the elephant said goodbye to the monkeys and continued his walk in the forest. The monkeys were happy to have played with the kind elephant and they counted the number of times they had jumped over his trunk all the way home.
