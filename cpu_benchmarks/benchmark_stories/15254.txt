Once upon a time there was a elderly lady who needed some support. She went to the store and saw a penny on the ground. She smiled and picked it up, thinking it must be her lucky day.
The elderly lady put her penny in her pocket and walked to the bank. She bought some food and decided to give the penny to the old man at the bus stop.
The old man was very grateful. He said, "Thank you so much for your support. This penny will help me get where I need to go."
The elderly lady smiled and said, "I'm glad I could help. Take care now." 
The old man smiled back and thanked her again before hopping onto the bus.
The elderly lady was happy she was able to support another in need. She went home knowing she had done a good deed.
