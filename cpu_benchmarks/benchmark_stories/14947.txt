John was a clever three-year-old who loved to play outside. He often went for walks with his Mom and Dad. One day, John asked them if he could ride on a mule. His Dad thought for a moment and said, "We don't have a mule, but if you're a good boy and take a nap, we'll see what we can do."
John knew he would need to be extra good while his parents were away. He took his nap, and when he awoke, his parents had returned with a mule. He was so excited he could hardly stand still! His Dad told him how clever he was and that he had learned to ride the mule.
John couldn't believe it! His Dad had taught him how to ride a mule and now he was a regular cowboy. He hopped on the mule and rode around the town all day. Everyone was amazed at how skillfully he was riding. 
Finally, the day came to a close and John had to return home. But his short time riding the mule was a day he would never forget. He was so proud and thanked his Dad for teaching him such a clever skill!
