Tommy was a naughty little boy. His mommy asked him to help build a cage for the rabbits in the garden. But Tommy was not interested. He didn't want to help.
"No mommy! I don't want to build that cage," Tommy said in a loud voice. His mommy was surprised.
"Tommy, come here. We have to build the cage. It will keep the rabbits safe," she said.
But Tommy ignored his mommy and ran away. He ran to the garden.
Tommy found a rough stick and he started to build a cage for the rabbits. But the cage was too tight and small. The poor rabbits couldn't escape.
Tommy's mommy was very angry. She rushed to the garden.
"Tommy! What have you done? You have built a terrible cage!" she said.
Tommy knew he had done something wrong. He felt sad and he started to cry. His mommy hugged him and told him that they could make a better cage for the rabbits. But it was too late. The poor rabbits were trapped in the rough cage.
