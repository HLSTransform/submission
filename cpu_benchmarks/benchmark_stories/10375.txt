Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big hill with many ants. Lily wanted to march with the ants. She said to Ben, "Let's march with the ants. They look fun."
Ben was scared of the ants. He said to Lily, "No, Lily. The ants are not fun. They can bite. They can have poison. We should not march with them."
But Lily did not listen to Ben. She was curious and brave. She ran to the hill and started to march with the ants. She followed them to their home. She saw a big hole in the ground. She wanted to see what was inside.
Ben shouted to Lily, "Lily, come back! That is the ant home. You cannot go inside. It is dark and dangerous. You can get lost or hurt."
But Lily did not hear Ben. She was too busy marching with the ants. She was clumsy and slipped. She fell into the hole. She screamed and cried. The ants were angry and scared. They bit Lily with their poison. Lily felt pain and sick. She could not get out of the hole.
Ben ran to the hole. He tried to help Lily. He called for help. But it was too late. Lily was gone. Ben was sad and sorry. He wished he had stopped Lily from marching with the ants. He learned a hard lesson. He never marched with the ants again.
