Tommy loved his trumpet. He got it for his birthday from his grandpa. He liked to blow it and make loud noises. He thought it was perfect.
One day, he took his trumpet to the park with his mom. He saw some other kids playing with balls and bikes. He wanted to join them, but he did not want to leave his trumpet.
"Mom, can I play with them?" he asked.
"Sure, honey, but be careful with your trumpet. Don't lose it or break it," his mom said.
"OK, mom, I will keep it safe," Tommy said.
He ran to the other kids and showed them his trumpet. They were curious and wanted to try it. Tommy let them blow it one by one, but he watched them closely. He did not want them to hurt his trumpet.
"Wow, your trumpet is cool," one kid said.
"Can I have it?" another kid asked.
"No, you can't. It's mine. Grandpa gave it to me. It's perfect," Tommy said.
He took his trumpet back and hugged it. He did not want to share it anymore. He ran back to his mom and told her what happened.
"Mom, they wanted my trumpet. But I said no. It's mine. I love it," he said.
"I'm proud of you, Tommy. You were nice to let them try it, but you also stood up for yourself. You can keep your trumpet. It's yours. And it's perfect," his mom said.
She kissed him and hugged him. Tommy smiled and blew his trumpet. He was happy. He had his mom and his perfect trumpet.
