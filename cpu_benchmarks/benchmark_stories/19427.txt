Once there was a bad tiger. He was always mean to the animals in the forest. He would growl and scare the other animals. One day a brave monkey wanted to stop the tiger being so bad. He rubbed his belly and whispered something magical. Suddenly the tiger stopped growling and began to smile. All the animals in the forest were so happy. They hugged each other and laughed. The bad tiger was now a gentle tiger and everyone in the forest was happy.
