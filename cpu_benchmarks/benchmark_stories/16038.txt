John was feeling very excited. He was going on a picnic with his parents. He was so excited that he insisted on helping carry the picnic basket. His parents were very careful as they let him carry it. 
John carried the basket all the way to the park. When they arrived, he opened the basket to find a big surprise. His parents had packed a big delicious reward for him. It was a sweet cake. 
John insisted on eating the cake right away. His parents warned him to be careful and not eat it all at once, but John was too excited. After he had eaten some of the cake, his parents insisted that he save the rest for later. So, John reluctantly put some of the cake back in the basket for later. 
John enjoyed the day with his family. He was glad that he had listened to his parents and saved some of the cake. He was happy with the reward.
