Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play with toys. One day, they found a colorful box in the park. It had many buttons and lights on it. They wondered what it was.
"Let's open it and see what's inside," Tom said.
"No, we should not touch it. It might be dangerous," Lily said.
"But it looks so fun. Maybe it has a toy or a game for us," Tom said. He reached for the box.
Lily grabbed his hand and pulled him away. "Stop, Tom. We don't know who left it here. It could make a loud sound or hurt us. We should tell a grown-up."
Tom refused to listen to Lily. He was curious and wanted to play with the box. He pushed Lily away and pressed a button. Suddenly, the box made a loud sound and a bright flash. Tom screamed and dropped the box. He felt a pain in his hand.
Lily ran to him and hugged him. She was scared and sorry for him. She saw a grown-up nearby and called for help. The grown-up came and looked at the box. He said it was a firework that someone had left behind. He said Tom was lucky that he only had a small burn. He took them to a nurse who put a bandage on Tom's hand.
Tom cried and said he was sorry. He said he should have listened to Lily. He said he learned his lesson. Lily said she forgave him and that she was glad he was okay. They hugged and said they were still friends. They said they would never touch a strange thing again. They said they would always tell a grown-up if they saw something like that. They said they would be careful and smart. The grown-up and the nurse smiled and said they were proud of them. They said they were good friends who cared for each other. They said they hoped they would have fun with safe toys. They gave them some colorful stickers and balloons. Lily and Tom thanked them and went home. They played with their stickers and balloons and had a happy day.
