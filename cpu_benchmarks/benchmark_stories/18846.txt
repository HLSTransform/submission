Lily liked to clap her hands. She clapped when she was happy, when she saw something funny, or when she wanted to make noise. She liked to clap with her mommy and daddy, and with her friends at the park.
One day, Lily heard a loud noise outside. It sounded like a big clap, but much louder and scarier. She ran to the window and saw dark clouds and rain. She asked her mommy, "What is that noise?"
Mommy said, "That is thunder, Lily. It is a powerful noise that comes from the sky when it rains. It is not a clap, but it sounds like one. It is not scary, but it is loud. Do you want to clap with the thunder?"
Lily nodded. She liked to try new things. She and mommy went to the porch and watched the rain. They waited for the thunder to come. When they heard it, they clapped their hands together. They clapped loud and fast, and then slow and soft. They clapped high and low, and then side to side. They clapped and laughed and had fun.
Lily learned that thunder was a powerful noise, but it was not scary. She learned that she could clap with the thunder, and make her own noise. She liked to clap with the thunder, and with her mommy. She clapped when she was happy, when she saw something funny, or when she wanted to make noise.
