Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the forest near her house. One day, she went on a walk with her mommy and they came across a big cliff. 
Lily's mommy said, "Be careful, Lily. The cliff is very high and we don't want you to fall." 
Lily felt anxious because she didn't want to fall. But then, she saw a butterfly and she forgot about the cliff. She followed the butterfly and they went on an adventure together. 
After a while, they came back to the cliff and Lily noticed something had changed. The sun was setting and the sky looked so pretty. She said to her mommy, "Look, mommy! The sky changed colors!" 
Lily and her mommy continued their walk and Lily felt happy that she got to see something so beautiful.
