Ben and Sam were brothers. They liked to play in the dark with their flashlight. They pretended they were spies and looked for clues. One night, they went to the basement to play.
"Look, I found a big box!" Ben said. He opened it and saw many old things. "Wow, this is great! There are books and toys and clothes!"
Sam came over and looked inside. He saw a shiny ball. He wanted to play with it. He reached for it, but Ben stopped him.
"No, that's mine!" Ben said. He grabbed the ball and held it tight. "You can have something else!"
Sam was angry. He wanted the ball too. He tried to take it from Ben, but Ben pushed him away. Sam fell on the floor and hit his head. He started to cry.
"Stop crying, you baby!" Ben said. He turned on the flashlight and shone it in Sam's face. "You can't have the ball! It's mine!"
Sam was hurt and scared. He wanted to get away from Ben. He kicked Ben's leg hard. Ben dropped the ball and the flashlight. The flashlight broke and the light went out. The basement was dark and quiet.
Ben and Sam were alone in the dark. They could not see anything. They could not find the stairs. They could not call for help. They were very sorry. They wished they had shared the ball and the flashlight. They wished they had been nice to each other. They wished they had not played in the dark.
