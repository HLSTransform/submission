Once upon a time there were two friends named Lucy and Molly. They both loved to run around and have fun. One day, they decided to go explore the zoo!
At the zoo, they saw a big ostrich, who ran around the enclosure. Lucy and Molly laughed and cheered as they watched the ostritch rush around.
After they left the ostrich, they went to see the monkeys. The monkeys were so happy and silly, Lucy and Molly couldn't stop laughing!
Eventually, Lucy and Molly had to leave the zoo but they had such a wonderful time. As they skipped home, they felt so happy and excited for their next adventure.
