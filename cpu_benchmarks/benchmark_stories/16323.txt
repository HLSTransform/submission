Once upon a time, there was a person named Tim. Tim was very tidy. He liked to keep his toys and room clean. One day, Tim went to the park to play with his friends. He saw a new person there. Tim asked the new person, "What is your name?" The new person said, "My name is Max." Tim and Max played together and had fun. When they were done playing, Tim said goodbye to Max and went home to tidy his room. The end.
