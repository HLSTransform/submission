Once upon a time, there was an orange vine. It grew around the house and up to the windows.
Every night, the vine went to sleep. Every morning, it woke up and went back to climbing and growing.
One day, a little bunny hopped over to the vine. She was so sleepy that she couldn't move! She decided to go to sleep right there on the orange vine.
All night long, the vine protected her, keeping her safe and warm.
In the morning, when the bunny woke up, she thanked the vine for its kindness. She hopped away and the vine waved goodbye. 
From then on, the vine and the bunny were friends and would see each other every day. They'd chat and go for walks together!
