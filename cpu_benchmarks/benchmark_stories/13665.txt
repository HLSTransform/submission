Anna loved to perform for her family. She liked to sing, dance and tell jokes. She wanted to make them happy and proud of her. One day, she decided to perform a special show for them after breakfast.
She put on her favorite dress and a hat. She took her teddy bear and a toy microphone. She went to the kitchen and saw her mom making waffles. Waffles were Anna's favorite food. She asked her mom, "Can I have a waffle, please?"
"Of course, sweetie. But first, you have to be obedient and brush your teeth. Then you can have a waffle and perform for us," her mom said.
Anna nodded and ran to the bathroom. She brushed her teeth quickly and rinsed her mouth. She came back to the kitchen and saw her dad and her brother waiting for her. They had waffles on their plates and smiles on their faces.
Anna took a waffle and put some syrup on it. She ate it with big bites. It was yummy and warm. She felt happy and ready to perform. She said, "Thank you, mom, for the waffle. Now I will perform for you. Please clap and cheer for me."
She put her teddy bear on a chair and held her toy microphone. She sang a song she learned at school. She danced and twirled. She told a joke she heard from her brother. She made her family laugh and clap. She bowed and hugged her teddy bear. She felt proud and loved. She said, "Thank you, thank you, for watching my show. I love you all very much."
Her family hugged her and praised her. They said, "You are a wonderful performer, Anna. We love you too. You made our day brighter and happier."
