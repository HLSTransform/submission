Once upon a time, there was a jolly rabbit named Benny. Benny loved to hop and play in the forest all day long. One day, Benny met a little girl named Lily. Lily was lost and scared in the forest.
Benny asked, "Are you lost, little girl?" 
Lily replied, "Yes, I am. I can't find my way home." 
Benny said, "Don't worry, I will protect you and help you find your way home. But first, let's have a meal together." 
Benny and Lily sat down and had a yummy meal of carrots and lettuce. After their meal, Benny hopped along with Lily and led her safely back to her home. Lily was so happy to have met Benny and thanked him for protecting her. From that day on, Benny and Lily became the best of friends and played together in the forest every day.
