Once upon a time, there was a big aeroplane. It was flying high in the sky. A little girl saw the aeroplane and wanted to go for a ride. She grabbed her mom's hand and said, "Mommy, can we go in the big aeroplane?" 
Her mom smiled and said"Let's go!" So the little girl and her mom went to the aeroplane. 
The pilot smiled and said, "Hi! Are you ready to go on a ride?" 
The little girl was so excited. She grabbed her mom's hand and said, "Yes, let's go!" 
So they got in the aeroplane and went up, up, up into the sky. The little girl was very happy. She saw wonderful things from up high. She saw big blue oceans and tall mountains. Soon, it was time to go down. 
The little girl grabbed her mommy's hand and said, "I had so much fun! Can we do this again?" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, anytime."
