Once there was a boy. He was three years old and he liked to play. One day he was in the living room, he saw something weird on the sofa. It was a big plastic box, with lots of different colors. The boy blinked.
He walked over to the plastic box, and he touched it. It felt funny and he could hear something moving inside. He blinked and he waited. Then, something popped out of the top of the box! 
It was a weird, blue creature. It had funny eyes and big ears. The creature blinked and the little boy blinked too. They stared at each other for a few seconds, until the creature hopped off the sofa and ran away.
The boy blinked and smiled. He had just seen something really weird and really cool. He ran to tell his family about this strange plastic creature. And that's the story of the weird plastic box!
