Once upon a time there was a little girl named Katy. She loved to explore the world around her. One day, while out walking on the street, Katy saw something she had never seen before. A sign! She was so curious that she wanted to go read it. But the sign was very high up, too high for Katy to reach. She felt helpless.
Just then, a kind old man approached her. "Do you need help?", he asked. Katy smiled and nodded, and he helped her read the sign. It said: "Welcome to Katy's street!" Katy was so happy!
The old man and Katy hugged each other, and from that day on Katy knew she could always find help when she needed it.
