Tom and Lily liked to go to the museum with Mom and Dad. They saw many things at the museum. They saw big bones of animals that lived long ago. They saw shiny rocks and colorful paintings. They saw a big train that made loud noises.
One day, they went to a new part of the museum. It was about food from different places. They saw pictures and models of food. They smelled different smells. Some smelled good, some smelled bad. They saw a sign that said "Try some spicy food". Tom and Lily were curious.
They asked Mom and Dad if they could try some spicy food. Mom and Dad said yes, but they warned them that spicy food might be too hot for them. They said they should only take a little bit and drink some water. Tom and Lily said please and thank you. They took a small piece of bread with red sauce on it. They put it in their mouths.
Tom and Lily felt a fire in their mouths. They felt their tongues and lips burn. They felt their eyes water. They felt their noses run. They spit out the bread and cried. Mom and Dad gave them some water and hugged them. They said they were sorry and that spicy food was not for everyone.
Tom and Lily learned that spicy food was not for them. They decided to stick to their favorite food, cheese and crackers. They still liked to go to the museum, but they never tried spicy food again.
