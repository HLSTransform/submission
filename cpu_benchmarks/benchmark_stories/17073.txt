Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max was very impatient. He always wanted to play, jump, and run. One day, Max was playing and running too fast. He fell and hurt his leg. Max was sad and he suffered because his leg hurt a lot.
Max's mom took him to the doctor. The doctor took an x-ray of Max's leg. The x-ray showed that Max had a little break in his leg. The doctor put a cast on Max's leg to help it get better. Max had to be patient and wait for his leg to heal.
As Max waited for his leg to get better, he learned to be more patient. He played with his toys and did not run too fast. When his leg was all better, Max remembered to be careful and not run too fast. The moral of the story is that being patient and careful can help keep us safe and happy.
