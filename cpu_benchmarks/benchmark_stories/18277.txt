Once upon a time, there was a big lion. He lived in a jungle with his friends. One day, he saw a newspaper blowing in the wind. He picked it up and looked at it. "What's this?" he asked.
"It's a newspaper," said his friend, the monkey.
"What does it do?" asked the lion.
"It tells us what's happening in the world," said the monkey.
The lion thought about it for a moment. "I want to be in the newspaper," he said. "I want to be known as the mighty lion who roars the loudest." And so, he practiced his roar every day until he was the mightiest lion in the jungle. And when a reporter came to the jungle to write a story, the lion roared so loud that it made the front page of the newspaper. From that day on, he was known as the mightiest lion in all the land.
