Lily and Tom are playing with their toys. They have many animals and cars and blocks. Lily likes to match the animals with their sounds. She picks up a lion and says "Roar!" Tom likes to match the cars with their colors. He picks up a red car and says "Vroom!"
Lily sees Tom's red car and wants to play with it. She says "Lily wants red car. Give Lily red car." Tom says "No, Tom wants red car. Red car is Tom's." They both pull the red car and start to cry.
Mom hears them and comes to see what is wrong. She says "Why are you crying, Lily and Tom? What is the problem?" Lily and Tom say "Red car! Red car!" Mom says "Red car is not a problem. Red car is a toy. You can share the red car and play together. Or you can find another toy to match. Look, there is a yellow car and a blue car. And there is a monkey and a zebra. You can match them too."
Lily and Tom stop crying and look at the other toys. They see that there are many toys to match and play with. They say "Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Lily. Sorry, Tom." They hug each other and Mom. They pick up the yellow car and the monkey and say "Beep! Ooh-ooh!" They pick up the blue car and the zebra and say "Honk! Neigh!" They smile and laugh and have fun.
Mom says "That's better. I'm glad you are sharing and matching and playing nicely. It is a hot day today. Do you want some ice cream?" Lily and Tom say "Yes, please! Ice cream! Ice cream!" They run to the kitchen and Mom follows them. They match their ice cream with their spoons and say "Yum! Yum!" They are happy.
