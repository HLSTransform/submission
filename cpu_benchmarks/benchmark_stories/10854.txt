Once upon a time, there was a pretty little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and draw pretty pictures. One day, her parent told her not to pour water from the big jug in the kitchen. But Lily didn't listen and poured the water all over the floor.
Her parent was very angry and scolded her. Lily felt sad and promised to never pour water again. But one day, when her parent was not looking, Lily poured water again. This time, she slipped on the wet floor and hurt herself badly.
The moral of the story is that we should always listen to our parents and not do things we are told not to do, or else we might get hurt.
