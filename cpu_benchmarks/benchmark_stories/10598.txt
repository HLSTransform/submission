Once upon a time, there was a black buckle. It had a very important job. It kept pants from falling down. The buckle worked hard every day. 
One day, the black buckle was tired from all of its hard work. So, it decided to quit. It had worked too hard for too long and just wanted to take a break. 
The pants were very upset without their special buckle. They did not understand why it had quit. It was the only buckle that could keep them up.
Just when they thought all hope was lost, a brave new buckle stepped in to help out. It was a sparkly green buckle and it was ready to do its job. All of the pants were really happy to have the green buckle around.
The green buckle worked hard to keep the pants up. It was determined to never quit on its special job. All of the pants lived happily ever after.
