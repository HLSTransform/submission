Once there was a boy who always wanted to do what was best. He had an idea to make everyone happy. He suggested that everyone should share their toys. Everyone seemed to like the idea and even smiled. 
But then, one day when it was really hot, the boy wanted to play with all the toys by himself, in the shade. He wanted to keep the toys all to himself. So, he told everyone that they couldn't have their toys anymore.
The other kids got angry, and no longer wanted to be nice to the boy. They were very sad and it turned out that his suggestion made everyone feel worse.
The moral of the story is to always think carefully before suggesting something. Even if your idea is a good one, it can make people unhappy if you don't think carefully.
