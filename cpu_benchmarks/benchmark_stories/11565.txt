One day, a cat named Tom went to the store. He had a long list of things to buy. On the list, he had to buy milk. Tom walked a long way to the store.
At the store, Tom met a dog named Max. Max was looking at the milk too. Tom said, "Hi, Max! I need to add milk to my cart." Max said, "Me too, Tom! Let's get milk together."
Tom and Max got the milk and put it in their carts. They were happy to have milk for their homes. They walked the long way back together, talking and laughing. Tom and Max became good friends.
