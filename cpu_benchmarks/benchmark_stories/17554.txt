Anna and Ben liked to play in the swamp near their house. They liked to look for frogs and bugs and make mud pies. Sometimes they saw a big green alligator that lived in the swamp. They were not afraid of him, because he was always calm and never bothered them.
One day, Anna and Ben found a big brown box in the swamp. They wondered what was inside. They opened the box and saw a lot of letters and cards and pictures. They were very curious. They decided to mail some of the letters and cards and pictures to their friends and family.
They took the box to their house and asked their mom for some stamps and envelopes. Their mom was surprised and asked them where they got the box. They told her they found it in the swamp. Their mom looked worried and told them to wait a minute. She called someone on the phone and said something about a missing mail truck and a reward.
Soon, a man came to their house. He was wearing a blue uniform and a hat. He said he was a mailman and he was looking for his mail truck. He said he had an accident and his mail truck fell into the swamp. He was very happy to see the box and thanked Anna and Ben for finding it. He gave them a hug and a smile and a sticker. He said they were very brave and smart and kind.
Anna and Ben were proud and happy. They helped the mailman and made him happy. They also learned something new. They learned that mail is not just something you get, but something you send. They learned that mail can make people happy and connected. They learned that mail is important and valuable. They decided to mail some letters and cards and pictures to their friends and family another day. They also decided to visit the swamp and the alligator again. They hoped he was still calm and friendly. They liked the swamp and the mail and the alligator. They liked to play and learn and help. They liked to be Anna and Ben.
