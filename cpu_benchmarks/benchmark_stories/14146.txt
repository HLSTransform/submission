Once upon a time, there was a happy family. They loved each other very much. Mama had a very special idea. She suggested a surprise for Papa. Mama had a smile on her face, but Papa was very impatient. He was not sure about the surprise.
The next day, the family gathered together in the backyard. They were all so excited. Papa looked very curious. Mama smiled and gave Papa a big hug. Suddenly, Papa saw something that made him even more impatient. It was a big tree!
Mama had suggested that they grow a tree in the backyard. She thought it would be nice to watch it grow over time. For now, Papa was not very happy but he knew deep down that it was a good idea.
The family smiled as they watched the small sapling grow over the following months. Soon it was tall and strong. Papa couldn't help but smile with pride. He was glad that he had listened to Mama's suggestion and grown the surprise tree.
