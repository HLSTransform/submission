Tom and Jen are friends. They like to swim in the pool. They have fun in the water. They splash and kick and zoom.
One day, a new kid comes to the pool. His name is Max. He has a big floaty. He says he can swim faster than Tom and Jen. He says he can zoom more than them.
Tom and Jen do not like Max. He is mean and loud. He takes up a lot of space in the pool. He bumps into them with his floaty. He laughs at them.
Tom and Jen want to show Max that they can swim and zoom too. They challenge him to a race. They say they will swim from one end of the pool to the other. They say the first one to touch the wall wins.
Max agrees. He thinks he will win easily. He says his floaty is normal and not cheating. He says Tom and Jen are slow and silly.
They get ready to swim. They say "go" and start to move. Tom and Jen swim hard. They use their arms and legs. They zoom through the water. Max tries to catch up. He pushes his floaty. He makes waves. He yells.
But Tom and Jen are faster. They reach the wall first. They touch it together. They win the race. They cheer and hug. They are happy and proud.
Max is angry and sad. He loses the race. He says it is not fair. He says his floaty is broken. He says Tom and Jen cheated. He cries and pouts.
Tom and Jen do not care. They ignore Max. They swim and zoom some more. They have fun in the pool. They are friends.
