Once upon a time, there were two furry friends, one was a dog and one was a cat. They were playing in the sunny park and having lots of fun. But then, they saw something square and shiny in the grass. They both wanted to have it, and started to fight over it. They were both so strong that neither one of them could win.
Finally, their mommy came to the park. When she saw them, she said, "No fighting!" The two furry friends stopped fighting and started to look sad and puppy-dog-eyed. Mommy saw how sad they looked, so she said that they could both have the square thing. When they heard that they were so happy they jumped and wagged their tails and yipped with joy. 
From then on, the two furry friends shared everything and were always friends.
