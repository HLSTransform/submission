Once upon a time, a girl named Judy wanted to explore the underground. She grabbed her flashlight and found a big, thick door. Judy knocked on the door and a voice said, "Who's there?".
"It's Judy", replied the girl.
"Come in," said the voice.
So Judy opened the big, thick door and went inside. She was amazed by what she sawâ€”rows and rows of shelves filled with books.
"What do you want here, Judy?" asked the voice.
"I just wanted to explore the underground," replied Judy.
"Well, grab a book off one of the shelves and start reading," said the voice.
So Judy grabbed a book and started to explore the underground through the words written on its pages. She was so excited that she stayed there for the whole day, learning about all sorts of amazing things.
