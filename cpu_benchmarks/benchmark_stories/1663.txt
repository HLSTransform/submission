Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. They would run and jump and laugh together. One day, Timmy's mom came outside and said it was time for Timmy to come inside and eat lunch. 
Timmy didn't want to stop playing, but his mom said it was important to eat. Timmy's friends said goodbye and went home. Timmy's mom made him a sandwich and taught him how to make one too. Timmy was happy to learn something new. 
After lunch, Timmy went back outside to play. But then, he saw a big dog that he didn't know. The dog barked and ran towards him. Timmy was scared and ran away. The dog didn't hurt him, but it disturbed him. Timmy's mom came outside and saw what happened. She made sure Timmy was okay and told him it's important to be careful around dogs he doesn't know. 
From that day on, Timmy was more careful when playing outside. He remembered what his mom taught him and didn't want to get hurt or disturbed again.
