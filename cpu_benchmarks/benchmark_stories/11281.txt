Once upon a time there was a family who had a cupboard. It was very filthy and they wanted to clean it. The dad decided to add water and soap to the cupboard. He worked hard for hours, but it was no use. The cupboard stayed filthy. The family was sad. They tried again the next day, but the cupboard remained filthy no matter how much they added to it. They just could not clean it. In the end, the cupboard stayed permanently filthy and they had to live with it.
