Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Daisy. Daisy had a pink dress, blue eyes and long hair. Lily took Daisy everywhere with her.
One day, Lily and her mom went to visit her grandma. Grandma lived in a big house with a fireplace. Lily liked to sit by the fire and listen to grandma's stories. She put Daisy on a chair next to her.
But Lily did not see that Daisy was too close to the fire. The fire was hot and made smoke. The smoke went up and touched Daisy's hair. Daisy's hair started to burn.
Lily smelled something bad. She looked at Daisy and saw the fire. She screamed and ran to Daisy. She grabbed Daisy and tried to put out the fire. But Daisy's hair was gone. Daisy looked different and ugly.
Lily was very sad and scared. She hugged Daisy and cried. She wished Daisy could be the same as before. She prayed to God to help Daisy. She said, "Please, God, make Daisy's hair grow back. Please, God, make Daisy pretty again. Please, God, I love Daisy so much."
Mom and grandma heard Lily's scream and came to see what happened. They saw Lily and Daisy and the smoke. They felt sorry for Lily and Daisy. They hugged Lily and told her they loved her. They told her it was an accident and not her fault. They told her Daisy was still her doll and still loved her. They told her they would try to find a new dress and a new wig for Daisy.
Lily stopped crying and looked at Daisy. She saw that Daisy still had blue eyes and a smile. She saw that Daisy was still her friend and still ordinary. She thanked God for saving Daisy. She thanked mom and grandma for helping Daisy. She said, "I'm sorry, Daisy, for hurting you. I'm glad you're still here. You're still my favorite doll."
