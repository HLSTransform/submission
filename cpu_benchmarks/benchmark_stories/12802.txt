The little girl sat in her chair with a big smile on her face. She was excited to see her tutor. She waited and waited. Then she heard a knock on the door. She quickly ran to answer it.
When she opened the door, she saw a lady with her arms full of books. She was wearing a bright smile, even though her clothes were a bit filthy. The little girl was excited to get started with her first lesson.
The tutor opened her books and asked the little girl to sit. The little girl sat down in her chair and was ready to learn. The tutor taught her lots and lots of exciting new things.
They worked together for hours and the little girl enjoyed every minute. She couldn't believe how much she learned with her tutor. The little girl thanked her tutor for all her hard work and gave her a big hug goodbye. The tutor left with a smile, happy to help the little girl learn.
