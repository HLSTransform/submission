Once upon a time there was a family who wanted to go to the park. They were all very excited. They packed their lunch and counted what they had. There were five sandwiches. Everyone was very pleased.
When they arrived it was fun. They played and ran and did a lot of exciting things. They even counted to twenty together!
When it was time for lunch, they each had a sandwich and found a place to sit. Everyone was so happy and proud that they could count to twenty and still have five sandwiches left.
After they finished lunch, they ran around some more and counted to thirty five. They were so excited to be together and spend the day counting and enjoying the park!
