Tom and Sue like to play with their toy cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They drive them on the floor, on the table, and on the porch. They make sounds like vroom, beep, and honk.
One day, Tom sees a new car in Sue's hand. It is big and red and shiny. It has four big wheels and a loud horn. Tom wants to play with it. He asks Sue, "Can I have your car?"
Sue says, "No, this is my car. I got it from Grandma. It is tough and fast and fun. You have your own cars."
Tom feels angry. He thinks Sue is not nice. He wants to take her car. He waits until Sue is not looking. Then he grabs her car and runs away.
Sue sees Tom with her car. She feels sad and mad. She shouts, "Tom, give me back my car! That is not fair!"
She chases Tom around the house. They run and bump and yell. They knock over chairs and lamps and books. They make a big mess.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to see what is wrong. She sees Tom and Sue with the car. She sees the mess. She feels unhappy. She says, "Tom and Sue, what are you doing? Why are you fighting over a car? Why are you making a mess?"
Tom and Sue stop and look at Mom. They feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were playing with the car. Tom wanted it and Sue did not want to share. We were not nice to each other."
Mom says, "I understand. But you have to learn to share and be kind. The car is a gift from Grandma. She loves you both. She wants you to enjoy it together. How about you take turns driving it? And how about you help me clean up the mess?"
Tom and Sue nod. They say, "OK, Mom. We will share and be kind. We will help you clean up. We love you and Grandma."
Mom smiles. She says, "I love you too. Now, let's go to the porch and drive the car. It is a beautiful day."
