Once upon a time there was a big strong bear. He was brave and liked to dare other animals to do silly things.
One day he dared a rabbit to jump into a big pond in the middle of spring. The rabbit was so scared and kept saying, "No! No!"
But the bear kept saying, "Go ahead and jump, don't be scared!"
Finally the rabbit decided to be brave and took a big jump. He jumped high and far, into the pond.
When he got out of the pond he was really wet and cold. The bear said, "Now do you see why I dared you? It isn't so bad, is it?" 
The rabbit agreed, and then the bear said, "Now if you do something even more daring I'll give you something special."
The rabbit thought for a moment, and then said, "Dare me to go into the expensive store and get something from it?"
The bear said, "Ok, that is daring! Go get something special for yourself if you can."
The rabbit hopped off and went to the expensive store. He got something special, and the bear was so proud of him. He gave the rabbit a special reward, and from then on the rabbit was not scared to dare himself to do new things.
