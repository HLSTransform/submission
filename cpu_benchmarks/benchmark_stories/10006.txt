Once upon a time, there was a goat named Billy. Billy was very adventurous and loved to explore the fields. One day, Billy met a funny friend who made him laugh. They played together and had so much fun. 
As they were playing, they saw a big hill. Billy wanted to climb it, but he was scared. His friend encouraged him and they climbed the hill together. When they reached the top, they saw a beautiful view and laughed with joy. 
From that day on, Billy and his friend went on many adventures together. They laughed and played and had the best time ever. Billy was so happy to have a friend who was just as adventurous as he was.
