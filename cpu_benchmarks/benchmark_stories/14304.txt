Once there was a clever little girl named Lily. Lily loved to help her mom with cleaning the house. One day, her mom said that Lily could use the mop to help clean the floor.
Lily separated the mop into pieces, the handle and the cloth part. She carefully pushed the mop around the room, making the floor sparkle!
Lily was so proud of her work. She was so clever that her mom was amazed. That night, when Lily went to bed, she was very happy with her job of helping her mom clean.
