Once there was an elderly man who lived on his own. Every day he would go to his mailbox  to see if he got some mail. But today, nothing was there. He missed having mail but that was ok.
Then a little three year old boy came along. He was called Bobby and he had a lot of toys. He waved hello to the man and asked him why he was there.
The old man said he was waiting for mail, but he didn't have any today. Bobby felt sorry for the man and asked if he could help.
The old man smiled and said yes. So Bobby went to his house to get his toy mail truck. He loaded it up with some letters, pictures and cards for the old man.
When Bobby came back, the old man's face was full of joy. He thanked Bobby for his kindness and told him that he would never miss having mail ever again.
