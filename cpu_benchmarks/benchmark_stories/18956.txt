Once upon a time, there was a little white dog named Sleepy. Sleepy was very sleepy all the time. He liked to take naps under the big tree in the yard.
One day, Sleepy saw a little red ball in the grass. He wanted to play with it, so he jumped up and ran to get it. He picked up the ball with his mouth and started to run around the yard.
Sleepy's friend, a little girl named Lily, came to watch him play. She clapped her hands and laughed as Sleepy ran with the ball. Sleepy was so happy to have Lily watch him play.
After a while, Sleepy started to feel very sleepy again. He dropped the ball and went back to the big tree. He lay down under the tree and closed his eyes.
Lily knew Sleepy was tired, so she sat down next to him. They both took a nap under the big tree, and when they woke up, they played with the red ball again. Sleepy and Lily were the best of friends.
