Once upon a time there was a little girl called Cate. She was 3 years old, and very curious. One day, she asked her mom if she could go to the temple. Her mom said, "Yes, you can go, but you must be careful!"
So Cate went to the temple. When she arrived, she was very confused. She didn't know why she was there. Then she spotted a big door. She asked her mom if she could open it, but her mom said no. She said it was not permitted.
Cate was very disappointed, but she understood. She and her mom looked around the temple and saw many beautiful things, and Cate learned a lot.
Finally, Cate and her mom left the temple. Cate was sad that she didn't get to open the big door, but she was also happy to have had the opportunity to visit the temple.
