Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside in the yard. One day, he saw a lizard on the ground. The lizard was green and had a long tail. Timmy thought it was cool.
But then, Timmy saw that the ground was icy. He didn't want the lizard to get cold, so he picked it up and put it in his pocket. When Timmy went inside, his mom asked him what he had in his pocket. Timmy didn't want to tell a lie, so he showed her the lizard. His mom smiled and said it was a nice lizard. 
Timmy took the lizard back outside and let it go. He watched it run away and felt happy that he helped it stay warm. From then on, Timmy always looked out for the animals in his yard, even when it was icy outside.
