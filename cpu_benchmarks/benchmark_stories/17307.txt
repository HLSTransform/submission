Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a friend named Max who was very tall. One day, Lily and Max decided to climb a high tree in the park. When they got to the top, they saw that they were very thirsty. Luckily, Lily had brought a water bottle to supply them with water. They drank the water and felt much better. From that day on, they always brought a water bottle with them when they climbed the high tree. They were happy to have each other as friends and to always be prepared with a supply of water.
