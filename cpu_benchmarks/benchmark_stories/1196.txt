Once upon a time, there was a family of bears who lived in the woods. They were a unique family because they all had different colored fur. Mama bear had brown fur, Papa bear had black fur, and Baby bear had white fur.
One day, Mama bear decided to make some delicious porridge for breakfast. She cooked it in three different bowls, one for each bear. But the porridge was too hot, so the bears went for a walk in the woods while it cooled down.
As they walked, they met a little girl named Goldilocks. She was lost and hungry, so the bears invited her to try their porridge. Baby bear's porridge was just right for her, so she ate it all up.
But when the bears came back, they saw that someone had been in their house. Mama bear noticed that her porridge had been tasted, Papa bear saw that his chair had been sat on, and Baby bear saw that his bed had been slept in. Suddenly, they heard a noise in Baby bear's room.
"Who's there?" asked Papa bear.
"It's me, Goldilocks," said the little girl. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bite your porridge."
The bears forgave Goldilocks and they all became friends. From that day on, they had many adventures together in the woods.
