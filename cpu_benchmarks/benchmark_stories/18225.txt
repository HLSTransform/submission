Once upon a time, there was a family with a mom, a dad, a big sister, and a little brother. They lived in a small house with a big tree in the yard. The family was broken because they didn't talk to each other. They were always sad and didn't play together.
One day, the big sister said, "I want to solve this problem. Let's talk and play together." The little brother said, "Yes, I want to be happy." So, they went to their mom and dad and asked them to join them.
The family started to talk and play together. They laughed and had fun. The broken family became happy again. They learned that talking and playing together can solve problems and make everyone happy. And they lived happily ever after.
