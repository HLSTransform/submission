Mama was busy in the kitchen. She was cooking something in the pan. The room smelled yummy. Then, she opened the fridge and took out something.
Mama said, "Little one, I am making lunch for you. Are you hungry?"
Little one smiled and said, "Yes, Mama!"
Mama smiled back and kept working. Then, she put the food on the table.
Little one said, "This smells so good Mama! Thank you so much!"
Mama said, "You're welcome, Little one. I'm glad you like it."
Little one smiled and ate the yummy food. Mama was happy that her hard work paid off.
