Once upon a time there was a little girl called Ella. She loved exploring, and one day she decided to go to the market with her daddy. As they arrived, Ella's eyes widened in amazement at the colourful sights and smells.
Ella spoke to her dad: “What can I do here?”
Her dad replied with a smile. “Let’s follow, and I’ll show you!”
So they went exploring the market together, looking at all the new things the market had to offer. Ella liked the sweet treats and brightly coloured fruits, and the fun games they could play. Eventually, they reached the end and Ella smiled in delight.
“Can we come back here next week?” she asked her dad.
“Yes, of course!” said her dad. “Let’s come back and explore the new things that will have arrived.”
So, every week, Ella and her dad reunited at the market to find new things.
And that was the start of Ella and her dad’s fun adventures at the market.
