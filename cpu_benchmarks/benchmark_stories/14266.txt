Once there was a brave little girl who wanted to make a beautiful blanket. She went to the yarn store and bought some red yarn. She was very excited and wanted to get started right away. 
When she got home, she laid out the yarn and began to polish it so it would look really nice. As she polished, the yarn started to get smoother and shinier. It was looking really pretty and she was so proud of her work. 
Suddenly, there was a loud crash! The yarn had tangled up in a big mess. The little girl was so disappointed. She was brave and tried to untangle the yarn but it was too hard. 
The little girl started to cry. She had worked so hard to make the blanket but it was ruined. There was no way she could fix it now. 
Sad and disappointed, the little girl gathered up the tangled yarn and went home. She would never get to make her beautiful blanket.
