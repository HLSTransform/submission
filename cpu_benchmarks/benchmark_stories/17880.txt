Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lucy. Lucy was three years old and loved to explore. One day, Lucy went for a walk in the park with her mom. She saw a big toy phone on the ground. She was so excited and went to pick it up. She was admiring it and looking at all the buttons. Suddenly, a big truck stopped next to Lucy and her mom. The truck was carrying a huge, big box. Lucy was so excited and started to admire the big box. Her mom gave her a big smile and Lucy felt so lucky. Then, the truck left and she and her mom kept walking. Lucy hugged her mom and kept admiring the big toy phone. They went home and she played with her toy phone for the rest of the day. They both smiled and laughed and enjoyed their special day together.
