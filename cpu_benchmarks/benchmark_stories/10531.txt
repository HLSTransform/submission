John and his mom were driving in the car. His mom had a map in her hand. John asked her why. She said “We are going on a special adventure, don’t worry.” John was glad and smiled. 
Suddenly, they stopped in the middle of a park. They got out of the car and walked around the park. His mom was looking at the map carefully. John asked her again “Where are we going?” His mom said “We are going to find a big tree, can you help me look for it?” 
John looked around and suddenly, he saw a big tree. He ran to it and shouted “Mom, I found it!” His mom was smiling and said “Let’s rest here for a while and enjoy the view.” So they sat together under the tree and looked around, enjoying the beautiful nature. John was very glad and happy. 
The sun started to set and John said to his mom “Can we come back here another day?” His mom smiled and said “Of course, we can. Now it's time for us to go home.” 
John was looking forward to coming back to this special place. He was glad to have found this special place and he knew that he would come back again soon.
