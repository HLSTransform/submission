Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved going to the mall with his mom. They went there every week. It was their regular thing to do.
One day, as they were walking around, Timmy saw a big toy car. He wanted it so badly. He said to his mom, "Mommy, can I have that car? Please!" His mom said, "No, Timmy. We can't buy that today. Maybe next time."
Timmy was sad. He leaned on his mom's leg and said, "But I really want it." His mom hugged him and said, "I know, Timmy. But we have to be responsible with our money."
Timmy understood and they continued their walk around the mall. Even though he didn't get the toy car, he was happy to spend time with his mom.
