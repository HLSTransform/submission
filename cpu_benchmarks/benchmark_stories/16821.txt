Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily was playing with her toys. Suddenly, her mommy came in and said, "Lily, it's time to pick up your toys and clean your room."
Lily replied, "Okay mommy, I will pick up my toys." She started to put her toys in the toy box. Then, she saw her tablet on the floor. She said, "Oh no! I forgot to put my tablet on the shelf." 
Her mommy said, "That's okay, Lily. You can pick it up and put it on the shelf." Lily picked up her tablet and opened the screen. She saw that her favorite game was still open. She smiled and said, "Yay! My game is still here." Then, she put her tablet on the shelf and finished cleaning her room.
