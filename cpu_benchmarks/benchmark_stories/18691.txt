Once upon a time, there was a man who worked in a coal mine. He had no hair on his head, which made him bald. One day, he found a shiny rock in the coal. He was so happy and wanted to reveal it to everyone. 
He ran out of the mine and showed the rock to his friends. They were amazed and asked him where he found it. The man told them that he found it in the coal. 
After that day, people started looking for shiny rocks in the coal mine. They found many beautiful stones and the man with no hair on his head became famous for revealing the secret of the coal mine.
