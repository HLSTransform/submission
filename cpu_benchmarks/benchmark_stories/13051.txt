Jimmy was a little boy with big blue eyes. He loved being outside and playing with his friends. He especially loved to hang from the old tree in the backyard.
One day it started to rain, so Jimmy decided to stay inside. He found an old blue blanket and hung it on the wall. He liked the way the blue matched the rest of the room.
Suddenly, there was a knocking at the door. It was Jimmy's friend! They had been stuck out in the rain, so Jimmy showed them compassion and invited them inside. He hung the old blue blanket up around his friend's shoulders and then went off to find them a warm cup of cocoa.
After his friend left, Jimmy hung the blanket back up on the wall. He was so glad he had been able to show compassion to his friend in need. It made him feel warm and happy inside.
