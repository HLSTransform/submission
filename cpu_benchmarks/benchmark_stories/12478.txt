Lily and Sam went to the beach with Mom and Dad. They liked the sand and the water. They made a big castle with a bucket and a shovel. They put shells and stones on it.
"Look at our castle!" Lily said. "It is so pretty!"
"It is the best castle ever!" Sam said. "Can we touch it?"
Mom and Dad smiled. "Yes, you can touch it. But be careful, don't break it."
Lily and Sam touched the castle gently. They felt the sand and the shells. They were happy.
Then they heard a loud noise. It was a big wave. It came to the shore and washed away the castle.
"Oh no!" Lily and Sam cried. "Our castle is gone!"
Mom and Dad hugged them. "It's okay, don't be sad. The wave took your castle, but it gave you a new one. Look, there are more shells and stones on the sand. You can make another castle, or something else."
Lily and Sam looked at the sand. They saw the new shells and stones. They dried their tears. They smiled.
"Okay, let's make something else!" Lily said.
"Maybe a boat, or a fish, or a star!" Sam said.
They took their bucket and shovel and started to make something else. They had fun at the beach.
