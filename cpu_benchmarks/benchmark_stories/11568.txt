Once upon a time, there was a helpful cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to play with her best friend, a little boy named Timmy. They liked to play outside in the sun and have fun together.
One day, while they were playing, Timmy tripped and had a fall. He started to cry because it hurt. Kitty ran to him and asked, "Are you okay, Timmy?" Timmy said, "I fell and it hurts." Kitty wanted to help her friend feel better, so they sat down to discuss what to do.
Kitty and Timmy talked about how to make the hurt go away. They decided to go ask Timmy's mom for a band-aid. Timmy's mom gave him a band-aid and a hug, and he felt much better. Timmy and Kitty went back outside to play, happy that they solved the problem together.
