In the summer there was a little girl named Kayla who loved to go to the creek. She would take her bucket and her shovel and go searching for treasure.
One day, when she was at the creek, she saw something very cute. It was a little duck swimming in the water. Kayla thought: "How cute!"
She wanted to play with the duck, so she reached out to try and catch it. But it was too fast! So she just watched it swim around.
Kayla wanted to help the duck, so she went back home and prayed. Then she came up with an idea: She would ask her mom for some breadcrumbs so that she could put it in the creek.
So the next day, she went back to the creek with a full bag of breadcrumbs. She sprinkled them beside the water and sure enough, the little duck came for them.
The duck ate all the breadcrumbs and it was so cute that Kayla couldn't stop staring. Then, when the duck was done, it looked at Kayla and then flew away.
Kayla always remembered that special moment and how she had helped the little duck by praying.
