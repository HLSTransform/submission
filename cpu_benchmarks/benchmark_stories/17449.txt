Lily and Sam are friends. They like to play outside. Lily has a bicycle. Sam does not have a bicycle. He wants to learn how to ride one.
One day, Lily says to Sam, "Do you want to try my bicycle? I can help you."
Sam says, "Yes, please. I want to learn. But I am scared. What if I fall?"
Lily says, "Don't be scared. I will hold your bicycle. You just have to pedal and balance. It is fun. You can do it. You are tough."
Sam says, "Okay. I will try. You are a good friend."
Lily and Sam walk to the park. Lily gives Sam her bicycle. She holds the back of the bicycle. Sam sits on the seat. He puts his feet on the pedals. He starts to pedal slowly. Lily runs with him.
"Good job, Sam. You are doing great. Pedal faster. I will let go soon. You can ride by yourself."
Sam pedals faster. He feels the wind on his face. He smiles. He likes the bicycle. He says, "I am riding. I am riding. This is fun. Thank you, Lily."
Lily lets go of the bicycle. She claps her hands. She says, "You are riding. You are riding. You are amazing. I am proud of you."
Sam rides the bicycle for a while. He turns around. He comes back to Lily. He stops the bicycle. He jumps off the seat. He hugs Lily. He says, "You are the best friend ever. You helped me learn. You are tough and kind. Can we play more?"
Lily says, "Yes, we can play more. We can take turns on the bicycle. We can race. We can have fun. We are friends."
Lily and Sam laugh. They play with the bicycle. They have fun. They are friends.
