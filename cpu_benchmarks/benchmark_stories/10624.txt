Once there was a worm named Mark. He was very healthy and happy. He lived in a warm, dry area and was always looking for something fun to do.
One day Mark was feeling adventurous so he decided to explore. He went up and down some hills, went through some tall grass, and then he came upon a pond. He liked the pond because it was wet and cool.
He decided to take a swim, but the water was slower than he expected and soon he was thirsty. He found a spot under the sun and sat there to dry off.
But when he opened his eyes, he was surprised to find several other worms around him that were also drying off in the sun. He had made some new friends!
They all talked and laughed in the sun together, and when they were all dry they waved goodbye and went off on their way. Mark was very happy that he made some healthy new friends and was sure he'd see them again someday.
