Tom and Mia are twins. They like to play in the kitchen. One day, they see a big knife on the table. It is shiny and sharp.
"Look, a knife!" Tom says. "I want to touch it."
"No, Tom, no!" Mia says. "Mama says knives are bad. They can hurt you. Put it down."
But Tom does not listen. He picks up the knife and holds it in his hand. He feels the edge. It is very sharp. He cuts his finger. He drops the knife and cries.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tom says. "It hurts, it hurts!"
Mia runs to him and hugs him. She sees blood on his finger. She is scared.
"Mama, mama!" Mia shouts. "Tom is hurt! He cut his finger with the knife!"
Mama hears Mia and comes to the kitchen. She sees Tom and Mia and the knife and the blood. She is angry.
"Tom, what did you do?" Mama says. "You know you are not supposed to touch knives. They are dangerous. You could have hurt yourself badly."
She takes Tom to the sink and washes his finger. She puts a band-aid on it. She gives him a kiss and a hug.
"I'm sorry, mama," Tom says. "I was curious. I wanted to see the knife."
"I know, Tom, but you have to be careful," Mama says. "Knives are not toys. They are for grown-ups only. Next time, ask me before you touch anything sharp."
"OK, mama," Tom says.
Mama looks at Mia and smiles.
"Thank you, Mia, for being a good sister," Mama says. "You tried to stop Tom and you called me for help. You are very brave and smart."
Mia smiles back.
"You're welcome, mama," Mia says. "I love Tom and I don't want him to get hurt."
Mama hugs them both.
"I love you both, too," Mama says. "Now, how about we have some ice cream from the fridge? That will make you feel better."
Tom and Mia nod and smile. They follow Mama to the fridge. They forget about the knife and the blood. They are happy.
