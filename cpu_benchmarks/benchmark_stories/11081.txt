One day, a farmer was working in his field. He had a big red tractor that he used to plow the soil and plant seeds. He liked his tractor very much and took good care of it.
But as he was driving his tractor, he heard a loud bang. He looked behind him and saw that one of his wheels had broken. He stopped the tractor and got off. He was very sad and worried. How could he fix his wheel? How could he finish his work?
He saw a little boy walking by the road. The boy had a blue hat and a yellow shirt. He was curious and came closer to the farmer.
"Hello, mister. What happened to your tractor?" the boy asked.
"Hello, little one. My tractor is broken. One of my wheels broke and I don't know what to do," the farmer said.
"That's too bad. Do you have a spare wheel?" the boy asked.
"No, I don't. I left it at home. And home is very far from here," the farmer said.
"Maybe I can help you. I have a bike. I can ride it to your home and bring your spare wheel back. It's not dark yet and I know the way," the boy said.
"Really? You would do that for me? That's very kind of you. Thank you, little one. You are a good friend," the farmer said.
The boy smiled and nodded. He got on his bike and rode away. The farmer waited for him and hoped he would come back soon.
After a while, the boy returned with the spare wheel. He helped the farmer to change the wheel and fix the tractor. The farmer was very happy and grateful. He gave the boy a hug and a big apple.
"Thank you, little one. You saved my day. You are very brave and smart. I'm glad I met you," the farmer said.
"You're welcome, mister. I'm glad I could help you. You have a nice tractor and a nice field. I hope you have a good harvest," the boy said.
They waved goodbye and the boy rode away. The farmer got on his tractor and finished his work. He looked at the sky and saw the stars. He thanked them for sending him a good friend. He felt very lucky and happy.
