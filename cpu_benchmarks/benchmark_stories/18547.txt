Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and run around. One day, she was playing with her friend when she fell down and hurt her muscle. It was very sore and she couldn't move her arm.
Her friend asked, "Are you okay, Lily?"
Lily replied, "No, my muscle hurts. It's very soft."
Her friend helped her lay down on the grass and brought her a soft blanket to make her feel better. Lily felt much better and thanked her friend for being so kind. From that day on, Lily and her friend always took care of each other and made sure to be gentle with their muscles.
