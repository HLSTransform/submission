Once there was a strong farmer who lived on a beautiful farm. One day the farmer decided to go out and discover what was in the fields. As he went around the farm, the farmer saw a cornfield full of beautiful yellow corn.
The farmer was very happy and he shouted out, "Oh wow! I've discovered corn!"
The farmer decided that he wanted to save the corn for a special meal, so he took some back to the farmhouse.
When he got home, he showed the corn to his wife and said, "Look at what I discovered today! Isn't it beautiful?"
The wife looked at the corn and said, "It's lovely, but you should have left some for the other people who live on this farm. That way everyone can benefit from what you have discovered."
The farmer thought about his wife's words and decided that she was right. So he took some of the corn back to the field and left it for the other people to enjoy.
This story teaches us that it is important to share what we have with others. Being strong means being generous and always thinking of others.
