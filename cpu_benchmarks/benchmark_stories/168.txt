Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her pink ball. One day, Lily went for a walk in the park. She saw a charming butterfly and tried to catch it, but it flew away. 
Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. It was a car that zoomed past her. Lily was scared and ran to hide behind a tree. She peeked through the branches and saw a dog running after the car. 
Lily felt sad for the dog, so she called him over. The dog was friendly and licked her face. Lily petted him and they became friends. From that day on, Lily and the dog played together in the park every day. They would chase after the pink ball and sometimes even try to catch the charming butterfly.
