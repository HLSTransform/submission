Once upon a time there was a brave girl named Ella who loved to swing in her garden. Everyday Ella would go outside to swing on her swing. She would swing so high in the air! One day, while Ella was swinging, she saw something strange. There was a thief in her garden trying to take her toys!
Ella stopped to take a closer look and she decided to talk to the thief. She asked him, "Hey! What are you doing in my garden?". The thief replied, "I'm just trying to take a few toys. It's very easy."
Ella smiled and said, "No! Toys are not for taking. You can swing on my swing though. It's very fun!" The thief thought about it for a moment and then decided to swing on the swing. Ella smiled from seeing the thief swing so happily.
