Once upon a time, there was a small boy called Colin. He was only three years old, but he loved to explore. Colin went outside to play one day and he saw a big, rough barrel in the garden. He wanted to see what was inside so he gave it a push. Suddenly, a creature jumped out! It was a dragon! “Oh no!” Colin said.
The dragon said, “Don't be scared Colin. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to protect you!” Colin felt much better when he heard the dragon's kind words. The dragon said, “Come, let me show you something.”
The dragon took Colin to a secret cave. Inside the cave were many treasures! The dragon said, “These treasures will help protect you, but you must also be careful Colin. Now, let's go home.”
So the dragon and Colin went back to Colin's house, and the dragon said goodbye. From that day on, Colin was always careful to look after his treasures, and he made sure the rough barrel was always safe from harm.
