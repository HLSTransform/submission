Once upon a time, there was a creative boy called Jack. Jack loved to play with his toys and make new things. He imagined he was a king and all of his toys were his royal subjects.
One day, Jack went to a meeting with his mommy. He thought the meeting was going to be fun and exciting, but there were a lot of grown-ups talking. Jack didn't understand what they were saying.
Jack started to feel small and scared. Then he had a bright idea. He whispered to his mommy, "Let's play games at the meeting". 
His mommy smiled. "That's a great idea, Jack. Let's see if the grown-ups want to join us". Jack was excited.
Jack asked the grown-ups, "Can we play games at the meeting?" They all nodded and smiled. So, they played fun and creative games together. Everybody was laughing and enjoying themselves. 
At the end, everyone was happy. Jack's mommy said, "You are so brave and creative, Jack!"
