Once upon a time there was a lazy fox. He was always so lazy that he would never try to do anything. One day, he decided to move to the left side of the woods to find something to eat. As he was walking along he spotted a nut. The nut was so big and tasty, it made his mouth water.
The lazy fox tried to open the nut, but it wouldn't budge. He tried and tried but he was too lazy to put any effort in. He decided to give up and said, "Oh well, I guess I can't have this nut". 
Just then, a wise old owl flew overhead. He noticed the poor fox and said, "I can help you open that nut if you try one more time". The fox looked up at the owl but shook his head and replied, "No thank you, I'm much too lazy to try again". 
The owl stared down at the fox sadly and said, "Then I guess you will never get to have the nut". The fox sadly watched as the owl flew away and he never had the nut. 
The End.
