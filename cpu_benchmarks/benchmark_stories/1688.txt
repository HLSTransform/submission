Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy's mom told him that he had to clean up his toys before he could go outside. Timmy didn't want to clean up, so he asked his mom a question. "Mommy, can I please go outside now?" he said.
His mom said no, and told him that he had to follow the law of cleaning up before he could play. Timmy didn't understand what that meant, so his mom explained that it was a rule that everyone had to follow. Timmy said sorry for not knowing the rule, and started to clean up his toys.
After he finished cleaning, Timmy went outside to play. He felt happy that he followed the law and listened to his mom. From then on, he always remembered to clean up before going outside to play.
