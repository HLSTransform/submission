Today, Mom and Dad took Timmy to the forest. The sun shone brightly and Mom and Dad were excited. Timmy was not so sure. 
They wanted to record the owl in the tree, but the owl was way up high. Dad pointed to the owl and told Timmy to look. Timmy felt uncomfortable, but he smiled anyway. 
Mom and Dad pulled out a big machine and started to record. Timmy was amazed by the owl's soft hoots and he smiled again. It was so beautiful. 
Suddenly, the owl flapped its wings and flew away. Timmy felt disappointed, but before long, it was time to go home. Dad said he would play the recording for Timmy when they got home. Timmy smiled, very happy that he could listen to the owl again.
