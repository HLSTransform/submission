Ben and Lily are playing in the park. They see a big hill with green grass. They want to go up the hill and see what is on the other side.
"Let's jump up the hill!" Ben says. He holds Lily's hand and they start to jump. They jump and jump and jump. They feel the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They laugh and have fun.
They reach the top of the hill and look around. They see a big tree with red fruits. They are hungry and want to try the fruits.
"Look, fruits!" Lily says. She runs to the tree and picks a fruit. She bites into it and makes a face. "Yuck! This fruit is sour!" She spits out the fruit and rubs her tongue.
Ben sees Lily's face and laughs. He picks a fruit and bites into it too. He also makes a face. "You are right, this fruit is sour!" He spits out the fruit and rubs his tongue too.
They look at each other and giggle. They throw the sour fruits away and run down the hill. They jump and jump and jump. They find their mom and dad and tell them about their adventure. They are happy and tired. They go home and have a sweet snack.
