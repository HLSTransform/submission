Once upon a time, there was a jolly bear named Ben. Ben lived in a small house in the woods. One day, Ben wanted to visit his friend, a rabbit named Rob, who lived far away.
Ben knew he needed a passport to see his friend. He asked his friend, a wise owl named Olly, if he could lend him a passport. Olly said yes, but told Ben to be very careful with it.
Ben was so happy and thanked Olly. He took the passport and went on his journey. Along the way, Ben saw a big river. He knew he had to cross it to see his friend, Rob. Ben was very careful not to drop the passport in the water.
When Ben reached Rob's house, they were both very happy to see each other. They played all day and had lots of fun. After a few days, it was time for Ben to go back home. He remembered to give the passport back to Olly and thanked him again for lending it.
The moral of the story is to always be careful with things that others lend you and to always say thank you.
