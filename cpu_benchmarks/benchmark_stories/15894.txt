Once upon a time, there was a girl named Emma. She had long, silky brown hair and the bluest of eyes. One day, Emma decided to play a game. She laid down flat on the ground in the garden and tried to match her shadow with the leaves. 
Suddenly, her big brother showed up and said, "Emma what foolish game are you playing? Matching your shadow with leaves? That's silly!"
Emma smiled and replied, "No it's not silly! I'm matching my shadow like it matches the leaves. See how my feet match the leaf! I'm matching my shadow!" 
Her big brother smiled and laughed. "Ok, ok Emma. But don't stay outside too long. We don't want you getting too much sun." 
Emma thanked her brother and laughed. She laid down flat on the ground and continued matching her shadow to the leaves. She was so silly and it made her big brother laugh. The sun shone countless times and the garden glowed with laughter. The end.
