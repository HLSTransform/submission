Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily decided to go on a walk with her mommy. They walked and walked until they reached a big park. 
While they were walking, Lily felt something on her shoulder. It was a disgusting bug! She didn't like bugs, so she asked her mommy to take it off. Her mommy brushed it away and they kept walking. 
After a while, they saw a big slide in the park. Lily wanted to go on it, but she was scared. Her mommy told her she should try it and that she would be there to catch her. So, Lily went up the ladder and slid down. She had so much fun! 
Finally, it was time to go home. Lily was tired from all the walking and sliding, so her mommy carried her on her shoulder. Lily felt safe and happy. They went home and had a yummy dinner together. The end.
