Once upon a time there was a happy family. Mommy, Daddy and baby all lived together. One day, Mommy said it was time for dinner. Baby was so excited because Mommy was making spaghetti. Baby said, "Yay!" 
Mommy said it was too hot for Baby to come to the kitchen, but there was a safe place at the table for Baby to wait. Baby sat down, and soon smelled the delicious spaghetti. Daddy came to the table and said, "Come family, it's time to eat!" They all had a big helping of spaghetti, and it was so yummy!
After dinner, Mommy said it was time to go to bed. Baby was tired, so they all said goodbye and went to bed. Baby dreamed of the yummy spaghetti and felt so safe snuggled up in bed.
