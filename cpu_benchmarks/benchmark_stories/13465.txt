Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to climb trees. One day, he tried to climb the biggest tree in the park. It was very tall and had lots of branches. Timmy climbed and climbed until he reached the top. He felt very proud of himself.
Suddenly, Timmy heard a loud noise. He looked down and saw a big crane. The crane was lifting heavy things and making a terrible noise. Timmy was scared because he had never seen a crane before. He climbed down the tree as fast as he could and ran home to tell his mom about the terrible noise he heard.
