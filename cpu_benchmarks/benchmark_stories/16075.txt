One day, Little Joe was playing in the park. He saw a strange man with a guitar. Little Joe wondered what he was doing. He walked up to the man and said, “What are you doing?”
The man said, “I am playing jazz. Do you want to pull the strings with me?” Little Joe smiled, humbled by the man's invitation.
Little Joe said, “Yes!” He carefully grabbed the strings and started strumming. Soon he was playing jazz music with the man. 
He looked around and saw that everyone was smiling. Little Joe couldn't believe that he was playing jazz. He was very proud. 
Little Joe said to the man, “Thank you for teaching me.” 
The man smiled and said, “You have a great future in jazz.” 
Little Joe smiled and thanked the man again. He was very happy to have found this humble man in the park. Little Joe was sure to remember this day for a long time.
