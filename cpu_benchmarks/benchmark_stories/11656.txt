Once upon a time there were two young boys. One day, they saw an old man. The old man wore a suit. The boys were curious and asked him his name. The old man said he was Mr. Number.
The boys were very excited. Mr. Number said he could teach them a special game. The boys were so excited, they ran off to get their toys.
The boys found a game called number snake. Mr. Number showed them how to play the game. He was a very good teacher.
When the game was over, Mr. Number said that he was deaf. The boys were surprised and asked him why. Mr. Number said it was from the loud noises he had heard when he was younger.
Before the sun set, the boys taught Mr. Number a special game. He smiled and thanked them for their kindness. They had a wonderful time together, and the boys forever remembered their time with Mr. Number and the special game.
