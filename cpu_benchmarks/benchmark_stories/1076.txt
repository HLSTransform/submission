Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sue. Sue was three years old. She loved to explore the world around her.
One day Sue went for a walk in the forest. She looked under rocks and around trees to see what she could find. Suddenly, Sue realized there was a big, ugly trunk at the bottom of a tree.
Sue smiled and opened the trunk. Inside she found a beautiful doll. She was so excited that she jumped for joy. She decided to take the doll home with her.
Sue hugged the doll and took it back home. She realized that the ugly trunk had been full of surprises!
