Once upon a time, there was a quiet man and a quiet woman. They both wanted to play in the garden and have some fun. So the man dug a hole with his spade and the woman chose some nice flowers to grow.
The sun was setting and the man and woman hugged each other and gave each other a big kiss. The man said, "Let's keep digging this hole, it's lots of fun" and the woman said "Yes, and let's keep planting these flowers. It's important to work together".
The sun finally set and the man and woman said good night. As they looked around the garden, it was the most beautiful sight. They had worked together to make the garden look so nice.
Moral of the story: if we work together, no matter how quiet or small we are, then we can make something beautiful.
