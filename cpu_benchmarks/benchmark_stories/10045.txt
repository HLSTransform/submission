Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play outside. They have a big yard with many trees and flowers. They think their yard is the best landscape in the world.
One day, Sara and Tom find a new toy in the yard. It is a red car with four wheels and a horn. They are very happy. They want to play with the car.
"Can I drive the car first?" Sara asks.
"No, I want to drive the car first," Tom says.
They start to argue. They both want to own the car. They do not want to share.
They do not see the big dog that is coming. The dog is hungry. He sees the car. He thinks it is a bone. He runs to the car. He bites the car. He breaks the car.
Sara and Tom stop arguing. They see the dog. They see the car. They are very sad. They cry.
The dog runs away. He does not like the car. He thinks it is a bad bone.
Sara and Tom hug each other. They are sorry. They say they are sorry.
They do not care about the car anymore. They care about their friendship. They look at their yard. They think it is still the best landscape in the world. They smile. They play. They are happy.
