Once upon a time there was a mouse who liked to jump. One day, the mouse saw a print and thought it looked fun. So, he stepped on top of it and jumped.
"Wheeee!" yelled the mouse.
The mouse then looked at the print more closely. It had strange lines on it that looked disgusting.
The mouse called out, "Hey buddy! What is this?"
A frog that was nearby spoke up. "That's a bug," croaked the frog. "It's not a good thing."
The mouse said, "Oh, yuck! I'm jumping away fast!"
So, the mouse ran away and never looked back at that disgusting bug. The end.
