Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and observe the birds in the trees. One day, she fell down and hurt her leg. Her mommy took her to the hospital.
When they arrived, Lily noticed that the hospital was big and had lots of rooms. But the room they were in was filthy! There were dirty tissues on the floor and the walls were stained.
Lily's mommy told her not to worry, because the doctor was coming soon. When the doctor arrived, he took one look at the filthy room and said, "This won't do!" He called for a cleaning crew and soon the room was sparkling clean.
Lily was happy that the doctor observed the dirty room and made it clean again. She felt much better knowing that the hospital was a clean and safe place to be. From that day on, Lily always made sure to observe her surroundings and keep them clean.
