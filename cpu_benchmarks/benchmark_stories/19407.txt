Hudson was a 3 year old boy. He lived in an igloo by the sea. Hudson liked to play, but nobody wanted to play with him.
One day, Hudson made a heavy snowman. He hoped that if he made it look nice, someone would play with him. But everyone just ignored him.
He was so sad that he wanted to run away. He thought that if he ran away with his snowman, maybe someone would play with him. So he grabbed his snowman and ran away.
But when Hudson got to the beach, he saw a lot of other kids playing. He was too shy to talk to them, so he just stood there, holding his snowman.
One of the kids noticed Hudson and asked him to play. Hudson was so happy and suddenly he felt less alone. He smiled and joined in the fun. From then on, nobody ever ignored Hudson again.
