Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He had a shiny gold toy car that he loved to play with. One day, he took his car to the park to play with his friends.
As he was playing, Timmy noticed a big dog walking towards him. The dog looked nervous and Timmy felt scared. He sighed and wanted to run away, but he didn't want to leave his toy car behind.
Suddenly, the dog started barking and Timmy's friends ran away. Timmy was left alone with the dog, feeling even more nervous. But then, the dog picked up Timmy's gold toy car in its mouth and brought it back to him. Timmy was so happy and grateful that he gave the dog a big hug. From that day on, Timmy and the dog became best friends and played together every day at the park.
