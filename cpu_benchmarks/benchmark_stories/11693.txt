Once there was a delicate flower on a big stage. Everyone in the audience loved the flower, so much so that they would all yell with joy when the flower was shown.
One day, however, a strong wind began to blow. The delicate flower was blown away from the stage, into the crowd of people. Everyone tried to grab the flower, but the wind was too strong.
The flower eventually flew out of the crowd, never to be seen again. Everyone felt very sad, and realized that sometimes even the most delicate things can be taken away from us if we don't take care of them.
Moral of the story: take care of things that are special to us, because they can be taken away in an instant.
