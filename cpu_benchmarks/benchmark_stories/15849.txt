Once upon a time there was a girl who liked to read books. Every day she took a book and sat in the garden and read. 
One day, after she had finished reading, she went to the lake to see her reflection. As she looked into the lake, she saw that the water was dirty. She thought to herself "Oh no! How can I see my reflection if the water is dirty?"
Suddenly, she saw a mirror on the ground. It was very old and had cobwebs on it, but it was still very shiny. She picked it up and looked into it.
"Wow!", she said. "This mirror looks so much better than the lake. Now I can see myself clearly!" 
She kept the mirror and took it home with her. She cleaned it up and was very happy. From that day onwards, she always liked to read and look in her mirror whenever she finished a book.
