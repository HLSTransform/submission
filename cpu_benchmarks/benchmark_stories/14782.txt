Lily and her mom went to the mall. Lily liked the mall. She saw many toys and clothes and books. She wanted to buy everything. But her mom said no. She said they only had money for food and a gift for Lily's dad.
Lily was sad and angry. She did not want to go home. She wanted to stay at the mall. She saw a big teddy bear in a store. She ran to the store and grabbed the teddy bear. She hugged it and said, "This is mine!"
Her mom followed her and said, "Lily, put that back. That is not yours. We have to pay for it. Come on, let's go."
Lily did not listen. She held the teddy bear tight and said, "No! I want it! I want it!"
A man who worked at the store came to them. He was helpful. He said, "Hello, little girl. Do you like the teddy bear? It is very soft and nice. But you know, you have to share it with other kids. There are many kids who want to play with it too. Why don't you give it back to me and I will give you a sticker?"
Lily did not like the man. She did not want to share. She did not want a sticker. She wanted the teddy bear. She screamed and kicked and bit the man. The man was hurt and angry. He said, "Ow! Stop that! You are a bad girl! You have to go now!"
He took the teddy bear from Lily and pushed her and her mom out of the store. Lily cried and cried. Her mom was sad and sorry. She said, "Lily, you did a very bad thing. You hurt the man and you stole the teddy bear. You have to say sorry and be nice. You have to learn to be good."
Lily did not say sorry. She did not want to be good. She hated the mall and the man and the teddy bear. She hated her mom and her dad and the gift. She hated everything. She stretched her arms and legs and made a big tantrum. She did not stop until they got home. She did not have any fun at the mall. She did not get any toys or clothes or books. She did not get any love or hugs or kisses. She was very unhappy. The end.
