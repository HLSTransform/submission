John's sister was very hairy. She had hair from her head all the way down to her toes. Every day, John would challenge his sister to a game. He wanted to win.
His sister always accepted the challenge. She knew that John was trying to win and wanted to prove her worth to him. The two would battle it out in the yard, running and tumbling around.
John would try his hardest to beat his sister, but she was just too fast and too cunning. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't win.
One day, John had an idea. He got a bucket full of water and put it in front of his sister. She was so fast and hairy, she couldn't stop herself in time! John had let her win the game, but he was the real winner because he had tricked her.
