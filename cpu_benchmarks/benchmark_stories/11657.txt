Once there was a girl named Jill. She was very shy and quiet. One day, she decided to go for a walk in the forest. She found a big strawberry bush and lay down to rest. She closed her eyes and fell asleep. 
When she woke up, she noticed something strange. Thousands of little strawberry creatures were singing and playing games around her. They had wings made of strawberry leaves! Jill was so surprised, but also a little scared. 
The creatures were very friendly and asked Jill if she would like to join them in a game. Jill was too shy to answer, but she tentatively stood up and soon she was playing and laughing with the little creatures. She had never felt such joy before! 
The strawberry creatures said goodbye to Jill that night and asked her to visit them again. Jill promised she would and then made her way back home. She returned every day to the strawberry bush and soon became good friends with the little creatures. She now plays with them every day and isn't shy anymore.
