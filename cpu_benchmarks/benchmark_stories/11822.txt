Mummy and Daddy had a special seat waiting for them. An invitation had come through the letterbox. It was so exciting!
Mummy and Daddy shouted, "Let's go!"
They took Grandma and Grandpa and went to the party. They saw lots of people, who were very playful. 
Grandma and Grandpa bent down to pick up two little presents, and gave them to Mummy and Daddy.
Mummy and Daddy opened their presents. Inside was a silly hat and a whistle! They laughed and laughed.
The room was full of friends and everyone had a seat. They shared stories and played games. They even danced and sang! 
Mummy, Daddy, Grandma and Grandpa were so happy and had so much fun!
