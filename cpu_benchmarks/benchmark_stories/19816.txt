Molly had spaghetti for dinner. Everything was going really well and she was really happy. But then she spilled the spaghetti on the floor and she was very frustrated.
Molly started to cry and her mom came over. She gave Molly a hug and told her it was okay. Then she cleaned up the spaghetti.
Molly still felt upset and sad. So, her mom opened her arms and Molly went over for another hug. This time, Molly didn't cry. She felt comforted by her mom's hug.
Molly and her mom stayed like that for a few minutes, until Molly felt better. Then, they hugged one last time and Molly went back to the table to finish her dinner. Now, she was happy again.
