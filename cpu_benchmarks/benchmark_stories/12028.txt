Once upon a time, there was a boy who loved baseball. He had a lot of baseballs and he would always play with them in his backyard. One day, he found a very curious plant. It was very small at first, but then it started to grow bigger and bigger. The boy was amazed! But then, something strange happened. The plant started to shrink! The boy didn't know what to do, so he decided to ask his mom for help. Together, they tried to figure out why the plant was shrinking. After a while, they realized that the plant needed more water. So, they watered the plant and it started to grow again. The boy was so happy that he could play baseball with his friends in the shade of the big plant.
