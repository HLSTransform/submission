Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to run and play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy fell down and hurt his knee. It hurt a lot and he cried.
His mom took him to the doctor who put a bandage on his knee to help it heal. Timmy felt better and was soon running and playing again.
While they were driving home, Timmy saw a big sign on the side of the road. It was called a billboard. The billboard was very tall and had a picture of a yummy cheeseburger on it.
Timmy's mom said they couldn't stop for a cheeseburger because they had to go home and make dinner. Timmy felt sad, but he knew that his mom was right. When they got home, his mom made a healthy dinner with thin slices of chicken and lots of vegetables. It was delicious!
