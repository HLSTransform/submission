John was a young boy who loved to explore. One day, he decided to search for something new. He took some of his toys and thought he could trade them for something fun.
He went to a old barn and soon found a secret compartment. Inside were many strange things that he had never seen before. John took them all and was excited to start trading.
But when he stepped out of the barn, John was frightened. Two tall men were waiting for him and asked him where he got the things. He was too scared to say anything, so they grabbed the items and ran away. John was so scared that he didn't even cry. 
John was very upset about what happened, but he learned a valuable lesson that day. He promised to always be careful when he searched for something new.
