Mummy was sewing. She had her sewing box open, with lots of different coloured thread in it. Mummy held a yellow thread in her hand. She carefully put the thread through her needle.
Mummy used her sewing machine to support the thread. She moved the material around so the thread could go through it. Mummy worked carefully.
The finished material looked beautiful. Mummy had used the yellow thread to make a pattern. She added buttons and bells to the design, which made it special.
Mummy showed her work to Daddy, who smiled and said it was very pretty.
Mummy was very happy because Daddy had supported her work. She packed up her sewing box and hugged Daddy. Then, they went off to see what else they could make with yellow thread.
