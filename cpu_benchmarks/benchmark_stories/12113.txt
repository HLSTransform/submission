Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved winter because she could make snowmen and go sledding. One day, she went outside to play in the snow. She saw her friend, Tom, and they decided to build a snowman together.
Lily and Tom rolled the snow into three big balls. They stacked them on top of each other to make the snowman. Lily found some soft sticks for the arms and a carrot for the nose. Tom found some rocks for the eyes and mouth.
As they were finishing up, Lily's mom called her inside for hot cocoa. Lily said goodbye to Tom and went inside. She was excited to drink hot cocoa, but she was sad to leave her snowman behind. When she finished her cocoa, she looked out the window and saw that it was snowing again. She decided to go back outside and play with her snowman some more.
When she got outside, she saw that her snowman had fallen over. She was sad, but then she remembered the sticks and carrot. She decided to make a new snowman and this time, she made sure to pack the snow extra tight so it wouldn't fall over again. Lily and Tom played with their snowmen all day and had lots of fun.
