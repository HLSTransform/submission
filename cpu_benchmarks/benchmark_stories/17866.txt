John had a special slide. His parents had given it to him on his birthday and he was very excited to play with it. He loved how it was so flexible.
John put the slide in his backyard in the sunshine. He grabbed his bucket and spade and started to dig in the sand. He wanted to make a special place for his slide.
He dug and dug until he made a lovely sandbox. He put the slide inside the sandbox, and then he went back to playing with his bucket and spade.
Suddenly he saw something in the sand. He pulled it out and saw it was a toy mine! It was small and flexible, so he could easily slide it around.
John decided to slide the mine up and down the slide. He slid it back and forth, faster and faster. Soon, the mine was zooming so fast, it flew right off the slide! John was laughing and having so much fun!
