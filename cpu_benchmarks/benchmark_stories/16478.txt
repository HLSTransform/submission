Sara and Ben like to play pretend. They have a big box of costumes and toys. One day, they decide to act like a king and a queen. Sara puts on a shiny dress and a crown. Ben wears a cape and a sword.
"Hello, my queen," Ben says. "How are you today?"
"I am very well, my king," Sara says. "But I am a little bored. What can we do?"
Ben thinks for a moment. He sees their elderly cat, Fluffy, sleeping on the couch. He has an idea.
"Let us go on a quest, my queen," he says. "We must find the magic jewel that can make Fluffy young again."
Sara likes the idea. She grabs a necklace from the box. "This is the magic jewel," she says. "But we have to hide it from the dragon."
They run around the house, looking for a good hiding place. They avoid the kitchen, where their mom is cooking. They avoid the bathroom, where their dad is shaving. They find a closet in their bedroom. They open the door and see a pile of blankets and pillows.
"This is perfect," Ben says. "We can make a castle here."
They go inside the closet and close the door. They arrange the blankets and pillows to make a cozy fort. They put the necklace under a pillow.
"We are safe here, my queen," Ben says. "The dragon will never find us."
They cuddle together and pretend to sleep. Fluffy wakes up and stretches. He smells something interesting. He follows his nose to the closet. He scratches the door and meows.
"What is that?" Sara says. "Is it the dragon?"
Ben peeks through a crack. He sees Fluffy's whiskers and eyes. He laughs.
"No, my queen," he says. "It is our cat. He wants to join us."
They open the door and let Fluffy in. He jumps on the pillow and finds the necklace. He plays with it and purrs.
"Look, my king," Sara says. "The magic jewel works. Fluffy is happy and playful."
They hug Fluffy and each other. They are happy too. They have fun acting like a king and a queen.
