Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a girl named Lucy. She had a flute that she loved to play. One day, she went to the park and took her flute with her. She played and played until it was time to go home.
At home, Lucy noticed her flute was gone! She was sad and told her mom, "I lost my flute." Her mom said, "Don't worry, we will return to the park and find it." They went back to the park and looked everywhere. They found the flute under a big tree.
Lucy was happy and played her flute. But the sound was sour. A man heard her and said, "I can fix your flute." He took the flute and cleaned it. Lucy played again, and the sound was sweet. She thanked the man and returned home with her mom, playing her flute all the way.
