One day, Mama and Mama's little boy decided to go to the museum. They arrived at the museum, and it was so big. Mama and her little boy looked at lots of things. They saw books and cartoons. They saw cars and boats. They even saw a pale elephant!
Mama and her little boy wandered around the museum for a while. They looked at the displays and read many stories. Everywhere they went, they saw something new.
After a while, they stopped in front of a model train. It was fun to see the engines chugging away and the little villages it stopped in. Mama and little boy thought it was cool!
Finally, it was time for them to go. But before they left, the little boy made sure to say goodbye to the pale elephant. He waved and smiled, happy to have spent the day at the museum.
