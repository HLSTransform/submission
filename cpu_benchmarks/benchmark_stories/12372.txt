Once upon a time there was a little fish who wanted to explore the world. He started swimming far away from his home. The other fish saw him and said, “Be careful! The water has poison!”
The little fish did not listen and kept swimming. He was so excited to see what was beyond the ocean that he forgot the warning.
Suddenly, he felt tired and weak. He wanted to keep swimming but he was too slow. He asked the other fish, “What’s wrong with me?”
The other fish said, “You have been swimming in the poisoned water! You must get back to the safe water quickly!”
The little fish started to swim fast, back to the safe water. When he finally reached his home, he was happy and promised himself to never forget the warning.
