Lily and Tom are playing in the park. They see a big, fat bird on a tree. The bird has a yellow beak and a red chest. It makes a loud whistle sound.
"Wow, look at that bird!" Lily says. "It is so fat and pretty. What is it?"
Tom shrugs. He does not know. He has a whistle in his pocket. He takes it out and blows it. He wants to talk to the bird.
The bird hears the whistle. It thinks Tom is another bird. It whistles back. It flaps its wings and flies to another tree. It wants Tom to follow it.
Tom runs after the bird. He blows his whistle again and again. He thinks the bird is his friend. Lily runs after Tom. She does not want to lose him.
The bird flies higher and higher. It whistles louder and louder. Tom tries to keep up. He blows his whistle harder and harder. His face turns red.
"Tom, stop!" Lily shouts. "You are too far. Come back!"
But Tom does not hear her. He only hears the bird. He wants to see it up close. He does not see the big fence in front of him. He runs into it and falls down.
"Ouch!" Tom cries. He drops his whistle. He feels pain in his nose and his knee. He sees blood.
Lily reaches him. She sees him hurt. She feels sorry for him. She hugs him and says, "It's okay, Tom. I'm here. The bird is gone. You don't need the whistle. You have me."
Tom stops crying. He hugs Lily back. He says, "Thank you, Lily. You are my best friend. I'm sorry I ran away. The bird was not my friend. It was mean. It made me increase my speed and crash."
Lily smiles. She says, "It's okay, Tom. You did not know. The bird was not mean. It was just scared. It did not understand your whistle. It thought you were a threat. Next time, we will be more careful. We will learn about birds before we talk to them."
Tom nods. He says, "Yes, Lily. You are right. We will learn about birds. And we will play with our toys. And we will stay together. We will have more fun that way."
Lily and Tom hold hands. They walk back to their mom. They tell her what happened. She cleans their wounds and gives them a kiss. She says, "I'm glad you are okay. You are brave and smart. And you are good friends. I'm proud of you."
Lily and Tom smile. They say, "We love you, mom. And we love each other. And we love the park. But we don't love the fat bird. It was too loud and fast. We prefer our whistle. It is more fun and easy."
