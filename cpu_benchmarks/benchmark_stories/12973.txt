Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was very clumsy and often stumbled around. One day, the girl was playing in the park.
She saw a barrel filled with apples. The little girl was very hungry and wanted to eat the apples. She tried to get close to the barrel, but she was too clumsy.
Suddenly, the barrel fell to the ground and all the apples spilled out. The girl was so sad that she started to weep. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't pick up the barrel.
The little girl never got the apples she wanted. All she could do was feel sad and weep. The bad ending broke her heart.
