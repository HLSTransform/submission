Sam and Mia are friends. They like to play with blocks and dolls. One day, Sam has a new toy. It is a big truck with wheels and lights. Sam is very happy with his truck. He shows it to Mia.
"Look, Mia, this is my truck. It can go fast and make noise. Do you want to play with it?" Sam asks.
Mia looks at the truck. She does not like it. She likes her dolls better. She shakes her head.
"No, thank you, Sam. I do not want to play with your truck. I want to play with my dolls. They are pretty and soft. You can play with your truck by yourself," Mia says.
Sam is sad and angry. He does not understand why Mia does not like his truck. He thinks his truck is better than her dolls. He wants Mia to play with him. He tries to give her his truck again.
"Please, Mia, play with my truck. It is fun and cool. Your dolls are boring and silly. You will like my truck if you try it," Sam says.
Mia refuses. She does not want to play with Sam's truck. She hugs her dolls and turns away from Sam. She does not want to talk to him.
"Go away, Sam. I do not want to be your friend. You are mean and rude. You do not respect what I like. You have a thick head. You only think about yourself," Mia says.
Sam feels hurt and angry. He does not want to lose Mia's friendship. He does not know what to do. He loves his truck, but he also loves Mia. He wishes they could play together and be happy. He does not like to fight with Mia. He thinks Mia has a thick head too. He does not understand why she does not like his truck. He thinks she is stubborn and unfair. He does not know how to say sorry. He does not know how to make Mia happy. He feels lonely and sad. He looks at his truck and his friend. He does not know what to choose.
