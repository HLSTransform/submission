Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Daisy. Daisy loved going on adventures, so one day she decided to go on a journey. 
She walked through the countryside, looking at the beautiful flowers and listening to the birds singing. She felt so happy and free! 
Suddenly, she heard a loud sound. It was coming from the sky and it was getting louder. Daisy was scared, so she hid behind a tree. 
She looked up and saw a dragon. The dragon had big wings and it flew around, destroying everything in its path. Daisy felt hurt, but she did not give up. She was brave and wanted to help. 
So, she jumped up and waved her magical wand. A bright light came from the wand and filled the sky. The dragon became smaller and disappeared into the clouds. 
Daisy was relieved and continued on her journey. She learned that a brave heart can never be destroyed!
