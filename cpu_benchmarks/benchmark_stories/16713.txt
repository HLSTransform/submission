Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big pit in the ground. It was full of sand and rocks and sticks. They wanted to dig and build in the pit.
"Can I borrow your shovel?" Lily asked Tom.
"OK, but be careful. It is powerful. It can dig very deep," Tom said.
Lily took the shovel and started to dig in the pit. She made a hole and found a shiny stone. She was happy and showed it to Tom.
"Wow, that is a pretty stone. Can I see it?" Tom asked.
"OK, but only for a little. It is mine. I found it," Lily said.
Tom took the stone and looked at it. He liked it too. He wanted to keep it.
"No, I want it. It is powerful. It can make me strong," Tom said.
He ran away with the stone. Lily was angry and sad. She chased him and shouted.
"Give it back! That is not nice. You did not find it. You have to share," Lily said.
They ran and ran until they came to a slide. Tom climbed up the slide and put the stone in his pocket. He slid down and laughed.
"Ha ha, you can't catch me. The stone is mine," Tom said.
But when he slid down, the stone fell out of his pocket. It rolled down the slide and into the pit. Lily saw it and ran to the pit. She picked up the stone and smiled.
"Ha ha, now I have it. The stone is mine," Lily said.
But when she looked at the stone, she saw that it was not shiny anymore. It was dull and gray. It was just a rock.
She felt sorry for Tom. She knew he liked the stone too. She walked to him and gave him the rock.
"Here, you can have it. It is not powerful. It is just a rock. But we can still play with it. We can be friends," Lily said.
Tom felt sorry for Lily. He knew he was not nice to her. He took the rock and hugged her.
"Thank you, Lily. You are right. It is just a rock. But we can still play with it. We can be friends," Tom said.
They went back to the pit and dug and built together. They had fun and shared the rock. They learned to be kind and fair. They were happy.
