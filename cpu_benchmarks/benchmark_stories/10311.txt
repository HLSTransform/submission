Sara and Ben like to travel with their mom and dad. They go to many places and see many things. One day, they travel to a big forest. They see many trees and animals. They are happy.
But in the forest, there is a witch. She is not kind. She is mean. She likes to make trouble for people. She sees Sara and Ben and wants to catch them. She makes a loud noise and scares them.
"Who are you?" Sara asks.
"I am the witch of the forest. And you are my lunch!" the witch says.
Sara and Ben are scared. They run away from the witch. They look for their mom and dad. But they are lost. They do not know where to go.
They see a small house. It is made of candy and cake. It smells good. They are hungry. They go to the house. They knock on the door.
"Hello?" a voice says.
They open the door. They see a lady. She is not a witch. She is kind. She smiles at them.
"Who are you?" Ben asks.
"I am the fairy of the forest. And you are my guests!" the lady says.
Sara and Ben are happy. They go inside the house. The lady gives them food and drink. She tells them stories. She helps them find their mom and dad.
They thank the lady and hug her. They say goodbye. They travel back to their mom and dad. They tell them about the witch and the fairy. They are safe and happy. The end.
