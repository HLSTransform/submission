Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite toy, a red ball. She loved to play with it every day. One day, she accidentally threw the ball too hard and it hit the wall. The ball broke into many pieces. Lily was very sad.
Her mom saw her crying and asked what happened. Lily showed her the broken ball. Her mom said, "Don't worry, we can fix it. We just need to find all the pieces and put them back together." So, they searched for all the pieces and put them in the shape of a ball.
Lily was very happy that her ball was fixed. She promised to be more obedient and careful with her toys from now on.
