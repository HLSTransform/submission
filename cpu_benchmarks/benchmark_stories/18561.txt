Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her mother would always watch her. One day, Lily's mother told her they were going to have a picnic in the park. Lily was so excited and couldn't wait to go.
When they got to the park, Lily's mother unpacked the picnic basket and they sat down to eat. Suddenly, Lily noticed something in the distance. "What's that?" she asked her mother. "It's a big light show!" her mother replied. Lily was so excited and couldn't wait to see it.
As the sun started to set, the sky got darker and darker. But then, the light show began! There were so many beautiful colors and lights flashing all around them. Lily was amazed and couldn't stop smiling. Her mother was happy to see her so happy.
After the light show, they packed up their things and headed home. Lily was tired but happy. She couldn't wait to tell her friends about the amazing light show she saw with her mother.
