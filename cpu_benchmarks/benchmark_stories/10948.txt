Once upon a time, there was a sweet cat named Bow. Bow liked to play with a pipe. The pipe was red and blue. Bow would run and jump with the pipe in his mouth.
One day, Bow went to the park with his pipe. He saw a big tree. Bow wanted to climb the tree with his pipe. Up, up, up he went! Bow was very high in the tree.
Bow saw a bird in the tree. The bird said, "Hello, Bow!" Bow said, "Hello, bird!" They played with the pipe together. They had a lot of fun. Then, Bow went down the tree and went home. Bow and the bird were happy friends.
