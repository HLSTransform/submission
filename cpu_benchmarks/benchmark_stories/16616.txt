Lily liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes. She painted flowers and trees and animals. She was happy when she painted.
One day, she saw a big rock in the garden. It was gray and ugly. Lily had an idea. She took her paint and brushes and went to the rock. She wanted to make it pretty.
She painted the rock with blue and yellow and pink. She made dots and stripes and swirls. She smiled at her work. She thought the rock looked nice.
But then, Tom came. Tom was Lily's brother. He was older and mean. He saw the rock and laughed. He said, "What is this? This is not a rock. This is a mess. You ruined the rock. You are a bad painter."
Lily felt sad. She liked her rock. She said, "No, I am not. I made the rock pretty. You are mean. Go away."
Tom got angry. He took a stick and scratched the paint. He said, "No, you go away. This is my garden. You have no right to paint here. This is an ugly rock. I will make it gray again."
Lily cried. She ran to the house. She told her mom what happened. Her mom hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. Tom was wrong. He should not have hurt your rock. He should have been kind. Your rock was beautiful. You are a good painter. You have a right to paint what you want. Come, let's go and fix your rock."
Lily and her mom went back to the garden. They saw the rock. It was scratched and dirty. But they also saw something else. They saw a butterfly. It was blue and yellow and pink. It had dots and stripes and swirls. It looked like Lily's paint. It was sitting on the rock.
Lily smiled. She said, "Look, mom. A butterfly. It likes my rock. It thinks it is pretty. Maybe Tom was wrong. Maybe my rock is not ugly. Maybe it is special."
Her mom smiled too. She said, "Yes, Lily. Your rock is special. And so are you. And so is the butterfly. Everyone is special in their own way. And everyone deserves respect and kindness. That is the moral of this story."
