Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a big tire that they roll on the grass. They take turns to push the tire and run after it.
One day, they have a race with the tire. They want to see who can roll the tire faster and farther. Lily says, "I will win. I am strong and fast." Ben says, "No, I will win. I am smart and clever."
They start the race. They push the tire as hard as they can. The tire goes very fast. Lily and Ben run after it. They laugh and shout.
But then, the tire hits a rock. The tire bounces off the rock and rolls away. Lily and Ben try to catch it, but they can't. The tire rolls out of the park and into the street.
Lily and Ben stop. They are scared. The street has cars and trucks. The cars and trucks are loud and big. They can hurt the tire. They can hurt Lily and Ben.
They look at each other. They are sad. They don't care about the race anymore. They just want their tire back.
They see a man on the other side of the street. He has a hat and a beard. He sees the tire. He picks it up. He smiles and waves at Lily and Ben.
He is a wise man. He knows the tire is not his. He knows the tire belongs to Lily and Ben. He waits for the cars and trucks to stop. He crosses the street. He gives the tire to Lily and Ben.
Lily and Ben are happy. They hug the man. They say, "Thank you, thank you, thank you." The man says, "You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome. Be careful with your tire. Don't let it roll into the street again."
Lily and Ben nod. They are sorry. They learned a lesson. They say, "We will be careful. We will not race with the tire again. We will share the tire and play nicely."
The man says, "That's good. That's wise. Have fun with your tire and your friend." He leaves.
Lily and Ben look at each other. They smile. They are friends. They have their tire. They are happy. They don't care who wins. They both win.
