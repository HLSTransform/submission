Mama decided to make a salad for dinner. She asked her three year old daughter to help. The daughter was anxious and a bit scared, but Mama said she would show her how to do it. 
The daughter found some tomatoes and cucumbers. She started chopping them and putting them into a bowl. Mama said the daughter was doing a great job. 
The daughter put some lettuce in the bowl. Suddenly, she felt embarrassed. Mama had told her to cut the lettuce into thin strips, but she had not done it - she had put the lettuce in whole. 
Mama laughed and said it was okay. She showed the daughter how to cut the lettuce properly. The daughter was relieved, and they finished making the salad together.
