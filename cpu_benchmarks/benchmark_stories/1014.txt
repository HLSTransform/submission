Once there was a little girl who loved to swim. She swam in the lake every day with her friends. Her favorite part was when they would all dive in and swim under the big, white veil. It was like swimming in a cloud!
One day while they were swimming they saw a fish. It was so big and so beautiful! The girl was so generous, she wanted to share the amazing experience with her friends. She used her veil to softly cover the fish so it wouldn't get scared. And then she swam away very slowly so that her friends could get a good look.
The little girl loved her generous nature and was sure that the fish did too. Every day she swam in the lake and visited the fish. After all the wonderful memories, this was the best swimming experience of her life!
