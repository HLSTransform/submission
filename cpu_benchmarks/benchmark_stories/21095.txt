One day, a little boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, went to the park. They played catch with a ball. Spot loved to run and catch the ball in his mouth. While they were playing, a big boy came over. He had a fake smile on his face.
The big boy said, "Give me your ball or I will take it." Tim felt scared. This was a threat! He didn't want to give his ball away, but he also didn't want the big boy to take it. So, Tim and Spot paused their game to think.
Tim got an idea. He said, "Why don't we all play together?" The big boy thought for a moment and then agreed. They all played catch and had a great time. In the end, the big boy wasn't mean anymore, and they all became friends.
The moral of the story is that sometimes it's better to share and make friends, rather than fight and be scared.
