Sara and Ben are in the classroom. They are playing with blocks and cups. Sara has a big cup of water. She likes to pour the water on the blocks and make them wet.
"Look, Ben, I can make a river!" Sara says. She pours the water on the floor and makes a puddle.
Ben is not happy. He does not like water on the floor. He likes to keep the classroom clean. He tries to stop Sara.
"Sara, no! Don't pour the water! The teacher will be mad!" Ben says. He grabs the cup from Sara's hand.
But Sara does not let go. She pulls the cup back. They both tug and pull. The cup falls and breaks. The water spills everywhere.
"Oh no!" Sara and Ben say. They look at the broken cup and the wet floor. They are scared. They hear the teacher coming.
The teacher sees the mess. She is angry. She asks Sara and Ben what happened.
"We were playing with the water and the cup broke. We are sorry, teacher!" Sara and Ben say. They look down and feel bad.
The teacher sighs. She tells Sara and Ben to clean up the water and the cup. She tells them to be more careful and not to waste water. She tells them to say sorry to each other.
Sara and Ben do what the teacher says. They use a mop and a dustpan. They clean up the water and the cup. They say sorry to each other.
They hug and make up. They promise to play nicely and not to pour water again. They are friends again.
