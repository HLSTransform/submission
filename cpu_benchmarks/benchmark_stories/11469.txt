Once upon a time, there was an old man. He had an old television in his room. Every morning he liked to rest in his chair and watch the television.
One day, the old man's grandson came to visit him. He was only three years old. He looked at the old television and said, "Grandpa, why don't you get a new TV?"
The old man smiled and said, "My old television works just fine. I just like to rest and watch my favorite shows!" 
The little boy thought that resting was a great idea. He asked, "Can I rest too?" 
The old man was delighted and said, "Of course, let's rest together and watch our favorite program!" 
So the old man and the little boy rested in the chair together and watched their favorite show on the old television. They had a great day!
