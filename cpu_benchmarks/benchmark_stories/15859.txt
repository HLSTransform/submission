Once upon a time, there was a girl named Daisy. One day, Daisy was hungry so she decided to eat some honey. She opened the jar and found that it was full of sweet, yellow honey. She was very excited and began licking the honey off the spoon. Suddenly, she noticed something that made her tremble. It was a shiny razor blade in the honey!
"Mommy," she said in a trembling voice, "Look what I found in the honey!"
Her mommy quickly came to investigate. She carefully looked at the razor blade and told Daisy, "Don't worry, I'll take care of it." 
She then took the razor blade away and Daisy felt much better. 
The next day, Daisy had a big smile on her face. She knew that if she always listened to her mommy, she would always be safe. 
The end.
