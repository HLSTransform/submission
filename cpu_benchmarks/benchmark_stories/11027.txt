Lily likes to balance on one foot. She thinks it is fun and cool. She can balance for a long time. She shows her mother how she can balance.
"Look, Mommy, I can balance!" Lily says. She lifts her left foot and stands on her right foot. She smiles and holds her arms out.
"Wow, Lily, you are very good at balancing!" her mother says. She claps her hands and smiles back. "Can you balance on the other foot too?"
Lily nods and puts her left foot down. She lifts her right foot and stands on her left foot. She balances for a few seconds, but then she wobbles and falls down. She laughs and gets up.
"That's okay, Lily, you can try again," her mother says. She hugs Lily and kisses her cheek. "You are very brave and smart. I love you."
"I love you too, Mommy," Lily says. She hugs her mother back and kisses her nose. "Can we balance some more?"
"Sure, Lily, we can balance some more," her mother says. They hold hands and balance together. They have fun and laugh. They are happy.
