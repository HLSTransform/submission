Once upon a time, there was a graceful river. It was very calm and peaceful. All the animals who lived by the river were very happy with how peaceful it stayed. 
One day, a little bird who lived by the river wanted to see what it was like to go over it. He flew toward the river and asked, "Can I go over the river?" 
No one answered his question. He was a little disappointed but decided to keep going. He flew higher and higher and eventually he was over the river.
 
From high up, he could see how big and graceful the river was. He was very excited. He flew for such a long time that he almost forgot about his question. He thought to himself, "Maybe the river could answer me one day..." 
The next day, the river flooded so high that the little bird had to fly further and further away! He was so excited that he finally got an answer to his question. From then on, the little bird remembered to be careful not to ask any more questions of the river.
