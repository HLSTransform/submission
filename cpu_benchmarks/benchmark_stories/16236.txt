There was a little girl named Jane who loved to play on the slide. She would go to the playground every day and slide down the big slide again and again. One day, she was running up the stairs to the slide when she slipped and fell. She was worried as it hurt a lot.
Jane's mom heard her crying and quickly ran to see what was wrong. She asked what had happened, and Jane told her that she had fallen when she ran to the slide.
Jane's mom was very worried, but she was also very kind. She hugged Jane and told her that it was ok to be scared sometimes. She said that she was there to help and make sure Jane was alright.
Her mom helped Jane back onto the slide, and after that, no more worry. Jane slid down the slide with a big smile, enjoying her time playing with her mom.
