Once upon a time there was a comet in the sky. It was so high and far away. It was very distant.
The comet was moving. It was flying through the sky. It was traveling so fast!
But then it stopped. It stayed still in the sky. It was so quiet.
Everybody looked up. They wanted to see the comet. It was beautiful!
Then the comet started to move again. It flew away off into the sky. It was going very fast.
But soon it stopped again. It stayed in the sky. Everybody looked up. They wanted to see the comet.
Then the comet moved away. It was so far and looked so small. Everybody watched until it vanished in the night. The comet was gone.
