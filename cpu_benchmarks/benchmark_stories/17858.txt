Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was only three years old and she wanted to be a chef! She asked her mom for a pan so she could start cooking. Her mom agreed, so she got her a special pan. It was a different kind of pan, she had never seen one like it before. 
The little girl was so excited to finally cook with her new pan. She put all the ingredients in the pan and set to work. It almost felt like forever before the food was ready. Then finally, after some delay, the food was ready. 
The little girl couldn't wait to eat her cooking. She tasted it and it was delicious! She was so happy she had her own pan that she could use to cook. She knew she could make all kinds of different things with it. 
The little girl was very proud of her new pan and she still uses it to this day.
