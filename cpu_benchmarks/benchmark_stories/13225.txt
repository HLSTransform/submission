Once upon a time there was a little girl. She had two arms. She liked to wiggle them both. 
One day, she spun and spun until she felt so dizzy. She tried to grab something to stop spinning, but couldn't find anything.
Then she remembered her arms. She grabbed one arm with the other and then she stopped spinning. She felt much better.
The little girl was so happy that she stopped spinning. She laughed and then gave her two arms a big hug!
