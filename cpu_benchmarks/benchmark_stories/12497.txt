Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went on a walk with her mom. They saw a river with water that flowed fast. Lily wanted to touch the water, but her mom said no because it was dangerous. 
Suddenly, they heard a voice from the bushes. It was a little boy who said he was lost and needed help. Lily's mom told her to stay put while she went to find the boy's parents. 
But the boy lied. He was a bad person who wanted to hurt Lily. He came out of the bushes and pushed her into the water. Lily didn't know how to swim, and the water was too strong. She was taken away by the current and disappeared into the unknown. 
Lily's mom came back and saw what happened. She cried and called for help, but it was too late. They never found Lily again. The boy was never caught, and he continued to lie and hurt others.
