Lily and Ben were on a trip with their mom and dad. They stayed in a big hotel with many rooms and a pool. Lily and Ben liked the pool a lot. They put on their swimsuits and ran to the water.
"Wait for me!" Lily shouted to Ben, who was faster than her. She saw him jump into the pool and splash. She wanted to do the same. She ran faster and faster, but she did not see the icy floor. It was slippery and shiny. She slipped and fell. She hurt her knee and cried.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lily cried. Ben heard her and swam to the edge of the pool. He saw Lily on the floor, holding her knee. He felt sorry for her. He got out of the pool and ran to her.
"Are you okay, Lily?" Ben asked. He helped her stand up and hugged her. "I'm sorry you fell. The floor is icy. You have to be careful."
Lily stopped crying and hugged Ben back. "Thank you, Ben. You are a good brother. I'm sorry I ran too fast. I wanted to play with you."
They walked to their mom and dad, who were sitting on chairs. They saw Lily's knee and put a band-aid on it. They told Lily and Ben to be more careful and not to run on the icy floor. They said they could still play in the pool, but they had to walk slowly and hold hands.
Lily and Ben learned their lesson. They played in the pool together, but they did not run or push. They had fun and stayed safe. They were happy and thankful. They learned that the icy floor can be dangerous, and that they should always look out for each other.
