One day, Mommy and Daddy bought an orange thing. It was big and round, and it had a handle on one side. Mommy and Daddy told their little girl that it was a magical thing and that it needed to be decorated. 
So, the little girl asked Mommy and Daddy for some colors to decorate with. They gave her markers, paint, ribbon, and glitter. She squealed with excitement. 
The little girl started drawing with her markers. She made little circles, some orange and some not. She also added some glitter to the thing to make it shiny. 
Mommy and Daddy had to help her with the ribbon. She put big, looping bows on the top of the orange thing. 
When she was done decorating, Mommy and Daddy told her what the thing was: It was a special pumpkin! The little girl laughed with joy.
