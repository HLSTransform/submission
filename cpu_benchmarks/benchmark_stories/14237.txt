Mum was cooking in the kitchen. There was a big pot of hot stew bubbling on the stove. Mum stirred the pot with a spoon. 
Jenny came in from the garden. She had a row of carrots in her hands. She ran to the kitchen and gave the carrots to Mum. 
Mum smiled and thanked Jenny for the carrots. Then she chopped them into tiny pieces. She added them to the hot stew and stirred them in. 
Mum tasted the stew. It was delicious! She smiled and said it was ready to eat.
Jenny and Mum filled two plates with the hot stew. They sat down at the table and enjoyed their meal. It tasted so yummy!
