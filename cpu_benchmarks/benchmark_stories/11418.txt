Tommy was a 3 year old boy who loved playing outside. One day, he was walking through the park when he found a big lime. He was very excited!
He picked it up and asked his mom, "What can I do with this?"
His mom said, "You can spend some time squeezing it. It will be easy, and you'll have lots of fun!"
So Tommy spent the afternoon outside, squeezing the lime. He giggled with joy as he played with the soft fruit. When he was done, his hands were stained yellow and his cheeks were smeared with lime juice.
His mom smiled and said, "That was easy, wasn't it?" 
Tommy nodded and said, "Yes, it was easy and lots of fun!" 
That was the best way Tommy had ever spent an afternoon!
