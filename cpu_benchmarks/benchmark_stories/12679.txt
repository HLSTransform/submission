Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to drink juice from her cup. One day, Lily's big brother came in and took her cup away. He started to tease her and wouldn't give it back. Lily was confused and didn't know what to do. 
Suddenly, their mom walked in and saw what was happening. She told Lily's brother to give the cup back and stop teasing her. Lily was happy to have her cup again and her brother felt bad for being mean. From that day on, Lily's brother learned to be kind and not tease her anymore.
