Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He was three years old and every day he was full of energy and laughter. 
One day, Tim was playing with his friends in a field, when he saw an arrow in the grass. Curious, he picked up the arrow and stared at it, pointing it towards his friends. 
"It's a magic arrow!" one of Tim's friends, Jessica, exclaimed. 
Tim loved the idea, and the two decided to play a game with the arrow. Jessica said if Tim held up the arrow and pointed it at someone, they would have to do whatever they said. 
Tim thought this was a great idea, and pointed the arrow at a friend. However, the friend refused, and Tim got angry. He started to yell and said his friend was being selfish.
Seeing his reaction, Jessica laughed. She then suggested that they forget the game, and share the arrow. She said that if Tim and his friends shared the arrow, everyone would get to enjoy it. 
Tim thought about it for a moment, then smiled and agreed. He realized that sharing was the best way to make everyone happy. 
From then on, Tim and his friends shared the arrow, always laughing and having a good time.
