Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, she found a shiny red piano and started to play it. She played a beautiful note, but then she accidentally broke one of the keys. 
"Oh no!" said Lily. "I broke it!"
"It's okay," said her mom. "Let's see if we can fix it."
Lily felt calm knowing that her mom would help her fix the piano. Together, they found some glue and fixed the broken key. From then on, Lily played her piano every day and made beautiful music.
