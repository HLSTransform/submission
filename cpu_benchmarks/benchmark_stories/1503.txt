Mild Bill was walking through the park when he started to feel hungry. He looked around and saw a bright blue label on a big tree. He went closer to read what it said, and saw that it was a label for a yummy apple. He couldn't reach it so he started to look for something to help him get the apple. He found a big stick and used it to pull the apple down. Mild Bill happily took the apple, smiled, and bit into it. The apple was so juicy and sweet! Mild Bill was so pleased he started to dance with joy. He thanked the tree for the yummy apple.
