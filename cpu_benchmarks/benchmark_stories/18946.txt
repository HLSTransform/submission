Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a thin cat named Kitty. She had many friends, like Doggy, Birdy, and Fishy. They all liked to play and have fun together. They were very happy.
One day, Kitty saw a sign near a big tree. The sign said, "Save the park." Kitty did not want her park to go away, so she asked her friends to help. Doggy barked, Birdy sang, and Fishy splashed in the water. They all wanted to save the park.
Kitty and her friends worked together to clean the park. They picked up trash and put it in the bin. Soon, the park was clean and pretty. The people in the town saw what Kitty and her friends did. They were very proud of them. They all learned that if they work together, they can save the things they love. And they all lived happily ever after.
