Once upon a time, there was a wise owl who wanted to drive a car. He asked his friends for help, but they were too busy. So, he decided to take a lecture on how to drive. The teacher was very nice and taught him all the things he needed to know. 
The wise owl practiced driving every day and soon became very good at it. He would drive around the forest and wave to all his friends. They were very impressed with his driving skills. 
One day, the wise owl gave a lecture to all his friends about driving safely. He told them how important it was to wear a seatbelt and to always pay attention to the road. They all listened carefully and learned a lot from the wise owl. From then on, they all drove safely in the forest.
