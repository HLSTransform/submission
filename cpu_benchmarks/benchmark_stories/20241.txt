One day, a rabbit named Hoppy went for a walk. Hoppy loved to hop all around. He was hopping near a big tree when he saw a big boot. The boot was very dirty and smelly. Hoppy thought it was a bad boot.
Hoppy saw a frog near the boot. The frog said, "Hi Hoppy! Do you want to play with me and this boot?" Hoppy replied, "No, thank you. That boot looks bad and smells bad too." The frog looked sad, but he understood.
Hoppy hopped away from the boot and the frog. He found a nice, clean ball to play with instead. Hoppy had a fun day playing with the ball. He was happy that he did not play with the bad boot.
