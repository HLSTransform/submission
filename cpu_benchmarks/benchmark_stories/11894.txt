Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore the woods. One day, he found a bow and arrow. He was so excited to play with it, but he didn't know how to use it. 
He asked his friend, Sarah, "Can you help me shoot the arrow?" 
Sarah said, "Sure, but be careful not to spoil it. Arrows are delicate." 
Timmy tried to shoot the arrow, but he didn't yield it right. It didn't go very far. Sarah showed him how to yield it properly and the arrow flew through the air. Timmy was so happy and thanked Sarah for her help. 
From that day on, Timmy and Sarah played with the bow and arrow together, always making sure to yield it carefully so it wouldn't get spoiled.
