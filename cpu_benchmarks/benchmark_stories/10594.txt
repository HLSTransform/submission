Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sue. Sue was very happy in her small house. One day, she saw a field across the street. Sue thought the field was so pretty, so she decided to kneel down and admire it from afar. 
But when Sue knelt down, she found that someone had plopped a cheap chair in the middle of the field. Sue felt sad, because she wanted to take a closer look at the grass, trees, and flowers stored in that field. 
Sue knew she had to do something, so she went to her neighbour's house to ask him for help. When her neighbour heard her story, he helped Sue take the chair away so she could explore the field. 
Sue was so relieved and thanked her neighbour for the help. Now, Sue was finally able to kneel down in the field and admire the beauty it had to offer. She was so happy!
