Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved to create. Every day, she would use her special tools to make things of every shape and size. She made hats, fun designs for her friends, and even fashion for animals.
One day, she noticed it was starting to get colder outside. She thought about the animals, and she knew that they needed something special so they could stay warm. So the girl used her special tools and began to create something special.
She used warm colors and fun designs to create special cloaks. She even used bits of fur and wool that she got from her friends. She made a lot of cloaks, enough for all the animals.
When she was finished, she took all her cloaks to all the animals. They were so excited when they saw them, and so glad to have something to keep them warm in the cold weather.
The girl was so happy that she had made something that her friends and the animals all enjoyed. She knew for sure that she could create anything, and that felt great!
