Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved collecting shiny rocks. She had a big collection of minerals that she kept in a box that she owned. One day, she found a smooth, shiny rock that was the most beautiful one she had ever seen. She was so happy to add it to her collection. 
But one day, when she was playing outside, she accidentally dropped her box and all of her precious minerals spilled out. She tried to pick them up, but the smooth, shiny rock rolled away and fell into a deep hole. She was so sad because she could not get it back. 
From that day on, she learned to be more careful with her things that she owned and to always hold on tight to the things that were important to her. She still loved her collection of minerals, but she always missed that one smooth, shiny rock that she lost.
