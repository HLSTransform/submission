Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Michael. He loved to perform. Every day he would put on a show for his mom and dad. He loved to play with his toys and act out different scenes. 
One day, Michael went to the store with his mom to buy a new toy. He saw a beautiful purple purse and wanted to buy it. His mom said no, she didn't have enough money. Michael was sad but he understood that sometimes he wasn't able to get what he wanted. 
A few days later, Michael's dad gave him an old purse he had found. It was old, but it was soft and perfect for playing pretend. Michael was so excited and he thanked his dad. He ran and performed a great show with the purse, showing his mom and dad that even with something old and used, he can be creative and perform. 
The moral of the story is that having something new and fancy isn't always essential. You don't need expensive things to be creative. With imagination and a few simple things you can perform and have fun.
