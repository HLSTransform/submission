Once there was a little girl called Amy. She was three years old. She had one little toy - it was her favourite. One day she was playing with it and she wanted to throw it up into the air. She picked it up by the handle and threw it into the air. 
But when the toy came down, it got stuck in a tree! Amy was so confused. She didn't know what to do. She looked around and around but she couldn't see the toy anywhere. 
Suddenly the wind started to blow and the toy fell out of the tree. Amy was so happy! She ran to get it, grabbed the handle and hugged her toy close.
Amy was no longer confused - she was very happy and she threw her toy up into the air again and again.
