Once upon a time there was a mommy and daddy who wanted to get money. They needed serious help so they got some friends to come over. Everyone gathered together and they started talking about ways to get money. 
Mommy made dinner and gave everyone a big smile. She was excited and ready to find money. Everyone had great ideas but they needed to get to work. 
They decided to each take a job to get some money. Daddy said he could paint, Mommy said she could sell some of her baked goods, and the other friends said they would do repairs for some extra cash. 
They all worked hard and when it was time, they gathered all their money together. Everyone was so happy because they got enough money to buy what they needed. 
The end.
