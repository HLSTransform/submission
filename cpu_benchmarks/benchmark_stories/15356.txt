Once upon a time there was a girl named Lily. Lily was three years old and she loved to sit in her room. In her room, there was an original picture on the wall. Every morning, Lily would come into her room, sit in her chair, and look at the picture.
The picture had a silly cat painted on it. The cat was wearing a hat and had a big smile. Lily thought it was very funny, so she would sit and laugh every time she saw it.
Then one day, Lily saw something new. She saw that something was under the picture. She got off her chair and stood on her tippy toes to look underneath. She saw the artist's original signature! Lily thought it was amazing, and she was so excited.
From then on, Lily would sit in her room every day and look at the picture and the original signature. She thought it was so cool that such an original thing was hanging in her room!
