Once upon a time, there was an anxious octopus. Every day, it swam around looking for fun things to do. One day, the octopus went on an adventure and didn’t come back. The ocean creatures were so worried and waited for it to return. 
Months passed and the octopus hadn’t returned. The ocean animals were starting to lose hope when one day they heard a splash in the water. The octopus had returned! Everyone was so happy and couldn’t wait to hear about its adventures. 
The octopus had been travelling far away and had met lots of new friends. Some fishes, a crab and even a friendly shark! It even brought back some shells as a souvenir. 
The octopus was so happy to be back and couldn’t wait to tell its friends in the ocean all about its exciting adventure. Everyone was so happy and glad the octopus had returned.
