Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a big, powerful crane. The crane was very strong and could lift many heavy things. One day, the crane was asked to display its strength at the town fair.
At the fair, the crane met a small, weak bird. The bird said, "You are so big and strong, but I am so small and weak. Can you help me fly high in the sky?" The crane agreed to help the bird.
But when the crane tried to lift the bird, it was not easy. The bird was scared and did not want to let go of the crane's strong arm. The crane said, "Don't be scared, little bird. I will help you fly high." The bird trusted the crane, let go, and together they flew high in the sky. The town cheered and clapped as they watched the powerful crane and the brave little bird display their friendship and teamwork.
