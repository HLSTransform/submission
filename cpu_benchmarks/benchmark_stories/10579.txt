Once upon a time there was a girl named Molly. Molly was very adventurous and loved to explore new places. One day her dad took her to the park and they rode on the swing. As they swung, Molly saw a symbol in the sky. It was a bird, with long wings and a long tail.
Molly was so amazed by what she saw, she wanted to ride the bird. Her dad smiled and told her he would make it happen. He took her to the pet shop and bought a big toy bird.
Molly was so excited to ride the bird and take it for a spin around the park. She jumped on the bird and waved her hands in the air as she whizzed around the park.
Molly could feel the wind in her hair and see the sky get bigger and bigger. It was such an adventurous ride and all the other kids at the park were amazed. Molly felt like she was a true adventurer and couldnâ€™t help but smile as she rode her bird around the park.
