Anna and Ben are playing in the garden. They see a big tree with green things on it. Anna says, "What are those things, Ben?"
Ben says, "They are pears, Anna. They are fruits. You can eat them. They are sweet and soft."
Anna says, "Can we pick some, Ben?"
Ben says, "Yes, but we have to be careful. Some pears are not ready. They are hard and sour. We have to notice which ones are ripe. They are yellow and brown."
Anna and Ben look at the tree. They notice some pears that are ripe. They reach for them and pull them off. They smell them and feel them. They are soft and sweet.
Anna and Ben take a bite of their pears. They say, "Mmm, these are good pears. Thank you, tree!"
The end.
