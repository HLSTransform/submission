Once upon a time there were two small friends named Mary and Jack. They were both very thoughtful and caring.
One morning, Mary and Jack were curious and wanted to explore. So, they decided to wander around and find something exciting. After a while, they spotted a tall building in the distance.
The two friends ran towards the building and looked up in amazement. "Wow! This is so cool," said Jack. 
"Let's go inside and explore," suggested Mary. The two friends went inside and looked around. Suddenly, they heard someone speaking. They immediately became curious and followed the sound.
When they arrived, they saw a kind old man talking to himself. "Greetings young ones," said the old man. The children were surprised to see the man, but they were excited to talk to him.
The old man proceeded to introduce himself. He said, "My name is Mr. Johnson. I'm very thankful for this building and I'm always very thoughtful to those around me."
Mary and Jack were so excited to meet him. They spoke about the building and how thoughtful he was. Mary and Jack thanked Mr. Johnson for being kind and said goodbye. Feeling inspired, they left the building with a new appreciation for thoughtfulness.
