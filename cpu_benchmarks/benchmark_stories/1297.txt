Tommy was very excited because he was going to read a letter. The envelope was pink and it had flowers on it. He opened the envelope slowly and carefully. Inside was a letter for him! It had lots of different colours and pictures on it. He couldn't wait to read it.
Tommy's mummy read the letter to him. It said that there was a surprise coming for him, but it didn't say what it was. Tommy's mummy said that he would just have to wait and see.
Tommy was a bit sad he didn't know what the surprise was, but he was excited about it at the same time. He went off to play, dreaming of what the surprise might be. Later on, Tommy found out what the surprise was and he was so happy! It was the best gift ever.
