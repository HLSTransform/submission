Lily and Tom are friends who like to play outside. They go to the park with their moms. The park has new equipment that is modern and fun. There are slides, swings, seesaws, and a big spring.
Lily and Tom run to the spring. They take turns to sit on it and bounce up and down. They laugh and shout.
"Look at me, I'm a kangaroo!" Lily says.
"I'm a rocket!" Tom says.
They spring higher and higher. Their moms watch them and smile.
But then, Lily springs too high. She falls off the spring and lands on the grass. She cries and holds her knee. It hurts.
Tom jumps off the spring and runs to her. He helps her up and hugs her.
"I'm sorry, Lily. Are you okay?" he asks.
Lily sniffles and nods. She shows him her knee. It has a small scratch.
"It's okay, Tom. It's not your fault. It's just a boo-boo," she says.
Tom looks at her knee and frowns. He has an idea.
"Wait here, Lily. I'll be right back," he says.
He runs to his mom and asks for a band-aid. His mom gives him one and tells him to be careful. He runs back to Lily and puts the band-aid on her knee.
"There, Lily. Now you're better," he says.
Lily smiles and thanks him. She feels better.
"Tom, you're a good friend," she says.
Tom smiles and hugs her again.
"Lily, you're a good friend too," he says.
They hold hands and walk to the other equipment. They play together until it is time to go home. They say goodbye and promise to play again soon. They are happy.
