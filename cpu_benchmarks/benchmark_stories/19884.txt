Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to her yellow class every day. Her teacher, Miss Daisy, was always kind and encouraged her to learn new things.
One day, Lily was feeling shy and didn't want to participate in class. But Miss Daisy noticed and said, "Lily, you can do it! I believe in you." This encouraged Lily to try her best and she ended up doing a great job.
After class, Lily's mom picked her up and asked how her day was. Lily replied, "It was good! Miss Daisy encouraged me and my class is so yellow!" Her mom smiled and was happy to hear that Lily had a good day.
