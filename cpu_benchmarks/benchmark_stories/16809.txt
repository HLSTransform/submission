Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was a big dog with a healthy coat of fur. He loved to play fetch with his owner and go for walks. One day, Max's owner took him to the park to watch the ducks swim in the pond. Max wagged his tail and barked with excitement. He loved to watch the ducks! When it was time to go home, Max's owner called his name and Max happily followed.
