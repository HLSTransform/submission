Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends were playing hide and seek. Suddenly, Lily saw a bunny rabbit and she ran towards it. But when she got closer, the bunny disappeared in the fog.
Lily's friend, Timmy, asked her, "What happened? Why did you stop running?" Lily replied, "I saw a bunny but it disappeared in the fog." Timmy said, "Oh no! That's too bad. Maybe we can find it later." Lily agreed and said, "Yes, let's keep playing."
After a while, Lily's mom came to the park and brought some yummy snacks for everyone. They all sat down on the grass and started eating. Lily's mom said, "Be careful not to pinch your fingers when you eat." They all laughed and enjoyed their yummy snacks together.
