Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat candy and cookies all day long. One day, her mom said, "Lily, you can't eat candy all day. It's not good for you." 
Lily didn't like this and she turned to her mom and said, "But I want candy! It tastes so good!" 
Her mom shook her head and said, "No, Lily. You need to eat some fruits and veggies too." 
Lily didn't like this idea and she started to feel dizzy. Her mom said, "See, Lily? You need to eat healthy food too." 
Lily realized her mom was right and she tried some fruits and veggies. They tasted good too! From that day on, Lily ate a balanced diet and she never felt dizzy again.
