Once upon a time there was a bench in the park. It was wood and very long. People liked to sit on it to rest. On one day, a little girl came to the park with her mom.
The little girl was glad to see the bench. She ran up to it and hopped onto the seat. Then she started to fill the bench with acorns. She put them in all the little holes and cracks in the wood.
The little girl and her mom were both so glad. Now the bench was full of acorns! It looked so pretty with their little brown shells standing out against the wood.
The girl and her mom sat on the bench for a while. Everyone who walked by was impressed with the acorns and smiled. The little girl was very proud of her work. She felt like she had made the park look even more beautiful.
