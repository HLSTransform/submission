Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very brave. One day, she went for a walk in the woods. Everything was quiet, until suddenly she heard a noise. She stopped and looked around, and saw a figure standing in the shadows. She was scared but didn't run away. She took a few steps closer and saw that it wasn't a monster, it was just a little bunny. The bunny was scared too and they both smiled. The little girl said softly, "it's ok, you don't need to be scared". The little bunny smiled and hopped away. The little girl felt happy that she had made a new friend, and knew that she could be brave when she was scared.
