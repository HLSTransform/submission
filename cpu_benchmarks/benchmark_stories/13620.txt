Ben did not like school. He had to sit and listen to the teacher. He had to write and read and count. He had to do exams. Exams were hard and scary. He did not know the answers. He felt miserable.
One day, the teacher said, "Today we have a big exam. You have to do your best. If you do well, you will get a prize." Ben felt more miserable. He did not want to do the exam. He wanted to play and have fun.
He looked at his friend Lily. Lily was smart and happy. She liked school. She liked exams. She knew the answers. She smiled at Ben. "Don't worry, Ben. You can do it. I will help you. I will give you a hint if you need it."
Ben felt a little better. He liked Lily. She was kind and friendly. She was his best friend. He said, "Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend. I will try to do the exam. Maybe I will get a prize too."
They did the exam. Ben tried to remember what the teacher said. He tried to write and read and count. He looked at Lily sometimes. She gave him a hint when he was stuck. She whispered, "You can do it, Ben. I believe in you."
When they finished, the teacher checked their papers. She smiled and said, "Well done, everyone. You did a great job. You all get a prize. You can choose a sticker or a candy." Ben was happy. He did the exam. He did not feel miserable. He felt proud. He chose a sticker. He gave it to Lily. He said, "Thank you, Lily. You helped me. You are the best friend ever." Lily hugged him. She said, "You're welcome, Ben. You did it. You are the best friend ever too." They smiled and played and had fun.
