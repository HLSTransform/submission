Once upon a time there was a little girl who had a funny task. She had to pick coal for her mom. She was scared, but she was brave and she marched out to the coal pile.
She bent over and picked up a big piece of coal. "Woah!", she said when she saw how heavy it was. She carefully put the coal in her basket.
Next, she spotted lots of smaller pieces of coal. She picked up each one, making sure it was just as special as the first one. 
When she was finished, her basket was full! She smiled and marched back to her mom. What a brave little girl she was!
