Tom and Lily were best friends. They liked to play outside and look at the sky. One day, they saw a big, white cloud that looked like a bear. They wanted to hug the cloud.
"Let's go hug the cloud!" Tom said.
"How?" Lily asked.
"Maybe we can climb a tree or a hill," Tom said.
They looked around and saw a big hill near their house. They ran to the hill and started to climb. They were very excited.
But when they reached the top of the hill, they saw that the cloud was very far away. They could not hug the cloud. They felt sad.
"It's too far," Lily said.
"Maybe it will come closer," Tom said.
They waited and waited, but the cloud did not move. It stayed in the same place. The sun was setting and the sky was turning pink and purple.
"Maybe we should go home," Lily said.
"OK," Tom said.
They started to go down the hill, but then they heard a loud roar. They looked up and saw that the cloud had changed. It was not a bear anymore. It was a dragon. It had wings, teeth, and fire. It looked very angry and serious.
"Run!" Tom shouted.
They ran as fast as they could, but the dragon was faster. It flew over them and breathed fire. They dodged the fire and hid behind a rock.
"What do we do?" Lily cried.
"I don't know," Tom said.
They were very scared. They wished they had never tried to hug the cloud. They hugged each other and hoped the dragon would go away.
