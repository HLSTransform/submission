Once upon a time, there was a brown bear. He was looking for food and he felt very hungry. He walked through the forest picking up different things he could eat but he couldn't find anything he liked. 
He came across a tree and he noticed that it had a lot of ripe fruits hanging on its branches. He was delighted and started picking one. Suddenly, he sensed that something was wrong. He heard a voice. "What are you doing here?".
He turned around and saw an angry gorilla with a big stick in his hands. The bear was so scared that he ran away and the gorilla started chasing him. He tried to escape but couldn't do it. The gorilla caught him and pulled his skin off.
The poor bear died that day. He was never seen again and his skin became a reminder of his bad luck.
