One day, Jack and his mommy went to the store. They got in the elevator and Mommy told Jack to load the groceries. He got a big box of apples. The apples were so heavy he had to hold them tight.
When they got home they unloaded the apples. Jack thought they looked pretty and juicy but when he bit into one it was so bitter he almost cried. Mommy hugged him and told him it was okay.
The next time Mommy and Jack went to the store, he knew to check the apples before he loaded them. He asked the worker if they were sweet and the worker said yes. They loaded the sweet apples and their shopping trip was a lot happier.
