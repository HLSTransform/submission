Once upon a time, there was a wide box. Inside the box was a special toy, and the boy wanted to see it. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't open the box.
The boy was patient as he tried every way to open it, but still it would not break. Then one day, he had a great idea - he asked his Mommy for help.
His Mommy was strong and she was able to break the wide box open. The boy was so happy to finally see the toy inside - it was the most beautiful toy he had ever seen! 
From that day forward, the boy was very patient and careful when opening any kind of box. He knew that if ever he couldn't open one, he could always ask Mommy for help.
