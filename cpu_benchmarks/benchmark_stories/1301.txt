One day, a plane was flying high above. It was going to work and it felt excited. As it flew above, it saw something. It saw a little girl near a pond. She looked very guilty. The plane flew closer and saw that she had a bucket and she was picking something from the pond. The plane noticed that she was picking up tiny little fish and putting them in the bucket. 
The plane was confused. Why was the girl taking the fish? Suddenly, the plane noticed that there were two cats near the pond. The plane realized that the girl was taking the fish to feed the cats. It felt happy to know that the girl was taking care of the cats. 
The plane watched as the girl ran to the cats and dropped the fish near them. The cats were very excited and they quickly ate the fish. The plane was happy to know that the girl was trying to help the cats and it flew away feeling very pleased.
