Once upon a time, there was a little bird with black wings. The bird liked to fly high in the sky and touch the clouds. One day, the bird saw a little girl walking in the park. The girl saw the bird and wanted to touch its black wings. The bird was scared at first, but then it realized the girl was friendly. The little girl touched the bird's wings and they both smiled. From that day on, the bird and the little girl became good friends and played together every day.
