Lily and Max were best friends. They loved to play together in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. They also liked to feed the ducks in the pond. The ducks were gray and soft.
One day, Lily had to move to a new house far away. She was sad and so was Max. They hugged and said goodbye.
"I will miss you, Lily," Max said.
"I will miss you, too, Max," Lily said. "But we will always have our memories. We can remember the fun we had in the park and the ducks we fed."
"Yes, we can," Max said. "And we can write letters and call each other sometimes."
Lily nodded and smiled. She gave Max a picture of them in the park. Max gave Lily a toy duck. They hugged again and got in their cars.
As they drove away, they waved and shouted, "I love you, best friend!"
They kept their gifts and their memories in their hearts. They knew they would always be friends, no matter how far apart they were.
