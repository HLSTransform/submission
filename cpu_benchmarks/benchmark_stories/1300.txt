One day, Joe saw something strange. He was walking in the park and he saw steam coming out of the ground. Joe was so surprised. He shouted, "Look what is that?"
It was a dragon! The dragon made the steam come out of the ground with its hot breath. Joe was scared and started to back away. Then the dragon started talking to Joe.
The dragon said, "Joe, I need your help. I am very dry and thirsty." Joe asked, "How can I help you?" The dragon said, "I need water! Can you please go and get some water for me?" Joe smiled and said okay.
He ran home and grabbed a bucket. He filled the bucket with water and brought it back to the dragon. The dragon drank all of the water and then gave a big shout of happiness. Joe was so happy that he helped the dragon. 
Joe said good-bye to the dragon and walked back home. He knew that he had done something really special.
