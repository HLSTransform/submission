Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat sweet treats. One day, she went to the park with her mom and saw a group of children tapping their feet to a song. Lily joined in and danced along with them.
After they finished dancing, the children sat down to discuss what games they wanted to play. Lily suggested playing hide-and-seek, and they all agreed it was a great idea. They had so much fun running around and hiding from each other.
When it was time to go home, Lily's mom gave her a sweet lollipop as a treat for being such a good girl. Lily was so happy and thanked her mom with a big hug. She went to bed that night with a smile on her face, dreaming of all the fun she had at the park.
