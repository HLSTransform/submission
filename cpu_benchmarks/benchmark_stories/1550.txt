Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play outside and get dirty. One day, her mother saw her and said, "Lily, you need to wash your hands before dinner."
Lily replied, "But Mama, I don't want to wash my hands. They are not dirty."
Her mother smiled and said, "I know, but it's important to wash our hands so we don't get sick. Plus, it's always good to be clean."
Lily thought about it for a moment and then said, "Okay, Mama. I will wash my hands." So, Lily went to the sink and washed her hands with soap and water until they were clean and shiny. Her mother smiled and said, "Good job, Lily. You're an original girl."
