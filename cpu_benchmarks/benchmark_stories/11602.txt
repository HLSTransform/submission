Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to pretend. She loved pretending to be different people and tell stories so much that she called it playing dress up.
One day, she went to the store to get a new dress up outfit. She tried on a beautiful sparkly dress and a pretend hat. She looked so pretty!
But when she looked in the mirror, she didn't feel very comfortable in the dress. It was difficult to move in, and it made her feel uncomfortable.
So she put it back on the shelf and instead of buying the dress up outfit, she decided to buy something else instead.
She chose a comfy pair of shoes and a new outfit that would make her feel comfortable and free. When she put them on, she felt much better and realized that it was more important to feel comfortable in her own body than to pretend to be somebody else.
The little girl learned an important moral lesson about being true to herself. She realized that the most comfortable way to be was to just be herself. She was happy with her decision and never looked back.
