Once upon a time, there was a child who loved to play outside. One day, the child was running around in the garden and trying to pick up the best dandelion for their parent. Suddenly, the child spotted a bee flying in their direction. The child ran away, but wasn't fast enough. The bee stung the child's arm.
The parent came running over and saw the bee flying away. They gave the child a big hug and started to spray lotion on the spot the bee stung. The child thanked them and said, "Thank you for helping me, parent!" 
The parent smiled and replied, "You're welcome! It's important to be careful when playing outside, because the bees can be very busy this time of year." 
The child nodded and then returned to picking dandelions. They stayed careful and mindful of bees, happy as can be.
