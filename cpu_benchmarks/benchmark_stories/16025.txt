Once upon a time, there lived a little sheep named Dot. She was curious and adventurous, and always wanted to explore the world.
One day, Dot noticed a bright red collar on a nearby tree and decided to investigate. She walked over to the tree, but just as she got close, a big and harsh voice said, "Woah, what are you doing!?"
Startled, Dot looked up to see an old man standing in front of her. She realized the collar was his. He continued, "This collar doesn't belong to you, and I'm going to weigh it to make sure you haven't taken anything!"
Dot replied, "I was only examining it, I don't have anything!" But the man didn't believe her, and so he weighed the collar on a nearby scale.
The man was relieved when the collar weighed the same as before and he finally let Dot go. He said to Dot, "It's important to remember that other people's things don't belong to you - okay?" Dot nodded, understanding the man's intent, and ran away in search of her next adventure.
