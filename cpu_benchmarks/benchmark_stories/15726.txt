Molly was walking through the forest and she noticed something strange. There was steam coming from the ground and she thought it was very interesting. She stepped closer and saw a little creature, wearing a funny hat and frowning. 
Molly cautiously stepped closer and said, "Hello, why are you frowning?".
The little creature replied, "I'm stuck here and I can't leave. I just keep making more and more steam and it's not helping me get out." 
Molly smiled and said, "I might be able to help you, but you'll have to trust me." 
The little creature perked up, smiled and said, "I would love your help!" 
Molly carefully stepped towards the creature, held out her hand and helped the little creature up. Then, together, they walked away from the steam and out into the sunshine.
