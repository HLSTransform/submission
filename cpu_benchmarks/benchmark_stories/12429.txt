Once upon a time there was a family, who lived together in a house. One day, the father of the family got very sick and needed to go to the hospital. So he and his family came to the hospital.
The doctor examined the father and said, “I am very sorry, but the treatment of your father will be very expensive.” 
The mother said, “We will do whatever we need to do to help him get better.”
The doctor replied, “I can see that your family loves him very much.”
So the father's family came up with a plan to help him. They all worked together to raise the money for the expensive hospital treatments. 
Finally, the money was raised, and the father got better. And they all lived happily ever after.
