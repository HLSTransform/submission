Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit who needed a place to stay. He wanted to find a nice, secure shelter. With his happy smile and fluffy fur, he set off on a journey. After a while, he came across an old shed. It was the perfect shelter; safe, strong and warm.
The rabbit went inside and made himself at home. He was happy to finally have found his home. He started fixing up the place and decorating it. He was so patient, working hard to make the place nice and cosy.
Finally, the shed was ready. He had a bright, cozy shelter where he could stay. The little rabbit was so happy; he had what he needed. He had found his shelter and could rest content.
