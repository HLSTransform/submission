Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big swamp with green water and mud. They wanted to go near it and look for frogs and bugs.
"Let's go to the swamp!" Tom said.
"No, it is too far and dirty. Mom said we should not go there." Lily said.
"Come on, it will be fun. We can pass the bridge and see what is on the other side." Tom said.
He took Lily's hand and ran to the bridge. The bridge was old and shaky. It made loud noises when they stepped on it. Lily was scared.
"Tom, I don't like this. The swamp is smelly and the bridge is broken. Let's go back." Lily said.
But Tom did not listen. He wanted to see the distant trees and flowers. He ran faster and faster. Lily tried to keep up. She did not see the hole in the bridge. She stepped on it and fell. She screamed.
"Help! Help! I'm in the swamp!" Lily cried.
Tom heard her and turned around. He saw Lily in the water. She was covered in mud and weeds. She looked sad and scared. Tom felt sorry. He ran back to the bridge and tried to help her.
"Lily, I'm sorry. I was wrong. Hold on, I'll get you out." Tom said.
He reached for her hand and pulled. Lily came out of the swamp. She was wet and dirty. She hugged Tom and cried.
"Thank you, Tom. You are a good brother. Let's go home and clean up." Lily said.
They walked back to the park. They passed the swamp and the bridge. They did not look at them. They learned their lesson. They decided to play in the sandbox instead. They were happy.
