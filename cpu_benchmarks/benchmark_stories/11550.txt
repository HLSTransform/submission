One day, a little boy named Tim found a great big hat. It was so big that it was ten inches wide. Tim thought it would be fun to wear the hat. So, he put it on his head and went outside to play.
While playing, Tim met his friend, Sue. Sue saw the hat and said, "Wow, Tim! That hat is great! Can I wear it too?" Tim smiled and said, "Sure, Sue! Let's take turns wearing the hat." So, they played together, taking turns wearing the big hat.
As they played, more and more friends came to join them. They all wanted to wear the great big hat. They laughed and played, each taking a turn with the hat. At the end of the day, they were all happy and tired. Tim and his friends had so much fun wearing the great big hat together.
