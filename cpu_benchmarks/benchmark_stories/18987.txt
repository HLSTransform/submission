Once upon a time, there was a peaceful hill. On the top of the hill, there was a big tree. Every day, a little bird would fly and sit on the tree.
One day, the little bird found a long stick. The bird wanted to carry the stick to its nest. So, it picked up the stick with its beak and started to fly.
The bird flew up to the top of the tree. It put the stick in its nest. The bird was very happy. Now, it could rest in its nest on the peaceful hill.
