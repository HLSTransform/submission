One day a little boy named John was walking through the park with his dad. His dad saw a jar on the grass and told him to go get it. John was happy and ran to the jar.
When he peeked inside, he saw a lot of coins. He was very excited and put it in his pocket. As he was walking back to his dad, he heard a harsh voice. It was a tall man who was asking if he had seen the jar. 
John became scared and leaned backwards. He wanted to get away from the man, but the man kept getting closer and closer. He asked John if he had the jar, but John shook his head. The man didn't believe him and he grabbed the jar from his pocket.
John screamed, but the man didn't stop. He took the jar and ran away. John and his dad were sad and couldn't believe what happened. They had to leave the park with no money. It was a very harsh ending.
