Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big pond with ducks and fish. Lily wanted to feed them some bread. Ben wanted to catch them with his net.
"Come on, Lily, let's catch some ducks!" Ben said.
"No, Ben, that's not nice. The ducks are living things. They have life. We should be kind to them," Lily said.
"But it's fun, Lily. Look, I caught a fish!" Ben said, holding up his net.
"Put it back, Ben. The fish needs water to breathe. It will die if you keep it," Lily said.
Ben did not listen. He wanted to keep the fish. He ran away from Lily. Lily followed him. She was angry and sad.
"Ben, stop! You are hurting the fish!" Lily shouted.
Ben ran to the bridge. He saw a big swan swimming in the pond. It was white and graceful. It looked at Ben with its black eyes.
"Wow, a swan! I want to catch it too!" Ben said.
He threw his net at the swan. But the swan was too fast and smart. It dodged the net and flapped its wings. It made a loud noise. It scared Ben.
"Help, help! The swan is angry!" Ben cried.
Lily ran to Ben. She took his net and threw it away. She hugged Ben.
"Ben, you are silly. You should not try to catch the swan. The swan is strong and proud. It does not like to be bothered. You should leave it alone. You should remain calm and quiet," Lily said.
Ben nodded. He was sorry. He said sorry to the swan. He said sorry to Lily. He said sorry to the fish. He learned his lesson.
Lily and Ben went back to the playground. They played nicely. They watched the swan swim in the pond. It was graceful and beautiful. They smiled.
