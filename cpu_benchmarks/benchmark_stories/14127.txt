Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sarah. She was very curious and loved to ask questions. One day, she asked her dad a very serious question. Her dad was so surprised that he had to pause and think very hard. He wanted to make sure he had the right answer. After a long moment of thinking, he gave Sarah a loving answer that made her happy. She smiled and said, "Thank you, Daddy!" From then on, Sarah could ask her dad any kind of question without feeling scared. She was very lucky to have a dad who was ready to answer all of her questions, no matter how serious they were.
