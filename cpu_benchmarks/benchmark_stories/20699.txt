Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was very happy. Everywhere she went she would hug. She hugged her friends and she hugged family members.
One day the little girl went to the store. There she saw something special. It was a big bottle of wine. It was very original and very sparkly.
The little girl was so excited! She wanted to hug the bottle of wine. So, she gave it a big hug. She felt so happy that she ran back home and shared the story with everyone.
The little girl became the happiest girl ever after the hug.
