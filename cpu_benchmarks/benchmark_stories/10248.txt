Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and do cartwheels in the grass. One day, Lily's mommy took her to the doctor because she was worried about her cough. The doctor said Lily needed more oxygen and gave her a little tube to breathe through. 
Lily didn't like the tube because it made her feel different, but she knew it would help her feel better. She went home and played with her toys while breathing in the oxygen. Soon, her cough went away and she felt much better. 
From then on, Lily knew that sometimes we need help to do things, like breathing oxygen when we're sick. She wasn't worried anymore because she knew her mommy and the doctor would always take care of her. The end.
