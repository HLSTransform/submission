Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big truck with a sign that said "Ice Cream". They ran to the truck and asked for some ice cream.
"What flavor do you want?" the man in the truck said.
"I want chocolate!" Lily said.
"I want vanilla!" Ben said.
The man gave them each a cone with a scoop of ice cream. They paid him with some coins that their moms had given them.
"Thank you!" they said and walked away.
They licked their ice cream and smiled. It was cold and sweet and yummy.
"This is the best ice cream ever!" Lily said.
"I agree!" Ben said.
They saw a bench and sat down to enjoy their treat. But then, they noticed something strange. There was another cone on the bench, with a scoop of ice cream that was green and had brown spots.
"Who left this here?" Lily wondered.
"I don't know. Maybe someone forgot it," Ben said.
They looked around, but they did not see anyone who looked like they owned the cone.
"Maybe we should try it," Lily said. "It might be good."
"I don't know. It looks weird," Ben said.
Lily was curious. She picked up the cone and took a small bite. She made a face.
"Yuck! This is awful!" she said. "It tastes like grass and dirt and bugs!"
She spit out the ice cream and threw the cone away.
"Are you okay?" Ben asked.
"I'm fine. But that was the worst ice cream ever!" Lily said.
They hugged each other and decided to never try unknown ice cream again. They finished their own ice cream and threw away their cones.
They learned a lesson that day. They learned that not all ice cream is good, and that some things have no value. They also learned to be happy with what they have, and to share it with their friends.
