One day, a big number war happened. In this war, all the numbers wanted to be the best. The number one was very alert. It saw that the other numbers were fighting. It did not like the war. It wanted all the numbers to be friends.
The number one had a good idea. It said, "Let's play a game instead of fighting!" All the other numbers liked the idea. They stopped the war and started to play. They played games like hide and seek, and tag. The numbers had a lot of fun.
In the end, the numbers became friends. They learned that it was better to play together than to fight. The number one was happy that it could help. The numbers promised to always be alert and not let a war happen again.
