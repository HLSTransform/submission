Lily and Ben went to the zoo with their mom. They wanted to see the pandas, because they liked their black and white fur and their round ears. Mom bought them some ice cream and they walked to the panda enclosure.
"Look, there they are!" Lily said, pointing to two pandas that were eating bamboo. "They are so cute and fluffy!"
Ben nodded and licked his ice cream. He observed the pandas carefully. He noticed that one of them had a pink spot on its nose. He wondered why.
"Mom, why does that panda have a pink nose?" he asked.
Mom looked at the panda and frowned. She did not know the answer. She saw a sign that said "Do not feed the pandas. They have a special diet."
"Maybe it is sick, or maybe it ate something it should not have," she said. "Let's ask the zookeeper."
They walked to a man who wore a green shirt and a hat. He had a bucket of food for the pandas.
"Excuse me, sir, can we ask you a question?" Mom said.
The zookeeper smiled and nodded.
"Sure, what do you want to know?" he said.
Ben pointed to the panda with the pink nose.
"Why does that panda have a pink nose?" he said.
The zookeeper looked at the panda and gasped. He dropped his bucket and ran to the enclosure.
"Oh no, this is bad, this is very bad!" he said. "That panda is allergic to strawberries! Someone must have given it some!"
He opened the gate and went inside. He tried to help the panda, but it was too late. The panda was breathing hard and its eyes were closed. It did not move.
Lily and Ben watched in horror. They felt sad and scared. They did not understand what was happening.
Mom hugged them and took them away.
"Come on, let's go home," she said. "The zookeeper will take care of the panda. Maybe it will be okay."
But the panda was not okay. It died from the strawberries. It was the last panda in the zoo. The zookeeper cried and blamed himself. He wished he had been more careful. He wished he had seen the pink nose sooner. He wished he had saved the panda.
