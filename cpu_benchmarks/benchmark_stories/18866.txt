Lily and Ben were twins. They liked to play with their toys and books. But one day, their mom said they had to go to the store. Lily and Ben did not like the store. It was big and loud and boring.
Mom put them in the car and drove to the store. She gave them each a snack and a drink. She said they had to be good and stay with her. Lily and Ben nodded, but they were not happy.
At the store, Mom pushed a big cart and put things in it. Lily and Ben had to sit in the cart. They saw many things, but they could not touch them. They heard many voices, but they could not talk to them. They felt miserable.
Lily and Ben started to whine and cry. They wanted to go home. They wanted to play. Mom tried to calm them down, but they did not listen. They made a lot of noise. Mom felt sad and tired.
Finally, Mom paid for the things and left the store. She put Lily and Ben back in the car. She said she was sorry they had a bad time. She said she loved them. She said they could play when they got home. Lily and Ben said they were sorry too. They said they loved her. They said they would be good next time. Mom smiled and hugged them. They felt better.
