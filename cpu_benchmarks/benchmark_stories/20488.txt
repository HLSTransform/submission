One morning, the sun was shining very brightly. A man and a woman wanted to do something fun outdoors. They said to each other, "Let's build something!" 
The man and woman started working together. They brought out some wood and tools. The man used his hammer and nails to build a strong frame. The woman found some fabric and made a screen.
When they were done, the screen was bright. It glowed in the morning sun. The man and woman were very proud of their work. They put a chair next to the screen and relaxed. It was a beautiful place to sit and enjoy the sunshine.
The man and woman enjoyed their new outdoor space. Every day, they would come out and sit in the chair under the bright screen. They would watch the birds and listen to the sounds of nature. It was a peaceful place to relax.
