Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside and run around with his friends. One day, Timmy saw a big flag waving in the wind. It was very colorful and had stars and stripes on it. 
Timmy went up to his mom and asked, "Mommy, what is that flag?" 
His mom replied, "That is the original flag of our country. It represents our freedom and hard work." 
Timmy thought about this for a moment and then said, "I want to work hard too, like the people who made that flag." 
His mom smiled and said, "You can work hard by doing your best in everything you do, even when you play with your friends." 
Timmy nodded his head and ran back outside to play. He felt proud knowing that he could work hard and be like the people who made the original flag.
