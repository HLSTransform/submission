Once upon a time, in a hot summer, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to play outside with his toys. He had a red ball that he thought was very useful. He could play with it all day long.
One day, Tim saw a big ice cream truck. He wanted to eat some ice cream, but he knew he should resist. His mom told him not to eat too much ice cream or he would get a tummy ache. So, Tim tried to be good and not eat ice cream.
Tim played with his red ball, and he forgot about the ice cream truck. He had fun in the summer sun. At the end of the day, his mom was happy he resisted the ice cream. She gave him a small treat for being good.
