Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She wanted to succeed in everything she did, but she was often too scared to try. She wanted to climb the highest tree in the forest, but it looked too difficult.
Another day, she decided to give it a try. It was hard to climb, but she pushed through. With each root, she pulled her way higher and higher until she could see the very top.
She looked down, and it seemed so far away. She was scared. But then she thought of all the people who had cheered her on and encouraged her. She thought of how proud theyâ€™d be.
So she kept climbing. She kept climbing until she reached the top. She had done it! She had succeeded. She was so proud of herself, and everyone was so proud of her too. They all cheered and celebrated her hard work and determination.
She had many more difficult tasks to come but she knew that if she worked hard enough, she could succeed.
