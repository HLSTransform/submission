Once upon a time, in a peaceful little town, there lived a girl named Lily. Lily was a kind girl who liked to help people feel better. One day, she saw her mom come home from work with a frown on her face. Lily wanted to help her mom feel happy again.
Lily thought of a way to make her mom smile. She asked her mom to sit down and close her eyes. Then, Lily began to give her mom a gentle massage on her shoulders. She rubbed her mom's shoulders slowly and softly.
As Lily gave the massage, her mom started to feel more and more relaxed. The frown on her mom's face went away, and soon she was smiling again. Lily felt happy that she could help her mom feel better. They both hugged and enjoyed the peaceful evening together.
