Bob was a little boy. He was very shy. He was walking in the woods one day when he saw something beautiful.
"What is that?" he asked.
"That's a flame!" said a voice from the tree. Bob looked up and saw a little blue bird perched on a branch above him.
"Hi!" said Bob.
"Hi!" said the little blue bird. "Would you like to grab the flame?"
Bob was too shy to reach up and grab the flame. He shook his head and said, "No, I'm too scared."
The little blue bird smiled. "You don't have to be scared," it said. "I will help you."
The little blue bird flew down and grabbed the flame with its beak. It flew back to the branch and set the flame down beside Bob.
"There," said the little blue bird. "Now you can take the flame and take it home with you."
Bob smiled and gently grabbed the flame. He thanked the little blue bird and continued on his way, feeling much less shy.
