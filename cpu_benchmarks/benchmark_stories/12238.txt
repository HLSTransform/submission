"Mommy, I want to pay for the cookies!", said the little boy. 
"Yes, sweetie, you can pay for something but first we have to go home, okay?", replied Mommy. 
The little boy smiled and nodded and the family walked down the street together. 
The sun was sinking lower and the sky started to turn deep blue. 
The family walked into their home and the little boy ran to his room. 
Mommy followed and saw him counting coins from his piggy bank. 
"What are you doing, sweetie?", asked Mommy. 
The little boy looked up and said happily, "I'm paying for the cookies! I want to show my family how much I love them." 
Mommy smiled and scooped the little boy up into her arms. She said "That's so sweet of you! I love how deep your love is for us." 
The little boy smiled and snuggled close to Mommy. 
The family went back out and the little boy paid for the cookies with his coins. 
The family shared the cookies together, each with a smile on their face.
