Once upon a time, there was a wheat field. In this wheat field, there was a very shy rabbit. The rabbit loved to hop around the field and eat the wheat.
One day, the rabbit saw something very strange. Something was moving in the wheat! The rabbit hopped up close to see what it was.
It was a group of little ants! The ants were parting the wheat and carrying it away. The rabbit was so curious, but it was too shy to join the ants.
So, instead, the rabbit just watched the ants from afar. They kept parting the wheat and carrying it away. The rabbit watched for a long time, until it was almost nightfall. 
Then, the ants all stopped and went home. But the rabbit still remembered the ants parting the wheat.
