Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl named Ruby. She didn't have a lot of money, but she was very brave. One day,Ruby saw an old shield in the street. She knelt down to pick it up and noticed that it was heavy. 
Ruby decided to take the shield home with her. She got an old stick and used it as a handle. She then took the shield and leaned it against the wall. 
When Ruby went to bed that night, she felt a little bit safer. She knew the shield would help protect her in case anything bad happened. 
The next day, Ruby went to the park with her shield. She was so proud to show it off to her friends. She even pretended to be a knight and ran around, trying to keep everyone safe with her old shield. 
Ruby kept the shield as protection for many years. It made her feel safe and brave, even when things were scary. 
The end.
