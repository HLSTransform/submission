One day, a little dog named Max went to the park to play. He saw his friend, a cat named Luna, playing with a ball. Max was excited and wanted to join Luna. But Max had a problem. He had just rolled in something disgusting and smelly. He didn't want Luna to see him like this.
Max hid behind a bush and called out to Luna, "Luna, I want to play, but I'm too embarrassed!" Luna looked around and asked, "Why are you embarrassed, Max?" Max replied, "I rolled in something yucky and smelly. I don't want you to see me like this."
Luna was a good friend. She said, "Don't worry, Max. We all get dirty sometimes. Let's go to the water and wash you off. Then we can play together." Max was happy and grateful for Luna's help. They went to the water, washed off the disgusting smell, and played together all day. From that day on, Max knew that true friends would always be there to help, no matter what.
