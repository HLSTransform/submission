Once upon a time there lived a poor family. They had one child, a three-year-old girl called Ella. One day, it began to rain outside. Ella was so excited - she had never seen rain before! 
Mama looked out the window and said, "Let's go outside and play in the rain!" Ella quickly put on her coat and ran outside. She laughed and smiled as the rain fell down around her.
Mama said, "Let's play a game! How about we count the raindrops?" Ella loved this idea, so she began counting.
Time seemed to fly by as Ella and Mama had fun in the rain. Soon, it was time for Ella to go to school. Mama said, "I'm so proud of you, Ella! Even though we're poor, you still get to go to school and learn new things. I'm so happy for you." 
Ella gave her Mama a big hug before she went off to school. She was so excited to learn new things and tell her mama all about it when she got home.
