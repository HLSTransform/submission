Ben and Sam are friends. They like to play with rockets. They have a big rocket toy in the backyard. They want to go to the moon.
"Are you ready, Sam?" Ben asks.
"Yes, I am ready, Ben," Sam says.
They get inside the rocket. They push the buttons. The rocket makes a loud noise. It starts to go up.
"Wow, we are going to the moon!" Ben says.
"Yay, we are going to the moon!" Sam says.
But the rocket is not a good rocket. It is a bad rocket. It goes too fast. It goes too high. It goes out of the backyard. It goes out of the town. It goes out of the world.
"Help, help!" Ben says.
"Help, help!" Sam says.
But no one can hear them. No one can see them. No one can help them. They are lost in space. They are scared. They are sad. They are not going to the moon. They are not going to come back. The end.
