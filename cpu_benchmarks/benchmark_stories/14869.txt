Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go to the beach with her mommy and daddy. One day, she went to the beach with her family and saw a big sandcastle. She wanted to play in it, but her mommy said it was too late and they had to go home soon.
Lily was sad and said, "I want to stay longer and play in the sandcastle." Her daddy said, "Don't lie, Lily. We have to go home now." Lily felt stupid for asking and went home with her family. But the next day, they went back to the beach and Lily got to play in the sandcastle all day long. She was so happy and thanked her mommy and daddy for taking her to the beach.
