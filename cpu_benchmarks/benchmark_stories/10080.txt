Lily wanted to make a card for daddy. She found some paper, crayons and glue. She drew a big heart and wrote "I love you" with her best letters. She wanted to attach a sticker of a flower, but she could not find one.
She looked around the room and saw a shiny button on the floor. She picked it up and thought it would look nice on the card. She put some glue on the button and tried to attach it to the paper. But the button was too heavy and it fell off. Lily tried again and again, but the button always fell off.
She started to feel sad and scared. What if daddy did not like her card? What if he thought she was bad at making things? She wanted to cry, but then she heard daddy's voice. He was coming home from work.
She ran to the door and hugged him. "Daddy, daddy, I made you a card, but it is not good. The button keeps falling off. I'm sorry, daddy."
Daddy smiled and kissed her. "Lily, I love your card. It is very beautiful and special. The button is not a problem. We can attach it together. Do you want to help me?"
Lily nodded and smiled. She felt happy and proud. She and daddy went to the table and found some tape. They attached the button to the card with the tape. It stayed on. Lily gave the card to daddy and he hugged her.
"Thank you, Lily. This is the best card ever. You are very good at making things. And I love you very much."
