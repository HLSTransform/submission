Once upon a time, there was a jolly cat named Tom. Tom liked to play with his friend, a tiny mouse named Tim. They lived in a small house near a big tree. They were very happy.
One day, Tom found a bottle with a bad thing called poison. Tom did not know what poison was. He thought it was a toy. So, he took it to Tim and said, "Look, I found a new toy for us to play with!"
Tim knew what poison was. He said, "No, Tom! That is not a toy. It is poison, and it is bad for us. We must replace it with a safe toy." So, Tom and Tim went to the store and replaced the poison with a fun, new ball.
Now, Tom and Tim play with their new ball every day. They are still very jolly and happy friends. And they know to stay away from poison.
