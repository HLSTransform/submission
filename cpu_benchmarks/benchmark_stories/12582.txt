Tim and Sam are brothers. They like to play with paper and make things. One day, they find a toy laser in their dad's room. It is shiny and red and makes a funny sound.
"Let's play with the laser!" Tim says. He takes the laser and points it at the wall. He sees a bright dot on the wall. He moves the laser and the dot moves too.
"Wow, that's cool!" Sam says. He wants to try the laser too. He asks Tim to share the laser with him. But Tim does not want to share. He says, "No, it's mine! I found it first!"
Sam feels sad and angry. He thinks Tim is mean. He goes to his room and finds some paper. He decides to make something with the paper. He folds the paper and makes a plane. He folds the paper again and makes a star. He folds the paper some more and makes a flower. He likes to fold paper. He thinks it is fun and creative.
He goes to show his paper things to Tim. He hopes Tim will like them and play with him. He knocks on Tim's door and says, "Look, Tim, I made some paper things. Do you want to see them?"
Tim opens the door and sees Sam's paper things. He thinks they are pretty and nice. He feels sorry for being mean to Sam. He says, "Wow, Sam, you made some paper things. They are sweet. I'm sorry I did not share the laser with you. Do you want to play with the laser now?"
Sam smiles and says, "Yes, I want to play with the laser. But can we also play with the paper things? I can show you how to fold them. It is easy and fun."
Tim nods and says, "Yes, let's play with the paper things too. I want to learn how to fold them. It is good to share and learn new things."
They hug and go to play with the laser and the paper things. They have a lot of fun and laugh together. They are happy and good brothers.
