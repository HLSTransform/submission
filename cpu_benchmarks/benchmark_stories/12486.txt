Anna and Ben were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to pass the ball to each other and catch it. Sometimes they threw the ball very high and watched it fly in the sky.
One day, they saw a giant walking in the park. He was very big and tall, and he had a long beard and a big hat. He looked scary, but he was not mean. He was harmless. He just liked to walk and see the flowers and the trees.
"Hello, little ones," the giant said to Anna and Ben. "Do you want to play with me?"
Anna and Ben were afraid of the giant. They did not know what to do. They held their ball tight and hid behind a bench.
"Don't be scared," the giant said. "I won't hurt you. I just want to have some fun. Can I pass the ball with you?"
Anna and Ben looked at each other. They saw that the giant had a kind smile and a gentle voice. They decided to give him a chance.
"Okay," Anna said. "But you have to be careful. Don't throw the ball too hard or too far."
"Of course," the giant said. "I will be gentle. Thank you for playing with me."
Anna and Ben came out from behind the bench and passed the ball to the giant. The giant passed the ball back to them. They had a lot of fun. They laughed and talked and made a new friend. The giant was not scary at all. He was harmless.
