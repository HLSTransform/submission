Once upon a time there was a girl named Sophie. Sophie needed to hurry. She wanted to go underground. She was looking for something very deep. 
So Sophie quickly put on her hat and grabbed her shovel. She ran to the meadow and started to dig. It was difficult work, but she kept going. 
The hole got deeper and deeper until Sophie reached the bottom. There was a big surprise! Inside was a long and dark tunnel. 
Sophie quickly got inside and started to crawl. Suddenly the tunnel opened up and the ground became sandy. There was a beach and an ocean! 
Sophie was so excited that she shouted with joy and started to run. She had found the deep underground ocean and she would never forget this special day.
