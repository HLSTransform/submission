Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very nervous to go on a big airplane ride with her mommy and daddy. When they got on the airplane, Lily sat in her seat and held onto her mommy's hand very tight. She hoped that the airplane ride would be over soon.
As the airplane took off, Lily's tummy felt funny, but she tried to be brave. She looked out the window and saw the clouds and the sun. It was very pretty! Lily's mommy gave her a snack and some juice, which made her feel better. She hoped that the airplane ride would be fun after all.
After a little while, the airplane landed safely and Lily was so happy! She had a great time on her first airplane ride and she wasn't nervous anymore. She hoped that she could go on another airplane ride soon! The end.
