Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to play chess with his grandpa. They played every day after lunch. Tim was very good at chess, but his grandpa always won.
One day, Tim noticed that his grandpa's teeth were starting to rot. He was worried and asked, "Grandpa, why are your teeth turning black?" His grandpa replied, "I haven't been honest with you, Tim. I eat too much candy and don't brush my teeth enough."
Tim was sad to hear this, but he knew he had to help his grandpa. So, he made a plan. He would give his grandpa a toothbrush and remind him to brush his teeth after eating candy.
The next day, Tim's grandpa thanked him for being honest and helping him take care of his teeth. They played chess again, but this time Tim won. His grandpa was proud of him and said, "You're getting better every day, Tim!"
