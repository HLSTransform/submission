Once upon a time there was a boy named Tom. Tom was three years old and he loved motorcycles. He dreamt every night of being able to ride one.
One day, Tom told his mom about his dream. His mom smiled and said, “If you really believe, Tom, your dream can come true.”
Tom was so excited. Every day he asked his mom if it was time for him to ride a motorcycle. His mom said he was too small.
One day, Tom's mom took him to a store. Tom saw a flexible motorcycle nearby. He looked up at his mom and said, “Will I be able to ride this one, Mommy?”
His mom smiled and said, “Yes! You just have to believe, Tom.”
Tom smiled and hopped onto the motorcycle. He was so excited he couldn't believe it. He rode around the store, feeling like the luckiest boy in the world. From that day on, Tom never stopped believing in his dreams.
