Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park, read books, and eat blueberries. One day, Ben told Lily that he had to travel with his family. He said they were going to a far place and he would not come back for a long time.
Lily was very sad. She did not want Ben to go. She said, "Ben, please stay with me. We can have more fun here. I will miss you a lot."
Ben hugged Lily and said, "Lily, I will miss you too. But I have to go with my family. They need me. Maybe we can write letters to each other. And I will bring you a gift when I come back."
Lily nodded and tried to smile. She gave Ben a bag of blueberries. She said, "Ben, these are for you. They are your favorite. You can eat them on the way. They will make you happy."
Ben thanked Lily and took the bag. He said, "Lily, you are very kind. These are the best blueberries ever. I will think of you when I eat them. You are my favorite friend."
Lily and Ben said goodbye and waved to each other. Ben got in the car with his family and drove away. Lily watched him until he was out of sight. She felt a tear roll down her cheek. She hoped Ben would come back soon. She went home and hugged her teddy bear. She wished she could travel with Ben.
