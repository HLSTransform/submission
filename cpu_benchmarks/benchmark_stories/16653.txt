Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she went for a walk and came across a creek. The water was moving and it made a funny sound. Lily wanted to touch the water, but her mom urged her to be careful.
Lily saw some orange flowers growing near the creek. They were so pretty! She wanted to pick them, but her mom urged her not to. Lily listened to her mom and just looked at the flowers instead. They were still very beautiful.
As the sun started to set, Lily and her mom headed back home. Lily was happy because she got to see the creek and the orange flowers. She promised her mom that she would always be careful near water and not pick flowers without asking first.
