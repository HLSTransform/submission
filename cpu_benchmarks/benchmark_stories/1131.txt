Once upon a time there was a generous temple. People liked to spend time there to be peaceful.
One day a little 3-year-old girl went to the temple. She was very excited. She asked her mommy and daddy if she could stay and play. 
They said yes, so she ran around the temple, looking at all the pretty flowers and a softly-flowing river. She even saw animals from far away and a big tree with so many birds in it. 
After a while she decided to spend some time with her mom and dad. They were all very happy to have had a special day together. 
The generous temple was happy too and gave them a special gift of love to take home. 
The little girl thanked the temple and promised to come back soon to visit.
