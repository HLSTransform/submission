Once upon a time, there was a big bull. He was very thirsty and wanted to drink some water. He walked to the river, but the water was not ready for him to drink. He saw a little boy playing nearby and asked, "Can you help me, please? I want to drink some water, but it's not ready for me." 
The boy said, "Sure, I can help you. Let me get my bucket." He ran to his house and returned with a small bucket. He filled it with water and gave it to the bull. The bull drank the water and felt much better. 
"Thank you so much," said the bull. "You are very kind." 
The boy smiled and said, "I'm happy to help. Do you want me to get you some more water?" 
The bull nodded and said, "Yes, please. I am still very thirsty." The boy filled the bucket again and the bull drank some more water. He was now ready to go back to his farm. He said goodbye to the boy and walked away, feeling happy and refreshed.
