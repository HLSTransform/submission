Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Poppy. Poppy was shy, so she didn't like it when new things happened. But every day, Poppy wanted to learn something new.
One day, Poppy went for a walk and saw a lot of new things. She was scared, but her Mum and Dad said it would be fun. Poppy took a deep breath and started to learn.
She saw the trees, with the long green leaves, and the birds flying in the sky. Then she saw a bright red poppy in a meadow. She was so excited and started laughing.
After a while, Poppy and her Mum and Dad went home. Poppy was happy because she had learned something new today. She realized that it was fun to explore and see new things. 
To remind her of this day, Poppy's parents gave her a toy poppy. She was so happy, and vowed to keep exploring so she could learn new things every day.
