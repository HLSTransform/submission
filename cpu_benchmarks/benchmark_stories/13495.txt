Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dream about going on a tour of the world. She imagined seeing big mountains, little animals, and colorful flowers.
One day, Lily's parents surprised her with a little suitcase and said they were going on a tour! She was so excited that she couldn't stop jumping up and down. They went on a big airplane and flew to many different places.
At night, Lily would dream about all the little things she saw during the day. She dreamed about the little monkeys she saw in the jungle and the little fish she saw in the ocean. She was so happy to be on this tour with her family.
