Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she saw a big tornado coming towards her house. She was scared and didn't know what to do. 
But then, her dad came to her and said, "Don't worry, Lily. I am here to protect you. I have a reliable plan to keep us safe." And he did. They went to the basement and waited until the tornado passed.
After the storm, Lily realized how important it is to have someone reliable in your life. Her dad succeeded in keeping them safe because he was there for her when she needed him the most. From that day on, Lily knew that she could always count on her dad to keep her safe and sound.
