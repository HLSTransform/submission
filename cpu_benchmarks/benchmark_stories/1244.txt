Anna was playing in her backyard when she heard something fall. She looked around and saw a big ball rolling down the hill. Anna ran to chase it and suddenly it rolled through a hole in the fence. She followed and found herself in a dark and scary place.
Anna was scared, but she wanted her ball back. She could see a bright light at the end of a tunnel and decided to go toward it. When she reached the end, she saw a scary monster standing in front of a movie screen! Anna was surprised, but she was brave.
The monster smiled and held out her ball. Anna was relieved and ran to catch it. Then the monster said, "Let's watch a movie!" Anna was scared at first, but then she remembered how much she liked watching movies. She smiled and the two of them watched the movie together.
