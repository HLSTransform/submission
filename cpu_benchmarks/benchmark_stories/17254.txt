Once upon a time, there was a big octopus in the ocean. He had eight long arms and loved to swim around. One day, he saw a little fish swimming by and wanted to eat it. But the fish tried to resist and swim away. The octopus chased after the fish, but the fish was too fast. Eventually, the octopus got tired and gave up. He realized it wasn't nice to eat other sea creatures and decided to be friends with the fish instead. From that day on, they swam together in the ocean and had lots of fun.
