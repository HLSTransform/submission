Anna loves to play basketball with her big brother Tom. She likes to bounce the ball and try to throw it in the hoop. Tom is very good at basketball and he teaches Anna how to play.
One day, they go to the park to play basketball with their friends. Anna is very excited to play with the big kids. She wants to show them how good she is at basketball. She runs after the ball and tries to catch it.
But then, a big dog comes to the park. The dog is very loud and runs very fast. He barks at the kids and chases the ball. Anna is very scared of the dog. She drops the ball and runs to Tom. She hugs him and cries.
Tom sees the dog and he is not scared. He knows the dog is just playing and he is not mean. He picks up the ball and throws it to the dog. The dog catches the ball and wags his tail. He brings the ball back to Tom and drops it. He licks Tom's hand and wags his tail again.
Tom smiles and pets the dog. He tells Anna that the dog is friendly and he just wants to play. He asks Anna if she wants to pet the dog too. Anna looks at the dog and sees that he is not scary. He is just big and loud. She wipes her tears and nods. She reaches out and touches the dog's fur. The dog licks her face and wags his tail. Anna giggles and pets the dog. She is not scared anymore. She is happy. She thanks Tom for helping her. She picks up the ball and throws it to the dog. The dog runs after the ball and brings it back. Anna and Tom play basketball with the dog and their friends. They have a lot of fun.
