Lila and Ben were playing outside with their toys. They liked to make sand castles and pretend they were kings and queens. They had a big bucket of salt that they used to make the sand stick together.
But then the sky became dark and gray. Lila heard a loud noise. It was thunder. She was scared of thunder. She grabbed her toys and ran to the house.
"Ben, come on! It's going to rain!" she shouted.
But Ben did not listen. He wanted to finish his sand castle. He said he was not scared of thunder. He said rain was fun.
"Rain can't hurt me. Rain is just water. I like water. I don't need to go inside," he said.
Lila was worried about Ben. She did not want him to get wet and cold. She did not want him to lose his toys. She did not want him to be alone.
She ran back to him and tried to pull him to the house.
"Ben, please! You can finish your sand castle later. You can play with me inside. We can read a book or draw a picture. It's not safe to stay outside," she said.
But Ben did not want to go. He pushed Lila away. He said he did not need her. He said he was big and brave.
"Go away, Lila! You are a baby. You are scared of everything. I don't want to play with you. I want to play with my sand castle. It's the best sand castle ever. You can't tell me what to do," he said.
Lila felt sad and angry. She did not like how Ben talked to her. She did not like how he pushed her. She did not like how he did not care about her.
She turned around and ran to the house. She did not look back.
But then the rain came. It came fast and hard. It washed away Ben's sand castle. It washed away his toys. It washed away his salt. It made him wet and cold.
Ben cried. He wished he had listened to Lila. He wished he had gone inside with her. He wished he had been nice to her.
He ran to the house. He knocked on the door. He hoped Lila would open it. He hoped she would forgive him. He hoped she would still be his friend.
Moral: Listen to your friends when they try to help you. Don't be rude or mean to them. They care about you and want you to be safe and happy.
