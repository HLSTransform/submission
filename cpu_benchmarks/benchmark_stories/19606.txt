Once upon a time there was a puppy called Sunshine. Sunshine was very playful and loved to keep running around.
One day, Sunshine went to the park with her family. Sunshine saw birds flying in the sky and smiled. The sun was so bright and so was Sunshine! 
Sunshine kept running around and playing in the grass. She chased a butterfly until she got tired, then lay down in the sunshine and took a nap.
Once she was feeling better, Sunshine and her family kept playing in the park. They ran after each other and laughed together. They took turns playing catch with a ball and even built a sandcastle.
Finally, the sun started to set and it was time to head home. Sunshine felt very happy and content - she had enjoyed a day of being playful in the sunshine.
