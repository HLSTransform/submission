Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited to go to her grandma's house. She packed her bag and went to the car with her mom and dad. They drove for a long time and finally arrived at grandma's house.
When they got inside, Lily saw a big cupboard in the kitchen. She asked her grandma, "What's in the cupboard?" Her grandma replied, "That's where I keep all my dishes and cups."
Lily was grateful when her grandma gave her a cup to drink from. She said, "Thank you, grandma! This cup is so pretty." They all sat down and had some cookies and milk. Lily was very happy to be with her family and couldn't wait to come back again.
