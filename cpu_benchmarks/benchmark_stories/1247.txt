Once upon a time, there was a bald man. He woke up in the morning and looked up at the sky. The sky was as blue as could be and it made the man happy. 
He decided to go for a walk. He went to the park, and there was an empty pitch. He sat down and watched the birds  rising in the sky. They were so pretty and graceful. He was mesmerized by their beauty.
Suddenly, he felt something shift underneath him. What was it? The pitch was rising! He could not believe his eyes! He got up and saw that the pitch had risen to a more comfortable level. He was so happy and couldn't believe his luck.
The bald man sat down and looked up at the sky once more. He was so astonished by his luck. He thanked God for this miracle and decided to never forget it. He would always remember the rising pitch and the birds soaring in the sky.
