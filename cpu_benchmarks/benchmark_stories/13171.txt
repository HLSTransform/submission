Once upon a time there was a wild cat. He loved to use his surprise. Every day he would use it to explore the world outside his house.
One day the cat explored a part of the woods he had never seen before. He saw a huge surprise. It was a wild fox. The cat was so excited and ran to the fox. The fox jumped and used its surprise to escape.
The cat was sad that the fox ran away. He promised himself to always use his surprise for good and not to run away from new things. He had to be brave and explore the wild world around him.
In the end, the cat was happy and enjoyed the surprise of discovering new things. He had learned a valuable lesson.
