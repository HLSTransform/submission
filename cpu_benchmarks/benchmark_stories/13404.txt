Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she found an unusual rock that she had never seen before. She wondered where it came from and what it was made of.
As she played with the rock, she noticed that it started to change. It became smaller and smoother. Lily was amazed by this and wondered how it was possible. She realized that even though things may seem unusual and strange, they can still change and become something new.
Lily learned that change can be a good thing and that sometimes we need to wonder and explore to discover new things. She decided to keep the rock as a reminder to always be curious and open to change.
