One day, a little boy named Tim found a rubber ball in his toy box. He was so happy because he loved to play with it. Tim took the ball outside to play.
In the yard, he met his friend, Sam, who was very intelligent. Sam knew how to whisper. He said, "Let's play a game with the ball." Tim and Sam whispered to each other to plan their game.
They threw the ball back and forth, laughing and having fun. The rubber ball was bouncy and made them smile. They played until it was time for dinner. Tim and Sam whispered "bye" to each other and went home. They couldn't wait to play with the rubber ball again tomorrow.
