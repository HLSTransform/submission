Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play in their room. They had many toys and books and games, but they also liked to try on their parents' clothes. They thought it was fun to wear big hats and coats and shoes and pretend to be different people.
One day, they found a key on the floor. They wondered what it could unlock. They looked around and saw a big trunk in the corner of the room. They had never opened it before. They decided to try the key on the trunk. It fit and they turned it. The trunk unlocked with a click.
They opened the trunk and saw many unusual clothes inside. They were colorful and shiny and had strange patterns and shapes. They were very different from the clothes they usually wore. They were curious and excited. They took out some of the clothes and put them on. They laughed and danced and made funny noises.
"Look at me, I'm a king!" Tim said, wearing a purple robe and a golden crown.
"And I'm a clown!" Sam said, wearing a red nose and a polka-dot suit.
They had so much fun that they did not hear their mom calling them for lunch. She came to their room and saw them in the unusual clothes. She was surprised and angry.
"Tim and Sam, what are you doing?" she asked. "These are not your clothes. These are your grandparents' clothes. They are very special and old. You should not play with them. You could damage them or lose them. They are part of our family history. You should respect them and put them back in the trunk. And you should not unlock things that are not yours. You should ask permission first. Do you understand?"
Tim and Sam felt ashamed and sorry. They realized they had done something wrong. They took off the unusual clothes and put them back in the trunk. They locked it and gave the key to their mom. They apologized and hugged her.
"We're sorry, mom. We didn't know. We were just curious and wanted to have fun. We won't do it again. We love you and we love our grandparents. Can you tell us more about them and their clothes?" they asked.
Their mom smiled and forgave them. She was glad they learned their lesson. She told them stories about their grandparents and their clothes. She explained why they were unusual and what they meant. She showed them pictures and souvenirs. She said they could look at them again, but only with her. Tim and Sam listened and asked questions. They felt happy and proud to know more about their family. They understood that some things are not for playing, but for remembering and honoring. They thanked their mom and gave her a kiss. They went to have lunch and then played with their own toys and clothes. They still had fun, but they also had respect.
