Once upon a time, in a bright sunny day, a little dog went out to play. He liked to run and jump in the park. The little dog was very happy.
While playing, the little dog found a red ball. He did not know who the ball belonged to. He wanted to find the owner of the ball. The little dog picked up the ball and started to look for the owner.
The little dog showed the red ball to many people in the park. At last, he found a little girl who was looking for her ball. She was the owner! The little girl was very happy and thanked the little dog. They played with the red ball together and had a lot of fun.
