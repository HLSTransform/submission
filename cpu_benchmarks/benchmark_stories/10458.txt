Once, there were two cats. They were friends, but one day, they got in a fight. They started to swat at each other hard and hiss. 
One of the cats quickly ran and hid under the bed. Then, the other cat got a big spray bottle. He started to spray it at the cat under the bed. 
The cat was scared and wouldn't come out. He sprayed more and more and said, "Go away!" 
Finally, the other cat was so scared that he ran away. The first cat was very happy and he stayed under the bed all day until it was safe.
