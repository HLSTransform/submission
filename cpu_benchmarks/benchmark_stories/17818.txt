Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved playing in his tent. It was big and red and he had lots of fun inside. One day, he asked his mum if he could polish it. She said he could, so the little boy got to work straight away.
The boy was very pleased with his work, it shone brightly in the sun. He was so happy and he couldn't wait to go back inside his tent. As he stepped inside, he noticed something funny. His mum had hung lots of different coloured lights from the roof.
The little boy laughed and began to jump up and down. His mum had made the tent even more fun for him! He knew that he would have lots of exciting adventures there. The little boy was very happy and gave the tent one last polish.
