Once upon a time there was a beautiful girl. She had twinkling eyes and long, dark hair. 
Every morning the girl would put on her clothes. She especially loved to dress in pretty dresses and skirts. All of her friends would often compliment her outfits, telling her how lovely she looked. 
One morning, the girl put on a dress that was very special. It was bright and sparkly and made her feel like a princess. Her eyes shone with joy as she looked at herself in the mirror. 
When she went outside all of the birds sang to her and the butterflies flew around her. Even the sun seemed to be shining brighter than ever. Everyone around her said, "What a pretty dress!"
The girl twirled, danced and laughed all day. This was a special day that she would never forget. From that day on, the girl made sure to dress in her most beautiful and special clothes every day.
