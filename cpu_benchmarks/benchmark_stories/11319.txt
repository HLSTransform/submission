Once upon a time, there was a loud inchworm. He lived in the garden and was friendly to the other animals around him. One day, a storm came to his garden and he needed help. He wriggled his inch-long body and called out for help, but no one heard him.
The inchworm was feeling scared and lonely, but suddenly he heard a voice coming from the sky. It was a kind voice, saying "I can help you". Looking up, he saw a beautiful butterfly fluttering in the sky. She said that she could unite her friends and protect the inchworm.
The butterfly flew around and soon a group of loud birds, bustling bees and singing frogs had come together. With all of their strength, they surrounded the inchworm and helped shelter him until the storm had gone.
The inchworm was so happy that he had made friends and all their help wanted them to be. He thanked the butterfly and they all stayed together as one big happy family. The inchworm realised that it is always better to unite and be kind.
