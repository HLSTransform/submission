Once upon a time, there was a wise old man. Every day, he would stretch his legs in the morning and always have lots of energy to do his chores. He had an old mop that he used to clean up, but he was getting tired of it.
One day, the old man was so fed up that he went out and bought a new mop. The mop was bigger, better, and more efficient than his old one. So he decided to throw away his old one.
That night, a little boy knocked on his door. He said he had been looking for his old mop, but he couldn't find it anywhere. When the old man told him he had thrown it out, the little boy started to cry. 
The old man could feel guilty so he asked the little boy why the mop was important to him. The little boy explained to him that it belonged to his grandmother and that it was very special to him. The old man suddenly felt regret for his actions.
But it was too late and the bad deed was already done. The old man was not so wise after all.
