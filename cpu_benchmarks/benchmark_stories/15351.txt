Joey was a young boy who was always told to trust. He was taught to trust adults, friends and himself. One day Joey wanted to try something new. He saw a lemon in the pantry and decided to try it. 
Joey picked up the lemon and felt how smooth it was. Even though it wasn't something he was used to tasting, he remembered to trust his decisions. He took a bite and discovered a very sour taste. His face went sour too! 
Joey was surprised by the taste, but he remembered something his mom taught him. He remembered to trust his judgement, even when he felt scared or unsure. So Joey bravely tried the lemon again and eventually learned to enjoy the sour taste. Joey's trust in himself was what helped him to have a positive experience.
