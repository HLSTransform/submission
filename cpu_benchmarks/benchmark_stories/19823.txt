Once upon a time, there was an ancient castle. Inside it was the best treasure of all. A princess lived in the castle too. One day, a big mean thief came and tried to take the treasure away.
The princess was scared, until a brave knight came and saved the day! He chased away the thief and made sure the treasure was safe. Everyone in the castle celebrated with a big party.
The princess was so very happy that the knight had saved her treasure. She said thank you to him, and thanked him for being so brave. From that day on, the knight was a true hero to everyone in the castle.
