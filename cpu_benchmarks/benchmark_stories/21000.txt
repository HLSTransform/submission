Once there was a young girl who loved to collect rare things. She had a box full of special things that she kept. One day, she found something that she thought was very special - a watch. She was so excited that she wanted to weigh it to see if it was valuable.
So, the girl put the watch on the scales, but as she did, the watch broke into tiny pieces. The girl was so sad! She realised that the watch was very rare and that she had made a mistake by weighing it.
The girl was very upset and angry with herself. She knew that she would never be able to get another watch like it. She learnt a valuable lesson - never weigh something rare and precious again!
