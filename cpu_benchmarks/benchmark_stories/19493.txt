The sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a happy day for everyone.
But then, a bad thing happened. A lazy cat was stuck in a tall tree and couldn't get down.
The cat meowed loudly, asking for help. What could she do?
Luckily, a kind man heard the cat's cries. He grabbed his ladder and climbed up the tree to rescue the cat.
The cat was so relieved! The man was very kind, and the cat was very grateful. The man was given a reward for his bravery - it was a bag of money!
The man thanked the cat and put the money in his pocket. He was glad he could make the cat feel safe again.
The cat meowed goodbye as the man climbed down the tree. Then, they both went off back to their homes, happy and safe.
