There was a furry animal who was walking through the woods. He had a big appetite, and he was looking for something to eat. Suddenly, he came across a big cherry tree. The animal was so excited that he began to chew on one of the cherries.
Then a voice said, "Be careful! Some of those cherries are sour!"
The animal looked up and saw an owl perched on a branch. "You shouldn't just eat all of these cherries without tasting them first because some of them are sour," the owl said.
The animal thanked the owl and began to taste each cherry before he chewed it. Sure enough, the owl was right. Some of the cherries were really sour! Luckily, he found lots of sweet cherries too and he was able to fill up his hungry stomach.
The animal looked up to the sky and thanked the wise owl. He was so happy that he had listened to the owl's advice. He wouldn't have been able to eat all of those cherries if he hadn't tasted them first. The furry animal had found a feast of sweet cherries in the woods, thanks to the owl!
