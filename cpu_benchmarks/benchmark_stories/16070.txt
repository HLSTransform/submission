Once upon a time there was a girl called Lucy. She lived near a big forest and loved to go exploring there with her friends. One day, when Lucy was out in the forest, a storm came whistling through the trees and made it so dark that Lucy couldn't see where she was going.
"Oh no!" cried Lucy. "It's getting so dark, what should I do?"
Just then, she saw a dependable old man walking through the forest and called out to him.
"Please, mister!" said Lucy. "Can you help me get home?"
The man smiled and replied "Of course I can. Don't worry, I'll get you home safe and sound."
The old man hurried through the forest and back to Lucy's house. He was kind and dependable, and made sure that Lucy arrived home without any problems.
The moral of this story is that it pays to be kind and helpful to others. When Lucy found herself in a difficult situation, the dependable old man helped her out and ensured she arrived back safely. We can all learn from this and remember to be kind and helpful to our family and friends.
