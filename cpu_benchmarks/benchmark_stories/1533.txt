Once upon a time, there was a rabbit named Jack. He loved to eat all kinds of healthy food. Early one morning, Jack hopped into the meadow to look for something delicious to eat. When he arrived, he saw a big patch of juicy carrots. Jack was so excited that he started to munch on them right away! 
Jack was so busy eating that he didn't realize he was in the shade of the big oak tree. The shade felt so nice and cool, so Jack decided to have a nap. He was feeling warm from all the eating, but the shade made him feel much better.
After his nap, Jack thanked the tree for providing such a nice and healthy place to rest. Then he hopped off into the meadow again, in search of more delicious foods!
