John had a reef. It was a very special reef. He loved playing with it in his room.
One day, John decided to go outside with his reef. He wanted to explore. As he looked around, he was surprised. Everywhere he looked there was beautiful coral. John also saw a lot of fascinating fish swimming around.
John became very independent. He swam around and explored different parts of the reef. Soon, he saw an amazing sea turtle swimming close by.
John was so excited and he was full of surprises. He felt so independent swimming with all the underwater animals. He couldn't stop smiling. It was the best day of his life.
