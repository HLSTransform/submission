Once upon a time there was a little girl who liked to write. She had a big crayon box with lots of colors. Every day, she wrote stories in her notebook. She was so happy!
But one day, she had a difficult problem. She used up all her crayons. She didn't have enough to finish her story.
The next day, she opened her box and there were lots of new crayons! She was so excited. She set to work writing her story and found it wasn't so difficult after all.
The little girl learned a valuable lesson. Having enough crayons makes it easier to write a story. She was very happy.
