Once upon a time, there was an ugly bug. The ugly bug lived in a big, green salad. The salad was in a bowl on the table. The ugly bug liked the salad very much.
One day, a little boy saw the ugly bug in the salad. The little boy did not like the ugly bug. He wanted to destroy the ugly bug. The little boy tried to hit the ugly bug with his hand, but the ugly bug was too fast.
The ugly bug ran away from the little boy. The ugly bug found a new salad to live in. The little boy did not see the ugly bug again. The ugly bug was happy in his new salad home.
