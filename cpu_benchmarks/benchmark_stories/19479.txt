An orange cat was very sleepy. He yawned and stretched big. Then he saw a big, soft bed. He was so excited! He jumped right on it and cuddled up. He purred and he was so content.
But then he heard a loud noise! It was too much and he quit the bed in a hurry. He ran around the room and his eyes were wide. He was scared! He tried to find somewhere safe. 
Finally, he jumped into an orange chair and curled up. He was happy and the noise stopped. He stayed there for a long time and was so sleepy. So he closed his eyes and slowly fell asleep.
