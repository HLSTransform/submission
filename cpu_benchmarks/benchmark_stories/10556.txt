Once upon a time there was a stick. It was a gentle stick. Every day the stick enjoyed sitting in the sunshine in the park.
One day, the stick was sitting by the lake. Suddenly, a big, mean puff of wind came, and it picked up the stick! The stick tried to hold on, but it couldn't keep a grip. The wind carried the poor stick way away, up high into the sky. The stick was scared of all the heights, but it kept flying, and soon it was out at sea.
The wind tossed the stick around for a long time. The stick was so very far from home and so very scared. Finally, the wind got tired and let the stick fall into the deep, dark water.
The poor stick was never seen again. It never enjoyed the sunshine, never saw its friends. The gentle stick was gone forever.
