Once upon a time there was a boy who was very dizzy. Everywhere he looked, he saw a lot of dust. He wanted to go and play, but he felt too dizzy to move. He thought to himself, "What should I do?".
Then he heard a voice, "I can help you!" He looked around to see where the voice was coming from, but he couldn't see anyone. Suddenly a gust of wind blew by, and in the windy dust a beautiful fairy appeared. She said, "I can help, let me make you better!"
The fairy waved her wand in the air and then, POOF! all the dizziness was gone. She said, "Now you can go and play! Just don't forget to take care of yourself."
The little boy was so happy that he could go and play, and from that day on he kept his house clean so that no dust would make him dizzy again. He thanked the fairy for being so kind and for helping him out.
He was so glad that he didn't have to stay dizzy forever!
