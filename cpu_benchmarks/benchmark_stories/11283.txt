Once upon a time, there was a girl called Daisy who was three years old. She wanted to explore and find something special.
Daisy opened the cupboard and reached in. Inside, she saw something delicate and sparkly. It was a necklace! Daisy knew that it must have belonged to her mommy. But when she tried to take it out, the necklace got stuck!
Daisy was sad, so she asked her mommy for help.
"Mommy, the necklace is stuck. Can you help me get it out?"
Her mommy smiled and said, "Yes, Daisy. Let me try."
Mommy tried to delicately pull out the necklace, but it wouldn't move. She looked at Daisy and said, "I'm sorry, Daisy. It's stuck too tight. We'll have to leave it there for now."
Daisy was disappointed but she understood. She hugged her mommy and together they closed the cupboard. Then, Daisy and her mommy went in search of something else to explore.
