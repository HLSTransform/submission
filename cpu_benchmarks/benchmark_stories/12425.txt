Once upon a time there was a chubby pigeon called Pete. He lived at the park and dreamed of soaring high in the sky like the other birds.
Pete’s friend Lucy noticed how excited he was and asked him why.
“I want to soar in style like the other birds” he said.
Lucy smiled and offered to help.
“Let’s practice flying together” she suggested.
So every day they flew a little higher and Pete practiced moving his wings to make smooth turns.
Finally, one day Pete was ready and he took off in the sky with Lucy beside him. He spread his wings wide and soared up into the clouds.
His style was perfect and his heart was filled with joy.
“This is the best feeling ever!” Pete yelled.
He glided through the sky, feeling chubby and proud.
