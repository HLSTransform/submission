Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and run around. One day, she went to get a popsicle from the freezer. She opened the door and reached in, but her hand slipped and she fell inside! 
Luckily, Lily was very flexible and she was able to wiggle her way out. She laughed and thought it was funny. From then on, she was careful when getting treats from the freezer. 
The end.
