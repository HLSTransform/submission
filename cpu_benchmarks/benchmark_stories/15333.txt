Once there was a girl named Mary who really wanted a doll to play with. She asked her mom and dad every day, but they never had enough money. One day when Mary was walking in the park, she saw something thick in the grass. She went over and found a doll in the weeds! It was all dirty, but she was happy to have it.
Mary cleaned the doll and it still looked a little sad, so she hugged it tight and kissed it. Suddenly, the doll started to yield. Its eyes opened, it started to move and its hair started growing. The doll was alive!
Mary and the doll became best friends. They played together all day and giggled and laughed. Even when the pesky neighbors yelled, the doll made Mary feel safe and happy. Having the doll made Mary's life worth living and she was so thankful for her new best friend.
