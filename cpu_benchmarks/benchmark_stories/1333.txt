Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a castle. One day she was walking close to the beach when she heard a sound coming from the ocean. She looked out and saw a little dog in the water. He was very nervous and he was swimming close to the shore but he just couldn't get out.
The princess knew she had to rescue him so she wasted no time. She quickly called out to the little dog and he looked over at her with wide eyes. She then picked him up with both hands and carried him back to the beach.
The princess and the dog both smiled in relief, but the princess still had to figure out where the dog came from. She sat down on the sand near a tall palm tree and the dog sat by her side. Suddenly, a boy appeared and he ran up to her and hugged the dog. He was so happy to see his puppy again! 
The princess said goodbye to the happy boy and the dog, then walked back to her castle, feeling very satisfied. She was glad she was able to rescue the little dog and return him to his owner.
