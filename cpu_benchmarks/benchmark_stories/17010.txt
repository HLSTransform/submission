Lily and Ben were playing with their dolls in the living room. They liked to make up stories and act them out. Lily was the princess and Ben was the knight. They had a castle, a dragon and a magic wand.
"Help me, help me!" Lily cried. "The dragon is coming to eat me!"
"Don't worry, princess!" Ben said. "I will save you with my magic wand. Repeat after me: dragon, go away!"
"Dragon, go away!" Lily repeated.
Ben waved his wand and pretended that the dragon flew away. He ran to Lily and hugged her.
"You are very brave, princess!" he said. "Now you are safe and we can have a feast."
"Yes, let's have a feast!" Lily said. "I am very hungry."
They went to the kitchen and looked for some food. They saw a big cake on the table. It had pink frosting and sprinkles. It looked very yummy.
"Wow, look at that cake!" Ben said. "Can we have some, please?"
"I don't know," Lily said. "Mommy said we have to wait until after dinner. She said it is for Daddy's birthday."
"But we are very hungry," Ben said. "And we saved the princess. We deserve a reward."
He winked at Lily and smiled.
"Maybe we can have a little bit," he said. "Mommy won't notice. Come on, it will be fun."
Lily was not sure. She did not want to make Mommy angry. But the cake looked so good. And Ben was her best friend. She winked back and nodded.
"OK, let's have a little bit," she said.
They climbed on a chair and reached for the cake. They cut a big slice and ate it. It was very sweet and soft. They liked it a lot.
"Yum, yum, yum!" they said.
They cut another slice and ate it. And another. And another. They did not stop until they ate the whole cake. They felt very full and happy.
"That was the best cake ever!" Ben said.
"Yes, it was!" Lily said.
They wiped their mouths and went back to the living room. They did not see Mommy coming home with Daddy. They did not hear them open the door. They did not see their angry faces when they saw the empty plate on the table.
They only heard Mommy's voice when she shouted.
"Lily! Ben! What have you done?"
