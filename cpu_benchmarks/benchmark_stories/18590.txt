Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the jungle near his house. One day, Timmy heard someone shouting in the jungle. He went to see who it was.
When he got there, he saw a monkey who was stuck in a tree. The monkey was shouting for help. Timmy was honest and knew he needed to help the monkey.
Timmy climbed up the tree to rescue the monkey. The monkey was very happy and said, "Thank you, Timmy!" Timmy was happy too because he had helped someone in need. From that day on, Timmy and the monkey became good friends and played together in the jungle every day.
