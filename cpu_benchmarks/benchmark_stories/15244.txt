One day, there was a hairy pilot. He was flying his plane in the sky. It was a special plane that could zip very fast. The pilot pulled a lever and the plane started to zip through the clouds. The pilot smiled and looked down at the ground. He saw a beautiful park with lots of trees.
The pilot put his plane into a dive and it zip zip zipped over the park. He touched the wheel and the plane soared up into the sky again. The wind blew through the pilot's hairy beard as he zipped around in the plane. He was having so much fun.
The pilot flew around the park one more time and then zoomed off into the distance. He flew until the night sky was full of stars. The pilot flew back to his home and parked the plane in its spot. He was happy with his fun day of zipping around in his plane.
