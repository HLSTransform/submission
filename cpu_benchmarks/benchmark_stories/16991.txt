One day, a little bug was crawling on a pole. He saw a big flower on top of the pole and wanted to smell it. He crawled and crawled, but the pole was very high and he was very tired.
"Hello, little bug," said a voice. The bug looked and saw a bird sitting on the flower. The bird had bright feathers and a long beak. He looked very pretty.
"Hello, bird," said the bug. "You are very pretty. Can I smell your flower?"
"Sure, little bug," said the bird. "But you have to crawl faster. The flower is very sweet and I don't want to share it with anyone else."
The bug crawled faster and faster, but he did not know that the bird was lying. The bird was hungry and wanted to eat the bug. He was waiting for the bug to come closer and closer.
When the bug was almost at the top of the pole, he saw the bird's sharp teeth and his ugly eyes. He realized that the bird was not his friend, but his enemy. He was scared and tried to crawl back, but it was too late. The bird snapped his beak and caught the bug.
"Help, help!" the bug cried. But no one heard him. The bird ate the bug and flew away.
The moral of the story is: Don't trust strangers who are too nice to you. They might have a hidden motive. And don't judge by appearances. Sometimes the pretty ones are the meanest and the ugly ones are the kindest.
