The sun was bright, and the birds were chirping. It was a perfect day for the little girl to go outside and play. She jumped, twirled, and laughed in the warm summer breeze, feeling free and alert.
Suddenly, an idea popped into her head: she wanted to climb to the top of the slide and succeed! She quickly scampered to the tall structure and began to crawl up. But every time she was about to reach the top, she would get scared and slip back down.
Then, her Mommy and Daddy came over to her and asked, "What is your dream?"
The little girl pointed up to the top of the slide and replied, "I want to climb to the top and succeed!"
Mommy and Daddy smiled and praised her. "We believe in you! You can do it!"
Filled with encouragement, the little girl slowly crawled up and made it to the top. She proudly looked down and smiled, feeling triumphant. 
"You did it!" Mommy and Daddy cried.
The little girl smiled brighter and replied, "Yes, I succeeded!"
