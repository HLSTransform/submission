Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved the color pink. One day, she went to the store with her mommy to buy a present for her grandma's birthday. They found a pretty pink scarf to wrap around her grandma's neck.
When they got home, Lily's mommy asked her to help wrap the present. Lily tried, but it was too hard for her little hands. "I can't do it," she said.
"Don't worry, I'll support you," said her mommy. Together, they wrapped the scarf around the present and put a pink bow on top.
The next day, they went to grandma's house for the birthday party. When she opened the present, she loved the pink scarf so much that she put it on right away. "Thank you so much, Lily and mommy. You two are the best," she said with a big smile.
