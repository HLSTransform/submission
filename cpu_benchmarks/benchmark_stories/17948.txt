One day, a little girl named Sue went for a walk. She saw her mom doing laundry. Sue wanted to help, but her mom said, "No, you are too small."
Sue was sad, but she kept walking. She saw a big, spoiled dog. The dog had a dirty shirt in his mouth. Sue thought, "This dog needs help with his laundry, too!"
Sue walked up to the dog and said, "Give me the shirt, and I will help you." The dog gave Sue the shirt. Sue took the shirt to her mom. Her mom smiled and said, "You can help with this one." Sue was happy, and she and her mom washed the dog's shirt together.
