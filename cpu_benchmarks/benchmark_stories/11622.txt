Once upon a time, two friends, Jack and Jill, were walking in the forest. Jack wanted to show Jill something special, so he held up a small cube and said, "This is my special cube. It is dependable and I always keep it with me." 
Jill asked, "What does it do?" 
Jack grinned and said, "It doesn't do much, but I always rely on it. It reminds me to be kind and dependable." 
Confused, Jill asked, "What do you mean?"
Jack replied, "If I'm feeling sad or scared, I look at my cube and it reminds me that I can always rely on myself and my friends."
Jill smiled and nodded. She said, "That's a nice message. We should always be kind and dependable to each other". 
The two friends held hands and continued walking thoughtfully through the forest. 
The moral of this story is to always put others' needs before your own and to be dependable when others need you.
