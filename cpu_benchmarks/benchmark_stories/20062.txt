Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bake cookies with her mom. They mixed flour, sugar, and eggs together and put the cookies in the oven to bake. The cookies smelled so good!
One day, Lily was playing outside when she saw lightning in the sky. It was very bright and made a loud noise. She ran inside to tell her mom. Her mom explained that lightning is a big spark in the sky that happens when it rains.
Later that day, Lily and her mom played hide and seek. Lily found a good hiding spot behind the couch. She was hidden so well that her mom couldn't find her. When Lily finally came out of hiding, her mom gave her a big hug and they baked more cookies together.
