Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweetie. Tweetie loved to fly high in the sky and feel the wind in her feathers. One day, she saw a big yellow balloon floating in the air. 
Tweetie wanted to see the balloon up close, so she flew towards it. As she got closer, she felt the wind getting stronger and stronger. But Tweetie was a brave bird, so she kept flying towards the balloon.
Finally, Tweetie reached the balloon and saw that it was tied to a tree. She perched on a branch and watched the balloon soar higher and higher in the sky. Tweetie was happy to have seen something so beautiful and exciting.
