Once upon a time, there was a beautiful cat named Velvet. Velvet loved to play and run in the sun. One day, Velvet saw a big red ball in the yard. She wanted to play with it, but she had to hurry because it was getting late.
Velvet ran fast to catch the ball. She played with the ball, rolling it and jumping on it. The sun was going down, and Velvet knew she had to go home soon. But she loved the ball so much, she wanted to play just a little bit more.
Finally, it was time for Velvet to go home. She hurried back to her house, but when she got there, she saw a big surprise. Her family had a new red ball just like the one in the yard! Velvet was so happy she could play with the red ball every day. And from that day on, Velvet and her family played with the beautiful red ball together.
