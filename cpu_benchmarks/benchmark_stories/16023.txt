Little Sam was out of the house taking a walk with his mom. As they walked, they heard a scurrying sound behind them. Mom turned around and saw a rat running away.
"Mom, what's that?" Little Sam asked.
"That was a rat, sweetie," Mom said kindly.
After a few minutes, they stopped in front of an old store. It was an elderly store with a big sign on the roof. Little Sam pointed at the sign and asked, "What does it say, Mom?"
Mom smiled and said, "It says 'Welcome to Sam's Store'. Sam's Store is a very special place. It's a store for old things."
Little Sam was curious, so he asked, "What kind of old things do they sell here?"
"All kinds of things," Mom said. "From vintage toys to antiques." 
Little Sam was excited and couldn't wait to explore the store. He grabbed his mom's hand and they both headed inside Sam's Store.
