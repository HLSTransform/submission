Mommy and Tommy were making cookies together in the kitchen. Tommy was very excited to help. 
"Let's bake some yummy cookies!" Mommy said. 
They mixed the ingredients together and put them in the oven. 
When the cookies were done, Tommy asked his mommy if they could take some to the library.
Still, Mommy answered, "Let's leave some for ourselves, it was so much fun to make them together."
So they shared the cookies between them and went to the library.
When they arrived, they saw all the pretty books and there were lots of people reading them. 
Tommy and Mommy left the cookies on the counter. 
One librarian looked very surprised. 
"What a nice thing to do!" she said. 
Tommy was happy and he knew this was the right thing to do.
Mommy put her hand on Tommy's shoulder and said, "See, being kind and sharing pays off. Now let's go check out some books."
They both smiled and went off to explore the library. 
The moral of this story is that it is important to be kind and to share. Doing nice things for other people often has unexpected rewards.
