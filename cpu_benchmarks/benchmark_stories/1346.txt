Once upon a time there was a tiny spider called Jasper. Everyday, he spun a beautiful cobweb in his small corner of the garden. It was so delicate that everyone said it looked like a rare and delicate piece of art!
One day, a strong wind came and blew Jasper's cobweb away! The poor spider was so sad!
Jasper was determined to build his cobweb back up. He scrambled up the long vines and worked away spinning out his web. But try as hard as he could, the cobweb would not look how it did before. Until one day, Jasper had an idea. He spooled the strands backwards and when he had finished, he was surprised to find that the cobweb was better than before! He had reversed the cobweb and made it look even more special.
From that day on, Jasper's cobweb was admired by all in the garden, and it became even more rare and beautiful.
