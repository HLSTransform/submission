Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys and books. One day, they go to the park with their moms. Anna has a bag with her favorite doll and Ben has a bag with his favorite car.
They see a big slide and run to it. They take turns to slide down. Anna goes first, then Ben, then Anna again. They have fun and laugh.
But then, a big boy comes. He is mean and rude. He pushes Anna and Ben away from the slide. He says, "This is my slide. Go away. You are too small and silly."
Anna and Ben are sad and scared. They want to play, but the big boy is not nice. He tries to take their bags with their toys. He says, "I want your doll and your car. Give them to me."
Anna and Ben say, "No, these are our toys. We love them. You cannot have them."
The big boy is angry. He grabs their bags and runs away. Anna and Ben cry. They want their toys back.
Their moms see what happens. They run after the big boy. They catch him and take the bags from him. They say, "You are very bad. You cannot take other children's toys. You have to say sorry and go away."
The big boy is ashamed. He says, "Sorry, sorry. I was wrong. I will not do it again." He goes away.
Anna and Ben are happy. They hug their moms and thank them. They say, "You are very good. You prevent the big boy from taking our toys. You are our heroes."
Their moms smile and hug them back. They say, "You are very brave. You stand up for your toys. You are our stars."
Anna and Ben smile and hold their bags. They go back to the slide and play together. They are friends. They are happy.
