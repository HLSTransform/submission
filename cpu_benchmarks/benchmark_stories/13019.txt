One day, Jack and Jill were playing in the garden.
Jack said, "Look, Jill, the sky is blue". Jill replied, "Yes, it is beautiful".
They both ran to the playground and saw a bird flying in the sky. Jack pointed up and said, "What is that?". Jill replied, "It's a bird. It can fly really high".
Jack said, "I wish I could fly. I would be so independent". Jill replied, "Me too. Let's pretend we can fly here".
Jack and Jill both spread out their arms and jumped up and down, pretending they could fly. They both laugh and had so much fun. 
When they were done, Jack said, "That was so much fun! Let's do it again!". 
Jill replied with a big smile, "Yes, let's do it again".
