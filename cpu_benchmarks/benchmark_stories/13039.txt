Once upon a time there was an honest boy. His name was John. John was three years old. One day he saw an iron. He wanted to try it. So he stared at it. He was curious. He wanted to touch it but it was too hot. So he kept staring and wishing he could touch it.
Suddenly, a big hand grabbed the iron. It was John's dad. He smiled and said, "John, this is an iron. You can't touch it, it's too hot."
John smiled back. His dad was honest and he was happy about that. He knew then that he could trust his dad. From that day on, whenever John saw the iron, he would smile and remember his dad's honesty.
