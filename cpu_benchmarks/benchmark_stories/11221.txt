Once, there was a little boy in a distant place. His name was Joe. Joe was very lonely and one day his chest started to feel very heavy inside. He noticed he was feeling sad and started to weep. Joe wept and wept until night time and he was still feeling very sad. 
Suddenly Joe heard a distant sound coming closer. He looked around and he saw a small cat walking towards him. Joe felt a bit better and he stopped crying. 
The cat purred and rubbed up against Joes's chest. Joe was happy and he smiled. After that day, Joe was never lonely again. He and the cat were friends forever and ever.
