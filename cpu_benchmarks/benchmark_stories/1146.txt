Once upon a time, there was a red wagon. The red wagon lived in a big yard with a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with the red wagon every day. She would put her toys in the wagon and pull it around the yard.
One sunny day, Lily was playing with the red wagon when she noticed a little cat. The cat was hiding under a tree. Lily wanted to be friends with the cat, so she was very careful not to scare it away. She slowly walked over to the cat with the red wagon.
Lily put some food in the red wagon and pulled it to the cat. The cat saw the food and came out from under the tree. The cat ate the food and then jumped into the red wagon. Lily and the cat played together all day, and they became the best of friends.
