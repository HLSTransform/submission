Lily was playing with her ball in the park. She liked to kick the ball high and far. She saw a big tree and wanted to kick the ball over it. She ran and kicked the ball hard.
But the ball did not go over the tree. It hit a branch and fell down. Lily ran to get her ball. But she saw something shiny on the ground. It was a needle. Lily was curious. She picked up the needle and looked at it.
"Ow!" Lily cried. The needle poked her finger. It hurt a lot. She dropped the needle and held her finger. She saw blood on her finger. She was scared and confused. She did not know what to do.
"Help! Help!" Lily shouted. She hoped someone would hear her. She wanted her mom.
A lady heard Lily's cry. She came to see what was wrong. She saw Lily crying and holding her finger. She saw the needle on the ground.
"Oh, you poor thing!" the lady said. "You found a needle. Needles are not toys. They are sharp and dangerous. They can make you sick. You should never touch them. Come, let me help you."
The lady took Lily to a bench. She had a band-aid in her purse. She cleaned Lily's finger and put the band-aid on it. She gave Lily a hug and a candy.
"Thank you, lady," Lily said. "You are very nice. I'm sorry I touched the needle. I won't do it again."
"That's good, Lily," the lady said. "You learned a lesson today. Needles are not for playing. They are for doctors and nurses. They use them to help people who are sick or hurt. But they are very careful with them. You should always be careful too. And if you ever see a needle on the ground, don't touch it. Tell an adult right away."
Lily nodded. She understood. She thanked the lady again and went to get her ball. She was happy to have a band-aid and a candy. She was also happy to have a new friend. She waved goodbye to the lady and went to find her mom. She wanted to tell her what happened and what she learned. She hoped her mom would be proud of her.
