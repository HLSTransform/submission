Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Mark. He loved to play outside in the soil. One sunny day, he went to the park with his mom.
At the park, Mark saw a girl playing in the soil too. He went over to her and said, "Hi, I'm Mark. Can I play with you?" The girl looked at him and said, "Yes, my name is Lily. Let's play together!"
Mark and Lily had lots of fun playing in the soil. But soon, Mark accidentally threw soil at Lily. She looked sad and said, "You made me dirty!" Mark felt sorry and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to." Lily smiled and said, "It's okay, Mark. Let's keep playing!"
They played until the sun went down, and Mark's mom called him to go home. Mark said goodbye to Lily and went back home with his mom. Mark was happy to make a new friend at the park, and he couldn't wait to play with Lily again.
