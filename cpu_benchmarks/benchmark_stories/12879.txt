Mama and Toby were in the kitchen, getting ready for dinner. Toby was helping to put the items on the table. "Mmm, the turkey smells so yummy," said Toby. Mama smiled and said, "We should be thankful for everything we have." Toby nodded and said,"Yeah, I'm thankful for the turkey and for everything else."  
After dinner, Toby went outside to play. He saw a pile of sticks and picked one up, wondering what he could do with it. He thought and thought, and then he had an idea. He started to arrange the sticks together. Before long, he had made a house! He was proud of himself and ran inside to show Mama what he had done.
Mama was amazed when Toby showed her the house. "This is wonderful! You are so creative. Sticks can be very useful. We can use them to build things and create things. And tonight we will use them to roast marshmallows." Toby was filled with joy. He said, "Thank you, Mama! I'm really glad I found the sticks." 
Mama smiled, feeling thankful for a moment like this with her son. Together they roasted the marshmallows and ate them with delight. They thanked the turkey for giving them enough energy to be able to play and have fun. It was a sweet evening filled with thankfulness.
