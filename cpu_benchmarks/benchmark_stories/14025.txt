Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim lived in a house with stairs. He liked to play with his toy car and make loud noises. One day, Tim was playing with his car on the stairs. He was having so much fun making loud noises.
Tim's mom told him to be careful on the stairs. She said, "Tim, recognize that playing on the stairs can be dangerous." But Tim did not listen to his mom. He kept playing and making loud noises.
Suddenly, Tim's car slipped and he fell down the stairs. Tim cried and his mom came to help him. She hugged Tim and said, "Now you recognize that playing on the stairs is not safe, right?" Tim nodded and said, "I'm sorry, mom." From that day on, Tim never played on the stairs again. He learned to listen to his mom and be careful. The moral of the story is to always listen to your parents and be careful when playing.
