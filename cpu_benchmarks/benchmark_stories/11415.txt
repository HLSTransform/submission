Once there was a little girl who liked to make things. One day she saw a shelf on the floor and she wanted to make it clean. 
She asked her mom if she could clean it and her mom said yes. 
The little girl started to move things around to make it clean. She moved the books, toys and clothes from the shelf and put them into boxes. 
When she was done, the shelf was nice and clean. 
The little girl smiled and said, "Look at my shelf! Now it's clean!"
