Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. They would run and jump and laugh together. One day, while they were playing, they found a big pile of junk. It was old and rusty and broken. But Lily had an idea. She thought they could use the junk to build a fort. So they started to work. They stacked the junk and made a big pile. It was hard work, but they didn't give up. When they were finished, they sat inside their fort and felt calm. They were proud of what they had made. From that day on, they played in their junk fort every day.
