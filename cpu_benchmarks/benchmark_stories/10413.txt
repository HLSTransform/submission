Once upon a time, there were two friends called Mike and Paul. Both of them were really excited for the new day, but what they didn't know was that a fog was coming their way.
Mike saw the fog first and yelled out, "guess what Paul, the sky is looking all foggy!" Paul was so excited, "let's go explore the fog!" and so they did.
It was so fun being in the fog, everything was so colorful. As they took another step, Mike stumbled upon something. He shouted out, "it's a big puzzle and it looks like we have to solve it!"
Paul was even more excited now, and quickly got down on the ground to help Mike. Together they worked hard and solved the puzzle.
Just then the fog cleared and the sun shone through. Both of them smiled and laughed, they were so happy to have solved the puzzle and had such a colorful day!
