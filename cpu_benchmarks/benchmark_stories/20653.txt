Once upon a time there was a green frog. It hopped around the pond looking for a friend. Suddenly the frog heard hoofsteps. It stopped hopping and looked around. As it peered around the pond it saw a horse. The horse was visiting the pond and it had come with a friend. The frog was so excited to have company! The horse said hi to the frog and asked if it wanted to visit. The frog was so happy that it hopped along beside the horse. They had a lot of fun visiting the pond, hopping and looking for friends. Eventually it was time for the horse to go. The frog waved goodbye and said it would see the horse again soon. The horse stopped and said "I'll come back soon, promise!" And the frog was excited to have a special visit to look forward to.
