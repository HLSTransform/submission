Once upon a time, there was an old flag. It blew in the wind and was very beautiful. One day, a group of kids wanted to play with it. They picked it up and began to sack it around. They ran and laughed and had lots of fun!
Soon, the flag needed to be put back. The kids found an old tree and gently placed the flag in it. The flag was safe and happy in its new home.
From then on, the kids would visit the old flag every day, and trail up and down the old tree. And when the wind blew, the old flag would wave and remind them of their fun day of sacking. The end.
