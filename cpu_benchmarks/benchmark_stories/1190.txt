Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and eat candy. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the store to buy him a new toy. Timmy saw a toy he really liked, but it was very expensive. His mom told him that they couldn't buy it because it was too cheap. Timmy didn't understand why something that was too cheap couldn't be bought.
Later that day, Timmy asked his mom why they couldn't buy the toy. His mom told him the truth, that they didn't have enough money to buy it. Timmy was sad, but he understood. He knew that his mom always answered his questions truthfully.
