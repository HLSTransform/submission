Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a very wealthy family and lived in a big house with a big garden. One day, she went outside to play and smelled something funny. She asked her friend, "What's that smell?"
Her friend replied, "It's my nose. I have a cold."
Lily didn't know what a cold was, so she asked her friend to repeat what she said. Her friend said, "I have a cold. It makes my nose runny and smelly."
Lily felt bad for her friend and wanted to help. She went inside and told her mommy about her friend's nose. Her mommy gave her a tissue and told her to give it to her friend. Lily ran outside and gave her friend the tissue. Her friend thanked her and said, "You're a good friend, Lily."
From that day on, Lily and her friend played together every day. Lily learned that even though her family was wealthy, it was important to be kind to others and help them when they needed it.
