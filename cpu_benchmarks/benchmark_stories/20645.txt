Mum was excited to take Harry to the park. There was so much to look forward to. Harry saw a big hoop and knew he would have to test it out. He hopped and jumped his way to the hoop and started swinging around it. He bounced up and down and went round and round. He was delighted.
But soon enough, he became frustrated. It was hard to hold on to the hoop and he often fell over. Mum watched and smiled, cheering him on. She saw that he was determined and encouraged him to try again. This time, he held on a little longer before tumbling off. He was determined to test the hoop again and again.
Finally, Harry managed to hang from the hoop without falling off. He shouted with joy and Mum cheered. They had fun playing together at the park and Harry was so proud of himself. Both were happy and content.
