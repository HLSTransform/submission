Once upon a time there was a princess. She was very rare and beautiful. 
She had a special task to do, and it was very important. She needed to drop a magical stone in the lake. 
The princess walked to the lake. She had never seen a lake before, so she was very scared. 
She slowly dropped the stone into the lake. As the stone made a splash, it shone brightly with a rainbow of colors. 
The princess was amazed. She knew she had done a good job and that she had made the lake more special. She skipped happily home feeling proud of herself.
