Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars. He had a red car, a blue car, and a green car. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy had a yellow car that could zoom really fast.
Timmy and Billy decided to have a race with their cars. They set up a track with blocks and pillows. Timmy was feeling competitive and really wanted to win. Billy's car zoomed ahead, but then it crashed into a grape that had fallen on the track.
Timmy's car won the race and he felt very happy. Billy was sad that his car crashed, but Timmy said, "Don't worry, we can play again and I'll share my grapes with you." They both laughed and continued to play with their cars.
