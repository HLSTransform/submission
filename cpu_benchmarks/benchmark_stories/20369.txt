Tom and Lily were going to the park with Mom. They liked the park. It had swings and slides and a big pond. Sometimes they saw ducks and frogs in the pond.
But today, they saw something else. A big, green, scary thing. It had a long tail and a big mouth with many teeth. It was an alligator!
Mom saw it too. She was alert. She told Tom and Lily to stay close to her and not to go near the pond. She called the park ranger on her phone. She said there was an alligator in the pond and they needed help.
The park ranger came soon. He had a big truck and a big net. He said he was sorry for the delay. He said the alligator had escaped from the zoo and he was going to take it back. He said it was not safe for people or animals to be near the alligator.
Tom and Lily watched as the park ranger caught the alligator with the net and put it in the truck. They were glad the alligator was gone. They said thank you to the park ranger. He said they were brave and smart to stay away from the alligator.
Mom said they could still play in the park, but not near the pond. Tom and Lily agreed. They ran to the swings and slides and had fun. They hoped they would not see the alligator again.
