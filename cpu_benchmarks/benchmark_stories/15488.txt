Once upon a time there was a little girl named Penny. She was very compassionate and always wanted to help people. One day, she went to the store and saw some corn. She wanted to help people with the corn, so she rang a bell and asked everyone to come.
Everyone was very happy and hungry. Penny gave them each a handful of corn and asked them to share it with others in need. Everyone thank Penny for her kindness and began to share the corn with those less fortunate.
Penny was so happy that she had been able to help others. She went around ringing her bell and telling people to share the corn. People were so touched by Penny's compassion that they decided to always remember her kindness.
That's why whenever we see a bell ring, we always think of Penny and her kind act of giving back to those in need.
