Jimmy was playing with his toys on the red couch. He was having a lot of fun and laughiong. Suddenly, a very strange bug flew by and landed on his arm. Jimmy was so surprised he screamed. The bug bit him and he started to cry. 
His mom ran into the room to help him. She saw the bug and took it outside. She asked Jimmy if he was okay and he nodded. 
Jimmy felt much better once the bug was gone. He gave his mom a hug and thanked her. She smiled and sat next to him on the red couch. Together they laughed and had lots of fun.
