Once upon a time there was a yellow pony with a very beautiful mane. Every day the pony would run around the village in search of fresh grass to eat. One day, out of nowhere, the pony vanished!
The villagers were very surprised and began to search for the pony. Finally they found the pony in the woods. The little pony was standing below a large yellow tree with its tail between its legs.
The villagers asked: "Why did you vanish?" The pony smiled and said: "I wanted to find big grass for me to eat!" Everyone began to laugh and the pony ran away happily. But the villagers never forgot the yellow pony that could vanish and reappear!
