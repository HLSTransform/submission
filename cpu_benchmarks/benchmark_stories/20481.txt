Once upon a time, there was a little brown alligator. He lived in a pond with other alligators and he enjoyed swimming around and exploring his home. One day he was swimming among the lily pads when something caught his eye. He swam over to investigate and he found a big spoon. The spoon looked so shiny and he wanted to play with it! 
He started to stir the water with the spoon, he enjoyed watching the ripples it made and hearing the sound of it beating against the pond. The alligator loved being creative and he imagined the spoon was a boat sailing across the water. He paddled around the pond and made funny noises as the spoon zipped around. 
Soon the other alligators in the pond became interested in what he was doing. They couldn't believe the spoon could float so quickly and make such fun noises! The little brown alligator was very proud of himself and he shared the spoon with all of his friends. Together they all stirred the water, laughed and had a great time. 
Soon the sun started to set and the little brown alligator tucked the spoon back in its secret hiding place. Until the next day when he could stir again!
