Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but one day she could not find her favorite toy car. Lily looked everywhere and was very sad. She thought maybe her friend, Max, had it. She decided to go to Max's house to see if he had her toy car.
When Lily got to Max's house, she asked Max, "Did you borrow my toy car?" Max said, "No, I did not borrow your toy car." Lily was frustrated and did not know where her toy car could be. Max wanted to help Lily, so they both went back to her house to look for the toy car together.
As they looked for the toy car, they found a big pile of dust under Lily's bed. Max and Lily moved the dust, and there was the toy car! Lily was so happy to have her toy car back. She said, "Thank you, Max, for helping me find my toy car!" Max and Lily played with the toy car and had lots of fun.
