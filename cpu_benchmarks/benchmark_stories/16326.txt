Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat cookies. One day, Lily's friend, Tommy, came over to play. He saw Lily's cookies on a tray and wanted one, but Lily didn't want to share.
Tommy said, "I need a cookie, please." But Lily was envious and didn't want to share her cookies. Tommy felt sad because he really wanted a cookie.
Then, Lily's mom came in and saw what was happening. She explained to Lily that it's important to share and be kind to friends. Lily realized her mistake and gave Tommy a cookie from the tray. Tommy was happy and they continued to play together. From then on, Lily learned that sharing is important and it's always better to be kind to others.
