Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and run around on the earth. He loved to feel the grass under his feet.
One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy was bigger and stronger than Timmy and he wanted to play rough. Timmy didn't want to play rough, he just wanted to remain friends with Billy.
But Billy didn't listen and started to push Timmy around. Timmy didn't feel fit enough to fight back, so he ran away and hid behind a tree.
After a while, Billy realized that he had hurt Timmy's feelings and he felt bad. He went to find Timmy and apologized. Timmy forgave him and they played together again, running and jumping on the earth. They remained friends forever.
