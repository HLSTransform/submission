Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big, brown squirrel with a long, fluffy tail. The squirrel was holding a peanut in its mouth. Lily and Tom wanted to see the peanut, so they ran after the squirrel.
"Hey, squirrel, can we see your peanut?" Lily shouted.
The squirrel did not like Lily and Tom. It thought they wanted to take its peanut. It ran faster and faster, and climbed up a tree. Lily and Tom followed it, but they could not climb as well as the squirrel.
"Please, squirrel, we just want to look, not eat," Tom said.
The squirrel did not listen. It was fierce and angry. It made a loud noise and threw the peanut at Lily and Tom. The peanut hit Tom on the head and made him cry.
"Ow, that hurt!" Tom said.
Lily was sad and mad. She picked up the peanut and threw it back at the squirrel. The peanut hit the squirrel on the nose and made it sneeze.
"Ha, take that!" Lily said.
The squirrel was scared and sorry. It realized that Lily and Tom were not bad. It wanted to be friends with them. It climbed down the tree and gave them another peanut.
"Sorry, friends, I was mean. Here, have a peanut," the squirrel said.
Lily and Tom smiled and took the peanut. They thanked the squirrel and shared the peanut. They all became friends and played in the park. The end.
