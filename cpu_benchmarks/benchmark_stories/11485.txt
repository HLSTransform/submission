Jack had a string. He thought it was a fun thing to play with. He asked his mom, "What can I do with this string?"
His mom thought for a minute, then said, "You can try to manage it somehow. That is, make something out of it like a lasso or a necklace."
Jack's eyes lit up. He loved creating things with his string. It took him a few tries, but he was eventually able to make a pretty necklace. He was so proud of himself, and his mom was very helpful.
When Jack showed his necklace to his mom, she smiled and said, "That's wonderful! You managed to make a beautiful necklace. I'm so proud of you."
Jack was thrilled. Now he had something special to wear, made from his own string.
