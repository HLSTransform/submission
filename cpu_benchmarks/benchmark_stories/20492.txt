Once upon a time, there was a girl named Jane. Every day when the sun came up, Jane would go marching out of her house and across the big green field. She would march and march until she came to the shore by the great big lake.
Once at the shore, Jane would look for all kinds of things. She liked to find shells, rocks, and sometimes even treasures! But it wasn't really the treasures that Jane loved to find the most. She liked to look for the nosy seagulls that came to visit the shore.
The seagulls loved to fly around and go on adventures. They also loved to come and take perches wherever they pleased. Jane thought this was so funny and she enjoyed watching them as they hopped around. Even when it rained, the seagulls were always nosy and full of life.
Jane loved going to the shore to march and look for things. But most of all she loved visiting with the nosy seagulls. They brought her so much joy and happiness each and every day.
