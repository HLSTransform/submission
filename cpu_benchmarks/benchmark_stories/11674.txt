Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Nina. Nina was very brave, but also felt scared sometimes. She was walking along a path one day, when she came to a tall mountain. It looked too high to climb.
Nina was feeling discouraged, but then she noticed a tiny switch on the side of the mountain. She pressed the switch and suddenly, the mountain began to lower! It became a hill, and soon Nina was able to climb over it.
She realized that the switch had been very reliable. It had encouraged her to keep going and not give up. Now the hill was small enough that she could easily go over it.
Nina was happy. She crossed the hill and continued on her journey. From then on, she remembered to always use the switch if she ever felt discouraged or scared.
