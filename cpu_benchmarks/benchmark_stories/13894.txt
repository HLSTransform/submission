One day, a little dog named Spot was very excited. He loved to play with his ball. His ball was big and red. Spot would chew the ball all day long.
One day, Spot's ball rolled into the street. He saw a big truck coming. Spot knew this was an emergency. He had to save his ball before the truck got too close.
Spot ran fast and grabbed his ball just in time. The truck passed by and Spot was safe. He was so happy that he could keep chewing his ball. Spot learned to be careful and never let his ball roll into the street again.
