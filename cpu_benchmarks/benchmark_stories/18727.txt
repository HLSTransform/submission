Once upon a time, there was a lazy cat named Mittens. Mittens liked to sleep all day and didn't like to play. One day, Mittens went to the store to buy some milk. But when Mittens got to the store, he got a shock! The store was all out of milk! Mittens was sad and didn't know what to do. 
Then, Mittens saw a friendly dog named Spot. Spot asked Mittens what was wrong and Mittens told him about the milk. Spot said, "Don't worry, Mittens! I have some milk at my house. You can come over and have some." Mittens was happy and went to Spot's house. 
At Spot's house, Mittens had some milk and they played together. Mittens realized that it was fun to play and not be lazy all the time. Mittens and Spot became good friends and would always help each other out. The end.
