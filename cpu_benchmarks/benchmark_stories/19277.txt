Once upon a time, there was a fearful little rabbit. He had been chased by a fox and wanted to escape. So he hopped and hopped until he found a tall apple tree. He quickly hopped to the top and hid. The fox couldn't see him- he was safe! He stayed there all day, trying not to make a sound. But then the sun went down, and he was still afraid.
Just then, he saw some soap. It was funny, because rabbits don't use soap. But it could help him escape. He carefully hopped down from the tree and grabbed the soap. He hopped and he hopped, until he found a river. In the river he found a big bubble. He jumped in, and with the soap, he was able to make many big bubbles! The bubbles started to float away, and he held on tight.
The fox never saw him! He was safe! The bubbles floated away until they finally reached land. It was a beautiful place, with lots of trees and flowers. It was much better than where the fox was! But still, the rabbit was fearful.
He looked around, and noticed some other rabbits! Maybe this would be a safe place to stay. He hopped down, and was finally happy. He had escaped!
