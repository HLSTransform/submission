Emma and Leo were best friends. They liked to play in the park every day. They liked to swing, slide and run. They also liked to look for bugs and flowers.
One day, they saw a big mosquito on a leaf. It had long legs and a pointy nose. Emma thought it was adorable. She wanted to touch it.
"Look, Leo, a mosquito!" she said. "It is so cute!"
Leo did not think it was cute. He thought it was scary. He remembered that mosquitoes could bite and make you itch.
"No, Emma, don't touch it!" he said. "It is not cute, it is mean!"
But Emma did not listen. She reached out her hand to the mosquito. The mosquito saw her hand and flew away. Emma was sad. She missed the mosquito.
"Come back, mosquito!" she cried. "I want to be your friend!"
Leo hugged Emma. He tried to make her feel better.
"Don't cry, Emma," he said. "There are many other bugs and flowers to play with. Maybe we can find a butterfly or a ladybug. They are more adorable than a mosquito."
Emma wiped her tears. She smiled at Leo.
"OK, Leo," she said. "Let's go find a butterfly or a ladybug. They are more adorable than a mosquito. But I still miss the mosquito a little bit."
They held hands and ran to the other side of the park. They forgot about the mosquito and had fun. They were still best friends.
