Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she saw a little bird with a broken wing. She felt sad in her heart because she wanted to help the bird.
Lily went to ask her mommy what to do. Her mommy told her to be very gentle and careful with the bird. Lily put the bird in a cozy nest and gave it some water and seeds to eat. She checked on the bird regularly to make sure it was okay.
After a few days, the bird's wing was all better and it was able to fly away. Lily felt happy in her heart knowing that she helped the little bird. She asked her mommy if they could plant more flowers to help the birds and butterflies. Her mommy said yes, and they went outside to plant more flowers together.
