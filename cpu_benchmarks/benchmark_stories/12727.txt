Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Tim. He was only three years old. One day, Tim and his mom had an adventure. They entered a mine. 
Tim felt uncomfortable. "Mom, I'm scared," he said. 
"It's alright, Tim, I'm here with you," she replied. "Let's keep going." 
They walked deeper and deeper into the mine. 
Suddenly, Tim saw lots of twinkling lights in the dark! He smiled and asked, "Mom, what is this?" 
"It's the treasure in the mine," said Mom. 
Tim and his Mom found lots of treasures and spent some time exploring the mine. 
Exiting the mine, they both felt excited. It was an amazing adventure!
