Once upon a time, there was a little birdie who lived in a big tree. One day, the birdie saw a big fire in the forest. The birdie felt very scared and helpless. It did not know what to do.
Suddenly, the birdie saw a wise owl flying by. The birdie asked the owl for help. The owl recommended that the birdie fly far away from the smoke and the fire. So, the birdie flapped its wings and flew away as fast as it could.
The birdie felt very happy and safe when it was far away from the smoke and the fire. It thanked the wise owl for helping it. From that day on, the birdie always listened to the owl's recommendations.
