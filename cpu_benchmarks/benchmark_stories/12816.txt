Once upon a time there was a bald man who loved change. He was always looking for something new and exciting.
One day he heard about a special event happening soon. He was so excited! He decided he must go to the event. 
So, he packed his bag and made some food for the journey. He said goodbye to his family and started off on his way. 
When the bald man arrived at the event, he was amazed. Everything had changed. There were so many new things to see and do. He met lots of new people and had an amazing time. 
On the way home, the bald man thought about all the wonderful changes he had experienced. He was so happy and excited about everything he had seen.
