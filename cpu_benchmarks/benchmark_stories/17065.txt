Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Max. Max was very stubborn. He loved to play in the yard all day long. One day, his mom asked him to bring his ball back inside the house.
Max did not want to bring the ball inside. He wanted to keep playing in the yard. But his mom told him that it was going to rain soon. Max did not listen to his mom. He wanted to play more.
Then, the rain came. Max was still in the yard with his ball. The rain was very heavy. Max got all wet and his ball got lost in the water. Max was sad because he did not listen to his mom. If he had brought the ball inside, he could have played with it even when it was raining.
