Tim was three and he loved to explore. One day he went out in the garden and he saw something strange. It was a big black box with a grate on top. He knelt down to take a closer look and he saw that it was a grill.
He said to himself, "That looks fun!" He started turning knobs, pushing buttons and pressing levers. Soon, the coals in the grill were burning brightly and it was ready to use. 
Tim ran inside and asked his mother for some healthy food to cook. She gave him some vegetables and a few pieces of chicken. He eagerly put them on the grill and watched them cook. When they were ready, he carefully served them on a plate and shared the delicious meal with his mom. 
The meal was healthy and delicious! Tim was very proud that he had cooked on the grill all by himself. From that day on, he asked his mom if he could make dinner on the grill every night. She said yes and Tim was very happy.
