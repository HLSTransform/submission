Once there was a bad cage. It was built to keep animals in. One day the supplies ran out and it was hard to keep the cage clean. So the people decided to replace the bad cage with a new one. They bought more supplies to keep the new cage clean. All the animals were so happy to have a clean and safe home. They were grateful to the people who supplied them a new cage. Everyone was happy and the animals sang and cheered with joy. They loved their new cage.
