Once upon a time, there was a man. He was a white man. He was walking in the cold snow. He started to shiver because he was so cold. 
Suddenly, he saw a little girl. She was also shivering in the snow. The man felt very sad for her. He gave her a big, warm hug to make her feel better. 
The little girl was very happy. She said, "Thank you, Mr. Man! You are so nice!" The man smiled and said, "You're welcome, little girl. Stay warm!" And they both continued on their way, feeling happy and warm.
