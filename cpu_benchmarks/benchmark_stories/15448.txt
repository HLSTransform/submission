Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sarah. She loved to play in the park and have loads of fun.
One day, while Sarah was playing in the park, she saw something colorful. She ran and picked up a fake soap. It had lots of glitter, and Sarah thought it was so pretty.
Sarah wanted to take it home, but it changed when she touched it. Her hand was suddenly all soapy. She wondered how the soap had changed so quickly.
Sarah kept the soap and began playing with it. She pretended it was a doll and she even named it "Sparkle". Sarah was so happy that she had found something new to play with.
As she was playing, Sarah realized that the soap smelled so nice. She smiled and hugged it. She knew that her new friend wasn't fake at all.
The End.
