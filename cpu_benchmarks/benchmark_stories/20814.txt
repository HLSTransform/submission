Once upon a time there were two little birds, Joe and May. They were very good friends and sang together everyday in the park. One day, Joe asked May if she would marry him. May thought this was a very foolish idea as they were just friends but still said yes.
The next day, Joe and May went on a trail in the forest. They climbed some trees and followed a small stream until they met a pond. Joe got a little box out of his pocket and showed May a beautiful ring. He asked May once again if she would marry him. 
May started laughing and said no. She said that they were too young to get married and they should wait until they were older. Joe replied that he was really serious and wanted to marry her. May said that although it was a sweet thought, it was a very foolish thing to do and that she must say no.
Joe was disappointed, but May was relieved. She hugged Joe and thanked him for the sweet thought. They carried on with their trail adventure until the sun started to set. Joe and May said goodbye, happier than ever as friends.
