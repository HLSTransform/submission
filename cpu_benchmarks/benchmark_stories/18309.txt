Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She woke up one morning and felt very happy because her mommy made waffles for breakfast. She sat at the table and ate her waffles with syrup on top. 
Suddenly, her little brother came and asked for some syrup too. Lily said, "Sure, I'll pour some for you." But when she tried to pour the syrup, the bottle slipped from her hand and spilled all over the table. 
Lily's mommy got very upset and scolded her for being careless. Lily felt sad and started to cry. She didn't feel happy anymore. She learned that she needs to be more careful next time.
