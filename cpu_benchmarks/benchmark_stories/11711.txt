Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Paul. He had a cute little donkey named Daisy. He used Daisy to carry all his crops to the farmers market. One day, Paul and Daisy were walking to the market when they saw a shield lying on the ground. It was very shiny and Paul was very happy. He decided to carry it with him. 
When they got to the market, Paul found a customer who wanted to buy the shield. He was very happy and made lots of money. Paul shared the money with Daisy and she was so happy! 
The moral of the story is that people should be kind and generous. If you help others, good things will come your way.
