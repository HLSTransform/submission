John was in the big field. He saw the wheat rise up high. He was nosy and wanted to see how high it could go. 
John said, "Look how high the wheat can rise!"
John's mom answered, "Yes, John. The wheat grows tall when the sun shines on it."
John asked, "Can I touch it?"
John's mom replied, "Of course, John. You can feel the wheat and see how tall it can get."
John stretched his arms up high and touched the wheat. He was amazed at how tall it was. He smiled and said, "I wonder how high it will rise tomorrow?"
John's mom smiled and said, "Let's come and see tomorrow, John."
