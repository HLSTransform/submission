Once upon a time there was a deep raven. Every day he liked to fly high in the sky and look around. One day he spotted a pig below. The pig was very sad and had a tear on his cheek. The raven decided to help the pig and fluttered down to the ground.
The raven asked the pig what was wrong and the pig replied that he was lost. The raven brushed his wing against the pig's cheek and it seemed to make the pig feel better. The pig thanked the raven and followed him.
The raven led the pig to a river where the pig washed his face and wiped his tears away. With a smile on his face, the pig thanked the raven once more and waved goodbye. The raven flew off into the sky, happy to have helped the lost pig.
