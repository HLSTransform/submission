Once there was a family of four. Dad, mum, Jess and Jack. One day Dad had a big idea. He ordered them all to pick up fallen leaves in their garden.
Mum, Jess and Jack all started picking up the leaves. But Jack was feeling lazy and he just stood there, not doing anything.
"Why aren't you helping," asked mum. 
Jack just shrugged and said, "I don't want to."
Mum sighed and said, "Jack, it's important to help when we are ordered to do something. And you should always do your best!"
Jack heard what mum said and started to help. Before long, the family had picked up all the leaves and the garden was tidy. 
The moral of the story is: when we are ordered to do something, we should always do our best.
