Once upon a time, there was a silly little girl named Jane. She was three years old and loved to explore the world around her.
One day, in her exploration of the house, Jane opened the big, cold freezer. Inside, she found a big box of yummy treats, and she wanted them all. 
So, with a mischievous smile, Jane shook the freezer and all the yummy treats spilled out. She was so excited to find all the delicious treats and couldn't wait to eat them.
But then, a loud voice called out from behind her. It was her big brother! He had been watching her the whole time, and he was very envious of her happy discovery. 
He promised to share the treats, but Jane had already eaten them all. As he shook his head in disappointment, Jane could only giggle with joy!
