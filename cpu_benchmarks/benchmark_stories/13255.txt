Once there was a mother. She had a blue box that she wanted to organize. Every day she thought to herself, "I should organize the box." But there were so many things in it that she couldn't decide what to do.
One day she decided to ask her 3 year old child for help! She asked, "Will you please help me organize my blue box?" The child was excited and said yes.
Together, the mother and the child sorted through the blue box and began organizing it. They put things in piles and sorted them by type. When they finished, the box looked neat and tidy. 
The mother was very happy with the work her child had done. She thanked him for his help and gave him a big hug. From then on, the mother was always sure to ask her 3 year old child to help her organize things!
