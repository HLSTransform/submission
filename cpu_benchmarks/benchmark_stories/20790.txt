Mark and his family arrived at the store. It was full of people, and the lines seemed tight. Mark's dad was looking around, trying to find something to buy.
After a while, Mark's dad said, "Mark, look at this order. It's very big. Do you think we should buy it?"
Mark really wanted to get the order, but he was a bit scared. He asked his Dad, "What's it for? Is it heavy?"
His Dad smiled and said, "It will help us with our work. It's not too heavy, and we have enough money." 
Mark thought about it for a moment and then decided he wanted to get the order. He said, "Yes, Daddy, let's get it!"
Mark and his Dad went to the counter and paid for the order. On the way home, Mark felt very proud. He was happy he was brave enough to mark the order.
