Once upon a time, there was a friendly dog named Max. Max loved to play with his friends in the park. One day, Max saw a piece of gum on the ground. He wanted to eat it, but his owner said no. Max felt sad and wanted to lift his owner's hand to get the gum, but he didn't. 
Later that day, Max went for a walk by himself. He saw the gum again and decided to eat it. The gum got stuck in his throat and he couldn't breathe. Max tried to lift his paw to call for help, but it was too late. Max passed away because of the gum. 
The end.
