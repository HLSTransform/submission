Little Jack was walking in the park. He liked to look up in the sky and see the birds flying around. As he looked up at the sky, he saw something scary. It was his older brother, teasing him by jumping from branch to branch! Jack was scared but he didn't want to show it. He had heard stories from his mom about how dangerous it was to tease people in the park. 
Jack's brother came down from the tree and apologized for teasing Jack. He said he was just trying to have some fun and wanted Jack to join in. So Jack slowly climbed up the tree and looked down from the top. He was amazed by how high he was, and he could see the whole park! Soon the boys were happily looking at the sky and pointing out the birds that flew around them. 
Jack's brother reminded him to never tease anyone, especially in a scary place like the park. Jack understood, and he promised himself to have fun but never to tease anyone ever again. He was grateful to his brother for helping him stay safe!
