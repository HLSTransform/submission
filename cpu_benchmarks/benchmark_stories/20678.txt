Once there was a boy, and his name was Jack. Jack really wanted to play with a toy. He found a beautiful kite made of string. He wanted to fly it, so he asked his mom to help him feed it. 
His mom said yes, and gave him a little bit of help. She showed him how to hold the string, and Jack was so happy. He smiled as the kite flew up in the sky.
But then, the wind started to blow, and the string got stuck in a big, tall tree. Jack was very upset. He tried to pull it out, but it was too hard. He started to cry.
His mom was sad to see her son so upset. She told him not to worry, and went to get a ladder. She climbed up and carefully grabbed the string, and placed it back in Jack's hands.
Jack was so thankful. He hugged his mom and said thank you. 
He smiled and started to feed the string, and the kite flew up into the sky once again. Jack was so happy to be able to play again.
