Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she saw a big ball and decided to kick it. The ball went in a circle and Lily laughed.
As she played, she noticed how peaceful it was in the park. The birds were singing and the sun was shining. Lily felt happy and content. She kept playing and running around, feeling free and joyful.
After a while, Lily got tired and sat down on the grass. She looked up at the sky and saw fluffy clouds that looked like animals. She smiled and felt grateful for the beautiful day. She knew she would come back to the park soon and play again.
