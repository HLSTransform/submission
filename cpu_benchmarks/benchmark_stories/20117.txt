Ben and Sam are brothers. They like to play with cars. One day, they see a big red car in the shop. It has lights and sounds and can go very fast. They want to buy the car.
They ask their mom. "Mom, can we buy the car? It is great!" they say. Mom looks at the car. She says, "No, you cannot buy the car. It is too expensive. You have many cars at home. You do not need another one."
Ben and Sam are sad. They cry and beg. "Please, mom, please! We love the car! We will share it and take good care of it!" they say. Mom says, "No, I said no. Stop crying and come with me. We have to go home now."
Ben and Sam are angry. They do not listen to mom. They run to the car and grab it. They try to take it out of the shop. But the shopkeeper sees them. He shouts, "Hey, you! Stop! You cannot take the car! You have to pay for it!"
The shopkeeper runs after them. He catches them and takes the car back. He calls mom. He says, "Your boys tried to steal the car! That is very bad! You have to pay for the car or I will call the police!"
Mom is shocked and ashamed. She says, "I am so sorry! I did not know they did that! They are very naughty! I will pay for the car and punish them!" She pays for the car and takes Ben and Sam home. She is very angry. She says, "You are in big trouble! You will not play with any cars for a long time! You will go to your room and think about what you did!"
Ben and Sam are very sorry. They wish they did not take the car. They wish they listened to mom. They cry and say, "We are sorry, mom. We made a big mistake. We will never do it again."
But mom does not hear them. She closes the door and leaves them alone. They do not have the car. They do not have any cars. They do not have any fun. They have a bad ending.
