Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a white teddy bear that she loved very much. One day, Lily noticed that her teddy bear's battery had run out and it wouldn't move anymore. She asked her mom for help and they went to the store to buy a new battery. 
At the store, Lily saw a sign that said "Batteries for Sale". She pointed to the sign and said "Look, Mommy! Batteries!" They found the right battery for her teddy bear and went back home. 
Lily's mom put the new battery in the teddy bear and it started moving again. Lily was so happy and hugged her teddy bear tightly. She said "Thank you, Mommy. Now my teddy bear is happy again!"
