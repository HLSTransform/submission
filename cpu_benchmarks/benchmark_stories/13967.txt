Once upon a time, there was a cute puppy named Spot. Spot was very adorable and loved to play with his ball. One day, Spot's owner gave him a lecture about not chewing on shoes. Spot listened carefully and promised to be a good boy.
Later that day, Spot went outside to play with his ball. Suddenly, a big storm came and lightning struck a nearby tree. Spot got scared and ran back inside. His owner hugged him and told him he was safe.
From that day on, Spot never chewed on shoes again and was always careful during storms. He knew that listening to his owner's lectures was important and would keep him safe.
