Lily and Tom liked to play with the board. The board had many colors and shapes. They could make pictures and words with the board. But one day, the board broke. Lily and Tom were sad.
They asked their mom to fix the board. Mom said she would try. She took the board to the garage. She used glue and tape and scissors. She worked hard to restore the board. She wanted Lily and Tom to be happy.
After a while, mom came back with the board. She showed Lily and Tom the board. It looked like new. The colors and shapes were all there. Lily and Tom were very happy. They hugged mom and thanked her. They said she was successful. They went to play with the board again. They made pictures and words with the board. They had fun. Mom smiled and watched them. She was happy too.
