Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play with their toys. They had many toys, but their favorite was a long rope that they could make into different shapes. Sometimes they made a snake, sometimes a bridge, sometimes a swing.
One day, they wanted to play with the rope, but they could not agree on what to make. Lily wanted to make a knot, because she liked how it looked. Ben wanted to make a loop, because he liked how it felt. They both pulled on the rope, trying to get their way.
"Let me make a knot!" Lily said.
"No, let me make a loop!" Ben said.
They pulled and pulled, until the rope was so tight that it hurt their hands. They also made a big mess in their room, with toys and clothes everywhere. They were not happy at all.
Their mom came in and saw the mess and the tight rope. She was not happy either. She asked them what they were doing, and why they were fighting. They told her that they wanted to play with the rope, but they could not agree on what to make.
Mom said, "You know, you can both play with the rope, and have fun, if you learn to share and take turns. You can make a knot, and then a loop, and then something else. You can also help each other, and learn from each other. That way, you can be kind and happy, and not hurt yourselves or make a mess."
Lily and Ben thought about what mom said. They realized that she was right. They said sorry to each other, and to mom. They untied the rope, and decided to make a knot first, and then a loop. They also cleaned up their room, and put their toys and clothes away.
They played with the rope, and had a lot of fun. They made many shapes, and laughed and hugged. They were glad that they learned to share and take turns, and to settle their problems with words, not with pulling. They also learned that the rope was more fun when it was long and loose, not short and tight.
