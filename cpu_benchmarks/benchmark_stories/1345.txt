Once upon a time there was a small chair. It was very special because the chair could explain lots of things. Every day the chair would explain something new to a little 3 year old girl.
One day the chair explained what clouds were. It said that clouds were like white fluffy pillows in the sky. The little girl was amazed and asked the chair for more information.
The chair also Explained how birds fly. It told her that birds flap their wings and this makes them go up in the sky. The little girl was astonished and the chair would explain more and more things every day.
The small chair was a magical one and the little girl never stopped asking questions. She loved sitting on the chair and learning all sorts of things from it.
