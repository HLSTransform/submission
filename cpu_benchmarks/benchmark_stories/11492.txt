Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his blocks. He had many different colors and shapes of blocks. One day, Tim went to a new school. He felt shy and did not recognize any of the other kids.
At playtime, Tim saw a girl named Lily playing with blocks too. Tim walked over to Lily and said, "Hi, can I play with you?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, let's build a big tower with the blocks!" They played together and built a very tall tower. Soon, other kids came over and joined them. They all had fun playing with the blocks and building together.
After that day, Tim and Lily became popular in school because they were kind and always shared their blocks with others. All the kids wanted to play with them. The moral of the story is that if you share and are kind to others, you will make many friends.
