Lily was a little girl who liked to stare at the big building across the street. It was a university, where big people went to learn and play. Lily wanted to go there too, but her mom said she was too small.
One day, Lily saw a boy sitting on the steps of the university. He looked sad and lonely. He had no friends to talk to or play with. Lily felt sorry for him. She decided to go and say hello.
She crossed the street and walked up to the boy. She smiled and said, "Hi, I'm Lily. What's your name?"
The boy looked up and saw Lily. He was surprised and curious. He said, "Hi, I'm Ben. I'm new here. I don't know anyone."
Lily said, "That's okay. I don't know anyone here either. But we can be friends. Do you want to play with me?"
Ben nodded and smiled. He said, "Yes, I do. Thank you, Lily. You are very nice."
Lily and Ben held hands and ran to the park. They played on the swings, the slide, and the sandbox. They laughed and had fun. They forgot about being lonely. They were happy. They had found a new friend.
