One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk in the park. He saw a fast rabbit run by. Tim wanted to catch the rabbit, but it was too fast for him. He tried to run, but he could not catch it. Tim felt sad and gave a little shrug.
As he walked deeper into the park, Tim saw a pretty mist near the pond. The mist was like a soft, wet cloud on the ground. Tim walked into the mist and felt it on his face. It made him feel happy and cool.
In the mist, Tim met a kind frog. The frog asked Tim why he was sad. Tim told the frog about the fast rabbit. The frog said, "Don't be sad, Tim. You can't catch everything, and that's okay." Tim smiled and felt better. He played with the frog in the mist, and they became good friends.
