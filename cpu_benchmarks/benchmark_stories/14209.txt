Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was three years old and loved to explore and learn new things. 
One day, Tom wanted to go outside and play, but his mom said that it was too cold and he had to stay inside. Tom didn't want to listen and he shouted at his mom. His mom was very angry and said that Tom had to stay inside for the rest of the day and Tom had to wear his coldest clothes.
Tom was very sad and started to cry. He went to his room and put on his coldest clothes. As he was now wearing these cold clothes he became very bitter.
Tom eventually went outside and started to run around, despite his mom warning him. Suddenly, Tom tripped over a rock and he shouted out in pain. His mom then came running over to him and said that it was her way of trying to keep him safe and that he should listen to her next time.
The moral of this story is to not ignore your parents warning. It may not always be pleasant, but it is always done with your best interests at heart.
