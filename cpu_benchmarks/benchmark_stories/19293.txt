Once upon a time there was a little girl named June. Every year, June's family would go on vacation. This year, June was so proud because she was going to drive with her family to the beach.
On the way to the beach, June was very excited. She played in the car with her toys. Finally, the family arrived at the beach. June ran out of the car to the sand and the waves.
June looked around and saw other families playing. She saw some children building sand castles and some people flying kites. June smiled and felt very happy.
Finally, when it was time to go, June hugged her family goodbye. She already couldn't wait until next year to come back and be proud of another fun vacation.
