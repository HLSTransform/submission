Tim and Mia like to paint. They have many colors and brushes. They paint on big papers on the floor. Tim paints a pirate with a hat and a sword. Mia paints a princess with a dress and a crown.
"Look at my pirate!" Tim says. "He is brave and strong. He can find treasure and fight bad guys."
"Look at my princess!" Mia says. "She is pretty and kind. She can sing and dance and make friends."
Tim and Mia show each other their paintings. They are proud of their work.
But then, a grumpy cat comes in. The cat does not like to paint. The cat likes to sleep and scratch. The cat sees the papers on the floor. The cat thinks they are toys. The cat jumps on the papers and tears them with his claws.
"Hey, stop that!" Tim shouts. "You are ruining our paintings!"
"Go away, cat!" Mia cries. "You are mean and naughty!"
But the cat does not listen. The cat keeps jumping and tearing. Tim and Mia are sad and angry. They try to chase the cat away. But the cat is fast and sneaky. The cat runs under the sofa and hides.
Tim and Mia look at their paintings. They are ripped and messy. They cannot fix them. They hug each other and cry.
"Sorry, Tim," Mia says. "Your pirate was cool."
"Sorry, Mia," Tim says. "Your princess was beautiful."
They wipe their tears and smile.
"It's okay," Mia says. "We can paint again."
"Yes," Tim says. "We can paint something new."
They get new papers and colors. They start to paint again. They paint a castle and a dragon. They paint a boat and a dolphin. They paint a rainbow and a star.
They are happy and creative. They forget about the grumpy cat. They have fun with their paintings.
