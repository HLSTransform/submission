Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go on car rides with his mommy and daddy. But one day, Timmy's mommy and daddy had to go to work and couldn't take him on a car ride. Timmy was sad and bored.
Timmy asked his babysitter if she could take him on a car ride, but she refused. Timmy was even sadder now. He decided to go on a car ride by himself. He got into his toy car and started driving down the street.
But then, Timmy crashed into a tree and hurt himself badly. His mommy and daddy came home and took him to the hospital. Timmy learned that it's not safe to go on car rides by himself and that he should always listen to grown-ups. The moral of the story is to always be safe and listen to grown-ups.
