Ben and Sam are brothers. They like to play with cars and trucks. They have a big box of toys in their room. One day, they want to play with the same truck. It is red and shiny and has a loud horn.
"Give me the truck!" Ben says. He tries to grab it from Sam.
"No, it is mine!" Sam says. He holds the truck tight.
They pull and push and shout. They do not share. They do not yield.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to their room. She sees the mess and the angry faces.
"What is going on here?" Mom asks. She is not happy.
"Ben wants my truck!" Sam says.
"Sam won't let me have it!" Ben says.
Mom shakes her head. She picks up the truck and puts it on a shelf.
"Enough!" Mom says. "You are both poor at playing. You need to learn to take turns and be kind. No truck for either of you until you say sorry and hug."
Ben and Sam look at the truck. They look at each other. They feel sad and sorry. They do not want to fight.
They say sorry and hug. Mom smiles. She gives them the truck back.
"Good boys," Mom says. "Now you can play nicely. And remember to yield sometimes. It is good to share."
Ben and Sam nod. They thank Mom. They play with the truck together. They make it go fast and slow and honk the horn. They have fun. They see the light.
