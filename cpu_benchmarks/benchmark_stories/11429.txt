Jim was a small boy who lived with his family in the city. One day, they decided to take a drive to go and explore a forest. As they got closer, Jim was excited to see all the trees and animals. He pointed to everything that he saw in the distance. 
Eventually, they arrived in the forest. Jim's parents allowed him to wander and explore, so he journeyed into the depths of the trees. He was amazed at how quiet and peaceful it was. But then, he noticed something even more unusual. He could see a faint light in the middle of the trees. He pointed to the light and asked his parents what it was. 
His parents told him that it was nothing to worry about and that they should continue exploring the forest. Jim reluctantly agreed and kept walking, but he could not let the light go. 
Later, as Jim and his family were walking out of the forest, the light had grown brighter. His parents looked at each other, then his father reached into their backpacks and pulled out two flashlights. He smiled at Jim, handed him a flashlight, and said, "It looks like you had an unusual idea, son. Let's see what we can find!" 
Jim smiled and pointed his flashlight towards the light in the forest. He had figured out that the unusual light he had seen was not an ordinary one. It was a new adventure waiting to be explored.
