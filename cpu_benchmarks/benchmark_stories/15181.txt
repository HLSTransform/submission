Once upon a time, there were two friends called Jack and Jill. They loved to play together. They would play games and laugh loudly.
One day, Jack and Jill spotted a box of matches. They wondered what to do with them. Jill suggested it would be fun to light one. Jack thought it would be a good idea so they lit a match.
When the match was lit, Jill laughed and asked Jack to light another. But Jack was sad. He didn't want to, he wanted to be extra safe.
Jack said to Jill, "Let's save the matches for another time". Jill nodded sadly, understanding why they had to be careful. 
The next day, Jack and Jill decided to go outside and picnic. When they sat down, they realized they left the box of matches at home. As they looked for something to do, Jack's face lit up with an idea! 
Jack said to Jill, "Let's look for sticks and make a fire. We can use the matches from yesterday to start it!" Jill laughed and agreed. 
Using the matches from the day before, Jack and Jill were able to make a fire and toast marshmallows. They laughed and played until the sun went down.
