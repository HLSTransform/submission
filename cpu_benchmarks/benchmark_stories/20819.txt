Once upon a time, there was a row of dolls, hidden away in a special room. The room was very big, and the dolls sat in a single line. Every night, the little girl would lock the door to the room so the dolls would be safe. 
One day, the little girl wanted to show her friends her dolls. But when she opened the door, the dolls were gone! She looked all around the room, but she couldn't find them anywhere. 
The little girl was sad and she thought the dolls were lost forever, but then she remembered that the door was still locked. Suddenly the little girl remembered - the dolls were hidden in a secret place and only she knew the special way to find it! 
The little girl was so excited. She pushed and pulled on the wall until she found the hidden door. Sure enough, the dolls were inside. The little girl hugged them all and put them back in a straight row. She knew she would always have to remember to lock the special door so her dolls would be safe.
