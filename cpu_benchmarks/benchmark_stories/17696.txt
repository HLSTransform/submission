Once upon a time there were two little kids named Susie and Emmie.
One day, they wanted to go the park to play together. So they put on their coats and left the house.
But soon after they left, Susie fell and hurt her arm. She started to cry.
Luckily, an ambulance came and took her to the hospital. The ambulance was big and noisy and very filthy.
At the hospital, the doctor checked Susie's arm. He said it would be okay with some rest. So the doctor put Susie in a special bed and gave her some yummy ice cream and juice. 
Finally, Susie's arm was all better. Emmie and Susie had a big hug and were so glad to be done with the hospital. Together, they skipped all the way home.
