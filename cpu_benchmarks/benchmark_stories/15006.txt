Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Nasti. She was very brave, and liked to try new things. She also liked to play games. One day, while Nasti was playing a game, she tried to find something soft and fun. She found some hay, so she used it to make a game.
Nasti and her friends had a lot of fun playing with the hay. But then, they had a competition to see who could win. Nasti tried her best, but the game was a bit uncomfortable for her. She was so small and the hay was big. She didn't feel very sure of herself. 
But then, something surprising happened. Nasti won! She was so happy and proud of herself. She started jumping around and clapping her hands. Nasti had learned that it was okay to feel uncomfortable sometimes, but still try her best. She was so proud of herself for winning the game.
