Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim who loved to play in the park. He had a kite that he loved to fly high in the sky. One day, he went to the park to fly his kite, but it got stuck in a tree. Tim was sad and didn't know what to do. He was poor and didn't have any money to buy a new kite.
As Tim was walking home, he saw a swing in a nearby playground. He decided to take a swing and try to forget about his kite. While he was swinging, he saw a man walking towards him. The man asked Tim why he looked so sad. Tim told him about his kite getting stuck in the tree and how he couldn't afford a new one.
The man smiled and told Tim to follow him. They walked to the park, and the man climbed up the tree to get Tim's kite. Tim was so happy and grateful. He thanked the man and ran home to fly his kite again. From that day on, Tim always remembered the kind man who helped him get his kite back.
