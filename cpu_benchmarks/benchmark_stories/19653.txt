Once upon a time, there was a scared cat. The cat was small and always looking around, like it was afraid. One day, the cat decided to go outside. It was nervous, but wanted to explore the world.
The cat trotted around for a long time. It saw trees move in the wind and heard birds singing. Then, it came up to a big house. The cat wanted to go inside.
Suddenly, the door opened and a grownup appeared. The grownup looked at the cat and smiled. The grownup said, "Would you like to come inside?" The cat was a bit frightened but the grownup seemed kind.
The cat nodded and the grownup allowed it to come inside. The cat was so happy! It ran around the house exploring new places and finding new friends. The cat even found a cozy spot to take a nap. The grownup and the cat became very good friends. They would spend hours playing together and snuggling.
The cat was now safe, happy and no longer scared. It had found a new home and new friend. Every day, the grownup and cat would be together, snuggling and playing until the sun went down. They were very happy together. The end!
