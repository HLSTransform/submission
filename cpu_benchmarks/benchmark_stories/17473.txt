Lily and Tom were playing hide and seek in their room. Lily was the seeker and Tom was the hider. Lily counted to ten and then looked for Tom. She checked under the bed, behind the curtains, and in the closet. She could not find him.
"Where are you, Tom?" she called out. "I give up!"
Tom did not answer. He was hiding behind a big sheet that was hanging on the wall. He thought he was very clever and wanted to surprise Lily. He waited for her to come closer and then he jumped out from behind the sheet.
"Boo!" he shouted.
Lily was very scared. She did not expect Tom to appear from behind the sheet. She screamed and ran away. She tripped over a toy and fell to the floor. She hurt her knee and started to cry.
Tom felt bad. He did not mean to scare Lily so much. He ran to her and tried to help her. He said he was sorry and gave her a hug. He offered her his favorite teddy bear to make her feel better.
But Lily was very angry. She did not want Tom's teddy bear. She did not want his hug. She did not want his sorry. She pushed him away and said he was mean. She said she did not want to play with him anymore. She said he was not her brother.
Tom was very sad. He did not understand why Lily was so mad. He thought he was just playing a game. He thought she would laugh and play again. He thought she was generous and kind. He did not know what to do.
He went to his bed and covered himself with his sheet. He wished he had never jumped out from behind the sheet. He wished he had never scared Lily. He wished he had never played hide and seek. He wished he had a different sister.
