Tim and Lily liked to watch videos on the big screen. They liked funny videos with animals and songs. But one day, they found a video that was not funny. It was scary.
The video had a dark house and a loud noise. A man with a mask and a knife came out of the house. He chased a woman who screamed. Tim and Lily felt scared. They wanted to stop the video, but they did not know how.
"Mommy, mommy, help!" Tim cried. He blinked his eyes and hoped the video would go away.
"Tim, Lily, what's wrong?" Mommy came into the room. She saw the video and turned it off. She hugged Tim and Lily and said, "I'm sorry, my loves. You should not watch this video. It is not for kids. It is only pretend, but it is still scary. Let's watch something else, okay?"
"Okay, mommy," Tim and Lily said. They felt better. Mommy put on a video with a funny dog and a ball. Tim and Lily laughed and forgot about the scary video. They were happy again.
