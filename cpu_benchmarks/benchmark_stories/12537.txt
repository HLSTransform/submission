Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy car that he loved very much, but one day it went missing. Timmy searched and searched for his car but he couldn't find it. He asked his mommy and daddy to help him look for it too. 
They all looked in the toy box, under the bed, and even in the closet. But the toy car was nowhere to be found. Timmy felt sad and weird because he missed his car very much. 
One day, Timmy's mommy found the toy car in the laundry basket. It had accidentally fallen in there. Timmy was so happy and he hugged his car tight. He thanked his mommy and daddy for trying to help him search for his car.
