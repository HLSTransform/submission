Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim liked to play with his wagon. His wagon was red and it was light, so Tim could pull it easily. 
One day, Tim went to the park with his wagon. He played with his friends and they had fun. But when it was time to go home, Tim realized that he had lost his favorite toy. He looked everywhere, but he couldn't find it.
Tim's mom saw that he was sad and asked him what was wrong. Tim told her about his lost wagon. His mom said they would go back to the park and look for it.
When they got to the park, Tim saw a man with a sack. The man had found Tim's wagon and put it in the sack to keep it safe. Tim was happy to have his wagon back and thanked the man. He put his wagon in the back of the car and they went home.
