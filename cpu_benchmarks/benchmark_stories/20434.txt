Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a tap in her bathroom that made funny noises. One night, Lily woke up to a mysterious sound coming from the bathroom. She tiptoed to the door and opened it slowly. 
Inside the bathroom, she saw the tap moving by itself! Lily was scared but she remembered her mommy telling her to be brave. She walked towards the tap and tapped it gently. The tap stopped moving and the mysterious sound stopped too. 
Lily went back to bed feeling proud of herself for being brave. From that day on, she wasn't scared of mysterious sounds anymore. She knew that sometimes, all it took was a little tap to make things stop.
