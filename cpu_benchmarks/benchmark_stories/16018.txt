Once upon a time, there was a huge peanut. It was so big; it was almost as tall as a three-year-old child! One day, the child took the peanut and put it into the sunshine. He watched as the sunshine shone on the peanut. 
Suddenly, the peanut started to melt. The child was surprised! He said to the peanut, "Why are you melting?"
The peanut replied, "The sun is too hot for me. I’m melting because the sunshine is too strong for me!"
The child thought for a moment and then said, “Do you want to come into the shade? I can help keep you cool!” 
The peanut thanked the child and said, “That would be great!” 
So, the child put the peanut into the shade, and the peanut didn’t melt any more. From then on, the child and the peanut were the best of friends.
