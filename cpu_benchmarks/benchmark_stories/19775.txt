Once there was a pink cat named Silly. She lived in a big house with lots of windows. One day, Silly saw a big, scary spider outside the window. She screamed so loudly that the spider ran away scared. Then Silly started to laugh. She was so happy that the spider was gone.
Silly ran all around the house, laughing and screaming. Her laughter was so loud that it filled the house. Everywhere Silly went she could hear her own laughter echoing off the walls.
Then Silly saw a big butterfly. She was so excited. She ran towards it and gave a very loud, happy scream. The butterfly flew away, scared by the noise.
Silly laughed even harder. She ran around the house, screaming and laughing at everything she saw. In the end, Silly was silly and pink and happy.
