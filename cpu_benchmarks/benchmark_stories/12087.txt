Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toy animals all day. One day, her mom made beef for dinner. Lily didn't like the beef and said, "I don't want to eat it, Mommy." 
Her mom replied, "You have to eat it, Lily. It's good for you." 
Lily tried to eat the beef, but she was clumsy and dropped her fork. She said, "I don't like it, Mommy. It's too hard to eat." 
Her mom said, "Don't ignore your dinner, Lily. You have to eat it all." 
Lily tried again and finally finished her beef. She felt proud of herself and said, "I did it, Mommy! I ate all my beef!"
