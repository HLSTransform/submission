Once upon a time, there was a nice otter. The otter lived in a big river. He had many friends. The otter was harmless and liked to play all day.
One day, the otter wanted to spend time with his best friend, a little fish. They swam in the river and played games. They found a big rock to hide behind. They laughed and had fun together.
At the end of the day, the otter and the little fish were very happy. They spent a great day together. They said goodbye and went back to their homes. The otter knew he had a good friend and could not wait to spend more time with the little fish.
