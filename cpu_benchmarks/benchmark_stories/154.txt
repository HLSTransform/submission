Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had a teddy bear that she loved very much. One day, Lily lost her teddy bear and she was very sad. She looked everywhere for her teddy bear, but she couldn't find it. Lily started to feel anxious and worried that she would never find her teddy bear.
Lily's mommy saw that Lily was suffering because she lost her teddy bear. She tried to help Lily find her teddy bear, but they still couldn't find it. Then, Lily's daddy had an idea. He remembered that they went to the park yesterday and maybe the teddy bear was left there. They went to the park and found the teddy bear! Lily was so happy and she hugged her teddy bear tightly. She was no longer anxious and her smile came back. From that day on, Lily never let go of her teddy bear again.
