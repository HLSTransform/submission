Tom and Lily are playing in the park. They see a big machine near the fence. It has wheels, pipes and buttons. Tom wants to go and touch it. Lily says no.
"That is a dangerous machine. It can hurt you. Mommy and Daddy said we cannot go near it. We have to stay here and play with our toys."
But Tom does not listen. He runs to the fence and climbs over it. He goes to the machine and pushes a button. The machine makes a loud noise and starts to move. Tom is scared. He tries to run away, but he falls. He hurts his knee and cries.
Lily hears Tom cry. She runs to the fence and sees him on the ground. She is worried. She calls for help.
"Help! Help! Tom is hurt! He went to the dangerous machine and he fell!"
A man hears Lily's voice. He is a worker. He works with the machine. He runs to Tom and picks him up. He checks his knee and puts a bandage on it. He carries him to the fence and gives him to Lily. He is angry.
"What were you doing here? This is a dangerous machine. It is not a toy. You could have been hurt very badly. You have to listen to your sister. She is smart. She knows what is safe and what is not. You have to say sorry to her and to me."
Tom is sorry. He says sorry to the worker and to Lily. He hugs Lily and says thank you. He says he will not go to the dangerous machine again. He says he will listen to Lily and play with their toys. Lily hugs him back and says it is okay. She says she loves him and she is glad he is okay. They go back to their toys and play. They are happy.
