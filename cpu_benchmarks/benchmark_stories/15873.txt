Once there was a boy called Jam. He was a happy 3 year old. One day he needed a new ashtray for his bedroom. He asked his mom if he could get one. 
"An ashtray?," asked mom.
"Yes, please. A popular ashtray," said Jam.
Mom thought for a moment. Finally she said, "Okay, if you really need it."
Jam was very excited. He went to the store and bought the most popular ashtray he could find. When he got home, he couldn't wait to put his new ashtray in his bedroom. He smiled and looked at it every day.
Jam was now very happy. He thanked his mom for getting him the ashtray that he needed to make his bedroom complete.
