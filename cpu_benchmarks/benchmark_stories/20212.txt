Ben and Mia were playing in the garden. They liked to dig holes in the dirt and fill them with water. They pretended they were making ponds for frogs and fish.
"Look, I made a big hole!" Ben said, showing Mia his hole. "It is very deep and wet."
"That is a good hole, Ben," Mia said. "But mine is better. It is wider and has more water. See, I can spread my arms and touch both sides."
Ben looked at Mia's hole. He felt a little jealous. He wanted his hole to be bigger and better too. He had an idea. He took his shovel and started to dig more dirt from his hole. He dug and dug, making his hole deeper and wider.
"Ben, what are you doing?" Mia asked. "You are making a mess. You are throwing dirt on my hole. Stop it!"
But Ben did not stop. He dug faster and faster, until his hole was so big that it reached Mia's hole. The two holes became one huge hole. The water from Mia's hole spilled into Ben's hole, making a big puddle.
"Ben, you ruined my hole!" Mia cried. "You made an ugly hole. It is not a pond anymore. It is a swamp. I don't like it. I don't like you!"
Mia ran away, leaving Ben alone with his ugly hole. Ben felt sad. He realized he had made a mistake. He wished he had not dug so much. He wished he had not made Mia angry. He wished he had a friend to play with. He looked at his ugly hole and felt sorry. He wished he could make it better.
