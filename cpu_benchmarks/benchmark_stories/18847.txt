Lily liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Anna. Anna had long hair, a pretty dress, and a big smile. Lily liked to attach ribbons and clips to Anna's hair and make her look fancy.
One day, Lily found a new toy in the garage. It was a big machine with wheels and buttons. Lily wanted to see what it could do. She pushed a button and the machine made a loud noise. Lily was scared, but she was also curious. She pushed another button and the machine moved forward.
Lily saw Anna on the floor. She had left her there when she went to the garage. Lily wanted to get Anna, but the machine was faster. The machine ran over Anna and broke her. Anna's hair was torn, her dress was ripped, and her smile was gone. Lily cried and cried. She tried to fix Anna, but she could not. Anna was broken and covered with dust. Lily was very sad. She wished she had never played with the machine. She wished she had stayed with Anna. She hugged Anna and said she was sorry, but Anna did not answer. Anna was gone.
