Timmy found a case in the park. It was filled with fake things, but one of them looked interesting. He took it out and chewed on it. Timmy thought it was yummy, even though it was fake.
Mom saw Timmy with the fake thing and asked him where he got it. Timmy pointed at the case filled with fake things. Mom could not believe it, and she told Timmy that he shouldn't be chewing on fake things.
Timmy apologized and put the fake thing back in the case. He started to play with his toys, but he thought about the case every once in awhile. He wished he could find something like it again.
