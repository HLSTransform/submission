Ben and Mia are playing in the snow. They make a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They give him a carrot nose and two buttons for eyes. They are very happy.
"Look, our snowman is smiling!" Mia says.
"Yes, he is. He likes the snow," Ben says.
They hear a ring from the house. It is Mom. She calls them to come inside.
"Ben, Mia, time for lunch! Come on, it's cold outside!"
Ben and Mia run to the house. They take off their boots and gloves. They see their shoes by the door. They put them on.
"Mom, can we go out again after lunch?" Ben asks.
"Maybe, if it's not too cold. But you have to wear warm clothes," Mom says.
"OK, Mom. Thank you for lunch. We love you," Mia says.
They hug Mom and go to the kitchen. They smell soup and bread. They are hungry and happy. They eat and talk about their snowman. They hope he will stay until tomorrow.
