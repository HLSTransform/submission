Once, there was a little girl named Jane. She wanted to find something special. So one day, she decided to go to the jungle to find it. 
As Jane was walking and exploring the jungle, she suddenly saw something white. She was very excited and ran towards it. It was a white rabbit! 
Jane spoke to it and asked, "What's your name?" The white rabbit said, "My name is Bunny". Jane was so happy to meet Bunny. 
But suddenly, a big scary lion came out of the jungle and started chasing Jane and Bunny. They ran as fast as they could to get away from the lion. 
But it was too late. The lion was much faster and caught up to them. He roared loudly and ate Jane and Bunny.
The end.
