Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved trucks, especially big ones that make loud noises. One day, Timmy saw a funny looking truck driving down the street. It was so funny that he started laughing.
"Mommy, look at that funny truck!" Timmy said, pointing at the truck.
His mommy looked and saw the truck too. "That is a very funny looking truck," she said, also laughing.
Suddenly, the truck stopped right in front of them. The driver got out and asked, "Can you help me squeeze this big box into the back of my truck?"
Timmy and his mommy helped the driver squeeze the box into the truck. When they were finished, the driver thanked them and drove away. Timmy was so happy that he got to help and see a funny truck all in one day.
