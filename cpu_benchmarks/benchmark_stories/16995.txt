Lily wanted to go to the bathroom. She was very impatient. She asked her mom to lift her up and take her there.
"Not now, Lily. I'm busy. Wait a little bit," her mom said.
But Lily did not want to wait. She felt like she had to go right now. She tried to get off the couch by herself. She was too small. She fell down and hurt her knee.
"Ow! Ow! Ow!" she cried.
Her mom heard her and ran to her. She saw the blood on her knee. She felt sorry for Lily.
"I'm sorry, Lily. I should have lifted you up. Come on, let's go to the bathroom and clean your knee," her mom said.
She lifted Lily up and carried her to the bathroom. She washed her knee and put a band-aid on it. She hugged Lily and kissed her.
"Are you okay, Lily?" she asked.
Lily nodded. She felt better. She went to the bathroom and flushed the toilet. She smiled at her mom.
"Thank you, mom. I love you," she said.
"I love you too, Lily. Next time, tell me if you really have to go, okay?" her mom said.
"Okay, mom. I will," Lily said.
They walked back to the couch and cuddled. They watched a funny show on TV. They laughed together. Lily was happy.
