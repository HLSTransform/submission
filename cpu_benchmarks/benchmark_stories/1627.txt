Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. Yesterday, they went to the park with their moms. They saw a big slide. Lily wanted to go on the slide, but Tom was scared.
"Come on, Tom, let's go on the slide. It is fun!" Lily said.
"No, Lily, I don't want to. The slide is too high. I might fall," Tom said.
Lily was persistent. She tried to make Tom go on the slide. She said, "Don't be scared, Tom. I will go with you. We can hold hands. It will be easy."
Tom still said no. He shook his head. He said, "No, Lily, I don't like the slide. I like the swings. Let's go on the swings."
Lily was sad. She wanted to go on the slide with Tom. She said, "Please, Tom, just try it once. Maybe you will like it. It is not scary. It is fun."
Tom looked at the slide. He looked at Lily. He saw that she was sad. He did not want to make her sad. He said, "Okay, Lily, I will try it once. But only once. And you have to hold my hand."
Lily smiled. She said, "Thank you, Tom. You are a good friend. I will hold your hand. Don't worry."
They went on the slide together. They held hands. They slid down fast. They felt the wind in their hair. They laughed.
They reached the bottom. They looked at each other. They were happy.
"Wow, that was fun!" Tom said.
"See, I told you!" Lily said.
They hugged. They went on the slide again. And again. And again. They had a lot of fun. Their moms were proud of them. They were brave and persistent. They were good friends.
