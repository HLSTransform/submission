Once upon a time there was a boy named Sam. Sam was happy and loved to play. One day Sam's mom wanted to introduce him to a spider. He was a little scared, but his mom said the spider was harmless.
So, Sam sat and watched the spider. He was a funny looking creature with lots of legs and a scrunched-up face. But, as he watched, he felt more and more comfortable. He even started to smile and laugh.
Sam's mom said it was time to go and said goodbye to the spider. Surprisingly, the spider waved goodbye! Sam was so amazed that he was even more curious to come back.
The next day, Sam returned with his mom to say hello to the spider again. He was excited to see the spider, but he was surprised to see that it was different. Its face was bigger and there were now two spiders!
Sam was curious and asked why there were now two spiders. His mom explained that the little spider was the spiderâ€™s baby. They had multiplied!
 
Sam was amazed and thought it was the coolest thing ever. He had come to understand that the harmless spider he had first introduced to was now a family!
