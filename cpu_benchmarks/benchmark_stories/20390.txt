Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and go on adventures. One day, Lily's mom gave her a toy boat and said, "Let's go on an adventure to find an island!"
Lily was so excited and they set sail on the toy boat. They sailed for a long time until they found an island. But when they got there, they saw that the island was filthy with trash everywhere.
Lily said, "Mom, this island is so dirty. We should clean it up!" So they started to pick up the trash and put it in a big bag. But suddenly, a big storm came and destroyed their boat.
Lily and her mom were stuck on the filthy island with no way to leave. They were very sad and wished they had never come to the island. The end.
