The boy was so happy. He was playing in his room and he wanted to show everyone how happy he was. So he started to clap. He clapped his hands together like this and then the door opened.
Out came a little animal. It was a wild rabbit! The rabbit was so wild, it started to jump around the room. The boy was so excited he started clapping even more.
The rabbit was so happy to see the boy it jumped even higher. Then it hopped over to the door and through it. The boy stopped clapping as the rabbit disappeared. He wished it would come back so they could play together again.
But the rabbit did not come back. The boy was sad and he stopped clapping. He went to the door and opened it so he could look outside. But all he saw was the empty wildness of the outside world.
