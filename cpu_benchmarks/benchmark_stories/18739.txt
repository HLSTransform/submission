Once upon a time, there were two friends, Timmy and Tommy. They loved to play together in the park. One day, Timmy found a shiny rock on the ground. He showed it to Tommy and said, "Look! This rock is interesting!"
Tommy looked at the rock and said, "I want to add it to my rock collection."
But Timmy didn't want to give it away. He said, "No, it's mine. I found it first!"
Tommy was sad because he really wanted the shiny rock. But then he had an idea. He said, "Let's each take turns holding the rock in our palm. That way we can both enjoy it!"
Timmy thought that was a good idea. So they took turns holding the shiny rock in their palms and they both felt very happy. They realized that sharing was much more fun than fighting over things. From that day on, they shared everything they found in the park.
