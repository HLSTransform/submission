Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily wanted to know more about magnets. She asked her mom, “What are magnets?” Her mom told her, “Magnets are very impressive. They pull things to them.”
Lily was excited. She wanted to see a magnet for herself. She went to the store and found the most incredible magnet. It was a rainbow and it glittered in the light.
Lily was so excited and she wanted to show her friends what she knew about magnets. She took out the magnet and showed them how it would attract things. It was so impressive! Her friends were so amazed. They all learned more about magnets.
Lily was proud. She now knew a lot about magnets and had an impressive rainbow magnet to show her friends. She was so happy that she had learned something new.
