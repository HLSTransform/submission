Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a new slide. It is big and shiny. They want to try it.
"Let's go to the new slide!" Sara says.
"OK!" Ben says.
They run to the new slide. They gather at the top. They wait for their turn.
"Me first!" Sara says.
"No, me first!" Ben says.
They push and pull. They do not share. They are not nice.
Sara pushes Ben hard. Ben falls off the slide. He hits his head on the ground. He cries.
Sara slides down. She does not care. She is mean.
Ben's mom comes. She sees Ben's head. It is red and wet. She is scared.
"Ben, what happened?" she asks.
"Sara pushed me!" Ben says.
She picks up Ben. She takes him to the doctor. He needs a bandage.
Sara's mom comes. She sees Sara on the slide. She is angry.
"Sara, what did you do?" she asks.
"I pushed Ben!" Sara says.
She does not say sorry. She does not feel bad.
She gets off the slide. She goes home with her mom. She is in trouble.
The end.
