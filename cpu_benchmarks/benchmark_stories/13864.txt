Once upon a time, there was a little bird who loved to sing. Every day, the bird would fly around and sing happy songs. The bird had a friend, a dull gray mouse, who liked to listen to the bird's songs.
One day, while the bird was singing, the mouse found a shape on the ground. It was a big, round shape. The mouse was very excited and showed the shape to the bird. The bird stopped singing and looked at the shape, too.
Together, the bird and the mouse played with the shape. They rolled it around and had lots of fun. Then, the bird started to sing a new song about the shape. The mouse danced to the song, and they both had a great day.
