Tom and Lily were friends. They liked to play and laugh. One day, they found a big box in the park. They opened the box and saw a lot of food. There were apples, bananas, cookies, and juice. Tom and Lily were hungry, so they decided to eat some of the food.
But the food was not good. It was old and rotten. It smelled bad and tasted worse. The food was a joke. Someone had put it in the box to trick people. Tom and Lily did not know that. They ate the food and felt sick. They had stomach aches and headaches. They wanted to cry.
They tried to find help, but no one was around. The park was empty and quiet. It was getting dark and cold. Tom and Lily were scared and alone. They wished they had not eaten the food. They wished they had gone home. They wished they had a cool mom or dad to feed them and hug them. But they had no one. They had only each other. And they had a bad joke.
