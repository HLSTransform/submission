Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the hot sun. But today, the weather was not so hot. It was cloudy and rainy. Lily was sad because she could not play outside.
Lily's mom had an idea to make her happy. They went to the store to buy decorations. They bought balloons, streamers, and a big banner that said "Happy Birthday". Lily was confused because it was not her birthday. But her mom said they were going to decorate the house to make it look like a party.
Lily helped her mom decorate the house. She put up the balloons and streamers. She was so happy that she forgot about the rainy weather. When they finished decorating, they had a party inside the house. They danced and sang and had so much fun. Lily was no longer sad because she had a fun party inside her house!
