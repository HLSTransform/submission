Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a favorite spoon that he always used to eat his cereal. One day, Timmy's spoon broke and he was very sad. 
Timmy's mommy saw how sad he was and gave him a big hug. She promised to buy him a new spoon the next day. When they went to the store, Timmy picked out a shiny new spoon that made him very happy. 
But, Timmy's mommy also noticed that he had a little cut on his finger. She put a band-aid on it to help it heal. Timmy felt much better with his new spoon and his healed finger. He smiled and ate his cereal with joy. The end.
