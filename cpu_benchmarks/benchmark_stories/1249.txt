Once there was a little girl called Jane. Jane was always very hungry. One day, she decided to go to the temple. She got on the bus and rode to the temple.
When she arrived at the temple, it was big and very grand. Jane was excited. She got off the bus and ran over to the temple's entrance.
At the entrance, she saw a woman with a basket of food. Jane was so happy she almost cried. She got some food from the basket and ate it. It tasted so delicious and soon, she was full.
Then, Jane got up and explored the temple. Everywhere she went, she saw something new and interesting. It was a wonderful adventure. When she was done, she got back on the bus and went home feeling happy and no longer hungry.
