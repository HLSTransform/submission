Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch movies with his family. One day, they watched a movie about a little mouse who went on an adventure. Timmy counted how many times the mouse squeaked. He counted ten times! 
After the movie, Timmy's mom made some spicy popcorn for them to eat. Timmy tried some, but it was too spicy for him. He drank some water to cool his mouth down. 
Timmy had a fun day watching the movie and counting the mouse's squeaks. He couldn't wait to watch another movie with his family. The end.
