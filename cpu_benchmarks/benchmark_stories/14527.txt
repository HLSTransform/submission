Once upon a time there was a pilot. He wore a big green hat and flew in a plane. He kept flying in the sky, up and down.
When he needed a rest, he flew back to his home. The pilot had lots of smells there: delicious bacon and smelly socks too.
He kept on flying in the sky. He kept flying around the world all day and night.
One day he flew back and his home smelled even smellerer than before. The pilot sniffed and sniffed, trying to discover where the smelly smell was coming from. 
He kept looking and looking until he found it. His smelly socks were making all the smell! He picked them up, put them in the wash, and the smelly smell was gone. 
The pilot was so happy he started to dance. He kept dancing and spinning around the room. He was so happy to have his home smelling nice again!
