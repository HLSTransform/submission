Once upon a time, there was a big wreck in a field. It was a pile of metal that had been mixed together. Two friends, Andy and Ella, decided it would be fun to try and solve the puzzle of the wreck.
Andy said, "Let's see if we can figure out how to solve the wreck!"
"Okay!" Ella said with a smile.
The two of them got to work, sorting through the pieces and connecting them together. It was difficult, but eventually they figured out how to fit the pieces together.
When they were finished, Ella and Andy looked at the wreck in awe. It looked much better than it did when it was all in pieces! It was very impressive!
Andy and Ella hugged each other and said, "We did it! We solved the wreck!"
