Once upon a time there was a little fish called Finny. He liked to dive in the sea every day and explore. One day, Finny had a special surprise waiting for him. As he dived deep into the sea, he saw something sparkling. It was a word! Finny swam closer and realised it was a bad word. He had never seen it before and wondered what it meant. So he decided to take the word with him and show it to his friends. As he swam back to the surface, he rose up out of the sea holding the word in his fin. He showed his friends and they were all amazed. Finny was so proud of his find. He had discovered a bad word!
