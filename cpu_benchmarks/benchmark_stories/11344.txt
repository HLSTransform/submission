Once upon a time, there was a daddy and a mummy who were in love. Each day, they would hug and kiss to show how much they cared for each other.
One day, the daddy said to the mummy: "You and I are special. We must always stay together and never separate."
The mummy replied, "Yes, we must stay together. We should rub each other's backs every day. That will help our love to stay regular."
So, the mummy and the daddy rubbed each other's backs every day for the rest of their lives. They stayed together, never separating, and their love was always regular and strong.
