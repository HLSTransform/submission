Billy and his grandad were walking through the woods. The trees were tall and the ground was soft. 
Billy stopped and said, "Look Grandad, here's a strip of something." 
Grandad bent down and looked. He took it in his hands and said, "It looks like a very special strip, just like the one I've been searching for. I think it will help me."
Billy asked, "What will it do?"
Grandad replied, "It will help make things better, but it could be very hurtful if I'm not careful."
The two of them walked further into the woods, but they got lost. Grandad tried to use the strip to get them out, but it didn't work. The day got dark and they were still lost. Grandad got hurt and they had to stay in the woods overnight. 
In the morning, they were found and taken to safety. But Grandad never got better and stayed hurt for a long time.
