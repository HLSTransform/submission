Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a blue bicycle that he loved to ride. One day, he planned to ride his bicycle to the park. He was very excited.
On his way to the park, he saw a big dog. The dog barked loudly and scared Tim. Tim did not know what to do. He wanted to go to the park, but the dog was in the way.
Tim had an idea. He went back home and got a ball. He threw the ball far away, and the dog ran to get it. Tim quickly rode his blue bicycle to the park. He had so much fun playing there.
