Once upon a time, in a warm summer, a little boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, went to the park. They were so happy to play outside. Tim was a bit fearful, but Spot was always with him.
At the park, they met a big, fluffy cat. The cat said, "Meow, meow! I am lost. Can you help me find my home?" Tim was scared, but he wanted to help the cat. So, Tim and Spot walked with the cat.
As they walked, Tim saw a soft, pretty flower. He touched it and smiled. The cat saw her house and said, "Thank you, Tim and Spot!" They all became good friends and played together every summer day.
