Once there was a boy named Tom. Tom was three years old and he was full of energy. He had a great big tree in his garden that he loved to climb. One day, he wanted to climb up high and see what was up there.
Tom called out to his mom, "Mom, can I cut the switch?" His mom smiled and nodded, "Yes Tom, you can cut the switch - but be careful!"
So Tom took the switch in his hands and carefully cut it with a pair of scissors. He found himself at the top of the tree in no time! The view was mild and he could see the whole garden.
Tom's mom called him back down, "Tom, come down now - it's too high." Tom went back down, but he couldn't help but smile at what he had discovered. He knew he would come back soon!
