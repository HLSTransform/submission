Once upon a time, a big whale swam in the ocean. She was very fancy because she had a shiny tail and sparkly eyes. One day, the whale saw a little fish who was lost and scared. The whale wanted to help the fish, so she remained by the fish's side until they found their way home. The fish was very happy and thanked the fancy whale for being so kind. From that day on, the fish and the whale were the best of friends and remained together forever.
