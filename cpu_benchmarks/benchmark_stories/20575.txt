Once upon a time, there was a girl named Jane. She wanted to go outside to play, but the door was locked. She looked at the door and saw a key. She wanted to go play, so she pulled the key and put it in the door.
The door opened and she felt happy. She stepped outside and saw a big, calm lake. She walked slowly and slowly to the lake. She felt the cool breeze on her face and saw the birds flying calmly in the sky. She was so happy she wanted to dance and sing. 
But then she saw something in the water: it was a key! She knew it was the same one she used to open the door. She was so excited, she jumped up and down and ran to the lake to pull the key out. Then she ran home, with the key in her hands, and opened the door to go back inside. 
The end.
