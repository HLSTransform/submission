One day, a boy named Tim found a toy pistol in his room. He thought it was a cool toy. Tim wanted to play with his sister, Sue. He went to her room and said, "Sue, let's play with my toy pistol!"
Sue looked at the toy and said, "No, Tim. That toy is terrible. We should not play with it." But Tim insisted, "Please, Sue. It will be fun!"
Sue agreed to play with Tim. They played pretend and had a good time. Then, their mom came in and saw the toy pistol. She took it away and said, "Kids, this toy is not good. Let's find a better toy to play with."
Tim and Sue learned that some toys are not good to play with. They played with other toys and had fun together.
