Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there lived a baby deer named Dotty. Dotty was very unusual because she had colorful spots all over her body. She loved to play with her forest friends, but she needed to learn how to walk better.
One sunny day, Dotty met a wise old turtle named Mr. T. Mr. T said, "Dotty, I can teach you how to walk better. Just follow me and do what I do." Dotty was very happy and excited to learn from Mr. T.
They started to walk slowly, step by step. Dotty watched Mr. T's feet and tried to copy him. It was hard at first, but she kept trying. Soon, Dotty learned how to walk better and faster. She thanked Mr. T and said, "Now I can play with my friends without falling down!"
Dotty and Mr. T became best friends, and they spent many happy days together in the big green forest. And every time they walked together, Dotty's unusual colorful spots would shine brighter, making the forest even more beautiful.
