Once upon a time, there lived an elderly pony. He lived in a meadow all by himself, as he had no other animal friends. All the other ponies were too busy frolicking to bother talking to him.
One day, an idea struck the elderly pony. He decided to trot all over the meadow to try and find a friend. At first, he wasn't very lucky. Everyone was too busy to even spare a glance his way.
But eventually, he came upon another pony - a much younger one. The young pony was also looking for a friend. The two ponies united and quickly became good friends.
Together, they explored the meadow, ate clover and laughed until their bellies bobbed. They were the best of friends, and their friendship never wavered.
