Once upon a time, there was a big stadium. It was really messy and stretched for miles. 
John was three years old and he wanted to explore everywhere. He wanted to see every messy corner of the stadium.
John began to stretch his legs and run around the huge, long stadium. He ran and ran until finally he was too tired to run anymore. He saw a bench and decided to have a rest there.
John was so tired that he fell fast asleep on the bench. When he woke up, he felt even more rested and ready to explore again. He stretched his arms and smiled as he saw the huge stadium stretched out before him.
