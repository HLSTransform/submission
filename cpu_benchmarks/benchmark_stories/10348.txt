Lily liked to play dress-up with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Anna. Anna had a long blue dress and a shiny crown. Lily wanted to be like Anna and have a fancy dress and a crown too.
One day, Lily found a big box in her room. It had a note from her mom. The note said: "For my princess Lily. Have fun!" Lily opened the box and saw a beautiful dress and a crown inside. She was so happy! She put on the dress and the crown and looked in the mirror. She felt like a real princess.
She decided to show her mom her new outfit. She ran to the living room, where her mom was sitting on the couch with a fan. It was a hot day and the fan made the air cooler. Lily said: "Mom, look at me! I'm a princess!"
Her mom smiled and said: "You look wonderful, Lily! You are a very pretty princess!"
Lily hugged her mom and said: "Thank you, mom! You are the best!"
Then, something strange happened. A fairy appeared in front of them. She had wings and a wand and a sparkly dress. She said: "Hello, Lily and mom! I'm here to grant you a wish. You can wish for anything you want!"
Lily and her mom were surprised and amazed. They looked at each other and wondered what to wish for. Lily thought of her dolls, her dress, her crown, and her mom. She realized she had everything she needed. She said: "I don't need a wish, fairy. I'm happy with what I have. But thank you for coming!"
The fairy smiled and said: "You are very wise, Lily. You have a lot of love in your heart. I'm glad you are happy. I'll leave you a gift anyway. It's a magic fan. It can make you fly if you hold it and say the magic word. The magic word is 'fly'."
She gave Lily the fan and said: "Have fun, princess! And remember to be kind and grateful always!" Then, she disappeared.
Lily and her mom were amazed by the fairy and the fan. They thanked her and tried the fan. They held it and said "fly". They felt a breeze lift them up and they flew around the room. They laughed and had fun. They felt like they were in a fairy tale.
