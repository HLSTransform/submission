One day, a little girl named Amy was very excited. She had a small mint plant in a pot. She wanted to keep it safe and help it grow big.
Amy asked her mom, "How do I keep my mint safe?" Her mom said, "Put it near the window and give it water. Soon you will see something fun!" Amy did what her mom said. She put the mint near the window and gave it water every day.
After a few days, Amy saw the mint grow bigger and bigger. She was so happy! She remembered what her mom said about something fun. One morning, she saw a little butterfly sitting on her mint plant. The butterfly was the fun surprise! Amy kept her mint safe and got a new friend too.
