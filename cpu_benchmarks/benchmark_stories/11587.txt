Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a toy named Mr. Cable. Mr. Cable was a harmless toy made of soft, bendy cables. Tim loved Mr. Cable and played with him every day.
One sunny day, Tim took Mr. Cable to the park. While playing, Tim met a girl named Sue. Sue had a toy named Miss String. Miss String was also a harmless toy, made of soft, colorful strings. Tim and Sue decided to unite their toys and play together.
"Let's make a big fun game!" said Tim. "Yes, let's unite Mr. Cable and Miss String and see what we can make!" replied Sue. They twisted and turned Mr. Cable and Miss String together, making a big, soft ball. Tim and Sue played with their new toy all day, laughing and having fun. They became the best of friends, and Mr. Cable and Miss String stayed united forever.
