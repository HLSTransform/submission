Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to perform for her family and friends. One day, Lily's tooth started to hurt. She didn't want to tell her parents because she was scared of going to the dentist.
One day, Lily's friend asked her how she was feeling. Lily said, "My tooth hurts, but I don't want to go to the dentist." Her friend said, "It's important to take care of your teeth, so they stay perfect. You should tell your parents."
Lily listened to her friend and told her parents. They took her to the dentist, and the dentist fixed her tooth. Lily was happy and thanked her friend for the advice.
The moral of the story is that it's important to take care of your teeth, even if it's scary.
