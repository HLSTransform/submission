Once upon a time there was a fat cat. His name was Jasper and he liked to explore. Every day he would go walking through the village. One day he saw a newspaper lying on the floor. He decided to pick it up and lead it back to his house.
When Jasper got home he was very excited. He wanted to read the newspaper. He couldn't read the words, but he did like to look at the pictures. He pretended to read the stories out loud every day.
Jasper had so much fun with the newspaper that he decided to go find more. He went out and looked everyday until one day he found a big box of them. He was so excited that he dragged it back to his house and made a big pile of the newspapers.
From then on, Jasper always had something fun and new to explore. Every day would bring a new adventure. He was the happiest fat cat around!
