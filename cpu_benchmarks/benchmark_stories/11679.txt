Once upon a time there was a very rich family that had a little girl. The girl's parents both worked hard and they had a nice TV in the living room.
The girl loved the TV and asked her parents if she could watch it every day. Her parents said she could, but only if she promised to trust them.
Every day the girl would come home and trust her parents. When it was time to go to bed, the girl would often try to stay up to watch her favorite show on TV. Even though her parents told her no, she still tried to watch it anyway.
One night the girl's parents caught her trying to watch TV when she wasn't supposed to. They told her that if she couldn't trust them, she wouldn't be able to watch TV anymore. The little girl was sad, but she knew her parents were right and she promised to trust them from then on.
She kept her promise and soon she was able to watch TV again. From that day on, the little girl always trusted her parents and everything was right in the world.
