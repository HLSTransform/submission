Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very handy with her tools. She had a little hammer, a small saw and a shiny hook. One day, the little girl wanted to polish the hook to make it even shinier. She got out her polishing cloth and a tin of polish.
But when she started polishing the hook, her little brother came into the room. He was very angry with her for using his polishing cloth and he snatched it away.
The little girl said to him, "Please don't be angry. I just want to make my hook look nice and shiny. I promise, I'll give it back to you when I'm finished."
But her brother was still angry. He replied, "No! I need my cloth for polishing my own things. Give it back to me now!"
The little girl got a bit sad, but she handed back the polishing cloth to her brother. Her brother softened a bit when he saw her sad face and said, "Ok, you can use it, but be sure to give it back to me when you're finished!"
So the little girl finished polishing her hook, and she handed the polishing cloth back to her brother. After that, her brother went off to polish his own things, and the little girl had a wonderfully shiny hook to show off!
