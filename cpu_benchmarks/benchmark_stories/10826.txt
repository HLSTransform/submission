Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She wanted to learn how to ride her bike without training wheels. Her dad said he would teach her.
Dad said, "We need to get you a new helmet. Let's go to the store and pick out a package with a helmet and knee pads."
Lily was excited to get her new helmet, and she picked out a package that had a pretty pink helmet with flowers on it. Dad helped her put it on and they went outside to practice.
Lily tried and tried, but she kept falling off. Dad encouraged her and said, "Don't worry, we'll keep practicing until you're successful."
But then, Lily fell off her bike and hurt her arm. She cried and said she didn't want to ride her bike anymore. Dad hugged her and said, "It's okay, we can try again another day."
