Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play his guitar all day long. He would pluck the strings and sing happy songs. One day, Timmy's guitar string broke and he couldn't play anymore. He felt sad and started to frown.
Timmy went to his mom and said, "My guitar is broken. Can you fix it?" But his mom said, "I'm sorry, Timmy. I don't know how to fix a guitar." Timmy felt even sadder and started to cry.
Just then, Timmy's neighbor, Mr. Jones, heard him crying. Mr. Jones was a kind man who played guitar too. He said, "Don't worry, Timmy. I can fix your guitar. It's a flexible instrument." Timmy was happy again and said, "Thank you, Mr. Jones!"
The moral of the story is that when we are sad, we can always ask for help. There are people who care about us and want to make us happy.
