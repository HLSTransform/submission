Once upon a time there was a girl named Anna. She loved to explore and she often found fun things to do.
One day, Anna was playing in her house when her mummy said to her, "Let's go upstairs, Anna! There is something interesting to see!"
Anna was so excited as she followed her mummy up the stairs. When she reached the top, Anna saw a surprise in the room. It was a magical garden!
Anna was amazed. She ran around the garden, seeing all the interesting plants and smelling the flowers. Then she started to climb in the trees and pick the apples in the branches.
Mummy watched Anna play and smiled. She said, "I love watching you having such fun, Anna!"
Anna smiled back, happy to have mummy there with her. They stayed in the garden until it was time to go home. Anna knew that she would come back to her magical garden soon.
