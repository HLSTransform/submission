Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to play with his toy cars. One day, Timmy's favorite red car got stuck under the bed. He tried to get it out, but it was too far away. Timmy's mom came to help him and used a long cord to reach the car. They were successful in getting the car out from under the bed.
Later that day, Timmy and his mom went to the park to play. Timmy was having fun until he saw a big dog that scared him. His mom saw that he was upset and asked him what was wrong. Timmy told her that he was scared of the dog. His mom told him that she would always be there to care for him and keep him safe. Timmy felt better knowing that his mom was there to protect him.
