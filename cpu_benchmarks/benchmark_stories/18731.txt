Once upon a time, there was a mommy who loved to cook in the kitchen. She had a little boy who always watched her cook. One day, the mommy was sad because she couldn't find her favorite spoon. The little boy wanted to help his mommy, so he looked for the spoon too. 
He searched in the drawers and cabinets, but he couldn't find it. Then, he had an idea. He remembered the numbers on the spoons. He looked for the spoon with the same number as his mommy's favorite spoon. Finally, he found it! 
His mommy was so happy and gave him a big hug. From that day on, the little boy helped his mommy in the kitchen every day. They cooked together and had so much fun. And they never lost a spoon again because they always remembered the numbers. The end.
