Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had very long hair. His mom said, "Tim, you need a haircut."
They went to the haircut place. The haircut man made Tim's hair smooth. Tim's mom was happy. Tim's hair was short now.
As days went by, Tim's hair started to increase. It got long again. Tim's mom said, "Time for another haircut!" And they went back to the haircut place.
