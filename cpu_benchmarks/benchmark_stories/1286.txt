Once upon a time, there was a thin little village. The village was poor, and the people who lived there struggled every day.
The children of the village were often hungry and lonely, but they were strong and brave. One day, a kind lady arrived in the village and she had a sack full of food.
Everyone was very happy! All the people in the village smiled, and thanked the lady.
The kind lady stayed in the village for a few weeks and helped the people. When she left, the people in the village were very sad to see her go, but they had all the food they needed.
The people of the village worked hard together, and soon the village was a much happier place. They no longer had to struggle so much, and everyone was full of hope!
