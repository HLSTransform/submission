One day, Mommy and Jack went to the mall. It was empty when they got there. Jack was really excited to go shopping. He wanted to buy some candy.
But before Jack could go inside, Mommy grabbed his arm and said, "Don't touch anything!‚Äù Jack nodded and said, "Ok, Mommy".
They went inside and Jack saw lots of shiny things. He wanted to touch everything. But then he felt Mommy pinch his arm. He knew this meant he couldn't touch anything.
Jack was sad but he didn't want to get in trouble. He followed Mommy and only looked at the things he wanted to buy. Finally, Mommy said it was time to go home.
Jack was happy. He hugged Mommy and said, "Thank you for taking me to the mall!" Mommy hugged him back and said, "You're welcome!"
