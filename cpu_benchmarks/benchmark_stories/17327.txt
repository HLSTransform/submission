Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to run and play outside in the sunshine. One day, she saw a lively butterfly fluttering around in her backyard. The butterfly had bright colors and it was so pretty!
Lily wanted to learn more about butterflies, so she asked her mommy if they could study them together. They got some books from the library and looked at pictures of all kinds of butterflies. They learned about what they eat and how they grow.
After they finished studying, Lily and her mommy went outside to try and catch the butterfly. It was tricky, but they finally caught it and got to see it up close. Lily was so happy to learn about butterflies and even happier to see one in real life.
