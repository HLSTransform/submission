Once upon a time, there was a boy called David. He was only three years old and very careful with his toys. His mum had brought him a shiny new belt from the shops but he was too scared to wear it. So he decided to hide it. 
David's brother, Tommy, was the opposite - he was quite ignorant about his toys and didn't care where they went. When he found out about David's new belt, he was determined to take it for himself.
Tommy tried to find the belt, but David was too fast for him. He stayed one step ahead and managed to keep it hidden from his brother.
Eventually, Tommy got fed up and gave up trying to find it. But David was still careful - he still kept the belt hidden, just in case.
The end.
