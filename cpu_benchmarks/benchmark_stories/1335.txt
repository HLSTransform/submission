Once upon a time, there was a little boy. His name was Frank. He was only 3 years old and he loved to explore. One day, Frank was walking through the park. He saw something funny. It was a triangle. It was shiny and fragile. Frank wanted to touch it.
Frank stumbled across the park towards the triangle. He reached out his hand to touch it, but it was too slippery. He put his other hand on it and suddenly it moved. Frank started to laugh as the triangle began to roll away.
It rolled and rolled until it crashed into something else. Frank looked closer and saw it had crashed into a pile of glass. The glass was very fragile. Rhyme had broken it. Frank was very sad. He had made a mistake.
Frank used his little hands to carefully pick up all the pieces of the glass. He was careful not to put too much pressure on the glass, as it was very fragile. When he had finished, the park was all clean.
Frank looked down at the triangle. He realized that he had been very lucky. He vowed to never stumble across the park again, but always to take small steps.
