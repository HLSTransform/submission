Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play outside in the fields. One day, he saw a big pile of hay. Benny thought it looked like a fun place to bounce around. So, he hopped up onto the hay and started to bounce.
As Benny was bouncing, he heard a little noise. He looked down and saw a harmless little mouse. The mouse looked up at Benny and said, "Hello there, bunny!" Benny was surprised to see the mouse, but he was happy to have a new friend to play with.
Benny and the mouse played together on the hay for a while. They bounced and laughed and had so much fun. When it was time for Benny to go home, he said goodbye to his new friend and hopped away. From that day on, Benny knew that the hay pile was a great place to have fun and make new friends.
