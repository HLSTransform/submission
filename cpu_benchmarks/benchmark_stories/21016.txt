Once upon a time, there were two brothers named Ben and Bob. Ben was older, and he always protected his younger brother Bob.
Today, the two boys were playing a game. Ben let Bob set up the game, which he did quickly and easily.
Bob said, “Let’s start playing! I’m gonna get a higher score than you!” Ben smiled and said, “I’ll try, but I’m only playing to protect you. OK?”
The boys had a lot of fun playing their game. They laughed and cheered when one of them got a high score. But, in the end, Bob still had the highest score.
Ben said, “You’re a great player, Bob! I knew you’d make a great score.” Bob smiled and said, “Thanks! But, even if I make a good score, you’re always protecting me.”
The brothers hugged and learned a valuable lesson about protection. It’s important to look out for one another, even if we want to win a game. Protecting each other is what really matters most.
