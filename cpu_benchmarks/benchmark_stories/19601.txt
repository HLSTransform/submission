John was a little boy who liked to jog. One morning, he went for his daily jog. He notice a man walking by, who had a sad face. He stopped to say hello and asked if the man was ok.
The man was very quiet and didn't answer to John. He kept walking. John thought this was strange, so he kept jogging and kept an eye on the man.
John jogged to the park and saw the man once more. He was sitting on a park bench, looking very sad. John went up to him and asked why he was so sad. The man said he had lost his job and didn't have money to buy food.
John felt so sad for the man, he wanted to help and do something. He went back home and came back with a bag of groceries. He gave them to the man and welcomed him to sit and eat with him in the park.
John noticed a big smile appear on the man's face and was glad he was able to make him happy. From then on, John and the man became friends and would go jogging together whenever John was in the park.
