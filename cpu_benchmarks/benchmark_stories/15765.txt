Once upon a time there was a big, grey cat named Bob. He wanted to go out and have some fun.
Bob found a nice, clean sweater and he said, "This sweater looks cozy! I'm gonna get it." So Bob got the sweater.
On his way home, Bob went through a pile of leaves and dirt. He got so dirty that the sweater was filthy too! 
Bob saw a bird and the bird said, "Why do you have a filthy sweater?"
Bob said, "I got it because it was clean and cozy. I guess I got too messy on my way back." 
The bird said, "Now you need a bath! You better get going."
And so Bob finished his adventure and went straight home for a bath. The end.
