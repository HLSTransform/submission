Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and run around with his friends. One day, while he was playing tag, he fell down and hurt his leg. His mommy took him to the doctor, who said he had torn a muscle in his leg. 
Timmy was sad because he couldn't run around and play with his friends anymore. But his mommy told him not to worry, because the doctor said it would heal soon. 
One day, while Timmy was sitting on the porch, an ordinary bird flew by. Timmy said, "Hi birdie! You're just an ordinary bird, but I like you." The bird chirped back at Timmy and flew away. 
Timmy's mommy asked him, "Did you see that bird fly by?" Timmy replied, "Yes, it was just an ordinary bird, but I liked it." His mommy smiled and said, "Sometimes the ordinary things in life can be the most special."
