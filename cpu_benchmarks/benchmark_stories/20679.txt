Once upon a time, there was a fancy rocket. It was big and shiny and had bright colors.
One day, the rocket found a friend - a boy named Ben. Ben smiled when he saw the rocket, and he wanted to play with it. So he and the rocket decided to attach themselves together.
Ben grabbed some rope and tied the two together. Then he climbed onto the rocket and held on tight. Together, they flew up, up, and away into the sky!
Ben and the rocket circled around the moon and looked down on all the stars. They sang and laughed and the rocket's colors shone brighter and brighter.
Finally, they were ready to come home. Ben untied the rope and the rocket went back to its home in the sky. But they had made a special connection. Ben and the fancy rocket were now friends forever.
