Once upon a time, there was a kind old man who walked with a cane. He lived in a small house with a garden full of flowers. One day, a little girl came to visit him. She looked around and saw the pretty flowers. "I like the red one," she said and pointed at it. The old man smiled and gave her a candy. The little girl was grateful and hugged him. They sat together, ate candy and talked about the flowers. From that day on, the old man was happy to have a new friend.
