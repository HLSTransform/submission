Once there was a cheerful pilot. He always liked to fly in his plane. He had so much fun looking at the world from up high.
One day, the pilot had an amazing idea. He decided to take a 3 year old child for a ride in his plane. The pilot smiled and asked the child if she wanted to come along.
The child was so excited! She immediately said yes, and the pilot allowed her to come.
The child had so much fun on the plane ride. She looked out of the window and waved at all the people below. She laughed the whole time and was so happy.
When the plane landed, the pilot and the child hugged. The pilot thanked the child for coming along and said it was a pleasure to take her for a ride. The child smiled and said she would never forget it. She thanked the pilot and they both went home.
