Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the snow. One day, he saw a big white house made of ice. It was an igloo! Timmy wanted to go inside and peek at what was inside.
As he peeked inside, he saw a little penguin named Pete. Pete was very intelligent and could speak like a person. Timmy was amazed! They started talking and became fast friends.
But soon, a big polar bear came and wanted to eat Pete. Timmy had to think fast to save his friend. He remembered that polar bears don't like spicy things, so he threw a jar of pepper at the bear. The bear sneezed and ran away.
Timmy and Pete were safe and happy. They continued to play and have fun in the snow together.
