Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie was very happy and liked to sing. One day, the birdie saw an ugly cat. The cat wanted to catch the birdie and eat it. The birdie was scared and didn't know what to do. 
The birdie decided to stay in its nest and not fly away. The cat came closer and closer, but the birdie didn't move. Suddenly, the cat caught the birdie and ate it. The birdie didn't smile anymore and its friends were very sad. The end.
