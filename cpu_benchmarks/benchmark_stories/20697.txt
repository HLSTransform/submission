Once upon a time there was a nurse who was very compassionate. She always cared for the children and would give them nice hugs and kisses. One day, one of the children was feeling very angry. He wanted to get attention, so he slapped the nurse. 
The nurse was very surprised! She was sad because she knew that the child must be really unhappy. She remained calm and said, "It's ok, we all get angry sometimes." Then she gave him a big hug and smiled. 
The child was surprised too, because he thought the nurse would be mad. But he was so happy to find out she wasn't mad. He felt much better, and he said sorry.
The compassionate nurse always understood the children. She helped the children feel better by being gentle and kind. 
The end.
