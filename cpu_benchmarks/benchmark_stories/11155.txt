Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily was playing with her cup. She was holding it tight, but suddenly she dropped it on the floor. The cup broke into many pieces.
"Oh no!" cried Lily. "My cup is broken. It was my favorite cup. It was so wide and I loved to drink milk from it."
Lily's mom heard her crying and came to see what happened. "Don't worry, Lily," said her mom. "I will buy you a new cup tomorrow. We can go to the store and find one that is even wider than the last one."
Lily smiled and felt better. She knew that her mom would always be there to help her, even when she dropped her cup.
