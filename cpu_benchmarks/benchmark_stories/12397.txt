Two little girls, Bianca and Beth, were playing together in the park. Bianca said to Beth, "Let's dance!" The girls started dancing around the big, green mill in the middle of the park. As they were spinning, Bianca noticed an unknown box near the mill. She asked her friend, "What's that unknown box?" Beth answered, "I don't know. Let's go find out!"
So the two girls walked over to the box and opened it. Inside was a big grey rat, looking right up at them. The girls both screamed and ran away in fear. Bianca laughed, but Beth felt uneasy. "That was a bad ending," she said. They didn't know that the rat had had babies, which quickly spread all around the park.
