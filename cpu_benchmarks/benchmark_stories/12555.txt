Tom and Lily are playing in the park. They like to ride their bikes on the grass and the dirt. They have fun going fast and making turns.
But then, Tom's bike makes a loud noise. He stops and looks at his tire. It has a big hole in it. He is sad and angry. He says, "My tire is broken! I can't ride my bike anymore!"
Lily comes to see what is wrong. She sees the hole in Tom's tire. She says, "I'm sorry, Tom. That is not good. Maybe we can fix it."
She looks around and sees a piece of tape on a bench. She runs to get it. She says, "This tape can help. We can put it on your tire and make it better."
She tries to tear the tape with her teeth, but it is too hard. She says, "This tape is too strong. I can't tear it. We need scissors."
Tom says, "I have scissors in my backpack. They are important. I use them for school and for crafts. I will get them for you."
He goes to his backpack and opens it. He finds his scissors and brings them to Lily. He says, "Here are my scissors. Be careful with them. They are sharp."
Lily says, "Thank you, Tom. You are a good friend. I will be careful with your scissors. I will use them to tear the tape and fix your tire."
She takes the scissors and cuts a piece of tape. She puts it on Tom's tire and presses it hard. She says, "There. I think it is fixed. Try to ride your bike and see if it works."
Tom gets on his bike and rides it slowly. He says, "It works! It works! The tape fixed my tire. You are a smart and kind friend, Lily. Thank you for helping me."
Lily smiles and says, "You're welcome, Tom. I'm glad your bike works. Let's ride together and have more fun."
They ride their bikes on the grass and the dirt. They have fun going fast and making turns. They are happy and proud. They are good friends.
