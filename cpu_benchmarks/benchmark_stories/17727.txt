Once there was a little girl who wanted to go to a party. She asked her mom for an invitation. When the invitation came, it was very colorful. It had all sorts of happy designs on it, like stars and stripes and swirls. The little girl was so excited! She cheered and jumped around. She was ready to go to the party.
The little girl and her mom went to the party. It was in a big park and there were lots of people and all sorts of fun things to do. There were bounce houses and a water slide and games and food. Everything was so colorful!
The little girl had a great time at the party. She wanted to stay all day and play with her friends. But all too soon it was time to go. The little girl was sad but she had lots of great memories from the party, and a ton of colorful pictures to look back on.
