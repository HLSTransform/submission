Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One cold winter day, Lily wanted to go outside and build a snowman. Her mom said, "It is too cold outside, Lily. You should stay inside."
Lily was sad and said, "I really want to build a snowman. Please, can I go outside?" 
Her mom said, "No, you might get too cold. I'm sorry, Lily."
Lily started to cry and said, "But I will regret it."
Her mom said, "Why don't you put on some warm clothes, and I can help you build a snowman right here in the living room. You can use your Thomas and Friends toys to provide extra help."
Lily was very grateful and she put on a hat, mittens, and a warm coat. Together, she and her mom made the most beautiful snowman.
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you for helping me, Mama. I'm glad I didn't have to go outside in the cold.
Mama hugged her and said, "Me too."
