Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to watch things and see what they did. He would observe the birds in the sky and the ants on the ground. Timmy's mom worked at a store and sometimes he would go with her. Timmy liked to watch the cash register work and the people buying things. One day, Timmy was very impatient because he wanted to go to the park. But he had to wait for his mom to finish work. So, he observed the cars driving by and the people walking on the street. Finally, his mom finished work and they went to the park together.
