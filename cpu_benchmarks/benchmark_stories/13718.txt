Once upon a time, there was a little gray mouse named Mousy. Mousy loved to play hide and seek with his friends in the garden. One day, Mousy was playing when he found a shiny rock. He thought it was perfect and he wanted to keep it.
Mousy went to his friend, a big brown rabbit named BunBun. "Look what I found! It's perfect!" said Mousy. "Let me see," said BunBun. "It's just a gray rock," he said. "But it's perfect!" said Mousy.
BunBun then asked Mousy if he wanted to rub noses as a sign of friendship. Mousy agreed and they rubbed noses. Mousy then went back to playing with his friends, happy with his perfect gray rock.
