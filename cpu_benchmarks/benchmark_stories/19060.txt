Once upon a time, there was a shy little mouse named Max. Max was afraid of everything and everyone. He would always hide whenever he saw someone coming. One day, Max was walking in the forest when he heard a loud horn. It scared him so much that he ran as fast as he could. 
As he was running, he saw a big truck coming towards him. Max didn't know what to do, so he closed his eyes and hoped for the best. Suddenly, the truck stopped and started to reverse. Max was so surprised that he opened his eyes and saw a friendly driver waving at him. 
Max realized that not everyone and everything was scary. He felt a little less shy and decided to say hello to the driver. The driver was happy to see Max and gave him a piece of cheese. From that day on, Max wasn't as shy and would even say hello to other animals he met in the forest.
