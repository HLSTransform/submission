Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a crazy idea to make a surprise for her mommy. She went to the kitchen to find some ingredients to make a cake. She mixed the flour, sugar, and eggs together and put it in the oven. 
While the cake was baking, she went to play with her toys. But when she came back to the kitchen, she saw that her little brother had left the door open and the cake was burned. She was so sad and started to cry. 
Her mommy heard her crying and asked her what was wrong. Lily told her about the burned cake and how she wanted to surprise her. Her mommy hugged her and said, "Don't worry, we can still make a surprise for me. Let's make some cookies together!" Lily was so happy and they made cookies together. Her mommy said, "These cookies are the best surprise ever!"
