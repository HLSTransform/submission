Once there was a bear. It was rough and bristly. The bear lived in a meadow and it liked the sunshine and the meadow flowers.
The bear had an empty basket. It wanted to fill it with something, but it didn't know what.
Then the bear saw a small stream nearby. It had an idea. The bear put the basket in the stream and it started to fill it with water.
When the basket was full, the bear tried to carry it, but it was too heavy. So the bear emptied the basket, and this time it filled it with meadow flowers.
The bear carried the basket home with the meadow flowers in it. It was happy to have something to fill its empty basket with.
