Lily and Ben were playing in the park with their ball. They had a lot of fun, but they also got very tired. They saw the sun go down in the sky and make pretty colors. That was the sunset.
"Let's go home, Lily," Ben said. "It's getting dark and cold."
"OK, Ben," Lily said. "But can we take the ball with us?"
"Sure, Lily," Ben said. "But we have to be careful. The park is empty now. There are no other kids or grown-ups here."
They picked up the ball and started to walk to the gate. They heard a loud noise behind them. It sounded like a big dog. They turned around and saw a big, black dog running towards them. It had sharp teeth and angry eyes.
Lily and Ben were scared. They dropped the ball and ran to the gate. They hoped the dog would not catch them. They yawned as they ran. They were very tired and wanted to go home.
They reached the gate and opened it. They ran out of the park and saw their mom waiting for them. She had a big smile and a warm hug.
"Mom, mom, we're here!" Lily and Ben shouted. "There was a big, scary dog in the park!"
"Oh, no, my sweeties," Mom said. "I'm sorry you had a fright. But don't worry, the dog can't hurt you now. You're safe with me."
She took their hands and walked them home. She gave them some milk and cookies and tucked them in bed. She kissed them goodnight and turned off the light.
Lily and Ben snuggled under the covers. They felt happy and safe. They closed their eyes and fell asleep. They dreamed of the sunset and the ball and the park. But not of the dog.
