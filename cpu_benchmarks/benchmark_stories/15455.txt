Once there was a little girl who loved to play in the garden. One day she was watching the bees as they flew from one flower to the next. She wanted to be like them and fly too! The girl smiled and decided to try. She hugged her bear tight, then she spread her arms out wide. Suddenly a spray came from the sky and the girl laughed in delight.
The spray was a special spray that made her float up to the clouds. The clouds were fluffy and white and looked like cotton candy. The girl was so excited she wanted to stay floating among the clouds forever.
Meanwhile down on the ground, everyone was reading the news about a very patient girl who had sprouted wings and flew away in the sky. Everyone was fascinated by the story of the girl and wondered how she managed to float in the air.
