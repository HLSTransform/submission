Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a camera that he loved very much. He would take pictures of his toys, his dog, and the trees in the park.
One day, Tim saw a big cat in his yard. He was scared, but he hoped the cat would not hurt him. He picked up his camera and said, "I want to take a picture of you, cat!"
The cat looked at Tim and said, "Do not be scared. I am a nice cat. You can take a picture of me." Tim smiled, and took a picture of the big cat. The cat looked at the picture and said, "Thank you, Tim. That is a nice picture."
Tim was not scared anymore. He and the big cat became good friends. They played together every day, and Tim took many more pictures with his camera.
