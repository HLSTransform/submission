Once upon a time there was a little girl called Emily who was hoped to watch television. She couldn't wait to turn on the big box and see all of the colors and shapes.
But one day when Emily went to turn on the television, it wouldn't work. She was frightened, but she kept trying to make the box work again.
Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw her father quickly fixing something behind the television. When he was done, the television suddenly worked again!
Emily asked her dad why it wasn't working and he said, “Sometimes, life doesn't always go our way, but with a bit of hope, it can change.”
The moral of the story is to never give up hope, even when things don't work out how we want them to. With enough faith, anything is possible.
