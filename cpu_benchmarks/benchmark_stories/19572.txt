Once there was a big hill. At the top of the hill, there was a man. The man saw something in the grass. He went over to take a look.
He saw a tip. It was hurt and he wanted to help. The man picked up the tip and put it in his pocket.
The man walked back down the hill. He looked up and saw a bird in the sky. He watched the bird for a long time.
The man took the hurt tip back to his house. He fixed the tip and it was happy again. 
The man put the tip in the sky, so the birds could see it. The tip was a shiny and beautiful reminder that everyone can be helped when they are hurt.
