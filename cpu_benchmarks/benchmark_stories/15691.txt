Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Anna. Every day, she wanted to explore the world outside her house. But something made her scared: it was loud and harsh noises outside. 
One day, Anna asked her mom: “What are those noises?” 
Her mom smiled and said, “Those sounds come from cars and trains.”
 
Anna couldn’t believe it. She raised her tiny hands over her ears and asked, “Why are the noises so harsh?” 
Her mom said, “Sometimes loud noises help people get around quickly. But don’t worry, we can find ways to make the noises softer.” 
Anna smiled and said, “I want my ears to feel happy! Can we please find a way to make the noises softer?” 
Her mom laughed and said, “Yes, of course we can! Let’s go on an adventure and find something that can make the noises softer!”
