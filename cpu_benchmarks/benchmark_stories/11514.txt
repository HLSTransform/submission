Once upon a time, there was a small cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to eat from her small dish. Every day, Kitty's mom would put food in the dish for Kitty to eat. Kitty was very happy.
One day, a big dog named Max came to Kitty's house. Max saw the small dish and wanted it for himself. Max took the dish and put it in his house. Kitty was very sad and hungry.
Kitty thought of a plan. She went to Max's house and asked him to share the small dish. Max thought about it and agreed. Kitty's mom put food in the dish for both Kitty and Max. They ate together and became good friends. From that day on, they always shared the small dish and were very happy.
