Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends and run around. But one day, Timmy felt very sleepy and his mom let him take a nap.
When Timmy woke up, his mom had some news for him. She told him that they were going to have pizza for dinner! Timmy was so happy to hear this news because pizza was his favorite food.
After dinner, Timmy was still feeling a little sleepy. His mom let him watch some cartoons before bedtime. Timmy snuggled up in his bed and fell asleep dreaming about all the fun he would have with his friends the next day.
