Lily and Max were playing in the garden. They liked to pretend they were a queen and a knight. Lily wore a crown and a dress. Max wore a helmet and a sword.
"Queen Lily, I will protect you from the dragon!" Max said.
"Thank you, Knight Max. You are very brave!" Lily said.
They heard a loud roar. They saw a big shadow. They were scared. Was it a dragon?
"Run, Queen Lily, run!" Max shouted. He waved his sword.
Lily ran behind a tree. She peeked out. She saw the shadow. It was not a dragon. It was their dog, Rex. He was barking and wagging his tail.
"Rex, you scared us!" Lily said. She came out from the tree. She hugged Rex.
"Sorry, Queen Lily, sorry, Knight Max. I wanted to play too!" Rex said. He licked their faces.
Lily and Max laughed. They were not scared anymore. They were fine.
"Rex, you can be our dragon. But you have to be nice!" Lily said.
"OK, Queen Lily. I will be a nice dragon!" Rex said.
They played together in the garden. They had fun. They were happy.
