Frank was a little boy, and he was feeling very sad. He sighed. He looked out of his window, and he saw a bright red poppy. He smiled; it was so pretty. 
He opened his window and reached down to pick it. He held it in his hand and smelled it. It smelt so nice. He put it behind his ear and went outside and ran around. 
He was feeling much better now; he felt fine. He played all day, and when it was bedtime, he looked at the poppy still behind his ear. He sighed, but this time a happy sigh. 
He put it carefully aside to look at it again in the morning. Then he went to bed and dreamed of all the fun he'd had that day.
