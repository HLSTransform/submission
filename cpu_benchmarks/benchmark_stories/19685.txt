Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three years old and loved playing with her purple razor. Every day she would use it to make art on paper and lift it above her head when she was done.
One day while she was playing, a big wind started to blow! Lucy held onto her purple razor and tried as hard as she could to not let it go, but the wind was too strong, and it lifted her razor away! Lucy was very sad, but she didn't give up hope.
The next day, Lucy decided to go out and look for her lost razor. She searched all around, but she couldn't find it. She was about to give up, when she saw something purple up high in the sky! She squinted and saw that it was her razor! Lucy was so happy and cheered with joy.
The wind had taken her razor far, but it was back in her hands now. She promised to always be careful and never let go of her precious purple razor again!
