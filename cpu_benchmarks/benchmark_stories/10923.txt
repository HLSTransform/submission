Once upon a time, there was a little bunny with a fluffy tail. The bunny loved to hop around and play with his friends. One day, he met a new friend, a little bird with colorful feathers. The bunny and the bird played together and had lots of fun.
But then, the bunny wanted to play with his favorite toy, a shiny ball. The bird also wanted to play with it, but the bunny didn't want to share. The bird felt confused and sad. 
The bunny realized he was being selfish and decided to share the ball with his new friend. They played together happily, hopping and flying around with the shiny ball. From that day on, the bunny and the bird shared their toys and had lots of fun together.
