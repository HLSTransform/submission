Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three years old. 
One day, Lucy started to create a beautiful shop. She used boxes, paper and other items from around the house to create it. 
Once the shop was ready, Lucy opened it. She filled it with mild treats like gum and lollipops.
A few days later, Lucy's friend, Ryan, came over for a visit. When he saw the shop he said, "Wow, Lucy, this shop looks awesome!"
"Thank you Ryan," said Lucy. "Let's get some treats from the shop"
So Ryan and Lucy bought some mild treats from the shop. They had such a great time! The end.
