Once upon a time there was a little girl called Rose. Rose liked to visit the big garden. One day, Rose decided she wanted to pick a special flower to take home. She looked around and soon found a beautiful rose. But when Rose tried to pick it, it wouldnâ€™t come out of the ground.
Confused, Rose asked the garden for help. Suddenly, the rose bush began to move and asked Rose to kneel down beside it. Rose was surprised and a little scared but she did as the rose bush asked.
When she knelt down, the rose sprung up out of the ground. Rose was so happy. She thanked the rose bush and promised to look after the flower. Rose took her special rose home and promised to return to the garden soon.
