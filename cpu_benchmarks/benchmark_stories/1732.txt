Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved dinosaurs. He had a long green toy dinosaur that he carried everywhere. One day, Timmy went to the park to play with his dinosaur.
At the park, Timmy met a little girl named Sarah. Sarah had a toy dinosaur too. Timmy and Sarah played together and had fun. Sarah said to Timmy, "I like your long dinosaur." Timmy replied, "Thank you, I like your dinosaur too."
They played together for a long time, until it was time to go home. Timmy and Sarah said goodbye and promised to play together again soon. Timmy was happy to have made a new friend who loved dinosaurs just like him.
