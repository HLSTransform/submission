Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy who loved to play with his toy boat. He would take it to the pond and let it float on the water. One day, Timmy's mom made him a tasty sandwich for lunch. 
Timmy was so excited to eat his sandwich that he took a big bite and accidentally scattered crumbs all over the ground. "Oops!" he said. 
Just then, a duck swam up to Timmy's boat and quacked, "Hello! Can I play with your boat?" 
Timmy smiled and said, "Sure! But be careful not to scatter it too far away." 
The duck happily played with the boat while Timmy finished his tasty sandwich. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
