Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint with her purple paint. One day, she saw a white cat outside her window. She wanted to paint the cat with her purple paint, but the cat ran away. 
Lily was sad because she couldn't paint the cat. She went outside to look for the cat. She saw the cat again, but this time it was covered in white paint! 
Lily was confused and wondered who painted the cat white. She saw her little brother with a white paint bucket. He said he wanted to paint the cat too, but he didn't have purple paint. 
Lily explained to her brother that painting animals is not nice and they should only paint on paper. They both cleaned up the cat and went inside to paint together on their paper. The end.
