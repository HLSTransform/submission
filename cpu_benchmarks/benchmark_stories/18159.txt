Once upon a time, there was a small town with a big billboard. The billboard had a picture of a happy sun. Every day, the people in the town would look at the billboard and smile.
One day, a little boy named Tim saw a small fire near the billboard. He was scared and ran to his mom. "Mommy, the billboard will burn!" Tim cried. His mom looked and saw the fire too. She called the fireman to help.
The fireman came fast and put out the fire. The billboard was safe, and the people in the town were happy again. Tim's mom said, "Thank you, fireman!" The fireman smiled and said, "You're welcome. Always be careful with fire." Tim learned to be careful, and the town stayed safe and happy.
