It was Christmas morning and John was very excited. He jumped out of bed and ran to the living room to find a big box wrapped in strange, shiny paper. He had never seen anything quite like it before.
John asked his mom, "What is it?" His mom smiled and said, "It's a present for you! Open it and see!" 
John carefully tore the wrap off the box. Inside was an even stranger thing. He could not believe his eyes! It was a weird toy that he had never seen before. 
John asked his mom again, "What is it?" 
"It's a robot!" she said. "Press the button at the top and it will move around and make noises!"
John's eyes lit up and he pressed the button. Suddenly, the robot started moving, blinking and buzzing. John laughed out loud! It was the best present ever!
