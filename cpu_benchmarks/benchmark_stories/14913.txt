The sky was gloomy as he stumbled on. He had been walking for a long time and his feet were tired. Suddenly, he saw something lying in the grass. It was a steel box! He picked it up and found a key inside. Excitedly, he opened the box. Inside was a toy car!
He smiled and said, “Oh wow! I can play with this car!”
He put the box down, and with a little stumble, he pushed the car along. He played with it for hours and even though the sky was still gloomy, he was happy.
