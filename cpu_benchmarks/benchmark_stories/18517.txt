Sara and Ben like to play with paper and scissors. They cut out shapes and animals and stick them on the wall. One day, they find a big sheet of pink paper in the drawer. Sara wants to cut out a dove, because she likes birds. Ben wants to cut out a star, because he likes the sky.
"Let's share the paper," Sara says. "You can cut out a star here, and I can cut out a dove there."
"OK," Ben says. "But be careful with the scissors. They are sharp."
Sara and Ben start to cut out their shapes. Sara cuts out a big circle for the dove's body, and two smaller circles for the eyes. She cuts out a triangle for the beak, and two long ovals for the wings. She sticks them together with glue. Ben cuts out a big star with five points. He makes it shiny with glitter.
"Look, I made a dove!" Sara says. "It is pink and pretty. It can fly in the air."
"Look, I made a star!" Ben says. "It is bright and sparkly. It can shine in the night."
Sara and Ben are happy with their shapes. They show them to their mom, who smiles and hugs them.
"Wow, you are very creative!" she says. "You made a beautiful dove and a wonderful star. I'm proud of you."
Sara and Ben stick their shapes on the wall, next to their other paper animals. They look at them and smile. They like to cut out shapes and animals. They like to play with paper and scissors.
