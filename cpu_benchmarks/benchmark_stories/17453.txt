Lily and Max were playing in the living room with their new toys. Lily had a doll that could spin and sing. Max had a car that could zoom and beep. They were having fun, but they also wanted to see what the other had.
"Can I play with your doll?" Max asked Lily.
"No, it's mine. You have your car," Lily said.
"Please, just for a little bit. I want to make her spin and sing," Max said.
"No, no, no. Go away," Lily said. She hugged her doll and turned away from Max.
Max was angry. He wanted to play with the doll too. He thought Lily was being mean and selfish. He decided to take the doll from her when she was not looking. He waited until Lily was busy spinning her doll and singing along. Then he ran to her and grabbed the doll from her hands.
"Hey, give it back!" Lily shouted. She tried to pull the doll back, but Max was stronger. He ran away with the doll, laughing.
Lily was sad and mad. She wanted her doll back. She chased after Max, but he was faster. He ran to the door and opened it. He wanted to go outside and play with the doll there.
But as he opened the door, he saw something that made him stop. It was a big dog, barking and growling. The dog did not like strangers. The dog saw Max and the doll and wanted to chase them. Max was scared. He dropped the doll and ran back inside. He slammed the door behind him.
Lily saw what happened. She ran to the door and picked up her doll. She was happy to have her doll back, but she also felt sorry for Max. She saw him hiding behind the couch, shaking and crying.
"Are you okay, Max?" Lily asked.
"No, I'm not. The dog was scary. It wanted to bite me and the doll," Max said.
"I'm sorry, Max. That was not nice of me to not share with you. Do you want to play with the doll together?" Lily asked.
"Yes, please. Thank you, Lily. You are a good sister," Max said.
Lily smiled and hugged Max. She gave him the doll and they played with it together. They made the doll spin and sing, and they laughed and sang too. They forgot about the dog and the door. They were happy and friendly. They learned to share and care.
