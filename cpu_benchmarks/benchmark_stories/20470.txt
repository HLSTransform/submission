Once upon a time there was a boy. He was really happy but he did something bad. His mom was very angry and so she punished him. She made him sit in the corner, away from all his toys. He was sad and wanted to play but he knew he had to stay in the corner.
After some time, the boy was allowed to move. He saw something shiny on the floor - it was a button! He picked it up and put it in his pocket. He wanted to play with it.
But then it started to rain and the button became wet. He didn't want his mom to be mad at him again so he put the button back on the floor. He was sad that he couldn't play with the button but he knew it was the right thing to do.
