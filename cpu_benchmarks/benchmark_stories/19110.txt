Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but she always made a big mess. One day, her mom came in and said, "Lily, you need to clean up your toys. It's not safe to leave them all over the floor."
Lily replied, "But mom, I don't know how to balance them all!"
Her mom smiled and said, "That's okay, we can work on it together."
So, they started to clean up the toys and Lily's mom showed her how to balance them on top of each other. Lily thought it was charming how they could all stay together without falling.
After they finished cleaning, Lily's mom said, "Remember, it's important to take care of our earth too. Just like we balance our toys, we need to balance the things we do to keep our planet healthy."
Lily nodded and said, "I will try my best to keep the earth clean and balanced too!"
