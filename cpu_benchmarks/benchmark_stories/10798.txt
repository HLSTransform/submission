Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big problem. Her toy was broken and she didn't know how to fix it. She asked her mommy for help. 
"Mommy, can you help me solve my toy?" Lily asked. 
"Yes, let's have a meeting with Daddy and see what we can do," Mommy said. 
So, they had a meeting with Daddy. Daddy said that the toy was expensive and they couldn't buy a new one. 
"Don't worry, we can still fix it," Daddy said. 
Together, they found a way to fix the toy and Lily was very happy. She learned that sometimes, when there's a problem, you can solve it with the help of others.
