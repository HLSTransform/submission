Once there was a little girl. Her name was Mary. Mary wanted a mustache. She asked her mom for help. Her mom laughed. She said Mary was too young for a mustache.
So Mary got an idea. She went to the store and got a fake mustache. It was made of felt and had an elastic band. Mary put it on her face and it was so funny! Then she ran outside to show her friends.
Her friends were so surprised! They said her fake mustache looked real. Some of the friends even wanted to try it on. But Mary would not let them! She said it was hers and only hers!
Then Mary went back inside and put the mustache away. She knew she couldn't wear it all the time. But sometimes, when it was just the two of them, her mom would put the fake mustache on too!
