Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He liked to go to the lake with his dad to feed the fish. Tim and his dad would take thick bread to give to the fish.
One day, while they were at the lake, Tim saw a big fish. He wanted to catch it. His dad gave him a hook to use. Tim put some bread on the hook and threw it in the water.
The big fish saw the bread and swam to it. But when the fish ate the bread, the hook got stuck in its mouth. The fish was not happy and swam away very fast. Tim was sad that he hurt the fish, and he learned not to use hooks to catch them.
