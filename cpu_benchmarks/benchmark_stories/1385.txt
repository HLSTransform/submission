Once upon a time, there was a brave girl called Tina. She was very anxious to try out her new computer.
Tina plugged the computer into a wall socket and switched it on. She heard a buzzing sound and saw the lights on the computer turn on.
Tina excitedly typed something on the computer, then she pressed a button that said "print". Suddenly the computer started to make some loud noises and a piece of paper came out of it.
Tina was so happy that the computer had printed something! Now she wanted to try printing something else, something even more exciting.
So Tina typed something else, then again she pressed the button that said "print". But this time, nothing happened. Tina was a bit anxious, so she pressed the button again and again.
Eventually, the computer printed out what Tina had typed! She jumped up and down in excitement.
Tina was so proud of what she had done with her computer!
