Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a dream about a pretty pony. In her dream, the pony was honest and friendly. Lily woke up and told her mom about her dream. 
"Mommy, I dreamed about a pony. It was so pretty and honest," said Lily.
"That sounds like a nice dream, sweetie," replied her mom.
Lily smiled and said, "I wish I could ride a pony like that in real life."
Her mom hugged her and said, "Maybe one day you will, Lily. Dreams can come true."
