Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big tunnel in the park. It was dark and long.
"Let's go inside the tunnel!" Ben said. He was brave and curious.
"I don't know, Ben. It looks scary. What if there are monsters inside?" Lily said. She was shy and careful.
"Don't be afraid, Lily. We can study the tunnel and see what is inside. Maybe we can find something fun or interesting. Come on, follow me!" Ben said. He took Lily's hand and walked into the tunnel.
Lily and Ben walked and walked in the tunnel. They saw some spiders and bugs on the walls. They heard some noises and echoes. They felt some water and dirt on the floor.
"Wow, this is cool! Look at this, Lily!" Ben said. He pointed at a shiny rock on the wall. It was smooth and sparkly.
"Wow, that is pretty! Can I touch it, Ben?" Lily said. She reached for the rock.
Suddenly, they heard a loud roar from the other end of the tunnel. It was a big and chubby bear. It had sharp teeth and claws. It was hungry and angry.
"Run, Lily, run!" Ben shouted. He grabbed Lily's hand and ran back to the entrance of the tunnel.
Lily and Ben ran and ran as fast as they could. They saw the light and the park. They saw their moms and dads. They were safe and happy.
They hugged their moms and dads and told them what happened. Their moms and dads were surprised and proud. They said they were brave and smart to study the tunnel and to run away from the bear.
Lily and Ben smiled and thanked their moms and dads. They said they were sorry for going into the tunnel without asking. They said they learned a lot from their adventure. They said they were still best friends.
