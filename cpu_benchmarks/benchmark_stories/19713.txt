Once there was a boy. His name was Bob. Bob was very glad because he was going to bake a thing. First, he got the ingredients and put them all together in a bowl. Then he mixed them together until they became a big yummy dough. He put the dough in a special oven and waited and waited. After a while, the thing smelled so good that his mouth watered. Finally, the thing was done. Bob was so glad when it was pulled out of the oven. He ate it by himself and it was delicious! He was so happy he even did a little dance.
