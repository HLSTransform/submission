Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, she got very tired and needed to rest. She sat down on the grass and closed her eyes.
Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. It was her friend, Max. He was shouting, "Let's play tag!" But Lily was too tired to play. She said, "No, Max. I need to rest now."
Max didn't understand. He said, "Why are you so lazy? You always want to rest." Lily explained, "I'm not lazy. I just need to rest so I can be healthy and play later." Max understood and said, "Okay, I'll rest with you too." And they both sat on the grass, counting the number of clouds in the sky.
