Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She had a big, messy notebook. Every morning, her mom and dad would give her a big hug and ring the bell to wake her up.
The little girl loved ringing the bell. She would run to the bell and ring it as loud as she could. Every time she heard the bell ringing it made her happy.
One day, she wanted to ring the bell herself, so she got her messy notebook and wrote the word "ring". Then she took it to the bell and showed it to her mom and dad. They were so proud of her, and they helped her ring the bell again.
The little girl was so happy that she could make the bell ring. From then on, every morning she would write the word "ring" in her messy notebook, and she would always ring the bell. 
The end.
