Once upon a time, there was a clever little mouse. The mouse lived in a tower made of cheese. Every day, the mouse would eat the cheese from the tower. 
One day, a big cat came along and saw the tower. The cat wanted to eat the cheese too. The mouse was scared and didn't know what to do. 
But the clever mouse had an idea. He ran up the tower and gained more cheese. Then he threw the cheese at the cat and ran away. The cat was too busy eating the cheese to chase after the mouse. 
From that day on, the clever mouse knew how to protect his tower of cheese from any danger.
