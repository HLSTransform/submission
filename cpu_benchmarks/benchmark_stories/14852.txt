Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, her mom asked her to help her in the kitchen. Lily didn't want to stop playing, but her mom was patient and said, "Lily, can you please turn off your toys and come help me squash the potatoes?"
Lily didn't know what squash meant, but she went to the kitchen to help her mom. Her mom showed her how to squash the potatoes with a big spoon. Lily thought it was fun and giggled while doing it. After they were done, her mom said, "Lily, you did a great job. Now let's go play again."
Lily learned that it's important to help others, even if it means stopping what you're doing. She also learned a new word - squash! From that day on, Lily loved to squash things in the kitchen and always remembered to be patient with others.
