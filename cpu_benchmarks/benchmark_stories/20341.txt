Sara and Ben were playing with their pastels on the floor. They liked to draw flowers and trees and animals with many colors. They were happy and quiet until they heard a loud noise outside.
"What is that?" Sara asked, looking at the window.
"It is rain," Ben said. "Rain is water that falls from the sky. Sometimes it makes thunder and lightning."
"Rain is scary," Sara said. "I don't like it. It makes everything wet and dark."
Ben hugged his sister. "Don't be scared, Sara. Rain is good. It helps the plants grow and the birds drink. And sometimes it makes a rainbow."
"A rainbow?" Sara asked, curious.
"Yes, a rainbow. A rainbow is a big arch of colors in the sky. It is very pretty. It is like a pastel that the sky draws for us."
Sara smiled. "I want to see a rainbow. Can we go outside?"
Ben shook his head. "No, we can't. It is too wet and cold. We have to stay inside until the rain stops. But we can look at the window and wait for the rainbow."
They went to the window and watched the rain. They saw the drops splash on the ground and the puddles form. They saw the clouds move and the wind blow. They saw the sun peek through the clouds and the sky turn bright. And then they saw it. A rainbow.
"Look, Sara, look! A rainbow!" Ben shouted, pointing.
Sara gasped. "Wow, Ben, wow! A rainbow! It is so beautiful! It has all the colors of our pastels!"
They clapped and cheered. They felt happy and warm. They forgot about the rain and the thunder. They only saw the rainbow.
They heard a voice behind them. It was their mom. She had a smile on her face and a towel in her hand.
"Hello, my wise little ones. I see you found the rainbow. Do you like it?"
They nodded and hugged their mom. "We love it, mom. It is the best thing ever. Thank you, rain. Thank you, sky. Thank you, pastel."
