Once there was a little boy who loved to touch things. He touched everything he saw. One day, he saw a secret box that was tucked away in a corner of the room. It was a very special box and he knew it had something special inside. He touched the box and he liked the way it felt. His friend saw him touching it and she got very nosy. She asked what was inside the box and the little boy said it was a secret. No matter how much she asked, he wouldn't tell and kept the secret safe. The nosy friend argued and begged, but the little boy didn't change his mind. He kept the special secret inside the box.
