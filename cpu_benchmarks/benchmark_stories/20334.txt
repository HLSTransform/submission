Mia and Leo were having a picnic with their mom and dad in the park. They had a big blanket to sit on and a basket full of yummy food. Mia and Leo helped their mom spread some jam on the bread. They each got a piece and took a big bite.
"Mmm, this is so good!" Mia said.
"I like the jam, it is sweet and sticky," Leo said.
Their dad gave them some cheese and grapes to go with the bread. They also had some juice and cookies for dessert. Mia and Leo were very happy and full.
After they finished eating, they lay down on the blanket and looked at the sky. They saw some clouds that looked like animals and shapes. They pointed and laughed at what they saw.
"Look, that one is a bunny!" Mia said.
"And that one is a car!" Leo said.
Their mom cuddled them and said, "You two are so smart and creative. I love you very much."
They hugged their mom and said, "We love you too, mom."
They felt very comfortable and cozy on the blanket. They closed their eyes and listened to the birds and the wind. They had a wonderful picnic and a nice nap.
