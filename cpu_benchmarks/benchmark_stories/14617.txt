One day, Sally went to the park. She liked to go and sit on the swing. The swing was fun and it made her smile.
When she got to the park, she could hear the birds singing in the sky. She could also feel the warm sun shining on her skin.
After she finished sitting on the swing, she went to find a wet movie to watch. It was a silly movie with lots of fun characters. She laughed and smiled at the movie as she watched it on the big screen.
When she was done, she went to the park and found a nice spot to sit and relax. She was so happy and content. She felt the warm sun on her face as she relaxed and enjoyed her time in the park. She knew it was time to go home when the sun started to set.
