Once upon a time, there was a fast elephant. He always wanted to get almost everywhere really quickly. One day, he had to go on a very long journey, so he left early in the morning. 
On the way, he met a wise old turtle. The turtle asked, "Where are you going in such a hurry?" The elephant nodded, and motioned at the long journey ahead. The turtle said, "Why don't you take your time on such an important journey? If you go too fast, you may miss what's most important." 
The elephant thought about this and knew that the turtle was right. He lowered his head, slowing down from his fast pace. He made sure to take in all of the sights on his journey and to appreciate all of the little things. 
At the end of his journey, he was almost at his destination. To remind himself to never be in such a rush, he put his thumb on the side of his trunk. From that day on, he always looked at his thumb when he felt the urge to move too quickly. He realized that sometimes it's better to take your time and appreciate what's around you.
