Maggie was getting ready for her trip. She was so excited! Mommy helped her attach her luggage to the car. Maggie watched as Daddy checked to make sure everything was secure.
On the way to the airport, Maggie had so much fun. She looked out the window and said "Look, a rabbit!"
Once they arrived, Maggie and her family went to check in. Daddy was very careful with their luggage and watched as the worker put it on the belt.
But Maggie saw something. One of the other passengers had been careless. His suitcase was not attached properly and it fell off the belt! Maggie looked up at Daddy and laughed. Luckily nothing was broken.
