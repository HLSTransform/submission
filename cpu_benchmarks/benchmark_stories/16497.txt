Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mom. It was a hot day and Lily was sweating because of the heat. She said to her mom, "Mommy, it's so hot outside. Can we go home now?"
Her mom replied, "Yes, Lily, we can go home soon. But first, we have to wait for your dad to come and pick us up."
Lily was playing with her toys when she realized she had lost her favorite doll. She started crying and said, "Mommy, I lost my doll! I can't find it anywhere!"
Her mom said, "Don't worry, Lily. We'll find it. But next time, be more careful with your toys so you don't lose them."
Lily felt sad but she knew her mom was right. She promised to be more careful with her things from then on.
