Sam and Mia were playing with their toys in the living room. Sam had a lot of cars and trucks, and Mia had a lot of dolls and animals. They liked to make noises and stories with their toys, but they did not like to share them.
"Give me that car!" Sam said, grabbing a red car from Mia's hand.
"No, it's mine!" Mia said, pulling it back. "You have so many cars already!"
"I want this one!" Sam said, trying to take it again.
They started to fight over the car, and Mia scratched Sam's arm with her nails. Sam cried out and let go of the car. He looked at his arm and saw a red mark.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Sam said, rubbing his arm. "You hurt me!"
"Sorry, sorry, sorry!" Mia said, feeling bad. "I didn't mean to hurt you!"
She gave him the car and hugged him. Sam hugged her back and stopped crying.
"Are you okay?" Mia asked.
"I'm okay," Sam said. "But you have to be more careful with your nails."
"I know, I know," Mia said. "I'm sorry."
They looked at their toys and saw that they were all over the floor. They had made a big mess.
"Mom will be mad if she sees this," Sam said.
"Let's clean up," Mia said. "We have to be organized."
They started to put their toys back in their boxes and baskets. They remembered where each toy belonged and sorted them by color and type.
"Look, we did it!" Sam said, when they finished. "We are so organized!"
"Good job!" Mia said, giving him a high five. "We are a good team!"
They smiled and hugged each other. They were happy and proud of themselves. They had learned to share and to be organized. They had also remembered to say sorry and to forgive. They were good friends.
