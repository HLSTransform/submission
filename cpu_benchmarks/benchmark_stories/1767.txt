Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One morning, as Lily was playing outside, the sun began to rise. She looked up and said "Look! The sun is rising in the sky!" As the sun rose, the weather got cooler and cooler. 
Then Lily's mom came out and said "Lily, it's time for breakfast." 
Lily replied, "Mommy, can I stay out just a little bit longer? The weather is so cool and I really want to keep playing."
Mom smiled and said, “Okay, but just a few more minutes. Then you have to come in.”
So, Lily continued to play while the sun rose higher and higher. She enjoyed the cool morning and loved the sight of the bright sunshine.
When Lily's mom saw the sun was high in the sky, she said “Lily, it's time for breakfast now. Come inside and we'll have pancakes.”
Lily was so excited that she quickly ran inside. She had a wonderful time playing in the cool, sunny morning, and even better time eating pancakes!
