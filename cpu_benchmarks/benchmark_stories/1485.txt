Once upon a time, there was a girl named Jane. Jane wanted to get to the sky. She asked her mom if she could get some wings to help her fly. Her mom said she could use a kite instead. So they went to buy a kite.
When they got to the park, they saw that the sky was filled with thin white clouds. Jane was so excited to fly her kite. She held onto the string and ran until the kite was up high in the sky. She felt like she could almost touch the sky.
Jane couldn't believe that she was so close to the sky. She kept holding the string and wishing that she could fly higher and higher. Suddenly the wind got stronger and the kite started flying away.
Jane was so happy and excited. She waved goodbye as the kite flew away into the sky. Finally, she had gotten to the sky.
