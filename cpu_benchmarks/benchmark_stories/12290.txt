Once upon a time there were two best friends, Sally and Jane. They were both very brave and loved to play together. 
One day they decided to have a special adventure. They put on their bright jackets and went outside. 
When they got to the river, Sally said to Jane, "Let's go farther down the path. I dare you!" Jane bravely said yes and they kept walking together. 
As they walked, they noticed dust in the air and saw beautiful flower fields. The flowers were so pretty. 
Then, Jane noticed something bright under a tree. They went closer and saw it was a golden necklace. Sally smiled and said, "We should take it! I dare you!" 
Jane was a bit nervous but said yes. They grabbed the necklace and ran home together, excited and proud of their adventure.
