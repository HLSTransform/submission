Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a green dress that she loved to wear. One day, Lily's mommy got a phone call on her phone. Lily wondered who it could be. 
Later that day, Lily and her mommy went to the park. They played on the swings and had a picnic. Suddenly, Lily's mommy's phone rang again. This time, Lily knew who it was. It was her daddy! He was coming home from work. 
Lily was so excited to see her daddy. She ran to the car and waited for him. When he arrived, she gave him a big hug. She was so happy that she wore her green dress, just like he liked. From that day on, Lily knew that when mommy's phone rang, it could mean something really special.
