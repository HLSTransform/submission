Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bake cookies with her mommy. One day, they decided to make chocolate chip cookies. Mommy turned on the oven and Lily helped her mix the ingredients. They put the cookie dough on a tray and put it in the oven.
Lily was so excited to eat the cookies, but she had to wait for them to finish baking. While they were waiting, Lily started to draw with her crayons. She made a big, messy drawing on the table. Mommy told her to clean it up before the cookies finished baking.
Finally, the oven beeped and the cookies were ready. Lily and her mommy took them out of the oven and put them on a plate. They looked so delicious! But when Lily went to get a cookie, she saw that her messy drawing had ruined all of the cookies. Mommy reminded her that she needed to clean up her mess before they started baking. Lily was sad, but she learned an important lesson about being neat and tidy when cooking.
