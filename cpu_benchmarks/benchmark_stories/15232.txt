Once upon a time, a little boy named Tom loved to climb. One sunny day, he went to a big field to play. The field had many trees and a big hill. Tom was very happy to be there.
Tom saw a tall tree and wanted to climb it. He started to climb higher and higher. But then, he got upset because he was scared. He didn't know how to get down. He called for help, but no one was around.
A kind bird heard Tom and flew to him. The bird told Tom not to be upset and to follow her. She showed him how to climb down the tree slowly and safely. Tom was happy and thanked the bird. They played together in the field all day long.
