Molly was hopping down the street, singing a happy tune. It was a bright sunny day, so she was in a very good mood. 
Suddenly, Molly heard something in the grass. It was a zipper! She reached down and picked it up. 
Molly was so grateful that she found the zipper. She decided to hop back to her house to find someone to thank. 
At the house, Molly's mom was working in the garden. 
"Mommy," said Molly. "I found the zipper! I'm so grateful." 
"That's wonderful, sweetie," said mommy. "Who do you want to thank?"
Molly smiled. "Maybe I'll hop back and give it to the nice lady in the park!" 
Molly's mom helped her tie the zipper to a bouquet of flowers.
The next day, Molly hopped back to the park. She thanked the lady for losing the zipper. The lady was very grateful, and she gave Molly a big hug.
Molly couldn't stop smiling as she hopped home. She was so happy to have made someone so grateful!
