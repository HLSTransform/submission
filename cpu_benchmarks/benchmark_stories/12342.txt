Once there was a little girl who was lonely. She was so lonely that she didn't know what to do. One day, she started walking down the street. She kept walking until she came to a park.
As she looked around the park, she noticed that she was the only one there. She felt so lonely, but she didn't want to go home. So she sat down, and she decided to remain.
She stayed in the park for the whole day. As the sun went down, other kids started to arrive. They were laughing and playing, and she smiled to herself.
She realised that she didn't have to be lonely; she could make friends. She said hello and soon the other kids were playing with her too. She was no longer alone, and she enjoyed the start of a new adventure.
