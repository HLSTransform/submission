Once upon a time, there was a tough butterfly. The butterfly was very brave and never gave up. One day, the butterfly saw something that made him frown. His friend, the ladybug, had gotten stuck in a tree. She was too scared to get down!
The butterfly flew up high, near the top of the tree, and looked around. He saw a safe way for the ladybug to get down. He flew over to her and then smiled. He showed her the safe way and she thanked him.
The butterfly went to the ladybug's house to help her. He helped her get out of the tree and back home. The ladybug smiled because she knew the butterfly was brave and strong. The butterfly gave her some of his best butter to be sure she was safe and happy. 
The butterfly flew away, happy that he could help his friend. He knew that he had done something tough and he was proud of himself.
