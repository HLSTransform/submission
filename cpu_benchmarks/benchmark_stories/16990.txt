Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a big bag with toys and snacks. They zip the bag and go to the park.
They see a big slide. They want to slide down. Lily goes first. She slides fast and laughs. Ben goes next. He slides faster and louder. But he slides too fast. He falls off the slide and hurts his knee. He cries.
Lily runs to Ben. She sees his knee. It has a red patch. She says, "Oh no, Ben, you have a boo-boo. It must hurt. Do you want a hug?"
Ben nods. He hugs Lily. He says, "Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend. Can you help me?"
Lily says, "Yes, I can help you. Let's go to the bench. I have a band-aid in the bag. I can put it on your patch. It will make it better."
They go to the bench. Lily zips the bag and takes out a band-aid. She puts it on Ben's patch. She says, "There, now you have a nice band-aid. It has a star on it. You are brave, Ben."
Ben smiles. He says, "Thank you, Lily. You are kind, Lily. The band-aid is nice. It has a star. I like stars. Do you want a snack?"
Lily says, "Yes, I want a snack. What do you have?"
Ben says, "I have cookies. They are tasty. They have chocolate chips. Do you like chocolate chips?"
Lily says, "Yes, I like chocolate chips. They are yummy. Can I have a cookie?"
Ben says, "Yes, you can have a cookie. Here, take one. We can share. We are friends."
They take a cookie each. They bite the cookie. They say, "Mmm, tasty!"
They eat the cookie. They smile. They are happy. They are friends.
