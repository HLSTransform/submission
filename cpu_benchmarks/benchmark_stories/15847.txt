Jack and his mom took a walk in the park one sunny day. They looked around, but couldn't discover anything exciting. Then, Jack spotted something strange. It was waste near a tree! 
"Mom, look!" He said, pointing.
"Oh, no!" She said. "That is not supposed to be there! We have to clean it up."
Jack and his mom found some trash bags and started to clean up the waste. Jack was a bit stubborn and didn't want to help at first, but he finally agreed. After they picked up all of the waste, they saw that the park was much cleaner. 
"Thank you for helping, Jack," said his mom. "Let's keep going on our walk and see if we discover something else that needs cleaning."
Jack smiled and nodded. He was proud of himself for being so helpful. He grabbed his mom's hand, and they started walking again. Who knew what else they might discover!
