Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Molly. Every day, Molly liked to take a walk and explore. Today, Molly decided to explore something new. She walked and walked, until she came to a place that was very different - an igloo!
Molly had never seen an igloo before, and she was so excited! Molly went inside and looked around. It was so fine! Molly was so happy that she wanted to share this with her friends. She ran back outside and grabbed an envelope from the ground.
Molly carefully put a note she had written in the envelope, and she put a stamp on it. She put it in the mail box and hoped that it would reach her friends soon! 
Molly was so happy that she went back to the igloo and explored it more. She had a wonderful day, and she thanked the mail for helping her share her new discovery with her friends!
