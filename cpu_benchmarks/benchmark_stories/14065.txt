Once upon a time, a mommy was trying to explain something to her 3 year old daughter. The mommy wanted her daughter to understand and said: "Look at this chair. It is very organized." The three year old girl looked at the chair and didn't understand. Then the mommy explained: "Organized means nice and tidy. Can you help me by cleaning up the toys and putting them in the drawer so the room can be organized like the chair is?" The three year old girl smiled and said "Yes, mommy!" She enjoyed helping to make the room organized like the chair. And that is why, the room was soon so organized it looked like the chair. The three year old girl was very proud of her accomplishment.
