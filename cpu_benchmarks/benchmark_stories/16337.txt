Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and write with her crayons. One day, she wanted to write a letter to her grandma to say how much she loved her. But when she picked up her crayon, it was broken and hurt her hand.
Lily was sad and didn't know what to do. Then her mom came in with a cup of cocoa. She gave it to Lily and said, "Drink this, it will make you feel better." Lily drank the cocoa and felt warm and happy inside.
She decided to try writing again, but this time with a new crayon. She wrote a beautiful letter to her grandma and gave it to her mom to mail. Her grandma was so happy to get the letter and called to say how much she loved it. Lily was happy too, knowing that her grandma knew how much she loved her.
