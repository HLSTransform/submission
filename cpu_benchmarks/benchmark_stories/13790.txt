Sara and Ben were playing in the sand. They had a bucket and a spade each. They wanted to make a big castle with towers and walls. Sara was digging a hole for the moat. Ben was piling up the sand for the walls.
But then, a big boy came and kicked their castle. He laughed and said, "Your castle is silly. It is too small and weak. I can break it with one foot." He kicked it again and again. Sara and Ben were sad and angry. They shouted, "Stop it! Go away! You are mean!"
The big boy did not stop. He grabbed Sara's spade and threw it away. He said, "This is my spade now. You can't have it. You are too little to play with it." Sara cried and ran after her spade. Ben tried to stop the big boy, but he was too strong. He pushed Ben down and said, "You are too weak to fight me. You are a baby."
Then, a man came and saw what was happening. He was the big boy's father. He was very angry. He said, "What are you doing? Why are you bullying these children? Give them back their spade and say sorry. You should be ashamed of yourself."
The big boy was scared. He dropped the spade and said, "Sorry." He did not look at Sara and Ben. He looked at the ground. He was ashamed. He knew he was wrong. He followed his father, who took him away.
Sara and Ben picked up their spade and bucket. They hugged each other. They said, "It's okay. We are friends. We can make another castle." They smiled and started to play again. They were happy.
