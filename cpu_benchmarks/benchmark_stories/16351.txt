Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and laugh all day. But one day, she found a box with a strange powder inside. The powder was harsh and made her hands feel icky.
Lily decided to put the powder on her toy bear. When she did, the bear started to cry. Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. She hugged her bear and told it not to cry, but the bear kept crying.
Lily took the bear to her mom and told her what happened. Her mom helped her wash the bear and the harsh powder came off. The bear stopped crying and Lily was happy again. She learned not to play with strange things and to always ask for help when she needed it.
