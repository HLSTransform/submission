Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was a normal boy who liked to play with his toys and eat lunch. One day, Tim went to the park with his mom. They had a fun time playing and running around.
At lunch time, Tim's mom gave him a yummy sandwich. While he was eating, Tim saw a little bird. The bird was hungry too. Tim gave the bird some of his lunch. The bird was very happy and started to follow Tim.
Tim and the bird played together all day. They became best friends. When it was time to go home, Tim said goodbye to the bird. The bird flew away and Tim went home with his mom. Tim had a great day at the park with his new friend.
