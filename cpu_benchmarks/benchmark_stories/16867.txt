Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a new toy that she loved to play with every day. One day, her little brother came into her room and disturbed her while she was playing. 
"Stop disturbing me!" Lily said to her brother. 
Her brother didn't understand what she meant, so Lily explained that disturbing means bothering someone when they don't want to be bothered. 
Later that day, Lily's mom came home and showed her a new cell phone. Lily was excited to see the new phone and asked if she could play with it. Her mom said yes, but reminded her to be careful with the new phone. 
Lily played with the new phone for a while, but then accidentally dropped it on the floor. She was worried that she had broken it, but her mom reassured her that it was okay. 
From that day on, Lily made sure to be careful with the new phone and reminded her brother not to disturb her when she was playing with her toys. The end.
