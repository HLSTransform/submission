One day, Sarah and her family were in the park. It was a hot day and Sarah found a nice shady spot under a tree. The sun was high in the sky and Sarah saw the tree's shadow on the ground below. She thought it was helpful because it made her feel nice and cool.
Sarah and her family played catch and hide-and-seek in the park. They gathered lots of leaves and made big piles of them. They saw some ducks in the pond and laughed as they swam around. After they had some fun, it was time to go home.
On the way home, Sarah looked back at the park. She said goodbye to the ducks and thanked the big tree for its helpful shade. She smiled and waved as they drove away, happy and tired after a lovely day in the park.
