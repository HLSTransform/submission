Once upon a time, there was a kid named Timmy. Timmy was very fragile and always had to be careful not to hurt himself. One day, Timmy was playing with his favorite toy when his friend Billy came over. Billy wanted to play with Timmy's toy, but Timmy didn't want to share. Billy started to question why Timmy wouldn't share, but Timmy just got upset and said no.
Billy didn't like that Timmy wouldn't share, so he decided to take the toy anyways. Timmy got very upset and started to cry. Billy realized that he shouldn't have taken the toy and apologized to Timmy. Timmy forgave Billy and they played together with the toy. From then on, they always shared their toys and never had any more conflicts.
