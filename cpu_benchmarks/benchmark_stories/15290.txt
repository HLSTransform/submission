Once there was a person who was very weak. They were too weak to walk very far or play in the park. So, the person decided to do something different. 
The person started to balance different things on their head! First, the person balanced a book. It was wobbly at first, but the person managed to balance it for a few seconds. Then, the person balanced a pile of ten pencils. The person kept balancing more and more things.
Soon, the person was balancing cans, balls, and even a big chair! Everyone was so amazed that the person could balance all of these things. Other people tried, but they weren't very good at it. 
The person was very proud and everyone was happy to see the person getting stronger and stronger. The weak person had become strong by balancing all sorts of things!
