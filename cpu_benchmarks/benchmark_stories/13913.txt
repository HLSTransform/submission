Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a yummy cookie and a pretty doll. Lily loved her doll very much. She played with her doll every day.
One day, while Lily was playing with her doll, her friend Sam came over. Sam saw the yummy cookie and the pretty doll. He wanted to play with the doll and eat the cookie too. Sam said, "Lily, can we share your yummy cookie and pretty doll?"
Lily thought about it for a moment. She loved her doll and yummy cookie, but she also loved her friend Sam. So, she said, "Yes, Sam, we can share my doll and yummy cookie." They both played with the doll and ate the yummy cookie together. Lily and Sam were very happy and had lots of fun.
