Mia and Leo were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and find shiny things. Mia found a crystal that was very pretty. It was blue and sparkled in the sun.
"Look, Leo, I found a crystal!" Mia said, holding it up.
"Wow, it's so nice!" Leo said. "Can I see it?"
Mia gave the crystal to Leo. He looked at it closely. He saw a crack in the crystal. It was broken.
"Oh, no, Mia, your crystal is broken!" Leo said, feeling sad.
Mia took the crystal back. She saw the crack too. She felt sad too.
"It's okay, Leo, it's still pretty," Mia said, trying to smile.
"But it's not perfect," Leo said. "Don't you want a perfect crystal?"
Mia thought for a moment. She liked the crystal, even if it was broken. It was still shiny and blue. She decided to accept the crystal as it was.
"No, Leo, I don't need a perfect crystal," Mia said. "I like this crystal because I found it with you. We can share it, if you want."
Leo smiled. He liked Mia, even if she liked broken things. He decided to accept the crystal too.
"Okay, Mia, we can share it," Leo said. "It's our special crystal. Let's put it in our treasure box."
Mia and Leo ran to their treasure box. They put the crystal inside, next to their other shiny things. They were happy. They hugged each other and went back to playing in the garden.
