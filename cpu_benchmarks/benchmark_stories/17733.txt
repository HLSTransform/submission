Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sally. Sally was only three years old and she loved to play games. One day, when she was playing in the park, she met a funny old man. The man said to her, "Hello little one, what is your name?". Sally said, "My name is Sally." The old man said, "Hello Sally, I am Mr. Smith. Do you want to play a game with me?". Sally thought it sounded like fun so she said yes.
Mr. Smith gave her a funny looking box with a lid. He said, "Place your hand on the lid and then rub it". Sally did as she was told and the box made a funny sound. She quickly opened it and inside she found a silly looking toy. The old man said, "This is a magical toy. When you speak to it, it talks back". Sally thought this was the funniest thing ever.
She spoke to the toy and it began to move and talk to her. It spoke funny words and Sally laughed and laughed. Suddenly it said something stupid which made her laugh even more.
The old man said, "Now, let's put the toy back in the box and seal it. That way the magic will stay inside". So Sally put the toy in the box and rubbed the lid, and the magic was sealed away inside. Sally thanked the old man and they both went on their way.
