Once upon a time there were two friends, Jack and Jane. They were both very lively and enjoyed spending time together. One day they decided to make a pie. They took their bowls and picked apples from the tree. Then they mixed the apples with sugar and spices and put the pie in the oven.
When the pie was ready, Jack and Jane had a slice each. It was delicious! After they finished their slices, they started playing together. They ran around and laughed, having lots of fun.
Eventually, it became dark outside and Jane's mom called her home. Jane said goodbye to Jack and promised to come back the next day. Jack was so sad to see Jane go.
The next day, Jack and Jane met up again to have some more pie. They laughed and talked until it was time for them to end their day. They said goodbye and waved, knowing they'd get to make and eat more pie together in the future.
