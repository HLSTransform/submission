Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big garden where she loved to play. One day, she saw a beautiful flower and wanted to pick it. But her mom said, "No, Lily. We should let the flowers grow." 
Lily didn't listen and picked the flower anyway. She felt happy at first, but then she saw that the stem was thick and the petals were falling off. She realized that she had hurt the flower. 
Later that day, Lily saw a bird tapping on the ground with its beak. She went closer and saw that the bird was trying to pick up a worm. Lily helped the bird by picking up the worm and giving it to the bird. The bird flew away happily. 
Lily learned that it's important to be kind to nature and animals. She promised to never pick a flower again and to always help animals in need.
