Once upon a time, there was a furry bear. His name was Jazz. He lived all alone in the forest.
One day, he saw a bird flying outside his cave. It had something in its beak. Jazz was curious, so he followed the bird to its nest. 
In the nest, the bird had a present for Jazz. It was bring a big, juicy, red apple. Jazz was thankful for the kind gesture and thanked the bird. 
The next day, Jazz was excitedly waiting for the bird. He wanted to give the bird something in return. When the bird came back, Jazz brought with him a basket of freshly picked berries. He was happy to give the bird a snack. 
Jazz and the bird became friends and they used to spend lots of their time together. They laughed, sang, and danced to the sound of Jazz's music. They had lots of fun! 
That's how the furry bear Jazz and the bird became friends. They shared their days, filled with love and laughter.
