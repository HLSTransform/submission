Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat yummy food. One day, his mom made him a sandwich with delicious ham and cheese. Timmy ate it all up and asked for more.
After lunch, Timmy's mom told him it was time to go outside and play. Timmy ran to his room to put on his clothes. He picked out his favorite shirt and pants, but he couldn't tie his shoes. His mom helped him tie them and then he was ready to go play.
Timmy had so much fun playing outside and didn't want to come back inside. But when it started to get dark, his mom called him in for dinner. She made his favorite spaghetti and meatballs. Timmy thought it was the most delicious meal ever! After dinner, he went to bed with a full tummy and a happy heart.
