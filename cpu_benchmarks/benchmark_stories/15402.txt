Once there was a little girl who was very tired. She yawned and stretched her arms. She had worked very hard all day and was ready for a nap. 
Her mum came over with a medal. It was a shiny medal, with a nice red ribbon. The little girl smiled and clasped the medal to her chest.
Mum said she had earned the medal for all her hard work. She had worked so hard she made her mum and dad so proud. The little girl hugged mum and thanked her with a big yawn.
Mum hugged her back and told her it was time for bed. She brushed the little girl's hair and tucked her in tight. She gave the little girl one last hug, then said goodnight with a nice smile. 
The little girl soon fell asleep, dreaming of all her hard work and the nice medal she had been given.
