Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. Amy had a big mirror in her room. She liked to look at herself in the mirror every day. But Amy did not know the value of the mirror. She was ignorant.
One day, Amy's friend, Tom, came to play with her. Tom saw the big mirror and said, "Wow, Amy! You have a big mirror. It is very nice. Do you know its value?" Amy shook her head and said, "No, I don't know. What is value?"
Tom smiled and said, "Value means how important something is. This mirror is special. It helps you see yourself and make sure you look good. So, it has value."
Amy thought for a moment and then said, "Oh, I see! So, the mirror is important because it helps me. Thank you, Tom, for teaching me about value." From that day on, Amy was not ignorant about the value of her mirror. She took care of it and always made sure it was clean and shiny.
