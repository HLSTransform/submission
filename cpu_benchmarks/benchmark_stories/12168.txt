One day, Jack and his mom were walking by the beach. There were lots of people enjoying the nice day and the sun was shining brightly. Jack was really excited to see all the people diving into the water. He said to his mom, "Mommy, I want to dive in the water too!" His mom smiled and said, "Okay, let's go!"
Jack and his mom went over to the shore. Jack could see that the water was so clear and cold, like ice. He was so excited to jump in. He said, "Mommy, I'm going to dive!" His mom held his hand tight, and they both dove together. The water was so cold but it felt so nice!
Jack and his mom continued to dive in and out of the cold water, having so much fun. Jack kept saying, "Dive again, mommy! Dive again!" They took turns diving and had a really wonderful time together. After a while, Jack was starting to get tired, and so they both said goodbye to the ocean and went home.
