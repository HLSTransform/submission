Amy and Jack were washing the car together. All was going well until Jack took a strip off the sponge. Amy wanted to keep it tidy. She refused to let Jack use the strip, so a fight broke out.
Jack wanted to use the strip to help wash the car. However, Amy wanted him to leave it alone and said he was making a mess.
Jack refused and they argued and argued. Then Amy came up with the perfect solution. She said that Jack could use the strip to serve her. This would both tidy the car and make them both happy.
Jack agreed, and together they worked to serve the car with the strip, and soon enough it was clean and tidy.
