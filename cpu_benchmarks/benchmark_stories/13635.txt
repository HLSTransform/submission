Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to dig holes and find worms and stones. They had a big bucket and a small shovel. They were having fun.
"Look, Lily, I found a pipe!" Ben said. He held up a shiny metal thing. It was long and round and had a hole at both ends.
"What is it for?" Lily asked. She touched the pipe. It was cold and smooth.
"I don't know. Maybe it is for water. Let's see what happens if we blow into it." Ben said. He put one end of the pipe to his mouth and blew hard. A loud sound came out of the other end. It sounded like a horn.
"Wow, that's cool!" Lily said. She wanted to try too. She took the pipe from Ben and blew into it. The sound was even louder. It made them laugh.
But then they heard another sound. It was a voice. It was angry.
"Hey, you kids, stop that! That's my pipe! It's not a toy!" The voice belonged to Mr. Jones, the neighbor. He was standing at the fence. He looked very mad.
"Sorry, Mr. Jones, we didn't know. We found it in the ground." Ben said. He gave the pipe back to Mr. Jones.
"That's my sprinkler pipe. You broke it. Now I can't water my flowers. Go away and don't touch my things again." Mr. Jones said. He took the pipe and went back to his house.
Lily and Ben felt bad. They didn't mean to make Mr. Jones angry. They decided to go inside and have a snack. Mom had made some cookies. They smelled delicious.
"Mom, we're sorry. We played with Mr. Jones' pipe and he got mad." Lily said.
"It's okay, honey. You didn't know. But next time, be careful with things that don't belong to you. They might be important or dangerous." Mom said. She gave them each a cookie and a glass of milk.
"Thank you, Mom. You're the best." Ben said.
"Yes, thank you, Mom. We love you." Lily said.
They ate their cookies and drank their milk. They felt better. They hugged Mom and said sorry again. Then they went to their room and played with their own toys. They were happy.
