Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play with cars. They had many cars of different colors and sizes, but they always wanted more. One day, their mom took them to the toy store and said they could each choose one car to buy.
Tim ran to the shelf and picked a big red car that had shiny leather seats and a loud horn. He was very happy with his choice and showed it to his mom. Sam looked at the shelf and saw a small blue car that had soft leather seats and a quiet horn. He liked the blue car, but he was jealous of Tim's red car. He wanted to have the biggest and loudest car too.
He said to Tim, "Your car is not good. It is too big and too noisy. My car is better. It is small and quiet. Let me have your car and you can have mine."
Tim said, "No, I like my car. I chose it first. You can have your own car. Stop being jealous."
Sam was angry and did not listen. He grabbed Tim's car and tried to take it away from him. Tim held on to his car and did not let go. They both pulled and pushed and shouted. Their mom heard them and came to see what was wrong.
She saw them fighting over the red car and was very upset. She said, "You are both being very naughty. You should not fight over toys. You should be happy with what you have and share with each other. Because you did not behave, you will not get any car today. I will take them back to the store and you will go home with nothing."
She took the cars from their hands and put them back on the shelf. Tim and Sam cried and begged, but their mom did not change her mind. She took them by the hand and left the toy store. They went home with nothing and learned a hard lesson.
