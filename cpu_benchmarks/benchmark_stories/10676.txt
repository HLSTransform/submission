Once upon a time, a mom and her little boy were walking home. They were both feeling very upset.
When they arrived home, the little boy ran to his bedroom. He just wanted to be alone. His mom followed him and said, “What’s wrong, my love? Will you tell me why you are feeling so upset?”
The little boy burst into tears and said, “I am upset because I don’t have any friends to play with.”
His mom hugged him tightly and said, “Don’t worry, my love. I’m sure your friends will come and play with you soon.” She wiped away his tears and kissed him on the forehead.
The little boy’s face lit up and he said, “Really?”
“Yes, really,” his mom said with a smile. “Now come on, let’s go outside and play together.”
The little boy smiled and grabbed his mom’s hand, no longer feeling upset. They had a wonderful day in the sunshine.
