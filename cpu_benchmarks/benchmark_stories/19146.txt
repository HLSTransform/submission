Once upon a time, there was a little boat that loved to sail. One day, the boat sailed to a new place. In this place, there were many sour lemons. The boat met a friendly bird who lived there.
"Hello, boat!" said the bird. "Why are you in our place?"
"I like to sail and see new places," said the boat. "But I don't like sour things. They make me feel bad."
The bird wanted to help the boat feel better. So, the bird thought of a plan. The bird knew that the boat needed to sail away from the sour place. But there was a big, mean fish blocking the way.
The bird went to the mean fish and said, "Please let my friend, the boat, sail away from this sour place. It makes him feel bad."
The mean fish thought about it and said, "Okay, the boat can sail away. But only if you bring me some sweet fruit."
So, the bird flew far away and found some sweet fruit. The bird brought the sweet fruit to the mean fish. The mean fish was happy and let the boat sail away from the sour place.
The boat was so happy to sail away from the sour place. The boat and the bird became best friends and sailed to many new places together. And they lived happily ever after.
