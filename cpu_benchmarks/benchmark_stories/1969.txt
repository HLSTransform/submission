Once upon a time there was a friendly melon in the garden. Every day it said hello to the other fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, not all the fruits and vegetables were as friendly.
One day, a pumpkin came into the garden and it refused to say hello to the melon.
The melon asked, "Why don't you want to be my friend?"
But the pumpkin would not answer.
The melon sighed but it still said hello every day.
One day, after the pumpkin had been in the garden for a long time, it finally said hello back.
The melon was so happy and the two became friends.
From that day onward the pumpkin always said hello first and the two were great friends.
The moral of this story is that everyone should always behave in a friendly way. Even if somebody doesn't act friendly to you, you should still be kind to them.
