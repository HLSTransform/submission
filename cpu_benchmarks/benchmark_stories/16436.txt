Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They like to make castles with sand and sticks. They have a big bucket and a small shovel. They work hard and have fun.
But then, a big boy comes. He is mean and rude. He kicks their castles and laughs. He takes their bucket and shovel and runs away. Anna and Ben are sad and angry. They cry and shout.
"Hey, give us back our things!" Ben yells.
"Stop, you are bad!" Anna says.
But the big boy does not listen. He goes to the pond and throws the bucket and shovel in the water. They sink and disappear. The big boy smiles and walks away.
Anna and Ben run to the pond. They look for their bucket and shovel, but they cannot see them. They are gone. Anna and Ben are very sad. They hug each other and say sorry.
"Sorry, Ben. I wish we had our bucket and shovel back."
"Sorry, Anna. I wish the big boy was nice."
They go home and tell their mom what happened. She hugs them and says sorry too.
"Sorry, Anna and Ben. I am proud of you for being kind and brave. The big boy was wrong and mean. Maybe he will learn to be better someday."
But Anna and Ben do not feel better. They miss their bucket and shovel. They do not want to play with sand anymore. They have a bad day.
