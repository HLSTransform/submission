Once there was a little girl called Sarah. She was very happy and enjoyed playing in her garden with her friends. One day, she saw a bug that was crawling around. She thought it was so cute and she wanted to pick it up.
Sarah was very excited and bent down to pick up the bug. All of a sudden, there was a loud noise that disturbed Sarah. She was scared and quickly stood up. She saw that a bird had made the noise and flew away.
Sarah was frustrated that she could not pick up the bug. She did not understand why the bird scared it away. Sarah was very upset and went inside her house. She did not feel like playing in the garden anymore, so she went and watched a movie. Even though she was sad, she was still happy that she saw the bug.
