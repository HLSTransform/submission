Once upon a time, there was a little seed. This seed wanted to grow big and tall. It knew that it would be tough, but it tried very hard.
One day, a family went to a camp near the seed. They had a lot of fun. They played games, sang songs, and ate yummy food. The seed liked to watch them play and laugh.
As the days went by, the seed started to grow. It grew into a strong, tall tree. The family came back to the camp every year, and the tree was always there to give them shade and a place to play. The tree was very happy that it had grown so big and tough.
