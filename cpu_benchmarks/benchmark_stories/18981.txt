Once upon a time, there was a wealthy pilot named Bob. Bob loved to fly his big, blue plane up in the sky. One sunny day, Bob was walking to his plane when he saw a little boy named Timmy.
"Hi, Timmy!" said Bob. "Do you want to see my plane?"
"Yes, please!" said Timmy with a big smile.
Bob took Timmy to his plane and they both climbed inside. Timmy was so excited! He had never been in a plane before. Bob showed Timmy all the buttons and levers. Then, they heard a loud noise outside.
"Oh no!" said Bob. "My dog, Spot, is running away!"
Bob and Timmy ran out of the plane to catch Spot. They ran and ran until they finally caught him. Timmy was happy to help Bob catch his dog. After they caught Spot, they went back to the plane and flew up into the sky. Timmy had the best day ever with Bob, the wealthy pilot.
