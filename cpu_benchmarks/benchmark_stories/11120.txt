Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside. One day, he saw a shiny chain on the ground. He picked it up and decided to hold it in his hands. Tim felt happy with his new chain.
In the park, Tim met his friend, Sue. Sue had a yummy cookie. Tim wanted a cookie too. They made a plan. Tim would give Sue his shiny chain, and Sue would give Tim half of her yummy cookie. They both agreed and were excited about their trade.
Tim gave Sue the shiny chain, and Sue gave Tim half of her yummy cookie. They both smiled and enjoyed their new things. Tim took a big bite of the cookie, and it was the best cookie he ever had. Sue wore the shiny chain around her neck, and it made her feel special. They played together all day, happy with their trade.
