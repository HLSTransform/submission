Once upon a time, there was a little bird who lived in a big tree. One day, the bird was flying around looking for twigs to build a nest. It was a hot day and the bird was feeling very thirsty.
As the bird was flying, it saw a big puddle of water. The water looked cool and refreshing, but the bird noticed something strange. There was a big, scary cat hiding behind a bush near the puddle. The bird suggested to itself that it should be careful and not go near the puddle.
But the bird was so thirsty that it forgot about the cat and flew down to the puddle to drink. As soon as the bird landed, the cat pounced and caught the bird in its sharp claws. The bird realized too late that it should have listened to its own suggestion and stayed away from the puddle. The end.
