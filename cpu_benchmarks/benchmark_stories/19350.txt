Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. He loved to play outside. 
One day, he was playing in the garden when he saw a big bird. It was flying so high and so fast. Jack wanted to fly too! He jumped in the air and spread his arms wide. He wanted to fly like the bird.
Suddenly, he felt a strong wind. He was lifted off his feet. He started to rush up, up, up towards the sky! It was so much fun! 
But then, he started to fall. He had flown too high and the wind stopped carrying him. He felt a little scared but he didn't make a sound. He was deaf. He hoped he'd land in the soft grass in the garden.
Luckily, he did! He was so happy to be back on the ground. He learned his lesson - he won't try to fly too high next time!
