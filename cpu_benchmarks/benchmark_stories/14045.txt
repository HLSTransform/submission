Once upon a time there was an old man and a young boy. Every day the old man would take the boy for a walk in the woods.
One day the old man showed the boy a special watch. It was shiny, sparkly and really high. The old man said that he must look after the watch very carefully. 
The boy was very excited and held the watch tight in his hand. He kept it safe and they continued walking through the woods.
Suddenly, the sky opened and a huge rainbow appeared! The boy was amazed as he had never seen such a beautiful sight before. He looked up to the sky with the watch in his hand and suddenly noticed that the watch was shining brightly in the same colours as the rainbow. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen!
The old man smiled, knowing that he had shown the boy something really special that he would remember for the rest of his life.
