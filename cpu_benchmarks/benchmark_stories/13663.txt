Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to go on the swing and slide and run around. Lily had a new toy. It was a small box with a button. She could record her voice and play it back.
"Look, Ben, this is my toy. I can record what I say. Watch!" Lily said. She pressed the button and said, "Hello, I am Lily. I like to swing." Then she pressed the button again and the box repeated her words.
"Wow, that is cool, Lily. Can I try?" Ben asked.
"Sure, Ben. Here you go. Press the button and say something." Lily said. She gave the box to Ben. He pressed the button and said, "Hi, I am Ben. I like to slide." Then he pressed the button again and the box repeated his words.
They laughed and took turns to record and play back their voices. They said funny things like, "I am a dinosaur. Roar!" and "I am a princess. I have a crown." They had a lot of fun.
But soon they became sleepy. They had played for a long time. They yawned and rubbed their eyes.
"Let's go home, Lily. I am sleepy." Ben said.
"Me too, Ben. I am sleepy." Lily said. They put the box in Lily's backpack and walked to their moms. They said goodbye and hugged.
"Bye, Lily. See you tomorrow." Ben said.
"Bye, Ben. See you tomorrow." Lily said.
They went home with their moms. They had a nice nap and dreamed of the park. They were happy.
