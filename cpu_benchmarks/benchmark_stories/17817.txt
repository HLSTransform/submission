Once upon a time, there was a boy called Jack. He was very envious of his friend Tom. Tom had lots of nice toys that Jack wanted to play with.
One day, Tom was listening to a lecture from his teacher. It was about the importance of sharing. Jack didn't want to listen, so he shook his head and stared at the floor.
Tom saw Jack and he knew that he was feeling envious. So he decided to share his invitation to the park. Jack was so excited, and he shook Tom's hand to say thank you.
At the park, they played on all the swings and slides. Jack was so happy that Tom had shared his invitation, and he shook his hand again to say goodbye.
Jack and Tom were the best of friends after that day. The lesson about sharing had stuck, and they enjoyed playing together. The end.
