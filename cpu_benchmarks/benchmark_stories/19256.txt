Once upon a time, there was a girl named Tilly. Tilly had a special box with lots of things inside. One day, Tilly wanted to make something special so she decided to start using her things. 
Tilly took out some paper and a pair of scissors. She placed the paper on the table. Then she started to cut it into little pieces. She kept cutting and soon the paper was all cut up. 
Now she had an empty box and lots of cut up pieces of paper. She carefully put the pieces of paper into the box. Then she started to decorate them with bright colours. Finally, the box was full of colourful decorations. Tilly was so pleased with her work! 
The end.
