Jack and his mom were at the park. Jack saw a big tree and wanted to climb it. He looked up at the leaves and saw lots of apples. His mom smiled and said, “Pick some apples. They look tasty.”
Jack was excited! He started running up the tree, picking the apples off the branches. He was careful not to let any of them fall. He came back down with his arms full of apples. His mom said, “Let’s go home now. We can make a yummy apple pie.”
Jack and his mom went home to make the pie. Jack stirred the apples and sugar together in the bowl. His dad was so excited, he said it smelled very tasty! After the pie was cooked and cooled, Jack, his mom, and his dad ate it. It was delicious!
After dinner, Jack and his dad played a game of catch. They laughed and smiled as the ball went from one to the other. Jack was so happy and said, “This was the best day ever!”
