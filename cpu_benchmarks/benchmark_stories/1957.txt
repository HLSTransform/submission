One day, little David was playing in the garden with his father. He saw a pretty rope that his father had left there. He asked his father, “What is this rope for?” 
His father replied, “It is to pinch the leaves off of the trees.” 
Little David was curious and asked, “Can I try?” His father answered, “Sure, my little one.” 
David grabbed the pretty rope, and he started pinching the leaves off of the trees. His father smiled and said, “You are doing a great job!” 
David was so proud and happy to be helping his father. He felt like a big boy! He kept pinching until all of the leaves were gone. Then he said to his father, “Thank you for letting me help.” 
His father smiled and said, “You did a great job, my little one.”
