Once upon a time there was a girl named Sarah. She was very curious and wanted to explore the world. One day, she came across an old house with a mysterious stair. She wanted to explore the stair but was a little scared. 
So Sarah decided to write her name on the stair. She wrote her name slowly and carefully. She looked around and saw that no one was around. Sarah slowly began to climb the stair wondering where it was leading her.
Step by step Sarah made her way up the stair. As she reached the top, she saw a beautiful view! The view was so beautiful that Sarah wanted to write about it. She took out her pen and paper and started to write. 
She wrote about the beautiful view and how mysterious the stair was. Sarah was very happy that she had taken the risk to explore the old house. She knew that her curiosity had led her to a special place. The place will always be special to her.
