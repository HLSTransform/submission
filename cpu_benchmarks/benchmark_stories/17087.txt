Once upon a time, there was a charming parrot named Polly. Polly lived in a big tree with her friends. They liked to play and talk all day.
One day, Polly saw a group of ants marching. She flew down from her tree and asked the ants, "Where are you going?" The ants replied, "We are going to a picnic. Would you like to come with us?" Polly thought it was a great idea and joined the ants.
As they marched together, Polly and the ants saw a big rainbow. They all felt very happy. At the picnic, they shared yummy food and played fun games. The charming parrot and her new ant friends had a great day.
