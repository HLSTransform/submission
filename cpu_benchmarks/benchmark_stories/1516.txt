Once there was a bug. It loved living outside with its friends. It was so happy there that it prepared a special picnic. It found a calm spot in the yard and laid out all its food and friends.
The bug invited all the other bugs to join him. He prepared some tasty snacks and flowers to make the picnic even better. All the bugs were very excited and they started eating and playing.
The bug was so happy he had prepared such a fun picnic! Everyone was laughing, playing and eating. It was a peaceful and relaxing afternoon and the bug was so happy.
As the afternoon came to an end, all the bugs said goodbye to each other. They thanked the bug very much for preparing such a wonderful picnic. They all promised to come back soon!
