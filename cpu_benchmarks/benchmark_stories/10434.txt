Once upon a time, there was an elderly man who lived by a bridge. Every day, he would stop to admire the bridge and needs the river flowing beneath it.
The elderly man liked to repeat his favourite phrase: "One day I will cross this bridge".
Time passed and one day, the old man had saved enough money to buy an old car. He was so very proud because now he could drive across the bridge! The elderly man proudly repeated his words "One day I will cross this bridge" as he drove away.
Finally, the day came when the elderly man could actually cross the bridge he had admired for so long. He drove slowly and cautiously across the bridge, feeling so pleased with himself. 
At the other side, he stopped and looked back at the bridge. With a smile, he repeated his words once again:  "One day I crossed this bridge".
