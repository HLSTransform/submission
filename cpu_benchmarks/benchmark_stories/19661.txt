Once upon a time there was a young boy named Dave. Dave was three years old and he was looking for something to do. One day he found a fake math book in his room and he decided to give it a try. He opened the book and started to try and do the math. But it was too hard for him and he started to cry. 
His mom came in to check on him and asked what was wrong. Dave told her that he wanted to do the math, but he didn't understand it. His mom smiled at him and said, "Don't worry, I can help you. Let's go and wash our hands before we start." 
So Dave and his mom went to the kitchen and washed their hands properly. After that, it was time to do some math. Dave's mom taught him how to do each problem step by step and he was soon doing the math without any trouble. 
Dave was very happy that he was able to do the math, even though it was fake. He had learned a valuable lesson - if he tried his best, he could do anything he puts his mind to.
