Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy who loved trains. He went to the station every day to watch the trains go by. One day, he saw a big, red train that he had never seen before. He asked the train driver, "What kind of train is that?"
"It's a dependable train," said the driver. "It always gets to where it needs to go on time."
Timmy was impressed. "Can I ring the bell?" he asked.
"Of course," said the driver. Timmy ran up to the train and rang the bell. Ding ding ding! It was so loud and exciting. From that day on, Timmy loved dependable trains even more.
