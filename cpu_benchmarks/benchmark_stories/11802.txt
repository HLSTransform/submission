Once upon a time there was an ancient and wise crab. He lived near the beach, close to the sea.
The crab would catch shrimp every day. One day he noticed something strange. All the shrimp were clapping their hands! 
“What’s this?” exclaimed the crab. But the shrimp said nothing.
The crab asked again. This time the shrimp replied. “We are applauding to show our respect for the sharks. They are much bigger, and much wiser than us.”
The crab was inspired. He wanted to join in the applause. He started to clap his claws and the other shrimp joined in too. 
Soon they were all applauding together. The ancient crab was so proud of all the shrimp, and how they stood up for what they believed in.
