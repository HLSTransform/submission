Once upon a time, there was a little crab named Timmy. Timmy was very small and had a hard time finding food. He lived by the beach where the tide would come in and out. One day, Timmy was walking on the beach and he saw a big, juicy piece of seaweed. He was so excited to eat it, but then he saw a seagull coming towards him.
"Hey little crab, that seaweed looks delicious. Can I have a bite?" asked the seagull.
"No, it's mine!" Timmy said.
The seagull got angry and said, "Fine, keep your poor little piece of seaweed. I'll go find something else to eat." And with that, the seagull quit bothering Timmy and flew away. Timmy was happy that he got to keep his seaweed and he ate it all up. From then on, he learned to be brave and stand up for himself.
