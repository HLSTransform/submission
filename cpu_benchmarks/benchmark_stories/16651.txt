Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to go to the store with her mommy. One day, they went to a big store and saw a pretty purse. Lily asked her mommy if they could buy it. Her mommy said yes and they bought the purse.
But when they got home, Lily's mommy saw that the purse was fake. That means it wasn't a real purse, it was just pretending to be one. Lily's mommy was sad and told Lily that they had to return the purse to the store. 
Lily was sad too, but her mommy explained that it's not nice to buy fake things. It's better to buy things that are real and good quality. Lily understood and they went back to the store to return the fake purse. They found a real purse that was even prettier and bought that instead. Lily was happy and her mommy was proud of her for learning a good lesson. The end.
