Once upon a time, an old man and his grandson lived in the same house. The old man was very thoughtful and looked after his grandson when his parents were away. Every morning the old man would wake up early and give his grandson a big hug and kiss. 
One morning the old man was trying to wake up his grandson but he didn't wake up. The old man was worried and knew something must be wrong.
He quickly took the little boy to the bathroom and placed him in a warm bath. The water was warm and the old man started to raise the boy up and out of the water. The boy slowly opened his eyes and smiled. 
The old man was relieved and was very thankful that the boy was okay. He had been very thoughtful throughout the whole process and was really happy that his grandson was okay.
