Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she found a shiny rock and picked it up. "Look, Mama!" she said, holding the rock up for her mother to see.
Her mother smiled and said, "That's a pretty image, Lily. Be careful not to drop it." Lily nodded and held the rock tightly in her hand.
As she continued to walk, she saw a butterfly fluttering nearby. "Hello, butterfly! Do you want to see my rock?" she asked. The butterfly didn't answer, but Lily didn't mind. She was happy just to have a new friend to talk to.
Suddenly, Lily tripped and the rock slipped from her hand. It fell to the ground and shattered into pieces. Lily's eyes filled with tears as she looked at the broken pieces of her special rock. "It's okay, Lily," her mother said, comforting her. "We can find another pretty image for you to keep."
