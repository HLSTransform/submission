Anna liked to make jam sandwiches. She had a big jar of red jam and a knife. She took two slices of bread and put them on a plate. She opened the jar and dipped the knife in the jam. She spread the jam on one slice of bread. She liked to spread it thick and even. She put the other slice of bread on top and cut the sandwich in half.
She picked up one half and took a big bite. She smiled and licked her lips. The jam was sweet and sticky. She held the sandwich in her hand and looked at her thumb. Her thumb was chubby and had a band-aid on it. She had hurt her thumb yesterday when she played with her blocks. She had dropped a block on her thumb and it had made a cut. It had hurt a lot and she had cried. Mommy had washed her thumb and put a band-aid on it. She had given her a hug and a kiss and told her it would get better soon.
Anna touched her thumb gently and felt the band-aid. She thought it looked funny. She wondered what her thumb looked like under the band-aid. She was curious. She peeled off the band-aid and looked at her thumb. She saw a small scab where the cut had been. It was brown and dry. She touched it with her finger and felt it was hard. She thought it looked cool. She showed her thumb to her teddy bear and said, "Look, teddy, my thumb is healing. It is not bleeding anymore. It is strong and brave like me." She put the band-aid back on her thumb and took another bite of her sandwich. She was happy.
