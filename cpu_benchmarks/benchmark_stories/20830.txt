Once upon a time there was a kid called Tom. Tom was three and he loved to clean. Every morning he would clean his room and every night he would clean his toys. Tom thought that cleaning was fun! 
One day Tom tried to clean his secret hiding place, his secret was so special he kept it all to himself. He tried his best to clean it but could not move the messy stuff out. He pushed and he pulled, but nothing worked. He got so mad he started screaming and throwing things. 
Tom's mother heard the noise and came to see what had happened. She was very angry and scolded Tom for being so crazy. She told him it was not ok to make such a mess. Tom was so embarrassed and tried to hide his secret. 
His mother was not happy and told Tom she was very disappointed in him. She said it was time for him to learn that cleaning was important. From that day forward, Tom was very careful to keep his room clean and to always hide his secrets. The bad ending was that Tom was sad and no longer thought cleaning was so fun.
