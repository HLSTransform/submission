Once there was a poor little girl. Her name was Anna. Anna did not have any friends or toys. One day, she decided to look inside her closet. To her surprise, there was a talking book in the closet!
Anna: "Hello. Who are you? Are you my friend?" 
The book said "Hello. I am a book. I know lots of things. I can teach you things if you want."
Anna was excited. She asked the book "Can you teach me something?"
The book said: "Yes, I can teach you something very important. No matter how poor you are, you should always learn something new. That is how you become rich in knowledge."
Anna thanked the talking book, and soon she took lessons from it every day. She learned about the world and about nature, about science and about people. As time went by, Anna became more knowledgeable. 
The moral of the story is that knowledge is worth more than money. Learning is the key to gaining knowledge, and knowledge brings happiness and success!
