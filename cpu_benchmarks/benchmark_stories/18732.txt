Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with dough and make different shapes. One day, she made a big ball of dough and tried to roll it out, but it was too stubborn and wouldn't listen to her. 
Lily tried to turn the dough around and around, but it still wouldn't listen. She was getting frustrated and about to give up when her mom came in and saw what was happening. 
Her mom smiled and said, "Let me help you, Lily." She gently turned the dough and kneaded it until it was soft and easy to work with. Together, they made lots of fun shapes and had a great time. From then on, whenever Lily had trouble with her dough, she knew to ask for help instead of getting frustrated.
