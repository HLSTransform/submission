One day, a fat man was walking by the side of the road. He saw lots of traffic happening. There were lots of cars, buses, and trucks all going past him very quickly. The fat man was scared, so he jumped off the road and into the bushes.
He stayed in the bushes for a while, but then he started to get very hot. He could see an ice cream truck in the traffic, so he decided to get up and walk over to it.
The fat man was very happy when he got to the ice cream truck. He got a huge ice cream cone and started to eat it. He was so happy that he started to dance around in the traffic!
The traffic had to slow down to let him through, but the drivers were too busy watching the fat man to worry about it. Soon, the fat man finished his ice cream and walked away very happily. The traffic started happening again, and everyone was still smiling from watching the fat man.
