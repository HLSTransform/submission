Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy car that he loved to play with every day. One night, he went to bed and started to dream about his toy car. In his dream, he was driving his car on a bumpy road and having so much fun.
But then, Tim woke up and realized it was just a dream. He got sad because he wanted to play with his toy car again. However, his mom told him not to be harsh on himself and that he could play with his toy car when he woke up. Tim smiled and went back to sleep, dreaming about all the fun he would have with his toy car in the morning.
