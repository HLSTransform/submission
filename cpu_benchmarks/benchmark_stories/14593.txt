Once upon a time, there was a little bird who loved to fly. One day the skies were grey and dark and the little bird saw that there were heavy raindrops falling. The rain kept on and on and soon it began to flood. The little bird was scared and it didn't know what to do.
Just then the softest breeze blew by and the little bird felt more brave. It flapped its wings and flew up as high as it could. It flew above the flood and was safe from the water. The little bird stayed in the air for a long time, until it was time for the sun to come out.
When the sun shone down, the little bird could finally fly back home. It flew over the hills and valleys and was so happy to be outdoors again! The little bird fluttered around the sky, free and happy, and all the birds sang together, celebrating the sun and the blue skies. The little bird was so happy and content that it had flown away from the flood.
