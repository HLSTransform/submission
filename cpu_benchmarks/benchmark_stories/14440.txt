Once there was a little girl named Sarah. Every day, Sarah would try to delay going to bed. She didn't want to miss any of the fun!
One day, her mom advised her to take a nap. The wise mom knew a nap would help Sarah feel better. Sarah reluctantly agreed, so she snuggled into bed and fell asleep quickly.
When Sarah woke up, she felt energised and excited! She was sad that she had delayed her nap, because it had made her feel much better.
From then on, she took a nap every day. She knew the wise thing to do was to listen to her mom!
