Once upon a time there was a little girl named Bess. Bess was spoiled by her mom and dad.
One day, Bess's mom began to sew a pretty dress for her. She threaded the needle with lots of care, so the dress would be perfect. Bess watched in awe as her mom worked.
When the dress was finally finished, Bess was so excited. She couldn't wait to put it on and show it off. When her mom put the dress on her, Bess twirled and smiled, feeling so special.
Arms outstretched, Bess laughed and said, "I love my dress. Thank you for caring so much, Mommy". Her mom hugged her tight, happy to have made a dress that brought so much joy.
