Once upon a time, there was a wise old car. The car had a big job to do. It had to supply the town with lots of yummy treats. The car was happy to help out. 
Every day, the car would drive around the town. It would stop at all the shops and give them what they needed. The car was very good at its job. 
One day, the car got a flat tire. It couldn't supply the town anymore. The people were sad because they couldn't get their treats. But then, some kind people helped fix the car's tire. The car was very grateful and happy to be able to supply the town again. 
From then on, the car made sure to check its tires every day. It wanted to make sure it could always do its job and supply the town with treats. The end.
