Lily and Ben are friends who like to play with toys. One day, they find a microscope in the attic. It is a big tool that makes small things look big.
"Wow, what is this?" Lily says. She puts her eye on the microscope and sees a tiny bug.
"It is a microscope," Ben says. He knows a lot about tools and bugs. "It can show you things you cannot see with your eyes."
Lily is amazed. She wants to see more bugs. She looks for a jar with some dirt and leaves.
"Can I use the microscope too?" Ben says. He is curious and wants to take turns.
"No, it is mine," Lily says. She is selfish and does not want to share. "You are ignorant. You do not know anything about bugs."
Ben is hurt and angry. He is not ignorant. He knows many facts about bugs. He thinks Lily is rude and mean.
"That is not true," Ben says. He tries to grab the microscope from Lily. "You are ignorant. You do not know how to use the microscope."
Lily and Ben start to fight. They pull and push the microscope. They do not listen to each other. They do not care about the bugs.
The microscope falls to the floor. It breaks into pieces. The jar with the dirt and leaves spills over. The bugs crawl away.
Lily and Ben stop fighting. They look at the mess. They feel sad and sorry.
They realize they were both ignorant. They did not know how to be good friends. They did not know how to respect the microscope and the bugs.
They say sorry to each other. They hug and make up. They decide to clean up the mess and find a new toy to play with. They learn to share and be kind. They are not ignorant anymore.
