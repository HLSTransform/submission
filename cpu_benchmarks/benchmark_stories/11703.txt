Once there was a girl called Nell. She loved to help her mom and dad around the house.
One day, Nell saw her dad wearing a big, bright belt. Nell asked her dad why he was wearing it. He told her that it held up his trousers and kept them nice and neat. She thought it was a very clever idea.
Nell saw that her mom was having a hard time carrying all her groceries in her arms. Nell wanted to help her mom and knew just what to do. She ran to her bedroom and found an even bigger, brighter belt. Then she ran back to her mom and helped her lift up the bags with the belt.
At the end of the day, Nell was very proud of herself for helping her family. She had learnt a lesson that day - with a bit of thought, you can find clever ways to help others.
