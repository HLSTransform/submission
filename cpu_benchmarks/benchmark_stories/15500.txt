John and his family had a very fun event. It was a creative event and they used lots of fun things. They used balloons, paint and paper. Everyone had so much fun. 
John used the paint to make a big picture. He was very creative and excited. He painted a big sun in the sky and little flowers. He used the paper to make a funny hat. He put it on and it made everyone laugh. 
They used the balloons to make a game. They played tag with the balloons. Everyone ran around the house trying to catch them. It was the funniest thing! 
John had so much fun. He loved his special event and thought it was very creative. It was definitely an event to remember!
