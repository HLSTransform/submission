John was playing in the park with his mom. He saw a good elephant and he smiled. He asked his mom if he could ride it. But she told him no. He cried a little and his mom felt bad. She said sorry to John and gave him a big hug. 
John felt better, but he regretted not being able to ride the elephant. He wanted to have a good time with it. A few days later, his mom took him back to the park. When they arrived, John smiled when he saw the elephant. He asked his mom if he could ride it and this time, she said yes! 
John asked to go on the elephant's back and his mom helped him up. He was so happy and he smiled and laughed while the elephant walked around the park. John had a great time and his mom was so glad he got to experience a good adventure. He never regretted not riding the elephant before.
