Lily liked to create things with her cord. She had a long cord that was smooth and soft. She could make shapes and letters with it. She could also tie it to other things, like her toys or her chair.
One day, she wanted to create a surprise for her mom. She took her cord and went to her room. She looked around and saw her teddy bear, her doll, and her blocks. She had an idea. She tied one end of the cord to her teddy bear's arm. Then she tied the other end to her doll's leg. She made a loop with the cord and put it around her block. She smiled. She had created a train.
She ran to the living room, where her mom was reading a book. She pulled her cord and her train followed her. "Mom, mom, look what I created!" she said. "It's a train!"
Her mom looked up and saw her cord train. She smiled too. She was proud of Lily. "Wow, Lily, that's amazing!" she said. "You are very creative. How did you make it?"
Lily explained how she used her cord and her toys. She showed her mom how the cord was smooth and easy to tie. She asked her mom if she wanted to play with her train.
Her mom put down her book and hugged Lily. "Of course I do," she said. "I love your train. And I love you." They played with the cord train for a long time. They had fun. Lily was happy. She liked to create things with her cord.
