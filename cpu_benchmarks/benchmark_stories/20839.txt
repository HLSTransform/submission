Mum put the bucket on the floor and told Gella not to be scared. Gella knew that something was inside the bucket, but she was scared. It was dark and it was making strange sounds. 
Mum put her hand in the bucket and got something out. Gella was even more scared when she saw the big creature with scales, big eyes and a big tail. She screamed and started to cry. 
Mum told Gella it was okay and that the creature was called a fish. She said fish were nice and not scary. To prove it, mum put her hand in the bucket again so Gella could see the fish swimming around. Gella stopped being scared and laughed as the fish swam around the bucket.
