Once upon a time, there was a chubby little bear named Benny. Benny lived in a big forest with his animal friends. One day, Benny's friend, a kind rabbit named Rosie, wanted to introduce him to a new game. 
Rosie took Benny to a big board with many colorful pictures on it. She showed him how to play the game and Benny was very happy to learn something new. 
From that day on, Benny and Rosie played the game on the board every day. Benny loved spending time with Rosie and his other animal friends. He was grateful that Rosie had introduced him to the fun game on the board.
