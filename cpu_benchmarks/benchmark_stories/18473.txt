Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she saw a swing and wanted to try it. She sat on the swing and her daddy pushed her gently. She went up and down, up and down, and it made her very happy.
After playing on the swing, Lily went back to her house to draw. She took out her pencil and a piece of paper. She drew a beautiful picture of a flower. She showed it to her mommy, who said it was very pretty.
For dinner, Lily's mommy made spaghetti. It was so delicious that Lily ate it all up. She even asked for seconds! After dinner, Lily went to bed, tired from a fun day of swinging, drawing, and eating yummy food.
