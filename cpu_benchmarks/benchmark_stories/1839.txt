Once upon a time a mommy was feeling very nervous. She was getting ready to mix something really special. She was going to mix together the ingredients to make her very own baby!
The mommy took out all the things she needed: flour, eggs and milk. She carefully stirred everything together, making sure not too much of one thing was added.
After a few minutes of stirring, the mommy had finished mixing her special ingredients. Now she just had to wait and see what would happen!
The mommy waited and waited. After a few days, she had a special surprise. It was a tiny baby, crying and cooing! The mommy was so happy, she couldn't believe her eyes!
The mommy cradled her tiny baby in her arms and whispered “I love you!” She was no longer feeling nervous, she was feeling very, very happy!
