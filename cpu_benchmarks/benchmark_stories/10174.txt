Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play hide and seek with her friends. One day, she found a door that was very tight and hard to open. She tried and tried but couldn't open it.
Lily had an idea. She decided to reverse the door and push it instead of pulling it. And guess what? The door opened! Lily was so happy that she could finally explore what was on the other side.
As she walked through the door, she saw a big, beautiful garden with lots of colorful flowers. She played there for hours with her friends, and they had so much fun.
From that day on, whenever Lily saw a door that was tight, she remembered to reverse it and push instead of pull. She knew that there might be something amazing waiting for her on the other side.
