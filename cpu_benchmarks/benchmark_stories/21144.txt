Once upon a time there was a gifted child called Matt. He was very talented and always loved to try out new things.
One day, on his way home from school Matt saw a beautiful pattern sewn on a fabric shop window. He loved it and so decided to go in and buy it for his mom as a surprise.
But when Matt went up to the fabric shop owner to make his purchase, the shop owner told Matt he could not have the pattern. She explained that she had worked very hard on the pattern and she did not want it to be spoiled.
Matt was very sad but understood the shop owners decision. He thanked her and said goodbye, leaving the shop with a valuable lesson: Whatever we have worked hard for, should be appreciated and not spoiled.
