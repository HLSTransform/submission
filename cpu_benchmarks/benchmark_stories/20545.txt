Once upon a time, there was a blue bird who loved to sit in the rain. Every day, he would fly to a big tree and sit there all day long. He loved watching the rain fall from the sky and feeling the cool droplets on his feathers.
One day, while he was sitting in the tree, the rain started to come down faster and harder. He watched in amazement as the rain kept coming. Soon, he was completely soaked!
But the blue bird didn't mind. He just kept sitting there, enjoying the feeling of the rain fall all around him. He was having so much fun, he almost forgot to fly back home before it got dark. 
Finally, the rain stopped and the blue bird flew off and went home. He had so much fun singing and playing in the rain and he can't wait to come back and do it again tomorrow.
