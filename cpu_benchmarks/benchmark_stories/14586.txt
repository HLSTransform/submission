John was very proud. He was so proud that his family had given him a special book - a book just for him. He held it close and opened it up. Inside was a story about a penguin. "Wow!" said John. He wanted to read it right away.
John read the story out loud. He read about the very proud penguin who swam in the icy water. He read about the penguin's bumpy feathers and his big orange feet. He loved the story so much.
At the end of the story, John was even more proud. He was proud that he had read the story all by himself. He put his book away and hugged his mom tightly. He would never forget the story about the proud penguin.
