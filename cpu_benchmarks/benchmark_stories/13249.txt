Once upon a time, there was a kind lady. She worked very hard every day. Every day she made sure to open her mail. One day, her mail had a surprise - it was a special letter.
The letter had a special message. It said that if the kind lady was kind to others, she would gain something important. The kind lady thought about the message and decided to be even more kind.
For the next few days, the kind lady was very kind to everyone she met. She smiled at them and helped with their chores. She was so kind that people started to take notice.
Finally, the kind lady was rewarded for her kindness. She gained a very special prize. Everyone said how nice it was that the kind lady was so kind and gained a wonderful prize. 
The kind lady was happy she had followed the message in her mail, and from then on she was even nicer to everyone she met.
The end.
