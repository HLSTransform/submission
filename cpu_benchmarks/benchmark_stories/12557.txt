Lily was nervous. She had to do something new today. She had to go to school. She did not know the school or the teacher or the other kids. She wanted to stay home with Mom and Dad and play with her toys.
Mom and Dad took Lily to the school. They walked with her to the classroom. They saw the teacher. She was smiling and friendly. She said, "Hello, Lily. I'm Miss Lee. I'm your teacher. Welcome to school. You will have fun here. You will learn and play and make friends."
Lily looked at the teacher. She looked at the classroom. She saw many things. She saw books and crayons and puzzles and blocks. She saw a big rug and a small table and some chairs. She saw some kids. They were sitting on the rug. They were listening to a story. Some of them looked at Lily. They smiled and waved.
Mom and Dad said, "Lily, this is your school. This is your teacher. These are your classmates. They are nice. They want to play with you. You will like school. We will come back later to pick you up. We love you. Have a good day."
Lily felt a little less nervous. She said, "Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. I love you too. I will try school." She gave them a hug and a kiss. She took her backpack and followed the teacher. The teacher said, "Lily, come and join us. We are reading a story about a cat and a mouse. Do you like stories?" Lily nodded. She liked stories. She sat on the rug next to a girl. The girl said, "Hi, Lily. I'm Mia. Do you want to be my friend?" Lily smiled. She said, "Hi, Mia. Yes, I want to be your friend." She felt a little more happy. She listened to the story. She did something new today. She went to school.
