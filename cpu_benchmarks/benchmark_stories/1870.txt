Once upon a time, there was a great pirate who loved to sail the open seas. Everywhere he went, he was big and strong and he was always brave.
One day, the pirate was sailing in a storm when he saw a little boat. Inside the boat was a 3-year-old boy, who was all alone. The pirate said, "Ho, little brave one. Where do you go?"
The little boy replied, "I am sailing to find a great treasure!"
The pirate said, "No! You must turn around and go back home!" But the little boy wouldn't listen.
The pirate got so mad that he slapped the little boy on the bottom. The boy started to cry. 
The pirate felt so bad for what he did. He hugged the little boy and said, "I'm sorry, little brave one. I was only trying to keep you safe."
 
The little boy smiled and said, "It's okay, great pirate. I forgive you." Then he quickly put on his pirate hat, turned his little boat around, and sailed home.
