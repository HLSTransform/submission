Once upon a time there was a prince who lived in a big castle. He wanted to find a special friend. One day he saw a nice little girl. He said, "Hello!" The girl said well and politely. She said, "Hello!" The prince said, "Would you like to be my friend?" The little girl thought for a moment and then said, "Yes, I'd like that!" So the prince and the little girl became friends. 
They had lots of fun together playing tag in the castle garden and telling stories in the dining hall. They also got to visit the castle kitchen and the castle library, where they looked at all the interesting books. 
The prince was very polite and always said please and thank you. He taught the little girl to be polite too. They laughed and played together happily for many days. 
The end.
