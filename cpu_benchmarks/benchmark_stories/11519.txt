Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a boy named Tim. He had a toy police car that he loved very much. Tim would play with his police car every day. One day, a new boy, Ben, came to play with Tim. Ben saw Tim's toy police car and felt jealous. He wanted to play with it too.
"Can I play with your police car, please?" asked Ben. Tim didn't want to share, but he knew it was the right thing to do. So, he said, "Okay, you can play with it for a little bit."
As they played together, Ben accidentally pinched Tim's finger with the toy police car. Tim cried out, "Ouch! That hurt!" Ben quickly said, "I'm sorry, Tim. I didn't mean to pinch you." Tim forgave Ben, and they continued to play.
Soon, Tim's mom called them for a snack. They both went inside and enjoyed some cookies and milk. After their snack, Tim and Ben went back outside to play. This time, they decided to share all their toys and had lots of fun together. In the end, they became good friends and played together every day.
