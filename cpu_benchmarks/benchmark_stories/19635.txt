Once upon a time there was a new statue. The statue was made of shiny stone and stood very tall. People came from far away to see the beautiful statue. The statue was so tall that it reached the sky! 
One day, the wind started to blow. It blew harder and harder. The statue tried to resist the wind but it was too strong. The statue swayed back and forth until it fell down.
Everyone was very sad. They didn't know how to fix the statue. But then a magical bird came and flew around the statue. The bird waited until the wind stopped and used its beak to put the pieces back together.
Once the statue was rebuilt, it was even more beautiful than before. Everyone cheered with joy. And from then on, the statue stood tall and strong, and never had to resist the wind again.
