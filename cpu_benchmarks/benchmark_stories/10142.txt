Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat pears and would clap her hands when she saw them. One day, Lily went to the park to play. She saw a big tree with lots of pears on it. She was so happy and clapped her hands. 
But then, she saw a little boy named Timmy. He looked guilty and was holding a pear in his hand. Lily asked him where he got the pear from, but he didn't answer. Lily felt sad because she knew that the pear belonged to someone else. 
Later that day, Lily saw the owner of the pear looking for it. She told the owner about Timmy and the pear. The owner found Timmy and he felt guilty for taking the pear. He gave it back to the owner and apologized. Lily felt happy because she helped solve the conflict. She clapped her hands and ate a pear.
