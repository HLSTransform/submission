One day there was a cheerful boy named Peter. Peter loved eating lots of different fruits. He especially liked bananas, apples, and oranges. Every day he went to the store to buy some fruit. He liked to include lots of different colours into his fruit basket. 
Peter would find a nice spot in his yard to eat the fruit. His favourite spot was under a big tree. The tree was so tall and gave lots of shade. It was the perfect place to eat fruit and be cheerful. 
Peter loved to eat the fruit so much. He would eat and laugh and the tree would laugh with him. Sometimes he would share his fruit with some of the birds and other animals that would visit him at the tree. 
When Peter was done eating, he would sit still for a minute and take in the nature around him. He was so thankful that he was able to sit and enjoy the fruits of his labour. It made him feel very cheerful.
