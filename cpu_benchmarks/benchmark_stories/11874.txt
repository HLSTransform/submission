Once there was a pig named Peter. He was a very curious pig. One day, he asked his mom if he could go out and explore the huge street near his house. But mom didnâ€™t allow Peter to go alone. Peter was sad, but he still wanted to go out and explore. Finally, his mom said she would let him go if he took his brother with him. 
Peter was so excited! He was able to go out on the huge street. He ran around, looking at all the amazing things. He saw trees, buildings, and even a park. Everything was so big and new.
As Peter was exploring, he saw a giant dog. Peter started to feel scared, but his brother told him it was ok. Peter saw that the dog was friendly and he was very happy. He and his brother walked up to the dog.
Peter was so happy. He had explored the huge street and made a new friend. He thanked his mom for allowing him to explore.
