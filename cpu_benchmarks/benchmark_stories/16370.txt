One day, a little girl named Sue went to the beach with her mom. They wanted to play in the sand and look for shells. Sue was very happy and excited.
As they walked, Sue saw a big black shell. She picked it up and showed it to her mom. "Look, Mom! I found a black shell!" Sue said. Her mom smiled and said, "That's a very special shell, Sue. Let's study it when we get home."
When they got home, Sue and her mom studied the black shell. They found out it was a very rare shell. Sue was so proud of her find. She put the shell on her shelf to remember the fun day at the beach.
