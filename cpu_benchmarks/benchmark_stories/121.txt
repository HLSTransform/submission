Once upon a time, there was a deer named Bambi. Bambi wanted to play with his friends in the forest, but he couldn't find any comfortable clothes to wear. He tried on many clothes, but none of them fit him well. 
Bambi felt sad and worried that he wouldn't be able to play with his friends. Suddenly, he saw a rabbit hopping towards him. The rabbit asked Bambi what was wrong, and Bambi told him about his problem. 
The rabbit had an idea and took Bambi to a nearby store. There, they found a perfect outfit for Bambi that fit him just right. Bambi was so happy and grateful to the rabbit. He put on his new clothes and ran to play with his friends. 
From that day on, Bambi learned that it's important to ask for help when you have a problem and that there's always a solution to every problem.
