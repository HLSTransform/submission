Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her toys, especially her dollies. One day, Lily's mommy told her they were going to a lab. Lily didn't know what a lab was, but it sounded exciting!
When they got to the lab, Lily saw lots of people in white coats and machines that beeped and whirred. Her mommy explained that they were scientists who did experiments to learn new things. Lily thought it was cool, but then she saw a fake mouse on the table. It looked real, but it wasn't! Lily giggled and said, "That mouse is fake!" Her mommy smiled and said, "Yes, it's just pretend." 
Lily had fun watching the scientists work and learned a lot about what they do in the lab. She was excited to tell her friends about her adventure when she got home. From that day on, Lily loved learning about science and all the exciting things that happen in a lab.
