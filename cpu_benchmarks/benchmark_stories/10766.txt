Once upon a time, there was a painter named Tom. Tom liked to paint easy pictures of cats and dogs. He had many colors to paint with. His favorite colors were red, blue, and yellow.
One day, Tom wanted to play a game. He decided to hide his paints and find them later. He hid his red paint behind a big chair, his blue paint under his bed, and his yellow paint in a box. Then, Tom went to eat his lunch.
After lunch, Tom wanted to find his paints again. He looked behind the big chair and found the red paint. He looked under his bed and found the blue paint. But he could not find the yellow paint. Tom looked and looked, but it was not easy to find. Finally, he found the yellow paint in the box. Tom was happy and started to paint a big, easy picture of a yellow cat.
