Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and build things with her blocks. One day, Lily's dad gave her a big box of Legos to play with. Lily was so excited and started building a tall tower.
But then, Lily's little brother came into the room and wanted to play with the Legos too. Lily didn't want to share and was being selfish. Her dad reminded her that it's important to share and play nicely with others.
Later that day, Lily was trying to finish building her tower but it kept falling over. She realized she needed to fold the pieces together more carefully. Her dad also showed her how to use a screw to hold the pieces together. Lily was so happy when her tower finally stood tall and strong. She learned that it's important to be patient and ask for help when she needs it.
