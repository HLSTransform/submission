Ben and Mia like to play with their toy rockets. They pretend they are space explorers and zoom around the room. They make loud noises and laugh a lot.
One day, they find a big ball in the closet. It has many colors and shapes on it. Ben says, "Look, Mia, this is a planet. Let's zoom to it and see what it has."
They put the ball on the floor and zoom their rockets to it. They touch the ball and feel its bumps and lines. They see blue, green, brown, white, and yellow parts. Mia says, "This planet is very pretty. I wonder what lives here."
Ben says, "Maybe there are animals or plants or people. Let's zoom closer and find out." He picks up his rocket and tries to fit it on the ball. But the rocket is too big and falls off. He tries again and again, but it does not work.
Mia says, "Ben, your rocket is too big for this planet. You need a smaller one. Here, take mine. It is smaller and can fit on the ball." She gives him her rocket and he tries it. It fits on the ball and stays there.
Ben says, "Thank you, Mia. You are very nice. Your rocket is perfect for this planet. Let's zoom together and explore it." They zoom their rockets on the ball and pretend they see different things. They have fun and learn new words. They are happy space explorers.
