Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a house with her Mommy and Daddy. One day, her Mommy and Daddy said that they would change the ceiling in their house. The little girl didn't know what that meant, but she asked them anyway.
Mommy said "We need to put something new up on the ceiling because it will look nicer". The little girl thought it sounded exciting!
The next day, the little girl's Daddy got to work. He put up a strange, uncomfortable ceiling that didn't match the walls. The little girl felt so confused and sad because she didn't understand why it had to change.
When Daddy was finished, the little girl asked why he put up the uncomfortable ceiling. Her Daddy just said "That's just the way it has to be". 
The little girl felt so sad and frustrated that she couldn't change the ceiling back. No matter how much she asked, the ceiling stayed the same. It made her feel uncomfortable and angry that something in her house could change without her permission.
The little girl was never able to change the ceiling back to the way it was before. And that's why she never felt quite as comfortable in her house again.
