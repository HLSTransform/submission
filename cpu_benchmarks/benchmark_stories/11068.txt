Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big kangaroo near the fence. The kangaroo had a baby in her pouch. Lily and Ben wanted to see the baby, so they ran to the fence.
"Hello, kangaroo!" Lily said. "Can we see your baby?"
The kangaroo looked at them and made a loud noise. She did not like strangers near her baby. She kicked the fence with her strong legs. Lily and Ben were scared, but they did not go away.
"Come on, Ben, don't be afraid," Lily said. "We just want to say hi. Maybe the kangaroo will let us touch her baby."
Lily tried to encourage Ben, but Ben was not sure. He thought the kangaroo was angry and dangerous. He wanted to go back to the swings.
"Lily, let's go," Ben said. "The kangaroo does not want us here. She might hurt us."
But Lily was impatient. She did not listen to Ben. She climbed over the fence and walked to the kangaroo. She reached out her hand to touch the baby.
"Look, Ben, she is so cute!" Lily said.
But the kangaroo did not like Lily touching her baby. She felt Lily was a threat. She turned around and kicked Lily hard. Lily fell to the ground and cried. She was hurt and bleeding.
Ben was shocked and scared. He ran to Lily and tried to help her. He called for help. The kangaroo ran away with her baby.
Lily and Ben learned a hard lesson. They should not bother animals that do not want to be bothered. They should listen to their friends and be careful. They should not be impatient and do things that are not safe.
