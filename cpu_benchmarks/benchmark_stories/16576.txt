Sara and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to make noises and pretend they were animals. Sara was a lion and Ben was a monkey. They roared and chattered and jumped around.
But then Sara saw something shiny on the table. It was a glass of water that Mom had left there. Sara wanted to drink some water. She climbed on the couch and reached for the glass. But she was not careful and she knocked the glass over. The water spilled on the floor and the glass broke into pieces.
"Oh no!" Sara cried. "I broke the glass! Mom will be mad!"
Ben heard Sara and ran to see what happened. He saw the water and the glass and he was worried. He did not want Sara or Mom to get hurt by the glass.
"Sara, don't touch the glass!" Ben said. "It can cut you! We have to tell Mom!"
Sara was scared and sorry. She did not mean to break the glass. She wanted to fix it, but she did not know how. She nodded at Ben and they ran to find Mom.
"Mom, Mom!" they shouted. "We have a problem!"
Mom was in the kitchen. She heard the children and came to the living room. She saw the mess and she was worried too. She asked them what happened.
"Sara broke the glass," Ben said. "She wanted water, but she was not careful. We are sorry, Mom."
Mom hugged the children and told them it was okay. She was glad they were not hurt. She told them to stay away from the glass and she got a broom and a cloth. She cleaned up the water and the glass and threw them away.
"Next time, if you want water, ask me first," Mom said. "And be careful with the glass. It can break and hurt you."
Sara and Ben said they understood. They said they were sorry again and they thanked Mom. They gave her a kiss and a hug. Then they went back to playing with their toys. They decided to be quiet animals and not make a mess. They did not want to break anything else. They wanted Mom to be happy. The end.
