Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved exploring. The girl was always looking for new places to play.
One day the girl was walking in the forest, when she saw something strange. It looked like a triangle. She moved closer, and then saw that it was an animal's nest. 
The girl knew that she shouldn't disturb the nest, but she felt curious. She slowly touched it and was very surprised when she felt movement!
The little girl screamed, it was uncomfortable and she didn't like it. The animal was waking up. The girl quickly ran away and never came back to the nest again.
