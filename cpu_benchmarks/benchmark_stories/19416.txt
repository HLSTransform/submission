Little Kate and her family were out for a picnic. Everyone was very excited. Kate liked to observe the world around her.
She watched a family of birds. The parents were building a nest and the babies were happy and jumping around. That made Kate smile.
Kate looked around and saw lots of other families. One family had a lot of children, while another family had two children. Each family was flexible and did different things.
Kate looked back at her own family. Her parents hugged each other and her brother giggled. She smiled at the sight and knew that her family was special.
