Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the store with her mom. While they were there, Lily saw a big box of plastic toys. She wanted one so badly, but her mom said they couldn't afford it.
Lily was sad and miserable. She really wanted a toy. But then, a nice lady came up to her and said, "Excuse me, little girl. Do you want to play a game with me?"
Lily nodded her head excitedly. The lady said, "I'm going to hide a number somewhere in the store. If you can find it, I'll give you a surprise." Lily searched and searched, and finally found the number on a shelf next to the plastic toys. The nice lady gave her a toy as a prize. Lily was so happy and grateful. She learned that sometimes, good things can come from unexpected places.
