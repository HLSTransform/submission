Once upon a time there lived an adorable little spider called Steve. One day Steve was walking in the garden and saw something exciting. He decided to take a closer look.
Steve got closer and saw a big rock. He started to rub the rock with his tiny little legs. Suddenly, the rock started to move. 
Steve was so surprised that he jumped back. He saw something emerge from underneath the rock. It was a little rabbit.
The rabbit said, "Hi there! What are you doing?" 
Steve replied, "Hi! I'm just rubbing this rock."
The rabbit said, "Ah, that's nice" and they both went back to rubbing the rock. 
They had so much fun that they both forgot to stop. After a while, Steve realized how late it was and said goodbye to the rabbit and went home.
Steve was so happy that he made a new friend! He knew that this would be an adventure he would never forget.
