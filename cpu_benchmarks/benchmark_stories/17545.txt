Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the garden. One day, they find some grapes on a vine. They pick some grapes and put them in a bowl.
"Let's make wine!" Lily says. She remembers that her mom sometimes drinks wine from a bottle.
"How do we make wine?" Ben asks.
"We have to squish the grapes with our feet!" Lily says. She takes off her shoes and socks and steps into the bowl. She feels the grapes pop and squirt under her toes. She giggles.
"Can I try?" Ben says. He also takes off his shoes and socks and joins Lily in the bowl. They squish and splash and laugh.
They make a lot of juice. They pour the juice into a jar and put a lid on it.
"We have to wait for the wine to be ready," Lily says.
"How long do we have to wait?" Ben asks.
"I don't know. Maybe a long time. Maybe a short time. Maybe never," Lily says.
They put the jar in a sunny spot and go to play with their toys.
They forget about the jar for many days. Then, one day, they see the jar again. It looks different. It has bubbles and foam on top. It smells funny.
"Is this wine?" Lily asks.
"I don't know. Let's try it," Ben says.
They open the jar and take a sip. They make a face. They spit out the juice. It tastes bad. It tastes sour and bitter.
"Yuck! This is not wine! This is vinegar!" Lily says.
"Vinegar?" Ben says.
"Yes, vinegar. That's what you use to make salad," Lily says.
"Salad?" Ben says.
"Yes, salad. You know, with lettuce and tomatoes and cheese," Lily says.
"Oh, salad. I like salad," Ben says.
"Me too. But I don't like vinegar. Let's throw it away," Lily says.
They dump the jar in the trash. They decide to never make wine again.
They go to the kitchen and ask their mom for some juice. They drink the juice and smile.
They think they are very original. They think they are very clever. They think they are very funny.
