Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and catch bugs with his net. One day, Timmy caught a butterfly in his net. He was so happy and felt lucky to have caught such a beautiful butterfly.
As Timmy was holding the net with the butterfly inside, he started to shake it. The butterfly didn't like being shaken and tried to fly away. Timmy realized that he was scaring the butterfly and felt bad. He gently let the butterfly out of the net and watched it fly away.
Timmy learned that sometimes we can be too excited and not realize that we are scaring others. It's important to be kind and gentle, even when we are feeling lucky.
