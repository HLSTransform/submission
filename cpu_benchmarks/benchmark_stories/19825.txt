Once there was an open crocodile. He wanted to go on a walk. He looked around for something to help him, and he found a piece of rope. He tied one end of the rope round his neck, then he tied the other end of the rope to a tree.
Now the crocodile had his walk all tied up. He started to explore the forest and he saw lots of interesting things. He saw a bee buzzing around a flower, and a butterfly fluttering from branch to branch. He even saw a squirrel sitting in a tree.
The crocodile had a lovely walk, and when he was done he untied the rope and went back to his home in the river. He had an open mind and felt very happy!
