Mama and Lucy, who was three years old, were on a long journey to visit Grandma. Lucy was so excited to see her but the long train ride was hard. She was very tired and kept stumbling in the aisle.
Finally, they arrived at their stop, grabbed their luggage and got off the train. As Lucy and Mama stepped onto the platform, a terrible sound erupted from a distance and it kept getting louder.
Mama said, "Quick, let's go, Lucy. Stay close to me." Lucy listened to Mama and the two of them started quickly walking to the other end of the station.
Suddenly, Lucy stumbled and her luggage dropped to the ground. Mama quickly reached down, picked up the luggage, and said, "Come on, Lucy. We need to hurry!"
The two of them quickly ran across the station. When they looked back, they saw a big and scary truck with flashing lights and firemen. Mama said, "Whew! That was a close one!"
They hugged each other tight. Lucy had been so scared, but finally, they were on their way to Grandma's.
