Once there was a lovely little crab. Every day he went down to the beach and looked for food. He found lots of tasty treats and was very happy.
One day, he saw a little fish chasing a big fish. He was so surprised, he almost forgot about eating. He watched them swimming around together and realized it was a game.
The crab started to play with the two fish, swimming back and forth like them. It was so much fun! He didn't even realize that the sun was setting.
When the moon came out, he realized it was time to go home. As he walked on the sand, he felt happy knowing that he'd had a lovely day at the beach.
