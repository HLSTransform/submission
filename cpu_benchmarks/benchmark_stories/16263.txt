Once upon a time, there was a little bunny who was very persistent. Every day, she would go to the carrot patch and try to get a carrot for herself. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't reach them.
One day, she tried something new. She started to spray the carrot patch with water. The water made it easier for her to grab the carrots, so she was able to get all the carrots she wanted.
The next morning, she went back to the carrot patch and to her surprise, there were a lot of carrots!
She smiled and said, "It worked! I must be very persistent!"
The little bunny was so happy that she could finally get her own carrots and she never stopped being persistent!
