Mia and Leo were walking in the woods with their dad. They saw many trees and animals, but they were hungry and tired. They wanted to go back home and have some snacks.
"Dad, can we go home now?" Mia asked. "My tummy is empty and my feet hurt."
"Me too, dad," Leo said. "I don't like the woods. It's boring and scary."
Dad smiled and said, "Don't complain, my little ones. The woods are beautiful and fun. Look, there's a raven on that branch. Do you know what a raven is?"
Mia and Leo looked up and saw a big black bird with shiny feathers. It was making loud noises with its beak.
"A raven is a bird that likes to talk," Dad said. "Sometimes it can copy what people say. Do you want to try to talk to it?"
Mia and Leo nodded. They wanted to see if the raven would answer them.
"Hello, raven," Mia said.
"Hello, raven," the raven said.
"Wow, it can talk!" Leo said.
"Wow, it can talk!" the raven said.
Mia and Leo laughed. They thought the raven was funny and clever.
"Are you hungry, raven?" Mia asked.
"Are you hungry, raven?" the raven asked.
"Yes, we are hungry," Leo said.
"Yes, we are hungry," the raven said.
"Then you should eat some nuts and berries," Dad said. "They are good for you and the raven. Look, there are some over there."
Dad pointed to a bush with red and blue fruits. Mia and Leo ran to the bush and picked some nuts and berries. They shared them with the raven, who ate them happily.
"Thank you, raven," Mia said.
"Thank you, raven," the raven said.
"You're welcome, raven," Leo said.
"You're welcome, raven," the raven said.
Mia and Leo smiled. They were not hungry and tired anymore. They liked the woods and the raven. They decided to stop complaining and enjoy their adventure.
