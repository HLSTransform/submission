Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw pictures of flowers and trees on her paper. One day, she wanted to print her drawings so she asked her mommy for help. 
Her mommy showed her how to put the paper in the printer and press the button. The printer made a loud noise and printed the picture. Lily was so happy to see her drawing on the paper. 
Later that day, Lily was playing with her toys and accidentally stepped on a needle. It hurt her foot and made her cry. Her mommy quickly took the needle out and put a band-aid on it. Lily learned to be careful around sharp objects like needles. 
As the day went on, the weather outside became harsh. The wind was blowing and the rain was pouring down. Lily and her family stayed inside and played games together. They were happy to be safe and warm inside their home.
