Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play pretend with her toys. One day, she pretended to be a doctor and her teddy bear was her patient. She gave him a check-up and found out he was sick. 
Lily was worried about her teddy bear, but she knew it was important to take care of him. She gave him medicine and lots of cuddles. The result was that her teddy bear felt much better! 
From that day on, Lily knew that pretending to be a doctor was an important job because it helped her teddy bear feel better. She continued to play pretend and help her toys whenever they needed it.
