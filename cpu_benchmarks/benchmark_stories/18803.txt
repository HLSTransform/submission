Lily and Sam were playing in the park. They saw a big truck with a lot of boxes. The truck driver was talking into a microphone. He said, "Hello, this is Tom. I have a delivery for the zoo. Do you copy?"
Lily and Sam were curious. They wanted to know what was in the boxes. They ran to the truck and climbed on the back. They saw a microphone hanging from the ceiling. Sam grabbed it and said, "Hello, this is Sam. We are in the truck. What is in the boxes?"
The truck driver heard Sam's voice. He was surprised and angry. He said, "Who is this? Get off the truck now! This is not a toy!"
Lily and Sam were scared. They dropped the microphone and jumped off the truck. The microphone was heavy and it made a loud noise when it hit the floor. The truck driver saw them and shouted, "Hey, you kids! Come here!"
Lily and Sam ran away as fast as they could. They did not reply. They did not want to get in trouble. They learned that they should not touch things that do not belong to them. They decided to play with their own toys instead.
