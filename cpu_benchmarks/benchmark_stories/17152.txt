Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to eat pasta with her family. Her favorite pasta was the long spaghetti. She always admired how the spaghetti could twirl around her fork.
One day, Lucy's family decided to go on a picnic. They packed a lot of food, including pasta. Lucy was so excited to eat her favorite spaghetti. As they were setting up the picnic, Lucy saw a long, winding path in the woods. She asked her dad if they could go for a walk after eating pasta.
After eating their delicious pasta, Lucy and her family went for a walk in the woods. As they were walking, Lucy saw a beautiful butterfly. She followed the butterfly and found a big, beautiful garden full of flowers. Lucy admired the beauty of the garden and felt very happy. She realized that sometimes, the best things come after enjoying a good pasta meal.
