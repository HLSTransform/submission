Once upon a time, there was a young girl called Alice. She loved swimming in the sea. One day, she decided to go swimming and found a very special mask. It was a wild mask, made from shells and brightly coloured sea stones.
As she looked at the mask, Alice became excited. She asked her mother if she could use it. Her mother nodded and said, "Yes, of course you can!"
Alice put on the mask and went swimming. It was so wonderful! She could see a lot of bright and colourful fish. She swam and swam. She dove deeper and deeper until she had swam right across the sea.
When she come out of the water, she was beaming! She remembered all the wild creatures she had seen and the exciting places she had been. She told her mother all about her adventures and showed her the mask.
Her mother smiled and said, "That's what makes the sea so special - we never know what can happen!"
