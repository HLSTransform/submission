Once upon a time there was a curious little boy. He wanted to explore the world, so he went for a walk one day. As he went, he saw a strange chamber. It seemed mysterious and exciting!
The little boy walked inside the chamber, and noticed that it was very warm inside. He felt cozy and he liked it. Suddenly, he heard a noise coming from the back of the chamber. It seemed like someone was talking! 
The little boy walked towards the sound and saw a tall bunny. The bunny saw him and asked, "Hey there! What do you think of my chamber?" 
The little boy thought for a moment and then said, "It seems very warm and cozy. I like it a lot!" 
The bunny smiled and said, "That's great! You can stay and explore as much as you want! I'm sure you will learn lots of things here." 
The little boy thanked the bunny and explored the chamber. He was so happy to discover such a warm and wonderful place.
