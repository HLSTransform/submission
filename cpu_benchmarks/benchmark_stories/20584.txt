Once upon a time, there was a wild turkey. He got up one morning and wanted to find something to eat. So he started to wander around and look for food.
He soon came to a big field and saw a farmer. The farmer was carrying a basket and it looked like there was food in it. The turkey was so excited and wanted to get the food.
He carefully walked up to the farmer and asked if he could have some food. The farmer was very kind and gave the turkey some food from his basket. The turkey was so happy and he ate all the yummy food.
He continued wandering around and found more food, so he enjoyed his day. He was very thankful he got to eat lots of yummy food that was given to him by the wild turkey.
