Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Suzy. She was three years old, and always curious about the world. Today, she had a playdate with her friend, Sarah. Sarah and Suzy had a lot of fun running around in Suzy's backyard and playing pretend.
After their playdate, Suzy realized that she felt a little bit funny in her chest. Almost like when she got a cold. She asked her mom if she could go to the doctor. Her mom said yes and took her to the doctor.
The doctor checked her lungs and listened closely. Then the doctor said that her lungs sounded a little bit different than normal. Suzy was scared and asked what that meant. 
The doctor said she needed to take some medicine and close in her house to make sure that she felt better. Suzy didn't like the idea of staying inside, but she also knew it was important to feel better. So Suzy agreed and her mom made sure she took her medicine every day. 
In a few days, Suzy could feel that her lungs were getting back to normal. She had followed the doctor's instructions and it worked.
The end.
