Once there was a little bunny who wanted to play outside, so he hopped to the clearing in the woods. The bunny saw two trees; one was tall, and the other had lush green leaves that shaded the ground. The tall tree was full of blistering sunlight while the other tree supplied shade.
The bunny enjoyed the shade because it kept him cool, so he asked the tall tree why it couldn't provide any shade. The tall tree responded, “I don’t have any leaves to give like the other tree.”
The other tree said, “I have the leaves to supply shade and help you stay cool. That's why I have them.”
The little bunny understood the lessons of the two trees; that it is important to give of oneself to help others. The bunny also learned that being generous and giving something of yourself can provide comfort to others. The bunny smiled as he hopped away, and the two trees stood tall in their gray bark.
