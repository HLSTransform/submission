Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a famous cat named Kitty. Kitty had a magic sneeze. Every time Kitty sneezed, something fun would happen. All the kids in the town loved Kitty and her magic sneeze.
One day, Kitty met a dog named Buddy. Buddy said, "Hi Kitty, I heard about your magic sneeze. Can you show me?" Kitty said, "Sure, Buddy!" and she sneezed. Suddenly, they were both at the park playing with a big ball. They played all day and had so much fun.
At the end of the day, Kitty sneezed again. But this time, it was a big, big sneeze. The magic sneeze made the big ball turn into a giant cake. The cake was too big for Kitty and Buddy to eat. It was so big that it covered the whole park. The kids in the town were sad because they could not play at the park anymore. And that's how the story of Kitty and her magic sneeze had a bad ending.
