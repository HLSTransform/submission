Once upon a time there was a boy named Tim. He was three years old and very curious. Tim really wanted to find something special, so one day he set out on a search. He looked underneath his bed and his desk, but he still couldn't find what he was looking for. 
So he decided to go outside to have another look. As he walked around his garden, he saw something glinting in the distance. He rushed over to find a soft, shining cell! Tim knew it was something special and he was very happy.
When he got home, he called his friend to show them his new cell. His friend was very impressed and told Tim to always keep his cell safe. And from that day forward, Tim took good care of his special, soft cell.
