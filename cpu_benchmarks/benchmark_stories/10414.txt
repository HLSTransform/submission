Once upon a time there were two friends. One was a gray bird and the other was a little rabbit. The rabbit had a plan. She wanted to make a spear. She hoped to use it to catch some tasty bugs.
So the little rabbit and the gray bird worked together and they made a spear from sticks and rocks. They were so proud!
But then, the gray bird had a bad idea. He decided to use the spear to catch a big, fierce dragon! The rabbit knew it was bad but the bird wouldn't listen.
So, the rabbit and the gray bird flew to the dragon's cave. The dragon was so angry! He shouted and roared and chased the bird and the rabbit away. They were so scared!
But the dragon was too fast. He caught the gray bird, and the little rabbit had to fly away alone. The bad ending wasn't what the rabbit had planned at all.
