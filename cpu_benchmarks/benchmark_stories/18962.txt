Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She had a big box of toys. One day, she found a clean, old book in the box. It was a novel. Amy liked the book very much.
Amy read the novel every day. She took good care of the book. One day, the book got a rip. Amy was sad. Her mom said, "Let's restore the book." They put tape on the rip, and the book was like new again.
Amy learned that when we take care of things, they last a long time. And when something breaks, we can fix it. This made Amy happy. She kept the novel clean and safe.
