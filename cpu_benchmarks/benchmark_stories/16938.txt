Lily wanted to dress up as a fairy for the party. She had a pink dress, a wand and a crown. She was very happy.
But when she got to the party, she saw Max. Max was a big boy who liked to tease. He saw Lily and laughed. "You look silly, Lily! Fairies are not real. You are a baby!"
Lily felt nervous and sad. She did not want to play with Max. She wanted to have peace and fun. She ran to her mom and hugged her.
"Mom, Max is mean. He said I look silly. He said fairies are not real. I don't like him."
Mom smiled and kissed Lily. "Don't worry, Lily. You look beautiful. Fairies are real in your heart. You are not a baby. You are a brave girl. Do you want to go and play with the other kids?"
Lily nodded and smiled. She took her wand and crown and went to the garden. There she saw Anna, Ben and Zoe. They were dressed as a princess, a pirate and a lion. They liked Lily's fairy dress. They invited her to play with them. They had a lot of fun. Lily forgot about Max. She was happy.
