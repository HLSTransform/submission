Once upon a time, there was an ancient elephant. He had big ears and a long trunk. He loved to roam in the forests and make new friends. One day, the ancient elephant couldn't find anything to eat. He was feeling lonely and sad. He needed help.
Luckily, he stumbled upon an old friend who told him about something special he could make. The old friend said that if he found two big sticks and made a shape like an X, he could make something to take with him. 
The ancient elephant followed his friend's advice and soon enough he made something! He had made a basket out of the two sticks. He filled it with fruit and nuts and it kept him full for days. 
The ancient elephant was so pleased with his make that he invited his old friend to join him in the woods. Together they enjoyed the lovely forest and shared the fruit and nuts from the basket. From that day forwards, the ancient elephant was always happy and well fed.
