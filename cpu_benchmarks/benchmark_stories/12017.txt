Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max had a long tail that he loved to wag. One day, Max was running and playing when he hurt his paw. He couldn't manage to walk very well, so he sat down and whimpered. 
Max's friend, a kind cat named Mittens, saw him and knew she had to help. Mittens walked over to Max and gently licked his paw. Max felt better and managed to stand up. 
Mittens and Max played together for the rest of the day, wagging Max's tail and chasing each other around. Max was happy to have a friend who could help him when he was hurt.
