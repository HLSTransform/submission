Once upon a time, there was a wide tree. The tree was very big. A little boy named Tim and his friend, the squirrel, lived near the tree. They liked to play with paint. One day, they wanted to change how the tree looked.
Tim said, "Let's paint the tree!" The squirrel said, "Yes, let's do it!" They found red, blue, and yellow paint. They were very happy. They started to paint the wide tree with big smiles.
But then, it started to rain. The rain washed away all the paint. The tree looked the same as before. Tim and the squirrel were sad. The rain did not stop. The wide tree fell down. The end.
