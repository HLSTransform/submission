Once upon a time there was a tall tree in the woods. The tree shivered and trembled in the wind. There was a mist in the air, making everything feel strange and cool.
The tall tree was scared. It shook and quivered as the mist floated by. The tree wanted to run but it just couldn't. It wished for a friend to help it feel better.
Then one day, a little bird flew down from the sky and landed on the tall tree. The bird was gentle and kind. The tree stopped trembling and felt safe.
The bird sang a beautiful song and the mist slowly disappeared. The bird stayed with the tall tree for a long, long time and the tree was never scared again.
