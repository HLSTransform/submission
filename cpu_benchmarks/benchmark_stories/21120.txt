Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there lived a little bunny named Binky. Binky had many friends, but his best friend was a squirrel named Sammy. They loved to play together and gather nuts and berries for their families.
One sunny day, Binky and Sammy had an idea. "Let's have a big match to see who can gather the most nuts and berries!" said Binky. Sammy agreed, and they both started to gather as fast as they could. They knew that the winner would get a big surprise.
As they gathered, Binky found a big, shiny nut. He thought it would help him win the match. But Sammy was very fast and gathered lots of small nuts and berries. They both worked hard until the sun started to go down.
When it was time to count their nuts and berries, Binky and Sammy were very excited. Binky had the big, shiny nut and some other nuts, while Sammy had lots of small nuts and berries. They counted and counted, and in the end, Sammy had more!
"Good job, Sammy!" said Binky, smiling. "You won the match!" Sammy was very happy, and they both shared the big surprise â€“ a big, yummy cake that their families had made for them. Binky and Sammy learned that working together was more fun than trying to win a match. And they both enjoyed the big, yummy cake as the sun set in the big green forest.
