Once upon a time there was a little boy. He was very curious, so he went exploring. He found a big ship out in the middle of a big lake. The ship was so lonely, just standing in the middle of the lake with no one around.
The little boy was so excited he wanted to go on the ship. He called out, “Hello? Anyone on the ship?” 
Suddenly, he heard a voice calling back to him, “Hello! Yes, I’m here!” 
The little boy was so surprised. He asked, “Who are you?”
The voice replied, “I’m the captain of this ship. What are you doing here?”
“I’m exploring. I wanted to see what this big ship was,” the little boy said.
“Well, why don’t you come aboard and explore?” the captain said.
The little boy was so happy. He rushed over to the ship and climbed aboard. He explored every nook and cranny, and the captain showed him around. 
After a while, the little boy said goodbye to the captain. He thanked him for showing him around the ship. The little boy was so happy he had made a new friend. As he sailed away, he waved goodbye to the lonely ship.
