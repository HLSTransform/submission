Once upon a time there was a little boy called Jack. He wanted a parrot as a pet but he knew his parents wouldn't buy him one. So he decided to wait for his birthday. 
One day, Jack was walking through the park with his mom and he saw a thin parrot in a cage. Jack's mom told him he could take the parrot but only if he promised not to delay his birthday wish. 
At night Jack couldn't stop thinking about the parrot and the next day he returned to the park with his mom. But the parrot was gone! All that was left was a thin feather and Jack was sad. 
Jack went home to wait and on his birthday, his parents surprised him with a parrot and a cage! Jack was so happy and he realised that the parrot he had seen in the park had been a sign!
