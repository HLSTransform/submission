Once there was a penguin who was very frightened. He was looking around and wanted to find a safe place to stay. He heard a voice calling out to him and he was very scared.
The voice belonged to a friendly old lady. She asked the penguin if he wanted to come and stay with her for a while. But the penguin refused. He was scared and didn't want to go.
The old lady tried to keep talking to him, but he continued to refuse. She didn't want to scare him away and gave him some time. Soon enough he started to relax and he felt much better.
The old lady invited the penguin again, and this time he accepted. He went to stay with her for a few days and soon he was much less frightened. He was safe and happy.
