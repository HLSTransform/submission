There once was a farmer who had a very modern crane. One day he was preparing to move some hay with the crane. But when he went to grab the hay, he noticed that another farmer was preparing to use their old crane to move the same hay. The two farmers got into a big argument about whose crane was better.
The two farmers argued for a long time. Finally, the modern crane farmer said that since the old crane farmer had gotten to the hay first, the hay was his. The modern crane farmer knew that it was the right thing to do, even though he didn't get to use his crane this time.
The moral of this story is that it is better to be flexible and think of others, even when it costs you something. In this case, the modern crane farmer showed kindness and humility, and ended up making the right decision.
