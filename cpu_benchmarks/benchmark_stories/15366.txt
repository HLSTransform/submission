Once upon a time there were two friends, Jonny and John. They were very excited because they got to go to a special land. As they raced through the land it was so nice! Everywhere they looked there were trees, flowers and animals. All of the colors were so bright and pretty and the trees even had special fruits growing on them.
The two friends chased butterflies, splashed in the puddles and sang songs as they made their way through the land. The sun was glowing bright in the sky and there was a nice cool breeze. They even saw a few special creatures that they had never seen before.
Jonny and John raced each other to the top of the hill. They had such a great time playing on the hill, looking for pretty flowers and even finding a few treasures. The two friends laughed and smiled as they raced around the land. 
When it was time to go home, Jonny and John were very sad. They had such a nice time in the special land. But they were sure to come back and visit their friends there, soon.
