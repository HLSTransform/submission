One day there was a brave mouse named Max. He wanted to find some olives so he could eat them. Max rolled across the floor and looked everywhere. He was so brave he even checked under the big sofa.
"Oh look!" he exclaimed. "I found some olives!" He was so excited.
Max gathered up the olives and rolled back across the room towards the door. Then he heard a noise. 
Max stopped and asked, "Who's there?"
But no one answered. Max was a bit scared but he was also brave. He decided to keep rolling so he could get home. 
Max ran across the room and out the door. He was so happy to be safe. 
He rolled back to his home where he could eat his olives in peace. He was very brave.
