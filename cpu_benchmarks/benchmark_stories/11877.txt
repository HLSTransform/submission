Once upon a time there were two best friends, Jack and Jill. They were always together and had lots of fun. One day, Jack and Jill decided to do something special. They wanted to unite and be really creative.
They got all of their craft supplies and started thinking. Jill had a great idea - they could make a picture and hang it on the wall. Jack loved the idea and they happily got to work. They used bright colours and lots of glue to create the picture and soon it was done. 
The picture was a sight to behold! It was of a rainbow and sunshine, with daisies in the grass. Jack and Jill were so proud of their work and could not believe that they had made it. They held hands in front of the picture and knew that together, they could do anything!
