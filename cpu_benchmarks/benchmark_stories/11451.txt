Once there was a boy named Timmy. He was only three, but he liked to explore the world. His family was very happy and full of love. 
One day his mum and dad hung an ashtray on the wall of their living room. They told him it was for decoration, but Timmy thought it looked fun. 
Timmy smiled and said to his mum, "Let me hang it!" His mum shook her head and smiled. She said, "No, Timmy, that is for decoration. You can look at it, but you can't hang it."
Timmy felt sleepy and went to bed. But very early in the morning, his mum found the ashtray had been hung on the wall. She looked around the room and saw Timmy smiling. His mum just shook her head, smiled and said, "Well, I guess it looks nice!"
