Lily and Ben love to swim in the pool. They put on their swim suits and jump in the water. They splash and kick and laugh.
"Look at me, Lily!" Ben yells. He blows bubbles and makes a funny face.
Lily giggles and yells back. "You are silly, Ben! Watch me!" She swims to the other side and does a big flip.
They have so much fun in the pool. They are happy and wet.
But then they hear their mom call. "Lily and Ben, time to get out! We have to go home!"
They do not want to leave the pool. They want to swim more.
"Please, mom, can we stay a little longer?" Lily asks.
"Sorry, sweetie, we have to go. Come on, dry off and get your things." Mom says.
Lily and Ben get out of the pool. They are sad and cold.
They say goodbye to the pool and hug each other.
"Maybe we can swim again tomorrow?" Ben says.
"Maybe. I hope so." Lily says.
They smile and hold hands. They still love to swim.
