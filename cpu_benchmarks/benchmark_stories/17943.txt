One day, a boy named Tim went outside to play. It was a rainy day, so Tim's mom gave him a big umbrella. She said, "Tim, you are allowed to play, but stay dry with this umbrella."
Tim went to the park with his umbrella. He saw his friend, Sue, playing in the rain. Sue did not have an umbrella. She was wet and cold. Sue saw Tim and his umbrella. She felt envious. She said, "Tim, I wish I had an umbrella like yours!"
Tim was a kind boy. He wanted to help Sue. He said, "Sue, come under my umbrella. We can both stay dry and play together!" Sue smiled and joined Tim under the umbrella. They played and laughed together, staying dry and warm.
Their friends saw them and felt envious too. They all wanted to join Tim and Sue under the big umbrella. Tim and Sue let them come under the umbrella. They all played and had fun together, even on the rainy day.
