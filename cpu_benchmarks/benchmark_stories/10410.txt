One day, Sophie was wondering what to do. It was a boring day and she wanted something fun.
Suddenly, she had an idea! She would go explore the large park near her house.
So, she started walking towards it. Soon, she arrived at the large park and it looked so exciting.
She was having a great time until she got to the middle of the park. Suddenly, she saw a huge monster! She was so scared.
Sophie tried to run away but she couldn't. She was too scared. She started to cry.
But then, something happened. The monster started to laugh. Sophie stopped crying and she guessed that the monster was just trying to scare her. 
The monster talked to her and said that it was a game and that Sophie had to guess what he was going to do next. Sophie thought this sounded like fun and she started guess what the monster would do.
The monster was happy he made a new friend and they had a great time playing. At the end of the day, they said good-bye and Sophie went home happy.
