Anna was a lonely girl. She had no friends to play with. She only had her toys and her furniture. But she was not nice to them. She liked to tear their arms and legs and throw them away. She did not care if they felt pain or sadness.
One day, a new family moved next door. They had a boy named Ben. He was the same age as Anna. He saw her in the garden and said hello. He asked if he could play with her. Anna said yes, but she did not smile. She thought he was boring.
They went to Anna's room. Ben saw her toys and furniture. He was shocked. He said, "Why did you do this? Why did you tear them and hurt them? They are your friends. They want to make you happy. You should be kind to them."
Anna did not like what he said. She felt angry. She said, "They are not my friends. They are just things. I can do whatever I want with them. You are not my friend either. You are just a stranger. Go away and leave me alone."
Ben felt sad. He said, "I am sorry you feel that way. I wanted to be your friend. But you are not nice. You are mean and selfish. You do not know how to share or care. You will always be lonely if you act like this." He left her room and went back to his house.
Anna stayed in her room. She looked at her toys and furniture. She felt a strange feeling in her chest. She felt sorry for them. She felt sorry for herself. She realized that Ben was right. She had been mean and selfish. She had no friends because she did not know how to be a friend. She wished she could change. She wished she could say sorry to Ben and her toys and furniture. She wished she could be kind and happy. She learned a lesson that day. She learned that tearing and hurting others is wrong. She learned that sharing and caring is right. She learned that being a friend is the best way to not be lonely.
