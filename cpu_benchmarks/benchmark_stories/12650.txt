Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo loved to swim in the big blue ocean. One day, Nemo saw a shiny lock on a treasure chest. He wanted to see what was inside, but the lock was too strong.
Nemo asked his friend, a crab named Sally, for help. Sally said, "I can help you! I can dive down and unlock the chest for you." Nemo was happy and said, "Thank you, Sally!"
Sally dove down and unlocked the chest. When Nemo opened it, he found a lemon that was very sour. Nemo made a funny face and said, "This lemon is too sour for me!" Sally laughed and said, "Maybe next time, we will find something sweeter."
