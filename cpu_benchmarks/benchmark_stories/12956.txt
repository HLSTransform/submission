Once upon a time there was a big berry bush. There were big, juicy berries and lots of them! In the summertime, they were a delicious treat.
One day, two little bunnies were wandering through the forest and stumbled upon the berry bush. The first bunny said, "I want to eat the big, juicy berries!" But the other bunny said, "I don't think we should, they could make us feel funny."
After a while, the first bunny said, "I'm going to try one. Let's see if it changes us in any way." He ate a big berry and shouted, "Yum! It tastes delicious!" 
The other bunny was a bit scared but decided to try one too. She ate one of the big berries and smiled. "Oh! It tastes so good!" And so the two bunnies happily ate the berries until all the big, juicy berries were gone. 
The bunnies felt no different, just a lot fuller than before. They had a wonderful time eating all the big berries.
