Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play with beans. They have many beans of different colors. They put the beans in a big jar.
One day, they want to count the beans. They take the jar and sit on the floor. They take out the beans one by one and say the numbers.
"One, two, three, four, five..." Tom says.
"Six, seven, eight, nine, ten..." Lily says.
They keep counting until they reach twenty. Then they see a broken bean. It is brown and has a crack.
"Look, this bean is broken!" Tom says.
"Let me see!" Lily says. She takes the bean and looks at it.
"Maybe we can fix it!" Tom says.
"How?" Lily asks.
"Maybe we can glue it!" Tom says.
They look for glue, but they cannot find any. They are sad. They do not want to throw away the broken bean.
"Maybe we can keep it as a special bean!" Lily says.
"A special bean?" Tom asks.
"Yes, a special bean that is different from the others. We can give it a name and a story!" Lily says.
"OK, what name and what story?" Tom asks.
Lily thinks for a moment. Then she says:
"Let's call it Brownie. Brownie is a brave bean that went on a big adventure. He climbed a mountain, crossed a river, and met a dragon. He fought the dragon and won, but he got a crack on his shell. He is a hero bean!"
Tom likes the story. He smiles and says:
"Wow, Brownie is a cool bean! I like him!"
They put Brownie back in the jar with the other beans. They hug each other and say:
"We have twenty beans and one special bean. We are happy!"
