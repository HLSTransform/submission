Lily liked to look at the sky and see the aeroplanes. They were big and loud and flew very fast. Sometimes they had different colours or shapes. Lily wanted to fly in an aeroplane one day.
One day, Lily's mum and dad told her they had a surprise for her. They packed some bags and took her to a big place with many aeroplanes. Lily was very excited. She asked if they were going to fly in an aeroplane. Her mum and dad said yes, they were going to visit her grandma in another place.
Lily followed her mum and dad to a big aeroplane. They showed their tickets to a lady and went inside. Lily saw many seats and people. She found her seat and put on a belt. Her mum and dad did the same. Lily looked out of the window and saw the wing of the aeroplane. It had a part that moved up and down.
The aeroplane started to move and make a lot of noise. Lily felt scared and held her mum's hand. Her mum told her it was okay, they were going to take off soon. Lily watched as the aeroplane went faster and faster. Then it lifted off the ground and went up in the sky. Lily saw the clouds and the sun. She felt happy and amazed. She smiled and said, "We are flying in an aeroplane!"
