Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a big, orange ball. He loved his ball very much. One day, Tim met a girl named Sue. Sue had a pretty doll. Tim liked Sue's doll, and Sue liked Tim's orange ball.
Tim and Sue thought about a trade. They would trade the ball for the doll. Tim was not sure. He loved his orange ball. Sue said, "I promise to take care of your ball. You can play with it when you want." Tim said, "I promise to take care of your doll too."
They did the trade. Tim played with the doll, and Sue played with the orange ball. But then, Sue's big dog came. The dog saw the orange ball and thought it was a toy. The dog bit the ball and it popped. Tim was very sad, and Sue was sorry. The trade was not good, and the orange ball was gone forever.
