Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play with paint. They have many colors of paint. They can make pictures with paint.
One day, they find a big can of paint. It is black. It has a red sign on it. The sign has a picture of fire and a skull. Lily and Tom do not know what the sign means. They think it is a funny sign.
"Let's use this paint!" Tom says. "We can make a big picture on the wall!"
"No, Tom, that is a bad idea!" Lily says. "This paint is dangerous. It can hurt us. We should not touch it."
But Tom does not listen to Lily. He opens the can of paint. He dips his hand in the paint. He puts his hand on the wall. He makes a big black mark.
"Look, Lily, I can paint with my hand!" Tom says. "This is fun!"
Lily is scared. She sees smoke coming from the can of paint. She smells something bad. She hears a loud noise.
"Tom, stop! The paint is on fire!" Lily says. "We have to run away!"
Tom sees the fire. He drops the can of paint. He runs away with Lily. They scream for help.
A grown-up hears them. He comes with a hose. He puts out the fire. He is angry.
"Who did this?" he asks. "Who used this paint?"
Lily and Tom are sorry. They tell the truth.
"We did it," they say. "We are sorry. We did not know it was dangerous. We just wanted to paint."
The grown-up is still angry. But he is also glad they are safe.
"You should never use paint you do not know," he says. "This paint is not for children. It is for cars. It can burn and explode. You could have been hurt. You are lucky I saw you."
Lily and Tom nod. They are scared and sad. They do not want to play with paint anymore.
They learn a new word. The word is "flammable". It means something can catch fire easily. They do not like this word. They do not like this paint. They like their own paint. Their own paint is safe and fun. They say sorry to the grown-up. They say sorry to the wall. They say sorry to the paint. They say sorry to each other. They hug and make up. They are still friends. They go home. They wash their hands. They have a snack. They play with something else. They are happy.
