Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. He loved the outdoors and especially loved playing in the water. One day he brought a big, orange stick to the river. When he got there, he threw the stick into the water. Then, he waded in and started to splash around. 
He jumped and turned in circles, laughing and clapping his hands. He moved the stick around, making different shapes in the water. Everywhere he swam, big splashes came up. Jack was having so much fun!
At one point, he threw the orange stick far away from him. He laughed as it sped off and drifted down the river. Then, he spun around, twirling his arms and making bigger and bigger splashes. He couldn't stop and kept playing until the sun went down.
Afterwards, he was exhausted, but happy. He said goodbye to the river, ready to come back again soon and have even more fun.
