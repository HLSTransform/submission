Once upon a time, there was a girl named Mia. She had a pretty blouse with flowers on it. Mia loved to wear her blouse every day.
One day, Mia saw a cute kitty. The kitty was deaf and could not hear Mia when she called it. Mia wanted to be friends with the kitty. So, she decided to follow it.
Mia followed the kitty all around the park. They played together and had lots of fun. At the end of the day, Mia and the deaf kitty became best friends. They went home and Mia's mom let her keep the kitty. Mia and the kitty lived happily ever after.
