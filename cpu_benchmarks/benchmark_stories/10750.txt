One day, a little girl named Lucy went outside to play. She saw a tiny fairy sitting on a flower. The fairy looked hurt, so Lucy wanted to help her. She picked up the fairy very gently and took her to her room.
In her room, Lucy looked at the fairy and tried to study her. She wanted to know how to make the hurt fairy feel better. Lucy thought that maybe the fairy needed some rest, so she made a soft bed for her using a small box and a soft cloth.
After a while, the fairy started to feel better. She was so happy that Lucy had helped her. The fairy thanked Lucy and gave her a little kiss on the cheek. Then, the fairy flew away, back to her home in the flowers. Lucy smiled and knew that she had made a new friend.
