Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play with blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes. They can make houses, towers, cars and animals with their blocks.
One day, Sara has a new block. It is a cute block. It has a face and a tail. It is a cat block. Sara loves cats. She shows her block to Ben.
"Look, Ben! I have a cat block. It is cute and soft. Do you want to play with it?" Sara asks.
Ben looks at the cat block. He likes it too. He wants to play with it. But he does not know how to make a cat sound. He only knows how to make a dog sound.
"I want to play with it, Sara. But I do not know how to say meow. I only know how to say woof. Can you teach me how to say meow?" Ben asks.
Sara smiles. She is happy to teach Ben how to say meow. She is good at making cat sounds. She holds the cat block and makes a meow sound.
"Meow, meow, meow. This is how you say meow, Ben. Try it with me. Meow, meow, meow." Sara says.
Ben listens to Sara. He tries to make a meow sound. He holds the cat block and says meow.
"Meow, meow, meow. I did it, Sara. I can say meow. Thank you for teaching me how to say meow." Ben says.
Sara and Ben hug. They are happy. They can play with the cat block and make meow sounds. They can also play with the other blocks and make other sounds. They have fun with their blocks. They are good friends.
