One day, a powerful wizard was in the market. He saw a beautiful jewelry that caught his eye. He chose it and brought it home with him. When he put it on, he became even more powerful. He could do things he had never done before. 
Soon, people started to fear him. His power began to grow more and more. They realized that the jewelry was too powerful and they had to find a way to stop it.
The wizard was proud of his new powerful jewelry. But the more he used it, the more people in the village were scared. They were worried the wizard would become too powerful and take over the village.
The village leader decided to have a meeting to try and find a way to stop the wizard. Everyone came together but nothing seemed to work. They had no choice but to fight him.
The village people fought bravely, but the wizard's powerful jewelry was too strong. In the end, the village people lost and the wizard became the ruler of the village. The powerful jewelry had chosen him, and he was in control.
