Once upon a time there was a monster called Wide. He slept in a cave near a deep forest. One day, he woke from his slumber. It had been a long sleep and he was hungry. He was so hungry that he decided to eat everything he could find in the nearby forest. He gobbled up everything that he could find including flowers, grass, bugs, and even leaves. It was all so disgusting but he kept eating it anyway. Finally, with a full belly, Wide fell back to sleep in his cave. That's the end.
