Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play dress-up. One day, she put on a beautiful dress and a sparkly crown and pretended to become a princess. She twirled around and said, "Look at me, I'm a princess!"
Her mom came into the room and said, "Wow, Lily, you look so pretty! But do you want to be an original princess?"
Lily didn't understand what "original" meant, so her mom explained, "An original princess is one who is unique and special. She doesn't just wear a regular dress and crown, she adds her own special touches to make her stand out."
Lily thought about it and decided to add some flowers to her hair and a shiny necklace. She twirled around again and said, "Now I'm an original princess!"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, you are, Lily. And you're the most beautiful princess I've ever seen."
