Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books, but her family didn't have many at home. One day, she asked her mommy if they could go to the library to find some new stories to read.
Mommy said, "Of course, Lily! Let's go create a library card for you so you can borrow books."
Lily was so excited to have her very own library card. She picked out lots of books and brought them home to read. As she read, she noticed that some of the stories had harsh words in them. She asked her mommy why some stories were mean.
Mommy explained, "Sometimes, stories have harsh words to teach us important lessons. But we can always choose to read kind stories instead." From then on, Lily made sure to pick out only kind and happy stories to read from her library.
