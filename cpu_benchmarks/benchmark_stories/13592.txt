Tom and Anna were playing in the garden. They saw a big ladder leaning on the wall. They wanted to climb it and see what was on the other side.
"Let's go up the ladder!" Tom said.
"OK, but be careful!" Anna said.
They took turns to climb the ladder. Tom went first. He was chubby and had short legs. He had to use his arms and feet to move up. He was slow and tired.
Anna went second. She was thin and had long legs. She could climb faster and easier. She soon caught up with Tom.
"Look, I can see the roof!" Anna said.
"Wow, me too!" Tom said.
They reached the top of the ladder. They saw the roof of their house and the sky. They also saw a bird's nest with three eggs inside.
"Hello, birdies!" Anna said.
"Shh, don't scare them!" Tom said.
They looked at the nest for a while. Then they heard their mom calling them.
"Tom! Anna! Come down, it's time for lunch!" Mom said.
"OK, Mom, we're coming!" Tom and Anna said.
They climbed down the ladder. Anna went first. She was careful and quick. She reached the ground and ran to Mom.
Tom went second. He was clumsy and slow. He slipped and fell from the ladder. He landed on the grass and hurt his knee.
"Ouch!" Tom said.
"Are you OK, Tom?" Anna asked.
"I'm OK, just a little scratch." Tom said.
Mom came and hugged them. She checked Tom's knee and put a band-aid on it.
"You're brave, Tom. But next time, don't climb the ladder without me. It's dangerous." Mom said.
"Sorry, Mom. We just wanted to see the roof." Tom said.
"I know, but you have to be safe. Now, let's go inside and have some lunch. You must be hungry after your adventure." Mom said.
"OK, Mom. We're hungry." Tom and Anna said.
They followed Mom into the house. They finished their lunch and told Mom about the bird's nest. Mom smiled and said they could watch the birds from the window. Tom and Anna were happy. They liked the ladder, but they liked Mom more.
