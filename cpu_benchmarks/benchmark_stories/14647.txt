Once upon a time there was a troubled tiger. The tiger didn't like the jungle. He wanted to find a better place to live.
So one day the tiger zipped away to find a new home. First he zipped to a mountain. But the mountain wasn't nice. 
So the tiger zipped again and this time he found a valley. It looked really nice. He thought it might be a good place to live. 
But then the tiger saw a little girl, playing in the valley. The tiger was scared. He didn't want to hurt the girl, so he zipped away.
Finally, the tiger found a perfect place to live, all by himself. He was happy and no longer troubled. And he lived happily ever after.
