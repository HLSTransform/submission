Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play with stuff in the park. They have a ball, a kite, and a bike. They take turns to fly the kite in the sky. The kite is red and blue and has a long tail.
"Look, Lily, the kite is so high!" Tom says.
"I want to fly it too, Tom. Give me the string!" Lily says.
"OK, but be careful. The wind is strong today." Tom says. He gives Lily the string and runs to the bike.
Lily holds the string and tries to fly the kite. But the wind is too strong. It pulls the kite and Lily with it. Lily is scared. She screams for Tom.
"Tom, help me! The kite is taking me away!" Lily says.
Tom hears Lily and jumps on the bike. He pedals fast to catch up with Lily. He is alert and looks for the kite in the sky. He sees it far away, over the trees.
"Lily, hold on! I'm coming!" Tom says.
But Tom is too late. The kite and Lily fly over the road. A big truck is coming. The truck does not see the kite and Lily. It hits them with a loud bang. The kite and Lily fall to the ground. They are broken and hurt. Tom stops the bike and cries. He is sad and sorry. He lost his friend and his kite. The end.
