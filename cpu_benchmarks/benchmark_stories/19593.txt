Once upon a time, there was a great start. It was time to love. Everyone was happy and excited.
The sun was shining and the birds were singing. Everybody was ready to go on their way.
The little boy held his mommy's hand as they went on their new adventure. They walked through the fields, meadows and forests. He loved every minute.
Soon they found a great lake. The boy was so happy! He wanted to jump into the lake and swim. His mommy said it was time to love.
They played in the lake, splashed in the water and swam. It was the most fun day of his life.
After the lake, they hugged each other and laughed. They loved their great start and were so happy to be together.
