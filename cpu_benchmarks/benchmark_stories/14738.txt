Once there was a hippo who was very tired. He wanted to go to sleep, but he had a hurt foot. He looked around for a soft place, and he spotted a big comfy bed. He hopped on, and quickly snuggled in.
He let out a big yawn and closed his little eyes. Then, ever so slowly, he began to drift off to sleep. As he dozed off he had dreams about running and eating and playing. 
But then, just as he was about to drift off completely, he heard a noise! He quickly opened his eyes and saw a big fat mouse nibbling on his bed. He was so startled he jumped up and the mouse scurried away.
But then he remembered how tired he was and decided the mouse could keep the bed. He hopped off and found a grassy spot under a shady tree. He snuggled in and finally fell fast asleep. 
The hippo slept soundly all through the night until the morning sun woke him up. He felt much better after his long nap and he knew that he would be able to play and explore all day long.
