Sara likes to design things. She draws and cuts and glues and paints. She makes cards and hats and dolls and cars. She has a lot of fun.
One day, she wants to design a phone. She asks her mom for a box and some buttons and some string. Her mom gives her the things and says, "What are you making, Sara?"
"I'm making a phone, Mom. A fast phone. I can talk to anyone I want," Sara says.
She works hard on her phone. She puts the buttons on the box and makes holes for the string. She ties the string to the box and to a cup. She paints the box and the cup with bright colors.
She shows her phone to her mom and says, "Look, Mom. I made a phone. A fast phone. Do you want to talk to me?"
Her mom smiles and says, "Sure, Sara. I want to talk to you. You are very clever and creative. I love your phone."
She picks up the cup and says, "Hello, Sara. This is Mom. How are you?"
Sara picks up the box and says, "Hello, Mom. This is Sara. I'm fine. I love you."
They talk and laugh and have fun with the phone. Sara is happy. She likes to design things.
