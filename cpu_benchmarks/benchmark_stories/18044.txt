Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and sing songs. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. They decided to play a game of tag, and Lily was "it". She tried her best to catch her friends, but they were too fast for her. 
Lily felt sad because she couldn't catch anyone. Her friend, Timmy, noticed that she was feeling down and asked her what was wrong. Lily told him that she wanted to win the game, but she couldn't. Timmy said, "Winning isn't everything. It's how you act that matters." 
Lily didn't understand what Timmy meant, so he explained it to her. He said that even if she didn't win the game, she could still be a good sport and be cheerful. Lily realized that Timmy was right. So, she continued to play the game with a smile on her face, even though she wasn't winning. 
In the end, Lily's team didn't win the game, but Lily felt like she had won a victory because she learned an important lesson. She learned that it's not about winning, but how you act and how you make others feel. From that day on, Lily always tried to be cheerful and kind to everyone she met.
