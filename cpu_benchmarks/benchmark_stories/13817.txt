Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to swing and slide and run. They saw a big metal thing that looked like a snake. It was flexible and shiny and had a hole in the front.
"Let's go see the snake!" Lily said. She ran to the metal thing and touched it. It was cold and hard.
"Be careful, Lily. It might be dangerous," Ben said. He followed her slowly.
Lily put her head inside the hole. She wanted to see what was inside. She saw a red button and a green light. She pushed the button.
The metal thing made a loud noise. It moved and twisted and wrapped around Lily. It squeezed her tight. Lily screamed and cried.
"Help! Help!" Ben shouted. He tried to pull the metal thing off Lily. But it was too strong and heavy. He could not hug Lily or save her.
The metal thing was not a snake. It was a trap. Lily and Ben did not know that. They were too young and curious. They played with the wrong thing. And now Lily was gone.
