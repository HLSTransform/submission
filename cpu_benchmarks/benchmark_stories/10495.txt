Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to get to a special place. But the only way to get there was through a big, mysterious door. 
The girl was very eager to reach this special place, but the door seemed so hard to open. She was worried that she wouldn't be able to do it. 
But then, her mommy came to her and said, "It's okay, darling. Just try!"
So the little girl took a breath and tried really hard. She kept trying and trying until, finally, the door opened!
When the girl stepped into the special place behind the door, she learned an important lesson: trying is easy! With determination and hard work, you can do almost anything.
