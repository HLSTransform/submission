Once upon a time, there was a computer. Its job was to protect the family's secrets. One day, the computer was very nervous. It was scared that someone would steal the secrets. So it decided to hide them. 
The computer started looking for a place to hide. First, it looked in the closet. But the closet was too small. Then it looked under the bed. But there were too many stuffed animals there. The computer kept searching until it found the perfect place. 
The computer hid the secrets in a toy box. It told the secrets to stay safe and to never leave the box. Then it ran to the kitchen and told the family. 
The family was very happy to know the secrets were safe. From then on, the computer made sure the secrets stayed safe. It even decorated the box with stickers so that everyone knew it was an important box. 
The computer was happy it was able to protect the family's secrets. It was proud that it did a good job.
