Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved to blink. He would blink his eye all day long, from the moment he woke up until the moment he went to sleep. 
One day, the little boy saw something shiny glimmering in the dark. He came closer and saw that it was a golf ball! He was so excited, he picked it up and blinked in amazement. 
He ran with the golf ball all the way to the park. He found a golf club, and he had an idea. He started hitting the golf ball with the golf club. To his surprise, it went flying across the field! He couldn't believe it! He blinked in awe. 
The boy was so happy he blinked over and over again. He knew that he had found his favorite game! From then on, he would go to the park every day in the dark to have fun playing golf.
