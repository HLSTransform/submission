Sam and his mom had to travel far away from their home. There was a war in their country and it was terrible. Many people were hurt and scared. Sam did not like the loud noises and the smoke in the sky.
They took a bus and then a boat to a new place. The new place was different from their home. It had different buildings and different people. Sam and his mom did not know anyone there. They had to stay in a big room with many other people who also traveled from the war.
Sam missed his dad and his friends. He missed his toys and his books. He missed his bed and his blanket. He felt sad and lonely. He wondered when the war would end and when they could go back home.
One day, Sam met a girl in the big room. Her name was Ana and she also traveled from the war. She had curly hair and brown eyes. She smiled at Sam and gave him a crayon. They started to draw pictures on a piece of paper. They drew their homes, their families, their pets, and their dreams.
Sam and Ana became friends. They played and talked and laughed together. They shared their crayons and their stories. They helped each other feel less sad and less lonely. They hoped that the war would end soon and that they could be happy and safe.
