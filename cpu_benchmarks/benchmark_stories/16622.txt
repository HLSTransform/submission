Lily and Sam liked to pretend they were robots. They had cardboard boxes for their bodies and tin cans for their heads. They made beep and boop noises and walked stiffly around the room.
One day, they found a big battery in the garage. It was shiny and had two wires sticking out. They thought it would make their robot costumes more real. They took it to their room and attached it to their boxes with tape.
They turned on the battery and felt a tickle in their bellies. They laughed and said they had robot power. They beeped and booped louder and faster. They ran around the room and bumped into things.
But soon, the battery ran out of power. It stopped making the tickle and the wires fell off. Lily and Sam felt sad and said their robot power was gone. They looked at the battery and saw it was dead.
They decided to pretend they were something else. They took off their boxes and cans and put on their capes and masks. They said they were superheroes and had magic powers. They flew and jumped and saved the world. They had fun and forgot about the battery.
