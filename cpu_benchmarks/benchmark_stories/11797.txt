Once upon a time, there was a frog named Fred. He was so adventurous and always excited for something new. One day, Fred got an invitation. He was so excited and couldn't wait to see what it was. He quickly hopped to the invitation. 
When Fred got there, he was surprised. He saw a giant pond with many other frogs. They were all hopping around and having fun. He quickly joined in and began to hop around. Every day, they would hop around the pond and have lots of fun. 
One evening, Fred was hopping a little further away from the pond. Suddenly he realised he had gone too far and he couldn't find his way back. Fred became very scared and exhausted. He hopped around for hours and hours, but eventually he ran out of energy and he couldn't find his way home. 
The next morning, the other frogs found Fred lying by the side of the pond. They were very sad and realised that they had to say goodbye to him. Fred had been too adventurous, and sadly had not been able to return.
