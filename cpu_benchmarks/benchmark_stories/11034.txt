Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play at the park. They see a big slide. It is very long and shiny. Anna wants to go on the slide, but Ben is scared.
"Come on, Ben, it is fun!" Anna says. She runs to the slide and climbs up the steps. She sits on the top and smiles. "Look, Ben, I can see the whole park from here!"
Ben stays on the ground. He shakes his head. "No, Anna, it is too high. I don't like it. It is scary."
Anna slides down. She goes very fast and laughs. She lands on the sand and jumps up. She runs to Ben and hugs him. "Don't be scared, Ben. It is not scary. It is fun. I will explain to you how to do it. You just sit on the slide and hold on to the sides. Then you let go and slide down. It is easy and fun. You can do it, Ben. I will help you."
Ben looks at Anna. He sees that she is happy and not scared. He trusts her. He nods. "Okay, Anna, I will try. But you have to go with me."
Anna smiles. She takes Ben's hand and leads him to the slide. They climb up the steps together. They sit on the top and hold on to the sides. Anna says, "Ready, Ben? One, two, three, go!"
They slide down together. They go very fast and laugh. They land on the sand and jump up. They hug each other. "We did it, Anna! We did it!" Ben says. "It was fun! It was not scary. Thank you for explaining to me how to do it. You are a good friend."
Anna says, "You are welcome, Ben. You are a good friend too. I am proud of you. You are brave. Do you want to go again?"
Ben says, "Yes, Anna, I do. Let's go again!"
They run to the slide and climb up the steps. They slide down again and again. They have a lot of fun. They are happy. They are friends.
