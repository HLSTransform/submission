Once there was a boy who wanted to go outside and play. He grabbed his hat and put it on his head. He put his shoes on his feet and opened the door.
He went outside and felt the sun on his skin. It was so warm and the grass was dry. He ran around, chasing butterflies. He played until his hands were tired.
When he was done, he looked for a puddle. He wanted to use his hands to make some shapes. But the ground was too dry.
So he found a bucket and filled it with water from the hose. Then he used his hands to splash around. He made circles and lines and squares, until the water was all gone.
The boy went inside with a smile on his face. He had used his hands to make something new!
