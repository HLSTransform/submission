Lila and Ben were waiting for their dad to come home. They liked to play with him and tell him what they did at school. They heard a car stop outside and ran to the door.
"Dad, dad, you are here!" they shouted and hugged him.
"Hello, my sweeties, I missed you so much!" dad said and kissed them. "Did you have a good day?"
"Yes, dad, we did. We learned about colors and shapes and animals. Look, I made this picture for you. It is an orange cat with a blue hat. Do you like it?" Lila said and showed him her drawing.
"I love it, Lila, it is very pretty and creative. You are a smart girl. And what about you, Ben? What did you do?" dad asked and looked at Ben.
"I played with blocks and cars and puzzles. I made a big tower and a fast car and a funny puzzle. See, this is my tower. It is very tall and strong. Do you like it?" Ben said and pointed to his tower.
"I like it, Ben, it is very impressive and clever. You are a smart boy. You both make me very proud and happy. How about we go to the kitchen and have a snack? I brought some oranges for you. They are juicy and sweet. Do you want some?" dad said and smiled.
"Yes, dad, we want some. We love oranges. They are yummy and good for us. Thank you, dad. You are the best dad ever!" Lila and Ben said and followed him to the kitchen. They ate the oranges and talked and laughed. They were a happy family.
