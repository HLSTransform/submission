One day, Tom and Sam went to play in the woods. They liked to run, jump and climb on the trees. They saw a big hole in the ground. It was a cave.
"Let's go inside and see what is there," Tom said.
"OK, but be careful. It is dark and scary," Sam said.
They took a stick and a flashlight and walked into the cave. They saw many rocks and bats. They heard a loud roar. It was a bear!
"Run, run, run!" Tom shouted.
They ran back to the entrance, but the bear was faster. It blocked their way. They were trapped.
"What do we do now?" Sam asked.
"We have to solve this problem. We have to make the bear go away," Tom said.
He looked around and saw a big rock. He had an idea.
"Hey, bear, look at this!" he yelled.
He threw the rock at the bear's head. The bear was angry. It turned around and chased the rock.
"Now, let's go!" Tom said.
They ran out of the cave and did not look back. They were safe.
They hugged each other and smiled.
"We did it! We solved the problem!" Sam said.
"Yes, we did. We are brave and smart!" Tom said.
They went back to their home and told their mom and dad what happened. They were proud of themselves.
They never went back to the cave again. They knew it was a dead place. They liked to play in the woods, but not in the cave.
