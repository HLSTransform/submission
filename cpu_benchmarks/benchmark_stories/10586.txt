Molly was a 3 year old girl who loved going to the museum. Her favorite part about the museum was the room full of brilliant paintings. Every day, Molly would carefully lift the rope around the paintings and admire the colors and shapes.
One day, when she was admiring one of her favorite paintings, a security guard came over to her. He said, "Molly! You must not lift the rope. That is against the rules." But Molly did not understand the security guard.
So, the next day, Molly went back to the museum and once again lifted the rope and entered the room with the beautiful paintings. Just as she was about to look around, the security guard grabbed her arm and said, "Molly! You must not come back here. You have been a very naughty girl."
Molly started to cry and when her parents came to get her she was very upset. From that day onward, Molly was not allowed to visit the museum ever again. It was a bad ending for Molly.
