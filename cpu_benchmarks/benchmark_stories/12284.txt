Once upon a time, there were two friends named Carlos and Jessica. The two always loved to play together in the garden.
One day, when the Sun was shining and the birds were singing, Carlos and Jessica were playing a game of hide and seek. Carlos decided to hide behind a big tree and he waited for Jessica to search for him.
But Jessica was too fast and found him almost immediately! Carlos was so excited when Jessica shouted "I found you!" 
Just then, a big, fluffy dog came walking past. Jessica thought the dog was so adorable, so she shouted "Let's play with the puppy!"
But the puppy was too scared and ran away. Carlos was determined to make the puppy come back so he said, "Let's give him some milk. Maybe he'll surrender to us."
So Jessica and Carlos took a bowl of milk and placed it in the garden. They waited for the puppy to come back. After a few minutes, he eventually returned and started to slurp up the milk. Carlos and Jessica hugged him and said goodbye. 
From then on, the puppy became the three friends.
