Once upon a time, there was a new puppy called Charlie. Charlie was full of energy, and he loved to run around and play. Whenever Charlie was in the garden, he stayed very close and was careful not to go too far away.
One day, a big truck came to Charlie's house. The truck had a huge weight on the back. Charlie was curious and he wanted to know what was inside the truck. He stayed close and watched as the big weight was unloaded.
Mommy came out of the house and told Charlie that the weight was a new playhouse for him and his puppy friends. With his tail wagging, Charlie ran over to check it out. It was so fun, and he knew he'd be spending lots of time playing in the new playhouse.
From that day onward, Charlie stayed near his new playhouse. He loved playing in it with his friends, and it was the perfect size for him and his puppy pals.
