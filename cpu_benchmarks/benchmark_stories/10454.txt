Nina and her parents went for a walk around the neighbourhood. As they walked, Nina admired everything she saw. She saw some birds in the sky, a dog chasing a ball and a flower garden.
When they arrived at her neighbour's house, Nina stopped and admired the porch. The porch was made of wood and had a bright colour. Her mum said it had been newly painted.
They continued their walk and soon arrived at a different house. Nina looked at the porch and said, "It's dirty!" Mum said, "Yes, it is." She explained that the house had been empty for a while and no-one had looked after it.
Nina and her parents completed their walk and went home. Nina thought about the two porches she had seen and she admired them both, even if one was dirty.
