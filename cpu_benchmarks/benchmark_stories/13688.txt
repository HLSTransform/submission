Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big dog. The dog is brown and has a long tail. The dog barks at them. Sara and Ben are scared.
"Go away, dog!" Ben says. He throws a stick at the dog. The dog runs after the stick. Ben and Sara run away too. They hide behind a tree.
"Are you okay, Sara?" Ben asks. He sees that Sara is crying. Her knee is red and has a small cut. She fell when she ran from the dog.
"I'm okay, Ben. But my knee hurts. And the dog was scary." Sara says. She wipes her tears with her hand.
"I have an idea, Sara. Let's go to my house. My mom can help your knee. And she can give us cookies and milk. And we can play with my toys. Do you want to come?" Ben says. He smiles at Sara.
"Yes, Ben. I want to come. Thank you for being my friend." Sara says. She smiles back at Ben. She stands up and holds his hand. They walk to his house.
Before they leave the park, they see the dog again. The dog is not barking now. He is lying on the grass. He looks weak and sad. He has no stick and no friends.
"Maybe the dog is not bad, Ben. Maybe he is lonely and wants to play." Sara says. She feels sorry for the dog.
"Maybe you are right, Sara. Maybe we can be his friends too." Ben says. He feels brave and kind.
They go to the dog. They talk to him in a soft voice. They pet his fur. They give him some of their cookies. The dog wags his tail. He licks their faces. He is happy.
Sara and Ben hug the dog. They hug each other. They are happy too. They have a new friend.
