Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and books. One day, they visit their grandma and grandpa. Grandma and grandpa have a big house with a garden. They also have a cat named Fluffy.
"Hello, Anna and Ben!" Grandma says. "We are happy to see you. Do you want some cookies and milk?"
"Yes, please!" Anna and Ben say. They follow grandma to the kitchen. They see Fluffy sleeping on a chair. Fluffy is a flexible cat. He can curl up and stretch out in many ways.
"Can we pet Fluffy?" Anna asks.
"Sure, but be gentle. He might be grumpy if you wake him up." Grandma says.
Anna and Ben pet Fluffy softly. Fluffy opens his eyes and purrs. He likes Anna and Ben.
After they eat their cookies and drink their milk, grandma and grandpa take Anna and Ben to their bedroom. They have a big bed with a soft sheet. The sheet is blue and has stars on it.
"Can we play on the bed?" Ben asks.
"Of course, but be careful. Don't jump too high or fall off." Grandpa says.
Anna and Ben climb on the bed. They pretend the sheet is a tent. They hide under the sheet and make funny noises. They giggle and have fun.
Grandma and grandpa watch them and smile. They love Anna and Ben. They are happy to have them visit.
