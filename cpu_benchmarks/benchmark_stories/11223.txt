One day, Bob and Sarah were playing in the park. Bob saw something shiny and went to investigate. He found a shiny medal! Bob immediately shouted, "Victory!" Sarah smiled and asked, "What is it, Bob?"
Bob proudly said, "It's a victory medal! It means I won!" Sarah felt a little embarrassed. She was ignorant about what the medal was and felt bad she didn't know.
Bob was happy to teach her and said, "That's OK! We can separate the medal into two pieces. I'll give you one and you can have a victory too!" Sarah was delighted and thanked Bob for his generous offer.
They took the medal apart and continued playing together in the park, both very happy they had a victory medal to share.
