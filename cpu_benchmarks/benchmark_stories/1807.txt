Once upon a time, there was a beautiful sunset. It was so amazing! Everyone wanted to see it.
So, the family lit a fire in the backyard to watch the sunset. The flames were bright and warm. The sun was orange and red. It was wonderful to look at.
Then, it started to get darker. Soon, the fire was the only light around. Everyone enjoyed it and talked until it was time for bed.
Before the family went to bed, they looked up to see the amazing fire burning in the night sky. It was a special moment they would never forget.
