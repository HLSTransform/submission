Once upon a time, there was a girl named Agatha. Agatha had a phone, and she loved it very much. But one day, the phone started to act all strange and scary. Agatha was very scared.
Agatha asked her mum what was wrong with her phone. Her mum said that sometimes technology can just act up, but it will be ok soon. Agatha was still scared.
Agatha's mum said they should take the phone to the store, so a technician could have a look. Agatha wasn't sure, but finally she agreed.
At the store, the technician fixed the phone. But Agatha was still scared that something like this could happen again. 
Her mum gave her a big hug and said it was ok to be scared sometimes. Agatha felt a lot better, knowing she could always ask her mum for help when she was scared.
