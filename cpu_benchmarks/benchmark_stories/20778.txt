Once there was a little girl named Sandy who loved to decorate. She had colourful crayons, glitter, and lots of stickers. One day she decided to decorate a journal. In it, she put lots of pink and purple stickers and drew pretty little hearts. She knew it was going to be yummy! 
When Sandy finished decorating, she was so excited that she ran around and showed it to everyone she could find. Her mom, her dad and her brothers all admired her work. She was so proud of a job well done. 
Sandy made the journal her very own special place. She wrote stories and drew pictures in it every day. She was the happiest girl around. Now Sandy always has something both yummy and fun to share with her family and friends.
