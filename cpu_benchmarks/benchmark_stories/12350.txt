Once there was a brave knight who was gifted a sword. He was very excited and looked at the sword with admiration. It was impressive and the knight wanted to show everyone. The knight asked his friends to come look at the sword and they admired it too.
The knight wanted to keep the sword close, so he decided to tie it to his belt. Then he asked if anyone wanted to come with him on an adventure and everyone cheerfully agreed.
They left the village and began their journey. The knight laughed with joy and confidently carried his impressive sword. As they walked closer to the forest, the knight's friends looked uneasily around the area.
Soon enough the group found themselves surrounded by bandits and the knight held his sword to protect his friends. Despite his impressive weapon, the bandits outnumbered the knight and his friends, and the group was quickly defeated.
The knight looked sadly at his sword and wished he would have kept it safe at home and not taken it with him on this journey.
