Once upon a time, there was a gifted little girl named Lucy. Every day, she would march around her house with a big smile on her face. She loved to explore and learn new things. 
One day when Lucy was marching around the house, she found an ashtray under the kitchen table. She was curious about it and stopped to take a closer look. She picked it up and felt how heavy it was. She wondered what the ashtray was made for. 
Lucy carried the ashtray to her mom, who explained that it was a special container used for holding cigarettes. Lucy listened carefully and nodded her head. She thanked her mom, then marched around the house with her new knowledge. 
From that day on, Lucy became even more gifted. She was so curious and eager to explore her world. Every day she marched around her house, learning and discovering new things in her own special way.
