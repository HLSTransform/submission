Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice-cream, especially the famous kind that her mom bought for her. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and saw her friends playing hide-and-seek. She wanted to play too!
Lily's mom said, "Sure, you can play hide-and-seek with your friends, but be careful not to hide too far away."
Lily ran to hide behind a big tree, but she got scared because it was dark and she couldn't see anything. She started to cry and called out for her mom.
Her mom heard her and came to find her. She said, "It's okay, Lily. You don't have to hide if you don't want to. The most important thing is that you're safe and happy."
Lily learned that it's okay to try new things, but it's also important to listen to her feelings and not do things that make her uncomfortable. From that day on, Lily played with her friends, ate her favorite famous ice-cream, and had lots of fun at the park. The end.
