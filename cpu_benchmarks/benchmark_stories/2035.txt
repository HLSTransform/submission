Molly was so excited. Today was her first day of preschool! As she arrived she noticed a big picture on the wall. She wanted to take a closer look but she slipped on the way there. She felt embarrassed and a bit scared. She didn't know anybody yet, so she felt ignorant and alone. 
Suddenly she felt a gentle hand touch her shoulder. It was her teacher. She was so kind and understanding. She helped Molly get up and brought her closer to the picture. It was a painting of a big rainbow. Molly looked around and saw that everyone was enjoying the picture. She started to feel better and soon made friends with some of the other children. 
Molly realized that nobody was ignorant; they were all just getting to know each other! She was glad she decided to come to preschool and was even more excited to learn more!
