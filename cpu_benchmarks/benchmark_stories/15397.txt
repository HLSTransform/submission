Once upon a time, there was a mummy who wanted to bake a yummy treat for her son. She found a shiny pan and put it on the stove. She filled the pan with yummy ingredients, then stirred it all together.
The mummy was so excited to bake her special treat! She kept stirring until it was time to put the mix into the oven. She was just about to do that when something made her stop.
The mummy realized that she had forgotten something very important. She remembered that she needed to set the timer to make sure her treat was good and ready. She set the timer and placed the pan in the oven.
When the timer went off, the mummy remembered to check the oven. She opened the door and the most wonderful smell filled the room. The mummy was so happy that her special treat was ready!
She was so excited that she took the pan outside and gave it to her son. He was so happy when he saw it and ate it all up. He told mummy he would never forget how it tasted; she smiled and reminded him to always remember to set the timer.
