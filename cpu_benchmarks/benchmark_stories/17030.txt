Anna likes to draw and write notes. She has many crayons and papers. She makes notes for her mom, dad, and brother. She puts them in different places. She wants to make them happy.
One day, she makes a note for her cat, Fluffy. She draws a fish and writes "I love you". She puts the note under Fluffy's bed. She hopes Fluffy will see it and like it.
But Fluffy does not see the note. He is too busy playing with his toys. He runs and jumps and chases a ball. He does not go to his bed.
Anna is curious. She wonders if Fluffy saw her note. She goes to his bed and looks under it. She sees the note. It is still there. It remains under the bed.
Anna is sad. She thinks Fluffy does not love her. She picks up the note and hugs it. She cries.
Fluffy hears Anna cry. He stops playing. He runs to her and rubs his head on her leg. He purrs and licks her hand. He loves her.
Anna smiles. She sees Fluffy loves her. She gives him the note and a hug. She says "I love you too". Fluffy takes the note and puts it in his bed. He keeps it. He remains happy.
