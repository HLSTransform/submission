Once upon a time, in a small house, lived a girl named Amy. Amy had a toy car made of plastic. She loved to play with her car every day. One day, the car broke and Amy was sad. She wanted to fix her car, so she asked her mom for help.
"Mom, can you help me fix my car?" Amy asked. Her mom looked at the broken car and said, "Yes, I can help you. But we need to be careful because the glue we will use is hot."
Amy and her mom worked together to fix the car. They put the hot glue on the broken pieces and carefully put them back together. After a while, the car was fixed and looked like new. Amy was very happy and thanked her mom.
"Thank you, Mom, for helping me fix my car," Amy said with a big smile. Her mom smiled back and said, "You're welcome, Amy. Remember, it's always good to ask for help when you need it."
From that day on, Amy learned the importance of asking for help and working together. She knew that with the help of her mom, she could fix anything that was broken. And they lived happily ever after.
