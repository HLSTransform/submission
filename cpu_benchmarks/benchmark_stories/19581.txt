Once upon a time there was a very special girl. She had an enormous brain. She could do things no one else could. 
She could sort things that were very tricky. Every day she could sort out puzzles with ease. 
One day she was given a really enormous puzzle to sort out. It was so big she wondered if she would ever solve it. But she never gave up. She kept using her enormous brain and sorting the pieces. 
Eventually, piece by piece she sorted the puzzle until it was complete. She was so proud of solving the huge puzzle. 
From that day she was even better at sorting tricky things. She knew her enormous brain could figure out almost anything, so she was never afraid of a challenge.
