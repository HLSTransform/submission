Sara liked to play with her dolls in the sun. She made them have tea and cake on a blanket. She gave them names and voices. She was happy.
But she was also careless. She did not see the big dog that came near. The dog liked to play too. He saw the dolls and the cake. He thought they were toys and food. He ran to them and grabbed them with his mouth.
Sara was scared and sad. She cried out loud. She wanted her dolls and cake back. The dog did not listen. He ran away with them. He was happy.
Sara's mom heard her cry. She came to see what was wrong. She saw the dog and the mess. She hugged Sara and said sorry. She said they would get new dolls and cake. She said they would be more careful next time.
She took Sara inside the house. She gave her a glass of milk and a cookie. She read her a story. She said it was time for a nap. Sara was tired and sleepy. She lay down on her bed. She closed her eyes.
She dreamed of her dolls in the sun. They were shining and smiling. They were happy. Sara was happy too.
