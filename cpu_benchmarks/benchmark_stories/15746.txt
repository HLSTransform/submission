Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very adventurous. She wanted to find something fun to do, so she decided to go outside to find some friends to play with. 
When she went outside, she saw the sun shining in the sky and smiled. She loved how warm and bright it was!
She saw two other children playing in the park nearby, so she ran to join them. She said "Hi! My name is Sally, what are you doing?"
The two children said "We're sharing our toys! We have a lot of fun. Why don't you come and join us?"
Sally was so happy and said "Yes please! I love saying hello, and playing with toys."
The children smiled and said "Great! We can be adventurous and share the sun too!"
Sally and the other children had so much fun sharing toys and the sun together. They laughed, played, and enjoyed the warm sunny day. 
And that's how Sally and her friends shared the sun and had an adventurous day in the park.
