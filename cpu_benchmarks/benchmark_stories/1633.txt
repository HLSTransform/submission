Lily was a girl who liked to demand things. She wanted to have all the toys, all the snacks, and all the attention. She did not like to share or say please or thank you. She thought she was amazing and everyone else was not.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a big slide and ran to it. She did not wait for her turn. She pushed other kids out of the way and climbed up the ladder. She shouted, "This is my slide! Go away!"
But when she got to the top, she saw something that made her stop. There was a boy on the slide who was bigger and stronger than her. He had a red cape and a mask. He looked like a superhero. He said, "This is not your slide. This is my slide. I am amazing and you are not."
Lily felt scared and angry. She tried to demand that he move, but he did not listen. He laughed and slid down the slide. He landed on his feet and ran away. Lily was left alone on the top of the slide. She felt sad and silly. She realized that demanding things was not nice or fun. She wished she had been kind and polite.
She climbed down the slide and looked for her mom. She saw her sitting on a bench with a smile. She ran to her and hugged her. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I was not amazing. I was mean. Can we go home and play with my toys? I will share them with you."
Her mom hugged her back and said, "I'm proud of you, Lily. You learned a good lesson today. You are amazing when you are kind and polite. And I love you very much." They went home and played with the toys. Lily shared them with her mom and said please and thank you. She felt happy and amazing.
