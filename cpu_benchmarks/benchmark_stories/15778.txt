Once upon a time there was a boy named Mikey. Mikey had lots of toys and he loved to play with them all the time. One day, Mikey was playing with his toys in the living room when he heard a loud noise coming from the kitchen. He ran to the kitchen to see what the noise was all about.
When he arrived, Mikey saw that the door of the freezer was wide open. Inside was Mikey's favorite treat – an original popsicle!
Mikey stretched out his hand to reach the popsicle, but it was too far away. Mikey shouted with joy, “Mommy, look! I found a popsicle in the freezer!”
Mikey's mom smiled. She said, “Well, that’s nice, honey. But I’m afraid you’re too short to reach it. Why don’t you ask your dad for help?”
So Mikey asked his dad for help, and his dad was able to reach the popsicle for him. Mikey and his dad enjoyed the original popsicle together, and Mikey was very happy.
