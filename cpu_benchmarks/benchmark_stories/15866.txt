Once upon a time there was a little girl named Ann. Ann liked to play and be silly, but she also liked to write.
Today, Ann was feeling ready to write something special. She had an idea for a poem and wanted to try to write it down. Ann got out some paper and a pencil and started to write. 
Ann's mom came into the room. She asked Ann, "What are you doing?"
Ann said, "Mommy, I'm writing a poem! I'm almost done." Ann was so proud of her poem. She showed it to her mommy.
Her mommy read the poem and said, "Ann, this is amazing! You are so creative and clever."
Ann smiled and said, "Thank you mama! I'm so glad I was ready to write this poem!"
