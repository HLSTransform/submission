Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with puzzles. One day, she went to the store with her mommy and found a unique puzzle. It was very pretty and had lots of colors. Lily asked her mommy to buy it for her and her mommy said yes.
Lily was so happy and started to play with the puzzle. But then she realized that some pieces were missing. She got sad and told her mommy. Her mommy told her to trust her and that she would help her find the missing pieces. So, they looked everywhere and finally found the missing pieces under the couch.
Lily was very happy and finished the puzzle. She was proud of herself and showed it to her mommy. Her mommy was proud too and told her that she could trust her to always help her when she needed it. From that day on, Lily knew that she could trust her mommy and they continued to play with puzzles together.
