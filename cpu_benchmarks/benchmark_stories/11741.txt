One day, Peter wanted to examine his leg. He touched it and noticed it was covered with something blue. He didn't know what it was and he was a little frightened.
"What is that?" Peter asked, pointing to his leg.
His mom smiled and said, "That's a bruise! When you get hurt, your skin can sometimes look blue for a few days. But don't worry, it will go away soon!"
Peter felt relieved that it was only a bruise. He had forgotten he had tripped the day before while playing in the park. He then felt excited to show off his blue bruise to his friends.
Peter continued to examine his leg each day, expecting the bruise to fade away. After a few days, the blue was gone and he was happy. Peter had a new appreciation for the way his skin looked and felt. He laughed, knowing his bruise was not so scary after all.
