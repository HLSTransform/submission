Jimmy and his mum were walking through a big open field. He looked all around him at the colourful flowers and tall trees. His mum told him to close his eyes and surrender to the power of nature. 
Jimmy took a deep breath and did as his mother said. He felt a powerful tingling sensation in his chest. His mum smiled as she saw the joy in Jimmy's eyes.
The pair continued their walk along the path. Jimmy saw a butterfly fluttering ahead, so he ran and chased the butterfly until it flew away. His mum joined in, and the two of them laughed and smiled.
Jimmy's mum put her arm around his shoulder and said, "It's important to remember the power of surrender". Jimmy nodded and hugged his mum with a big smile. 
They resumed their journey together and Jimmy felt the powerful beauty of the nature surrounding him. He knew that no matter what life brought him, surrendering to its power was something he wouldn't forget.
