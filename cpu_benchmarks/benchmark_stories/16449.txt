Lily and Max were playing in the living room. They saw a big pile of magazines on the table. They wanted to look at the pictures and the colors.
"Let's play with the magazines!" Max said.
"Okay!" Lily said.
They grabbed some magazines and started to rip them and throw them in the air. They laughed and made a big mess.
Mom came in and saw what they did. She was very angry. She shouted at them.
"What are you doing? These are my magazines! They are delicate and expensive! You don't care about them at all!"
She took the magazines away from them and threw them in the trash. She sent them to their room without any toys or snacks.
Lily and Max were sad and sorry. They wished they had cared more about the magazines and Mom. They learned a hard lesson.
