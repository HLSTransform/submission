Once upon a time there was a boy. Every night he went to bed, but he did not want to go to bed. He wanted to stay up and play. His Mommy told him that he had to be obedient and go to bed. He always listened to Mommy, so he went to bed.
The boy was tired, so he went right to sleep. His Mommy wanted him to be healthy and strong, so she made sure to give him a drink before he went to bed. She gave him warm milk with honey. He liked the taste and drank it all up. 
The boy was always obedient and he liked drinking his milk before bed. He slept in his bed for 8 hours and then he woke up feeling happy and healthy. He was so glad that he was obedient and always made sure to drink his milk before bed.
