Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was very smart and had a special talent for drawing. He was gifted!
One summer day, Timmy went to the park to draw some pictures. He sat down on a bench and started to draw. Suddenly, he noticed that he had forgotten to lock his bike. 
Timmy got up from the bench and ran to his bike. He quickly locked it up so no one could take it. Then he went back to his drawing. He drew a picture of a big red apple and a green tree. It was a beautiful picture!
When Timmy was finished drawing, he went home to show his mom. She was very proud of him and said that he was a gifted artist. Timmy smiled and felt very happy. The end.
