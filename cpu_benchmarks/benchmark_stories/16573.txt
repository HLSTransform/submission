Tom and Lily were adventurous kids. They liked to explore new places and play with different things. One day, they found a big cord in the garage. It was long and thick and had a plug at one end.
"Look, Lily, a cord!" Tom said. "Let's see what it does."
They dragged the cord to the living room, where there was a wall socket. Tom wanted to plug the cord in, but Lily was scared.
"Tom, don't do that!" Lily said. "It might be dangerous. Mom and Dad said we should not touch cords and plugs."
But Tom did not listen. He was curious and brave. He said, "Don't worry, Lily. Nothing will happen. Let's count to three and then I will plug it in. One, two, three!"
Tom pushed the plug into the socket. But the cord was not a normal cord. It was a broken cord. It had a hole in it and some wires were sticking out. When Tom plugged it in, there was a loud bang and a flash of sparks. Tom and Lily screamed. The cord electrocuted Tom and he fell to the floor. Lily ran to him and cried. She called for Mom and Dad, but they were not home. Tom did not move or talk. He was hurt very badly. Lily wished she had stopped him. She wished they had not played with the cord. She wished they had been more careful.
