Once upon a time, there was a small palace. In this palace lived a special prince. He was very proud of his palace and every day he liked to record what it looked like.
The prince recorded the beautiful walls of the palace and the many windows that let the sunshine in. He recorded the gardens outside and the pretty birds that sang in the trees.
Within the palace the prince recorded the large, round table in the dining room, the magical library and long curtains that hung around the bedrooms. Everywhere he went, the prince would carry a special book and record what he saw.
He was so proud of his small palace and loved every part of it. He would always make sure to capture it forever in his magical book.
