Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved watching movies with her family. One day, they watched a movie about a princess who went on a big adventure to save her kingdom. Lily was so excited to see what would happen next.
But then, something strange happened. Lily's big brother, Max, said that the movie was fake. Lily didn't understand what that meant, so she asked him. Max explained that it meant the story wasn't real, it was just pretend. Lily didn't like that, she wanted the princess to be real.
Lily's mom observed the argument and suggested they watch a different movie. They all agreed and picked a new movie to watch. This time, Lily made sure to ask if it was real or fake before they started watching. She didn't want to get her hopes up again. From that day on, Lily always made sure to ask before watching a movie.
