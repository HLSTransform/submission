Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She went to the store with her mommy to buy a toy. There were many toys to choose from, but Lily wanted a doll. She picked out a beautiful doll with a pretty dress.
When they got to the checkout, the cashier said the doll was very expensive. Lily's mommy had to judge if they could afford it. She decided they could, so she bought the doll for Lily.
Lily was so happy and hugged her new doll. She knew she made the right choice. She played with her doll all day and loved it very much.
