Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat sandwiches from the subway. He would ask his mom to take him there every week. 
One day, Timmy saw his friend Billy eating a big sandwich. Timmy asked, "Billy, where did you get that big sandwich?" 
"I made it myself," said Billy. "I own a sandwich maker. It helps me make sandwiches that fit perfectly in my tummy." 
Timmy was amazed. He wanted to own a sandwich maker too so he could make big sandwiches like Billy. So, Timmy asked his mom to buy him a sandwich maker. And from that day on, Timmy made his own sandwiches that fit perfectly in his tummy, just like Billy.
