Mr. and Mrs. Rabbit were getting ready for bed. They both closed their eyes and Mrs. Rabbit blew out the candle near their bed. 
Mr. Rabbit asked, “Why are we blowing out the candle?”
Mrs. Rabbit replied, “It’s an ordinary thing to do when you go to sleep.”
“Oh! That’s cool!” replied Mr. Rabbit.
The two Rabbits closed their eyes and went to sleep. 
When they woke up the next morning, Mrs. Rabbit lit the candle again. 
The Rabbits enjoyed the gentle light and knew it was time to start their day.
