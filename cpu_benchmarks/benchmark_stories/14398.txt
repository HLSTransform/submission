Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends decided to go on an adventure in the forest. They walked for a long time until they found a big tree with a sharp branch. 
Lily's friend, Timmy, wanted to climb the tree, but Lily said, "Be careful, Timmy. That branch looks sharp!" Timmy climbed the tree anyway, but when he reached the top, he slipped and got a big cut on his hand. Lily felt sorry for Timmy and helped him bandage his wound. 
As they continued their adventure, they noticed the mist was getting thicker and thicker. They couldn't see where they were going, so they decided to turn back. On their way back, they saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky. Lily said, "Look, a rainbow! That means everything will be okay." And it was. They made it back to the park safely and had a picnic to celebrate their adventure.
