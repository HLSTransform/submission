Once upon a time, there were two friends - a monkey and a bird. The monkey was always eager to explore the world, while the bird was always eager to take pictures of new places with her camera.
One day, the two friends decided to go to the jungle. As they were walking, the monkey noticed an old bridge and wanted to cross it. The bird asked the monkey to be careful and not take too many risks. But the monkey was too eager and he started to climb without looking. Suddenly, the bridge collapsed and the monkey fell into the river.
The bird was so scared! She quickly took out her camera and clicked a few pictures of the incident. Then she ran to the river bank and started to speak. She begged and pleaded for the monkey to come out of the water. After a few moments, the monkey emerged from the water, safe and sound.
The bird and the monkey had learnt a valuable lesson - take risks, but be careful! Taking pictures can help you remember important moments in life, but you must always be careful.
