Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play soccer with his friends. One day, Timmy's team was losing the game. Timmy wanted to help his team score a goal, so he ran as fast as he could with the ball. He kicked the ball and it went into the goal! Timmy was so lucky that he scored the goal. 
After the game, Timmy's friends congratulated him. They all wanted to touch the ball that Timmy used to score the goal. Timmy was happy to share the ball with his friends. They all touched the ball and said, "Wow, this ball is lucky!" From that day on, Timmy's friends called him "Lucky Timmy" because he scored the winning goal.
