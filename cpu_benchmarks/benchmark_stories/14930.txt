Eva and her father were playing in the park. Eva was bouncing up and down on the trampoline as her dad watched in delight. 
"I'm a guard!" Eva exclaimed proudly as she jumped higher and higher. 
"That's fantastic! " Dad cheered, "You are a very good guard!" 
Eva giggled with glee as she continued to bounce. They soon noticed a deep pond nearby and went explore it. 
Eva's dad took one look in the pond and gasped. "Look, Eva! It's full of frogs!" he cried. 
Eva was excited. She ran up to the pond and bounced up and down in front of it, trying to get a better view. 
"Look, Dad!" she cried, pointing to a huge green frog hopping around in the deep water. 
Dad smiled as he watched his daughter bouncing and laughing. Together, the two of them enjoyed the beautiful sights of the pond and its inhabitants.
