Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lily. On every Wednesday, she would go to the park with her mom. 
Every Wednesday, they would take a yellow ball with them. Lily loved that ball and she would play with it all day long.
Today was Wednesday and the sky was yellow. Lily and her mom went to the park and the bright yellow ball made Lily happy. She ran around it, trying to catch it.
Suddenly the wind began to blow, making the yellow ball jump away. Lily wasn't able to get the ball and she started to shake. Her mom saw this, so she ran towards the ball and put it into Lily's hands. 
Lily was very happy now and she hugged the yellow ball tight. She smiled, knowing that Wednesday was just as amazing as it always was.
