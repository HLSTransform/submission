Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his blocks. He had a big pile of blocks that he would stack up and knock down. One day, Timmy received a new set of blocks from his grandma. He was so excited to play with them!
Timmy started building a tall tower with his new blocks. But then, his little sister came over and accidentally knocked it down. Timmy got very mad and threw his blocks all over the room. His mom came in and told him he couldn't play with his blocks anymore because he was being too rough.
Timmy was sad that he couldn't play with his blocks anymore. He realized that he should have been more careful and not let his anger take over. From then on, he tried to be more patient and gentle with his toys.
