Once upon a time, there lived a playful girl named Lola. Every day was an adventure for her, and she enjoyed exploring the town around her. 
One day, when Lola was walking through the town, she noticed a ball in front of her. She was so excited, she ran across the street and quickly kicked the ball, sending it flying up into the air. 
As she reached to catch it again, she heard a voice from behind. It said, “Whoa- that was a cool kick! You should join us for our weekly game!” 
Lola looked around and saw a group of people playing a friendly game of soccer. She was so excited she wanted to join in. 
But before she could move, the voice said to her, “Hold up! Before you join, you must practice. We want you to be the best player in the town!” 
Lola smiled. She knew with some practice, she could become the best soccer player in the town. She quickly ran off to the field to practice her kicks. 
And from that day on, she became the most skilled and playful player in the entire town. Everyone was amazed at the fantastic kicks she could do!
