Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved going to the store with her mom. One day, they went to a new store. Mia saw a filthy toy on the floor. "Mom, look at this dirty toy!" she said. Her mom told her to remember not to touch it.
The next day, Mia and her mom went back to the store. Mia wanted to see if the filthy toy was still there. When they got there, the toy was gone. Mia asked her mom, "Where did the toy go?" Her mom said, "Someone must have cleaned it up."
A few days later, Mia's birthday came. Mia got a big box from her mom. She opened it and saw the same toy from the store, but now it was clean and shiny! Mia was so happy. "I remember this toy, mom! Thank you for cleaning it for me!" she said. Her mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, Mia. Happy birthday!"
