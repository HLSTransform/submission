Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Sam. He was playing hide and seek with his friends. Sam wanted to be the first one to hide, so he quickly ran and hid in a big bush. But when he was hiding, he saw something scary! It was a ghost!
The ghost was very big and it was making loud, angry noises. Sam was scared but he could not move. He was too scared to come out of the bush.
But then, his friends came to the same bush. They did not see the ghost. They started to cover up Sam with leaves, because they thought he was still playing hide and seek.
But as soon as the leaves touched Sam, the ghost got even angrier. It started to throw pieces of rocks and sticks at them. Sam and his friends ran away as fast as they could. They all survived and never saw that ghost ever again!
