Once upon a time, there was a playful dog named Spot. Spot loved to run and jump in the park. He liked to chase the birds and the squirrels. Spot had many friends in the park who would admire how fast and happy he was.
One day, Spot met a new friend named Oxy. Oxy was a special friend because he was made of oxygen. Oxygen is something we all need to breathe. Oxy was very good at helping people and animals get the air they need.
Spot and Oxy became best friends. They played together every day in the park. All the other animals admired Spot and Oxy for being such good friends. And with Oxy's help, Spot could run and play even more than before. They lived happily ever after.
