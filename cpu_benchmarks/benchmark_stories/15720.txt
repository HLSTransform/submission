Little Jane and her mommy were in the kitchen making dinner. Jane watched as her mommy grabbed a spoon from the drawer.
"What are we going to do with the spoon, Mommy?" Jane asked.
"We are going to stir the soup, sweetie," her mommy told her. 
Jane smiled as she watched her mommy stir the soup. She liked to help her mommy cook.
"Can I stir too?" Jane asked.
"Sure thing!" her mommy said.
Jane took the ordinary spoon, feeling excited to stir. She held the spoon over the soup, carefully stirring it round and round.
"Does it feel good to stir the soup?" asked her mommy.
"Yes!" said Jane, feeling so happy. Her mommy smiled and they finished making dinner together.
