Ben liked to print pictures with his crayons. He had many crayons of different colors in his drawer. He liked to print animals, like dogs and cats and birds. He also liked to print his family, like his mom and dad and baby sister.
One day, he wanted to print a picture of his fish. His fish was blue and shiny and lived in a bowl on his desk. He opened his drawer and looked for a blue crayon. But he could not find one. He only saw red and green and yellow and brown crayons. He was sad. He asked his mom, "Mom, where is my blue crayon? I want to print my fish."
His mom came to his room and looked in his drawer. She said, "I'm sorry, Ben, but your blue crayon is dead. You used it too much and it broke into pieces. You need a new blue crayon."
Ben was confused. He said, "How can a crayon be dead? It is not alive. It is not like my fish."
His mom said, "Well, a crayon is not alive like your fish, but it can still be dead. It means that it can't do what it is supposed to do anymore. It can't print anymore. It is useless."
Ben understood. He said, "Oh, I see. That is sad. Can we get a new blue crayon, mom?"
His mom said, "Yes, we can. We can go to the store and buy a new blue crayon. And maybe some other colors too. Would you like that?"
Ben smiled. He said, "Yes, I would. Thank you, mom. Can I print my fish later?"
His mom said, "Of course, you can. But first, let's check on your fish. Maybe he is hungry."
They went to his desk and looked at his fish. But his fish was not moving. He was floating on the water. He was dead too. Ben was shocked. He said, "Mom, look! My fish is dead! What happened?"
His mom said, "Oh, no, Ben, I'm so sorry. Your fish is dead. He was old and sick. He couldn't breathe anymore. He is gone."
Ben was sad. He said, "But I loved my fish. He was my friend. I wanted to print him."
His mom hugged him. She said, "I know, Ben, I know. It is hard to lose someone you love. But you can still print him. You can print him from your memory. You can print how he looked and how he made you feel. You can print him as a way to say goodbye."
Ben nodded. He said, "Okay, mom. I will do that. I will print my fish. And I will print a blue crayon too. To remember him."
His mom said, "That is a good idea, Ben. That is a very good idea."
