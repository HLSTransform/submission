Lila and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a new thing in the park. It is green and has many sharp points. Lila and Tom are curious.
"What is that?" Lila asks.
"I don't know. Let's go and see," Tom says.
They walk to the new thing. It is a cactus. A sign says "Do not touch. It can hurt you."
Lila and Tom look at the cactus. They see some flowers on it. The flowers are pink and yellow. They are pretty.
"Wow, the cactus has flowers!" Lila says.
"Yes, it does. They are nice," Tom says.
They smile at the cactus. They think it is a good thing. They are happy to see something new.
"Can we say hello to the cactus?" Lila asks.
"Sure, we can. But we have to be careful. We can't touch it," Tom says.
They wave to the cactus. They say "Hello, cactus. You are pretty. We like you."
The cactus does not say anything. But it seems to smile back at them. Lila and Tom are glad. They have made a new friend.
