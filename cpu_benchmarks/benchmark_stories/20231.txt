Tom and Lily are twins. They live in a big house with Mom and Dad. They like to play in the yard and look at the sky. Sometimes they see birds and clouds and stars.
One day, they wake up early and go outside. They see a big balloon in the sky. It is red and yellow and blue. It is very pretty. They hear a voice from the balloon.
"Hello, children! Do you want to fly with me?" the voice says.
Tom and Lily are surprised and excited. They run to the fence and wave.
"Yes, please! We want to fly!" they shout.
The balloon comes down and lands near the fence. A man with a hat and a smile comes out. He has a basket with ropes.
"Come on, then! Hop in the basket! I will take you for a ride!" he says.
Tom and Lily look at each other and nod. They climb over the fence and get in the basket. The man pulls a string and the balloon starts to rise. Tom and Lily feel the wind and the sun. They see their house and their yard and their street. They see other houses and cars and trees. They see the river and the bridge and the park. They see everything from above. They feel happy and amazed.
"This is great!" Tom says.
"This is fun!" Lily says.
The man smiles and nods. He says, "This is the magic of flying!"
