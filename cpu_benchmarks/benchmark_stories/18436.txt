Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside and run around with his friends. One day, Tim and his friends decided to play a game of tag. They ran around and had lots of fun, but then Tim saw a tree with a big branch that looked perfect for hanging. Tim climbed up the tree and hung from the branch. His friends saw him and started to copy him, so they all hung from the branch together. They swung back and forth in motion and laughed so hard that their bellies hurt. Tim felt happy that he could share his fun idea with his friends. The end.
