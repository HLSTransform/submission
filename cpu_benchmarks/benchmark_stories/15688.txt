Once upon a time there was a kind girl, who loved to give. One day she asked her mom for some pocket money. 
"Mom, please can I have some money?" The girl asked. 
Mom smiled and said, "Yes, sweetheart, how much do you need?" 
The girl thought for a moment and said, "I need five coins, please!". 
Mom replied, "Yes, here you go. You can use it to buy something nice. 
The girl thanked her mom and headed out to the store. When she arrived, she looked around and saw many things she wanted. But then, she saw a pretty toy that was yet cheap. 
She looked at it and said, "Mom, can I have this?" 
Mom replied, "Yes, sweetheart, if it's cheap, you can take it." 
The girl smiled and quickly picked up the toy. She was so happy with her new toy. From then on, the girl was always looking for cheap toys whenever she went out to the store.
