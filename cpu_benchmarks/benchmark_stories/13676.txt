Tom and Sam were friends. They liked to play with firework. They found a big firework in a sack. They wanted to see it go boom.
They took the firework to the park. They looked for a good place to light it. They saw a big hill. They said, "Let's go there!"
They ran to the hill with the firework. They put the firework on the ground. They took a match from the sack. They lit the firework.
But the firework was not a good firework. It was a bad firework. It did not go boom in the sky. It went boom on the ground. It made a big fire. The fire spread to the grass and the trees.
Tom and Sam were scared. They tried to run away. But the fire was too fast. It caught them. They screamed. They got hurt. They cried.
The firework was a bad firework. It made a bad ending.
