Bob was getting ready to go to work. He put on his uniform and was getting ready to leave the house. But then he paused. He remembered he had forgotten something very important. He had forgotten his lunch! He felt so stupid.
He quickly got off the uniform and dashed to the kitchen. He quickly packed some lunch and hurried back into the uniform. He paused for a moment, making sure that he had remembered everything for this time. He hadn't forgotten anything else, which made him relieved.
He was now ready for work. As he was about to open the door he paused for one final time. He gave himself a pat on the back for being so smart and remembering his lunch. He smiled and went straight to work. He was confident that today would be a good day.
