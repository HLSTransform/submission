Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play outside at night. They looked at the stars and the moon and made wishes. One night, they saw a big, bright moon in the sky. It was round and yellow and beautiful.
"Wow, look at the moon!" Lily said. "I wish I could have it. It would be my best toy ever."
"I wish I could have it too," Ben said. "It would be my best friend ever."
They both wanted the moon very much. They started to argue and fight over who should get it. They pulled each other's hair and scratched each other's faces. They were very mean and loud.
The moon heard them and felt sad. It did not like to see them fight. It wanted them to be happy and kind. It decided to do something. It made itself smaller and smaller until it was as small as a ball. Then it fell from the sky and landed near Lily and Ben.
They stopped fighting and looked at the moon. They were surprised and curious. They picked it up and felt it. It was cold and hard and smooth. It did not shine or smile. It did not look like a toy or a friend. It looked like a rock.
They did not like the moon anymore. They felt sorry and ashamed. They realized they had been greedy and selfish. They had hurt each other and the moon. They wished they could make it better.
They hugged each other and said sorry. They said sorry to the moon too. They asked it to go back to the sky and be big and bright again. They said they would share it and love it and never fight over it again.
The moon heard them and felt happy. It forgave them and smiled. It made itself bigger and bigger until it was as big as before. Then it flew back to the sky and shone over Lily and Ben. It winked at them and said, "Thank you for being good and giving. You have learned a valuable lesson. The moon is for everyone to enjoy and admire. It is not for anyone to own or take. It is a gift from the sky. Be grateful and generous and you will always have the moon in your heart."
Lily and Ben smiled and nodded. They thanked the moon and said good night. They held hands and went back to their house. They were happy and warm and sleepy. They dreamed of the moon and the stars and their wishes. They were good twins who loved each other and the moon.
