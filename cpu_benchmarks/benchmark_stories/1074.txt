Daniel liked to play in his backyard. One sunny day, he noticed a big tree that gave a lot of shade. He thought it looked like a great place to play so he ran over to it.
When he got to the tree, he saw a rabbit under there. The rabbit was hopping around. Daniel was so excited. He wanted to talk to the rabbit, so he said, "Hello, Rabbit!"
The rabbit stopped hopping and looked at Daniel. Daniel started to discuss why the tree was so nice and cool. The rabbit agreed, saying it was a kind shade for them to play in. They talked and talked about how much fun it would be to play together. 
Daniel and the rabbit became great friends. Every time the sun was out, they would meet under the tree shade and discuss their day. They even shared snacks together. 
Daniel was so happy to have such a kind friend. He thanked the rabbit every day for being so friendly.
