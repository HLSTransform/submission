Ben is a small boy who likes to draw. He has many crayons and papers at home, but he also likes to draw on the blackboard at school. He thinks he can make beautiful pictures with the chalk.
One day, he sees a big blackboard in the hall. It is for the big kids who are learning to write. Ben thinks it would be fun to draw on it. He sneaks into the hall when no one is looking and picks up a white chalk. He starts to draw a big sun, a house, a tree, and a cat.
But he does not see that Miss Lee, the teacher, is coming. She sees Ben drawing on the blackboard and gets angry. She says, "Ben, what are you doing? This is not your blackboard. This is for the big kids. You are making a mess. You have to erase it now."
Ben feels sad and scared. He says, "I'm sorry, Miss Lee. I just wanted to draw. I think it is pretty."
Miss Lee says, "I know you like to draw, Ben, but you have to respect other people's things. You can draw on your own blackboard or on paper, but not on someone else's. That is not nice. Do you understand?"
Ben nods and says, "Yes, Miss Lee. I understand. I will not do it again."
Miss Lee gives him a cloth and helps him erase his drawing. She says, "That's good, Ben. I'm glad you learned your lesson. Next time, ask before you use something that is not yours. And remember, you can always show me your drawings. I think they are pretty, too."
Ben smiles and says, "Thank you, Miss Lee. You are very kind."
The moral of the story is: Respect other people's things and ask before you use them.
