Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a blue dress that she loved to wear every day. One day, Lily met an old man who was sitting on a bench. He looked sad, so she went to talk to him. 
"Hi, Mister. Why do you look sad?" asked Lily. 
"I hate being alone," said the old man. 
Lily felt sorry for him and sat down next to him. They talked for a while and Lily learned that the old man had no family or friends to talk to. She realized that she could be his friend and make him happy. 
From that day on, Lily visited the old man every day, bringing him cookies and telling him stories. The old man was very grateful and happy to have a friend. Lily learned that helping others can make them happy and that age doesn't matter when it comes to making friends.
