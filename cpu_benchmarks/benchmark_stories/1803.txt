Once upon a time, there was a brave girl who loved books. Her favourite place was the library; she went there every day. When she was there the brave girl liked to record different stories that she heard. She wrote them down in her notebook and made An illustrated book.
The brave girl would go to different places in the library and ask the librarian questions, and record the answers. She made all sorts of stories, from fairy tales to scary stories. She was very proud of her work!
One day, the brave girl was feeling extra brave. She went to the highest shelf in the library and took books that were much too big for her. Then, she went to a special room and recorded her own stories. She was so happy with what she heard!
The brave girl wrote and recorded stories every day. She loved spending time in the library learning new words, and recording different stories. Soon, she was the bravest girl in the library!
