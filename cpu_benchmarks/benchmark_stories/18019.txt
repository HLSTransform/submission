Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to eat carrots. He would hop high and low to find the juiciest and crunchiest carrots. 
One day, Benny saw his friend, a little bird named Billy, trying to fly high up in the sky. But Billy was having a hard time and kept falling down. Benny wanted to help his friend, so he thought of a plan. 
He brought Billy a carrot and said, "If you eat this carrot, you will have the energy to fly high up in the sky!" Billy ate the carrot and suddenly felt strong. He flapped his wings and flew higher than he ever had before. 
All the other animals in the forest saw Billy's amazing flight and applauded him. Benny felt happy that he was able to help his friend and learned that helping others can make you feel good too.
