Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to go to the mall with her. Lily was very excited and said, "Yes, I want to go to the mall!"
Lily's mom drove the car to the mall. They parked the car and went inside. They walked around and looked at all the stores. Lily saw a toy that she really wanted, but her mom said they couldn't buy it today.
Suddenly, there was a loud noise. Lily's mom looked outside and saw that a car had crashed into their car. The driver was not paying attention and it was a very bad accident. Lily and her mom were not hurt, but their car was very damaged.
Lily's mom told her that it's important to always be careful when you drive. Even though it may seem harmless to not pay attention, it can cause harm to others. The moral of the story is to always be careful and pay attention when you drive.
