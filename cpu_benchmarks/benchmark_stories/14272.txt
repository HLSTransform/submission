Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved to swim. Every day, she would put on her bathing suit, float over to the pool, and dive right in.
One night, the girl put on her bathing suit and grabbed her goggles. She was ready to go swimming!
But as she looked into the pool, she noticed that something was different. There were hundreds of candles floating on the water, and it was so beautiful. She jumped right in and started to swim around the pool.
The girl was surrounded by the colorful candles and she made a wish. Before she knew it, the candles were gone and her wish came true.
The girl had a very special night. She was so happy and so ready to swim.
