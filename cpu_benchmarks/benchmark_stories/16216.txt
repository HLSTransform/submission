Lily and her mommy were playing outside. "I'm so excited to play sport," Lily said with a big smile.
Lily's mommy smiled back at her, "I'm excited too! Let's shake it up!"
Lily and her mommy jumped around and shook their arms and legs all around. Suddenly, Lily saw a person standing nearby. She asked curiously, "Who is that?"
"Oh, that's just Bob," her Mommy said. "He's being very ignorant and won't join us in our sport."
Lily was confused. "What's 'ignorant' mean?"
"It means he doesn't want to play," her Mommy said.
Lily shook her head. "That's silly!" she said. "Everyone loves to play!"
So, Lily and her mommy kept playing and shaking until Bob finally joined in. Soon they were all happily jumping around and having fun!
