Once upon a time there was a bunny who loved to hop. He'd hop all day and night, no matter where he was. 
One day, the bunny hopped into a mysterious room. He saw a phone on the floor and decided to hop over to take a closer look. When he got to the phone, he was surprised to hear it ringing! 
The bunny picked it up and heard a voice on the other end. The voice said, "I'm looking for the mysterious phone, have you seen it?" 
The shocked bunny replied, "Yes, I have! I'm standing right next to it." The voice thanked the bunny and hung up.  
The bunny then realized that the mysterious phone must be his! He was so excited and began to hop all around the room. 
He took the phone with him and never looked back. From that day on, the bunny was always hopping and talking on his mysterious phone.
