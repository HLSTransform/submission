Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. They saw a big tree with many leaves. They wanted to climb the tree and see the birds.
They went to the tree and tried to climb. But the tree was too high and the bark was too rough. They could not reach the branches. They felt sad and sat on the grass.
"Look, Ben, I have gum!" Lily said. She took out a pink gum from her pocket. She liked to chew gum and make bubbles. "Do you want some?"
"Yes, please!" Ben said. He took a piece of gum from Lily and put it in his mouth. He chewed and chewed. He tried to make a bubble, but it popped on his face. He laughed and wiped his face.
"Let's use the gum to help us climb the tree!" Lily said. She had an idea. She took out more gum and gave some to Ben. They chewed and chewed. They made big balls of gum with their mouths. They stuck the gum on the tree trunk. They made steps with the gum. They climbed on the gum steps and reached the branches. They were happy and proud.
They saw many birds on the tree. They saw a blue bird, a red bird, a yellow bird and a black bird. They sang with the birds and watched them fly. They felt like they were flying too.
But then they heard a loud noise. It was the park keeper. He saw the gum on the tree and was angry. He had a pale face and a big hat. He shouted at Ben and Lily.
"Hey, you two, get down from there! What have you done to the tree? You have made a mess with your gum! That is not nice! You have to clean it up!"
Ben and Lily were scared. They climbed down from the tree. They said sorry to the park keeper. They tried to take off the gum from the tree, but it was hard and sticky. They needed more help. They asked their friends to help them. They all worked together and cleaned the tree. They learned a lesson. They decided to use their gum for bubbles, not for climbing. They said goodbye to the birds and the tree. They went home with their friends. They were still happy, but they were more careful.
