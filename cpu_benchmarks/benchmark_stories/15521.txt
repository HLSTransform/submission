Once upon a time there was a small boy named Jack. He loved to go on adventures. One day he decided to explore the woods near his house. As he walked through the woods, he noticed a vine growing on a tall tree. Jack had never seen a vine before, so he wanted to try it. He reached up and plucked one of the grapes off of the vine. He put it in his mouth and it tasted very bitter. 
Jack thought about the vine for a long time. He wanted to know what else was including on the vine. He ran back to his house and grabbed his big basket. He put on his special hat and went back to the vine. 
Jack filled up his basket with all the things that were on the vine. He put some of the grapes, as well as leaves, stems and flowers. He was very proud of his basket, which included all sorts of things from the vine. 
Jack had an idea. He decided to take the things he collected home and have a special snack. So he went back home and made a yummy treat with the leaves, flowers and bitter grapes. He savored the snack, happy that he had explored the vine and found so many tasty things to include in his special treat.
