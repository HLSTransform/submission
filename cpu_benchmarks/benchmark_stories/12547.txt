Tom and Mia are twins. They like to play in the park. They see many things in the park. They see birds, flowers, dogs, and swings.
One day, they find a small twig on the ground. It is brown and thin. Tom picks it up and looks at it. He says, "This is a stick. I can use it to draw in the sand." He draws a circle and a smiley face in the sand.
Mia looks at the twig and says, "This is not a stick. This is a wand. I can use it to do magic." She waves the twig and says, "Abracadabra! I turn you into a frog!"
Tom laughs and says, "You are silly. You cannot do magic. You are not a fairy. You are my sister."
Mia says, "I am a fairy. And you are a frog. Ribbit, ribbit!" She hops around the sand.
Tom and Mia have fun with the small twig. They pretend to be different things. They are happy.
