Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a castle far away. She was a very gentle princess, who smiled gently and had a kind heart.
One day, the princess was walking through the forest when she heard a loud noise coming from the distance. The noise was getting louder and louder. She quickly realised that it was a monster and it was coming closer!
The princess started to run and quickly, very quickly, she ran back to her castle. She opened the door and hurried inside. The princess was scared, but she remembered to close the big door behind her, so the monster couldn't follow.
The princess was safe now, she was so relieved. She went to the kitchen and made herself a nice cup of warm milk to drink. It was a mild, sweet drink and it made her feel much better.
The princess slowly started to relax, but then she remembered that she still had to save the people from the danger. She put on her princely clothes and ran outside to save the people from the monster. Hurry princess!
