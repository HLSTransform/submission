Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her backyard with her toys. One day, her mommy asked her to help prune the bushes. Lily didn't want to, but her mommy said it was important to keep the backyard nice and neat.
Lily started to prune the bushes, but she got bored quickly. She saw a butterfly and wanted to chase it instead. Her mommy told her to focus on pruning and ignore the butterfly for now.
Lily finished pruning and sat down on the grass. She looked at the peaceful sky and said, "Mommy, can we play now?" Her mommy smiled and said, "Yes, we can play now." They played together until it was time for dinner. Lily was happy she helped her mommy and had a fun day.
