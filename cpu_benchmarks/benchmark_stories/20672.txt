One cold night, a dad and his daughter were walking in the snow. They stopped when they saw an igloo. It was very tall and looked very strange in the snow. Dad said, "We can spend the night here. It will be warm and cozy."
The daughter looked at the igloo in wonder. She stepped inside and said, "It's so nice in here!" Dad said, "Yes, it is!" He came in and hugged his daughter.
The night was cold, but the igloo kept them warm. The harsh wind and snow could not get into the igloo. They felt safe and happy and snuggled up together.
When the morning came, they were still curled up in a hug. The daughter said, "Can we come back here one day?" Dad said, "Yes, of course! Let's always come back here when it's cold outside." They hugged each other tightly and slept in the igloo.
