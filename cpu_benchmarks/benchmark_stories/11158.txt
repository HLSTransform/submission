Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the woods near her house. One day, she found a big barrel in the woods. It was very dirty and disgusting. 
Lily wanted to write her name on the barrel, so she took out a marker from her pocket and started writing. But suddenly, she heard a loud noise. It was a bear! The bear was angry and started chasing Lily. 
Lily ran as fast as she could, but she tripped and fell. The bear caught up to her and took the marker from her hand. The bear wrote something on the barrel and then ran away. When Lily looked at the barrel, she saw that the bear wrote "Mine". 
Lily was very sad and scared. She ran back home and told her parents what happened. They called the forest rangers and they found the bear. Unfortunately, the bear had to be put down because it was becoming too dangerous for people to be around. Lily learned that it's important to respect nature and not write on things that don't belong to her.
