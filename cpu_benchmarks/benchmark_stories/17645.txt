The sun was shining and the birds were singing in the beautiful day. Little Sally was playing in the park. She was so happy - she had found something special - it was an adorable stamp.
She started to show it to her mom, when she saw something else. It was a poor little puppy, swimming in the lake. It looked like it was in trouble!
Sally knew what to do - she had to save the puppy. She ran over to the lake and scooped it up in her arms. She ran back to the park and gave it to her mom.
The puppy was so thankful and gave Sally a big kiss on her cheek. Sally was so proud that she had saved the puppy and her mom was so proud of her too. 
Later, Sally put the stamp in a special box - it was a reminder of her special day and she thought it was just adorable.
