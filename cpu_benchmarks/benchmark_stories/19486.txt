Mommy and Daddy were sorting out the house when someone loud knocked on the door. Mommy went to answer it and saw a stranger. Mommy was a bit worried and said "Hello, who are you?" The stranger said they were looking for the park. Mommy pointed the way and asked the stranger to be careful.
After the stranger left, Mommy and Daddy kept sorting. As they worked, they heard someone loud laughing. It was a different stranger! This time it was an old lady. She asked when the park opened and Mommy laughed because it was always open.
Mommy and Daddy finished sorting and then said goodbye to the old lady. They watched as she walked away, still laughing. They were glad to be done sorting and back to their normal world.
