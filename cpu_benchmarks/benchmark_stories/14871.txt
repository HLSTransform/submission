Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play dress up in her mommy's wardrobe. One day, she found a pretty dress that she wanted to wear, but it was too small. "Mommy, can you stretch this dress for me?" she asked.
Mommy looked at the dress and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I can't stretch it. It's too small for you."
Lily got angry and stomped her feet. "But I really want to wear it!" she exclaimed.
Mommy smiled and said, "Don't worry, Lily. We can go to the store and find a dress that fits you perfectly."
Lily's face lit up with excitement. She hugged her mommy and said, "Thank you, mommy! You're the best!"
