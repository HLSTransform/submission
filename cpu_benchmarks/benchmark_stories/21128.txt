Once upon a time, there was a big, smelly piano. It lived in a small house with a happy family. The family loved to play and sing together. They would laugh and dance when they heard the piano's music.
One day, a little girl named Sally came to visit the family. She saw the smelly piano and wanted to play it. Sally touched the keys and made a funny sound. Everyone laughed and clapped their hands.
Sally played the piano every day. The more she played, the less smelly the piano became. Soon, the piano was not smelly anymore. The family and Sally were very happy. They laughed, played, and danced together with their new, clean piano.
