Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One evening, she wanted to have a tea party with her teddy bears. She asked her mom to help her organize the tea party. Her mom said yes and they started to get everything ready. They put a charming tablecloth on the table and arranged the tea cups and saucers. Then they made some cookies and sandwiches. When it was all done, Lily and her teddy bears had a lovely tea party. They had so much fun that they decided to organize another one soon.
