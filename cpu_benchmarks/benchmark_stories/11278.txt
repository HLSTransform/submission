Once there was a little girl called Bella. She was three years old and had a special toy. Every day when Bella woke up, she would take her toy with her everywhere she went.
On this particular day, Bella and her parents went to the store. Her parents were looking around, but Bella kept holding onto her toy. The storekeeper saw Bella with her toy and asked her if she would like to buy it.
"No, I already have this toy," she replied. 
The storekeeper then said, "Ah well, maybe next time. That toy is quite expensive so remember to be good and behave. It's worth it!"
Bella nodded, thanked the storekeeper and continued on her way. She felt excited and made sure to be good and behave all day.
When night time rolled around, Bella was playing with her special toy when her parents came into the room. They brought with them a small box. Bella opened it and inside was the exact same toy from the store.
"We thought you'd like to have it, even though it was such a high price. You did so well and behaved all day, it was worth it!" her parents said. 
Bella was shocked and excited. She hugged her parents and thanked them for the toy. She felt grateful for the special gift and continued to remember to always behave.
