Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big dog with a cop. The dog had a yellow coat and a black nose. The cop had a blue hat and a shiny badge.
"Look, Ben, a dog!" Lily said. She was excited. She loved dogs. She wanted to pet the dog.
"Wait, Lily, we have to ask first," Ben said. He was careful. He knew some dogs could be mean. He wanted to be safe.
They ran to the cop and the dog. The cop smiled at them. The dog wagged his tail.
"Hello, kids, this is Rex. He is a police dog. He helps me catch bad guys," the cop said.
"Wow, can we pet him?" Lily asked.
"Sure, but be gentle. He is very strong and fast. He can spring and catch a ball in the air," the cop said.
He threw a ball for Rex. Rex sprang and caught it. He brought it back to the cop. Lily and Ben clapped and laughed.
"Rex is amazing! Can we play with him?" Ben asked.
"Sorry, kids, we have to go. We have work to do. But you can say bye to Rex," the cop said.
Lily and Ben hugged Rex and said bye. Rex licked their faces. The cop waved and walked away with Rex.
Lily and Ben went back to their games. They were happy. They had met a cop and a dog. They had seen Rex spring and catch a ball. They had a fun day in the park.
