Once upon a time, there was a wide tree. It had many objects hanging from it. One day, a little boy named Tim saw the tree. He wanted to take an object from it.
Tim's mom said, "Do not take the object. You will be punished." But Tim did not listen. He took the object when his mom was not looking. He felt happy, but he knew he did something wrong.
Later, Tim's mom found out. She punished him by taking away his toy. Tim was sad. He learned that he should always listen to his mom. He promised to be good from now on.
