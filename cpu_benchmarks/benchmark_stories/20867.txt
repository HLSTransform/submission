Once upon a time there lived a little boy called Jack. He was a very eager boy and always wanted to do something.
One day he was in a field and he saw a cell. He was very curious and went to have a closer look. Jack was so eager to see what was inside the cell that he ran towards it. 
As he was looking through, he heard someone say “Hey! What are you doing?”. It was a little rabbit and it had instinctively hopped onto the seat near the cell.
Jack was so excited to see the rabbit, he said “Hi! I'm Jack. I wanted to take a peek inside the cell.” 
The rabbit looked up at Jack and smiled. In a friendly voice, it said, “Go ahead and take a look. I'm sure you'll find something interesting in there.” 
Jack popped his head in and immediately noticed a little nest in the corner. It was full of colorful eggs and he was ever so eager to touch them.
The rabbit said, “Be careful! Those are my eggs and should be treated with respect.”
Jack giggled with joy and carefully touched the eggs. He thanked the rabbit and said his goodbyes, before heading back to his house with a smile on his face.
