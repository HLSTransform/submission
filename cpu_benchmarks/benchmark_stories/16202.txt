Once upon a time there was a small bald boy called Toby. Toby was curious about everything and wanted to explore the world.
One day, Toby's family was moving house and Toby was helping to move the things from one house to the next. Toby was excited and couldn't wait to see what was inside the cupboard.
Toby and his dad were unpacking the cupboard and Toby had lots of questions. “Daddy, what’s in the cupboard?” he asked.
His dad smiled and said, “Let’s find out together!” 
Toby and his dad looked in the cupboard and saw some old, dusty boxes. Toby couldn't wait to see what was inside them.
His dad opened one of the boxes and Toby's eyes widened. Inside were puzzles and games. Toby was so excited, he wanted to solve the puzzles and play the games.
His dad helped Toby solve the puzzles and Toby felt proud of himself for completing them. With his dad's help, he solved each one and was amazed at how fun it was.
His dad smiled and said, “Well done, Toby! You are so clever!”
Toby smiled happily, feeling proud of himself for being able to solve the puzzles. He was ready for the next adventure.
