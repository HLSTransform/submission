Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play in the park with his friends. One day, Timmy and his friends decided to play a game of hide-and-seek. Timmy was very good at hiding and he found a great spot behind a big tree. 
As Timmy was hiding, he saw a ghost! The ghost was white and see-through and it scared Timmy. But then the ghost spoke and said, "Don't be afraid, Timmy. I'm just a friendly ghost." Timmy was surprised that the ghost could talk, but he was happy that it was friendly. 
After a while, Timmy's friends couldn't find him and they started to worry. But then the ghost said, "I know where Timmy is hiding. Follow me!" So, Timmy's friends followed the ghost and they found Timmy behind the big tree. They were so happy to find him and complete the game. 
As they were leaving the park, Timmy asked the ghost if it could come play with them again. The ghost replied, "I would love to, but I'm only available at night when the stars are out." Timmy and his friends said goodbye to the ghost and went home, excited to play with their new friend again soon.
