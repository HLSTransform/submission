Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bear. One day, she saw her mommy sewing a dress with a needle. "What is that?" she asked.
"It's a needle," her mommy replied. "It's a tool we use to sew things together."
Lily was curious and asked, "Does it include the thread too?"
"Yes, it does," said her mommy. "The needle and thread work together to make the dress."
Lily was amazed at how modern tools like needles and thread could make beautiful clothes. She learned that even simple things can make a big difference. From that day on, she always appreciated the little things in life and never took them for granted.
