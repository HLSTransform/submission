One day, a little girl was wearing a new blouse. It had a bright pink colour and lots of sparkles. She was very proud of it and twirled around in it. Suddenly, she heard a fierce noise and she stopped.
The noise came from a big and scary looking dog. It was growling and staring at her with big eyes. She was scared and stepped away from it. The little girl looked around and noticed the dog's owner nearby. Quickly, she asked a question.
"What is your dog doing here? It's scaring me!"
The man said: "Don't worry. He just wants to play. He's a good dog." The girl was still worried and said: "I'm not sure. Please take him away."
The man smiled and got hold of the dog's collar. As he walked away, the girl felt relieved. She stood there for a few moments and smiled. She was no longer afraid and went back to twirling around in her beautiful blouse.
