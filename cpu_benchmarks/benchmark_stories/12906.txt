Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. He was a very intelligent three year old. Every day, Jack’s mom would take him out for a walk in the park.
On one of these walks, Jack and his mom came across a very special picture on the ground. The picture was of a boy that looked a lot like Jack, sitting on a bench with a big smile on his face. Jack was so happy to find this picture. He picked it up and showed it to his mom.
“This looks like me, mommy!” he said.
“Yes, it sure does,” his mom replied. “But why don’t you keep it? It could be a reminder of our special time together when you miss me.”
Jack nodded and put the picture in his pocket. He was so happy with his new picture.
When it was time for their walk to end and for Jack to go home, he felt really sad because he was going to miss his mom. But then, he remembered the picture.
He pulled it out of his pocket and smiled. He was so glad he had found it. Looking at the picture of himself always made Jack feel a little better when he was missing his mom.
