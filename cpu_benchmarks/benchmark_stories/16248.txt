Once upon a time there was a brave little girl named Lucy. She was always filled with curiosity and explored the world around her. 
One day, she decided to get out of her house and explore the nearby park. She took a few steps until she came to an exit. She trembled as she thought of her parents and how they would react.
"What if they don't find me?" she thought.
However, her courage overtook her fear and she stepped out to explore the new world ahead of her. She looked around and saw a park filled with things she had never seen before. She was about to take her first step when she heard her parents' voices behind her. 
She was embarrassed to have been caught but also excited to show them all the new things she had discovered. They laughed, and Lucy smiled. Little did she know what would happen the next time she decided to explore.
