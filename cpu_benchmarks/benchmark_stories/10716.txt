Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, Timmy went to the park and saw a bird. The bird was singing and Timmy wanted to sing too. He tried to whistle like the bird, but he couldn't do it.
Timmy's mom gave him a glass of water to drink. The water was cold and refreshing. Timmy drank it all up and felt better. Then, Timmy's dad made some food for dinner. The food was spicy and Timmy didn't like it. He drank more water to make the spicy feeling go away.
After dinner, Timmy went back outside to play. He saw the bird again and tried to whistle. This time, he was able to whistle a little bit. The bird heard him and flew down to say hello. Timmy was so happy to make a new friend. From that day on, Timmy practiced whistling every day and drank lots of water to stay healthy.
