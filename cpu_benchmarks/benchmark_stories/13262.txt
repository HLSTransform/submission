Once upon a time there were two best friends, Bobby and Steve. They liked to play together every day. One day they decided to go to the swamp to explore.
Once they got to the swamp Bobby and Steve saw a lot of things they hadn't seen before. They saw funny animals, colorful flowers, and big trees.
Bobby and Steve had lots of fun looking around the swamp. Then, they saw something strange. It was a funny book! Bobby and Steve decided to read the funny book together.
They sat down under a big tree and read the funny book with lots of pictures. They laughed and smiled as they read about all the funny animals in the swamp.
Bobby and Steve had a really great time together reading the funny book. They promised to come back to the swamp and read it again soon.
