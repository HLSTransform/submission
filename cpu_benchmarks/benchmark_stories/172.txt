Once upon a time, there was a farmer who loved to grow corn. He had a big field where he planted lots of corn. One day, a big wind came and made all the corn move back and forth. The farmer was happy to see it because he knew it meant the corn was growing well.
One day, the farmer saw a bird with a bald head. The bird was looking for food in the cornfield. The farmer felt sorry for the bird because it looked hungry. So, he decided to share some of his corn with the bird. The bird was very happy and ate all the corn.
From that day on, the bird would come to the cornfield every day to eat. The farmer was happy to see the bird and the bird was happy to eat the corn. And every time the wind blew, the corn would move and the bird would dance with joy.
