One day, a sheep named Sam was walking in the field. The sun was dull and not very bright. Sam was looking for some grass to eat.
Sam saw a big rock and tried to jump on it. But he did not see the wet ground near the rock. His foot began to slip! "Oh no!" Sam said. He was scared.
Just then, a big dog named Max came running. "Don't worry, Sam!" Max said. "I will help you!" Max held Sam's foot and stopped him from slipping. Sam was safe and happy. They both played and ate grass together in the field.
