Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy lived in a big house with his mom and dad. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the store to buy a new toy. Timmy saw a toy car that he really liked. 
"Mommy, can I have that car?" Timmy asked.
"Sure, Timmy. Let's buy it," his mom replied.
Timmy was very happy with his new toy car. He played with it all day long. But then, something strange happened. The car started to shrink! It became smaller and smaller until it was as tiny as a bug. 
"Oh no! My car is so small now," Timmy said.
"Don't worry, Timmy. We can take it to the toy store and exchange it for a new one," his mom said.
So, Timmy and his mom went to the toy store and got a new, modern toy car. They drove back home, happy and content. They watched the sun set in the west, and Timmy went to bed with a smile on his face, dreaming of his new toy car.
