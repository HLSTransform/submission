Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy's mom came into his room and said, "Timmy, it's time to go outside and play. It's important to be healthy and get some exercise." 
Timmy grabbed his favorite toy, a red truck, and ran outside. He saw his friend Billy and said, "Hi Billy, do you want to play with my truck?" Billy replied, "Yes, I love playing with toys!" 
Timmy and Billy played with the truck for a while, but then Timmy got tired and wanted to rest. He said to Billy, "Let's stand here and take a break." They stood there and took deep breaths, feeling healthy and happy. Then they continued playing with the truck until it was time to go home.
