One day, Alex went to the park. He hopped out of his car. He felt so excited! When he arrived at the park, he saw people making dough. Alex wanted to join them, so he jumped and hopped over to them.
"Can I help make the dough too?," Alex asked.
"Sure," said one of the people.
Alex rolled the dough with his hands. He could feel the dough getting icy cold. After a while, everyone started to make pizzas with the dough. Alex hopped around, laughing with delight. He was so happy to be part of the pizza-making.
When the pizza was finished, Alex smiled. He had a lot of fun!
