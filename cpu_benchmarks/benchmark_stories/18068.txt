Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a penny in her pocket and she was very happy about it. She loved to walk around and explore the world. One day, she met a dog. The dog was big and brown and Lily was fearful of him.
"Hello, little girl," said the dog. "What do you have there?"
"I have a penny," replied Lily.
"Oh, I love pennies," said the dog. "Can I have it?"
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "No, you might bite me."
The dog laughed and said, "I promise I won't bite you. I just want to play with the penny."
Lily gave the penny to the dog and they played together. She realized that not all big and brown dogs are scary.
