Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she was digging in the dirt and found a little worm. She picked it up and held it in her hand.
"Listen, worm," she said. "Do you want to be my friend?"
The worm didn't say anything, but Lily could tell it was happy. She played with the worm for a while, but soon grew impatient.
"Come on, worm," she said. "Let's go on an adventure!"
The worm wiggled in her hand, excited to see where they would go. They went on a walk through the garden, and Lily showed the worm all the pretty flowers. The worm was so happy to have a new friend to explore with.
