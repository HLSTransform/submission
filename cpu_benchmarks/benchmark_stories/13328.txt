One day, a boy named Tim went for a walk in the park. The sun was shining, and the day was mild. Tim saw a big square on the ground. It was made of colorful chalk. He thought it looked fun, so he stepped into the square.
A girl named Sue walked up to Tim. She smiled and said, "Want to play with me?" Tim nodded his head and said, "Yes, please!" Sue took a ball from her bag and they started to play.
They took turns to pass the ball to each other. They laughed and kicked the ball inside the square. They played until the sun went down. Tim and Sue were happy to make a new friend. They waved goodbye and went home, excited to play together again soon.
