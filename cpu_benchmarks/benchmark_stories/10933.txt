Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy who loved dolphins. He had a modern toy dolphin that he played with every day. One day, Timmy went to the beach to see real dolphins. He was very happy and excited.
But then, a big wave came and Timmy got lost in the water. He tried to swim, but he couldn't manage to get back to the shore. Suddenly, a dolphin appeared and swam towards Timmy. Timmy felt happy and safe because he knew dolphins were friendly.
The dolphin helped Timmy to swim back to the shore. But when they got there, Timmy's parents were angry and scared. They scolded Timmy for going too far into the water. Timmy felt sad because he thought they didn't like the dolphin. He hugged his toy dolphin and went to bed, hoping that tomorrow he could play with the real dolphins again.
