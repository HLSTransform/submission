Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the woods. One day, she saw an owl sitting on a branch. The owl was big and brown with big eyes. 
Lily said, "Hello Mr. Owl! Are you ready to play with me?" 
The owl replied, "Yes, I am ready to play. But first, let's count how many trees we can see." 
Lily and the owl counted all the trees they could see. They counted one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! They had so much fun counting together. 
After they finished counting, Lily and the owl played hide-and-seek. Lily had a great time playing with her new friend. She couldn't wait to come back and play with the owl again.
