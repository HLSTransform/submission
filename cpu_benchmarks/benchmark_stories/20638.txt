Mommy was holding a watch and pointing to it. She said the watch was clean and she wanted it to stay that way.
Lilly, a 3 year old, wanted to touch the watch. She asked if she could have it, but mommy said no. She said she was not allowed to have it.
Lilly was sad but then mommy smiled and said she could look at the watch. Lilly had fun looking at it and pretending it was hers.
Mommy held the watch up high and pointed to the numbers. She told Lilly that the numbers meant it was time for lunch.
Lilly was so excited. She ran off to the kitchen to get lunch. She thought about the watch the whole time and how clean it was.
