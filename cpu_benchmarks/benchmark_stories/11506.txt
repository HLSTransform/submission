Once upon a time, in a small farm, there lived a wealthy hen named Henny. Henny had many eggs in her nest. She loved her eggs very much.
One day, Henny met a wise old owl. The owl said, "Henny, you should mark your eggs. That way, you will always know which eggs are yours." Henny thought this was a great idea. She found a small stick and used it to make little marks on her eggs.
Later, a naughty fox came to the farm. He wanted to take Henny's eggs! But when he saw the marks on the eggs, he got scared. "These eggs have marks! They must be special!" said the fox. He ran away, leaving Henny and her eggs safe and sound.
Henny was very happy that she had marked her eggs. She thanked the wise old owl for his help. From that day on, Henny always marked her eggs, and they all lived happily ever after.
