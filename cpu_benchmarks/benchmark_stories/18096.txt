Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and get dirty. His mom always told him to take a bath before bed, but Timmy didn't like taking baths.
One day, Timmy's brain had an idea. "Timmy, if you take a bath, you'll feel clean and refreshed," said his brain. Timmy got excited and decided to take a bath.
But when Timmy went to take a bath, his little sister wanted to play with his toys. Timmy got upset and didn't want to share. His mom came in and asked what was wrong.
"I don't want to share my toys," said Timmy.
His mom explained that sharing is important and it's not nice to be selfish. Timmy realized his mistake and apologized to his sister. He then happily took his bath and went to bed feeling clean and refreshed.
The moral of the story is that it's important to share and take care of your body by bathing.
