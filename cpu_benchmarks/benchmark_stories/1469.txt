Once upon a time, there was a prince who was very stubborn. He always wanted to do things his own way. One day, the prince decided that he wanted to have a crown of his own. The prince searched everywhere for a crown but he couldn't find one.
So the prince decided to make a crown for himself. He gathered some ribbon, glitter, and glue. He worked hard, and soon he made a beautiful crown. It was colorful, sparkly, and perfect for him.
The prince decided to put his crown on his head and wear it all the time. He proudly strutted around the palace. Everyone complimented the prince on his crown.
The prince was very happy and decided that he would always be stubborn, but if anyone ever tried to argue with him he would simply tap his crown and they would know that he was the king!
