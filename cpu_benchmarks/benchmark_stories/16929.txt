Lily was miserable. She had a big boo-boo on her knee from falling down. It hurt a lot and she could not run or play. She wanted to go home and hug her teddy bear.
She saw her big brother, Ben, coming towards her. He had a bike and a helmet. He looked happy and proud. He had learned how to ride his bike without training wheels.
"Hi, Lily!" he said. "Look at me! I can ride my bike so fast and so far!"
Lily did not want to look at him. She felt sad and angry. She did not have a bike. She could not ride a bike. She could only walk and fall.
"Go away, Ben!" she said. "You are mean! You always show off and make fun of me!"
Ben was surprised. He did not mean to be mean. He wanted to share his joy with his sister. He loved his sister. He wanted to make her happy.
He got off his bike and walked to Lily. He saw her boo-boo and felt sorry for her.
"I'm sorry, Lily," he said. "I didn't know you had a boo-boo. Does it hurt a lot?"
Lily nodded. She felt a tear roll down her cheek.
Ben smiled gently. He lifted his sister in his arms. He felt her body warm and soft. He kissed her boo-boo and said, "It's okay, Lily. I'll take you home. You can hug your teddy bear and I'll hug you. You are my best sister and I love you."
Lily felt better. She hugged her brother and said, "I love you too, Ben. You are my best brother and you are not mean. You are kind and strong. Can you teach me how to ride a bike someday?"
Ben nodded. He put his helmet on Lily's head and said, "Of course I can, Lily. Someday you will ride your bike as fast and as far as me. But for now, let's go home and have some cookies and milk."
They got on the bike together. Ben pedaled and Lily held on. They laughed and sang as they rode home. They were not miserable anymore. They were happy.
