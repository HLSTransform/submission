Once upon a time there was a little boy. He was three years old and his name was Dan. One day, Dan saw an old guitar. He wanted to play it so he asked his mom for help. 
Dan's mom said, "Let's try and solve this problem, Dan. You can do it!"
Dan was very excited. He wanted to make some music. He tried to grab the strings on the old guitar but they were too stiff. 
Dan's mom said "You need to be flexible and try a different way. Can you think of one?"
So Dan grabbed a stick and strummed the strings. It made a nice sound and Dan was very happy. He continued to strum the strings and make beautiful music.
Dan was so proud of himself for solving the problem. He kept playing and singing , happy to have solved the problem with his mom's help.
