Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the store with her mommy. They were looking for a yummy pie to eat for dessert. Mommy said, "Let's find a cheap pie, Lily. We don't want to spend too much money." 
As they were looking at the pies, something strange happened. A big gust of wind blew through the store and knocked all the pies off the shelf! The store manager came over and said, "Oh no! What happened here?" 
Lily pointed to the pies on the ground and said, "The wind happened!" The manager was very kind and gave them a free pie to take home. They were so happy and enjoyed their pie for dessert that night. The end.
