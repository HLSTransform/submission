Once upon a time there was a little girl called Jess. Jess was three years old and very excited! She had just been playing in the garden and was now looking for something else to do.
Suddenly, she realized that she hadn't been inside the house for a while. With butterflies in her tummy, Jess slowly opened the front door and crept inside.
Jess looked all around. She noticed the beautiful curtains and way up high, a lock! Jess went to have a closer look. There was something special about this lock and Jess knew she had to find out what it was for. 
Jess watched carefully as her dad took a key out of his pocket and unlocked the door. A whoosh of cool air blew past Jess. It was so nice and calm inside. Then Jess realized what the lock was for - it was to keep her safe while she slept! 
Jess smiled and gave the lock a hug. She knew that she would always be safe and secure if she had a lock like this.
