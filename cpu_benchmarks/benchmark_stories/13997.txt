One day, a big dog named Max and a small cat named Lily lived in a little shelter. Max liked to teach Lily new tricks. Lily liked to learn from Max. They were very happy.
One day, a mean bird came to the shelter. The bird said, "This is my home now. Go away!" Max and Lily were sad. They did not want to leave their cheap shelter, but they did not know what to do.
Max had an idea. He would teach Lily to scare the bird away. Max said, "Lily, jump high and say 'meow' very loud." Lily did what Max said. The mean bird got scared and flew away. Max and Lily were happy. They could stay in their little shelter.
