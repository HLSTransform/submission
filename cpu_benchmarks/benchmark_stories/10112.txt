Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They saw a man with sunglasses on his nose. The sunglasses were shiny and expensive. Tom wanted to try them on.
"Can I have your sunglasses, please?" Tom asked the man.
"No, you can't. They are mine and they are very expensive. Go away, little boy," the man said.
But Tom did not listen. He ran to the man and grabbed his sunglasses. He put them on his nose and smiled. He felt very cool.
"Look at me, Lily! I have sunglasses!" Tom said.
Lily did not think it was funny. She was scared of the man. She wanted Tom to give back the sunglasses.
"Tom, that is not nice. You have to give back the sunglasses. The man is angry," Lily said.
But Tom did not listen. He ran away from the man. He wanted to keep the sunglasses. He ran to the slide and climbed up. He wanted to slide down with the sunglasses on.
But the sunglasses were too big for Tom. They did not fit his nose. They slipped off his face and fell to the ground. They broke into pieces.
The man saw what happened. He was very angry. He ran to Tom and shouted at him.
"You little thief! You broke my sunglasses! They were very expensive! You have to pay for them!" the man said.
Tom was very scared. He did not have any money. He did not know what to do. He started to cry.
Lily ran to Tom and tried to help him. She said sorry to the man. She said it was an accident. She said Tom did not mean to break the sunglasses.
But the man did not listen. He did not care. He grabbed Tom by the arm and dragged him to his car. He said he was going to take him to the police.
Tom and Lily were very sad. They did not have any fun in the park. They did not have any sunglasses. They had a lot of trouble. They wished they had never seen the man with the sunglasses.
