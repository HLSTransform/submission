Jack had a new mug. It was so fragile. He wanted to show it to his mom and dad.
“Wow, Jack! It’s so beautiful,” said Dad.
Jack was very proud. He held the mug carefully in both hands. He wanted to keep it safe.
Jack sat down with his mug in the living room. He wanted to look at it closer. He looked at it for a long time. He had never seen such a beautiful mug.
Jack kept looking at his mug until it was time for bed. He carefully put the mug back on the table. It was time for him to go to bed.
Jack smiled to himself as he tucked himself in. He would think of his mug all night.
