Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily wanted to go outside and play, but she couldn't find her shoes. She searched and searched, but they were nowhere to be found.
Lily's mommy asked her, "What's wrong, sweetie? Why are you sad?" Lily replied, "I can't find my shoes, and I want to go outside and play." Her mommy said, "Don't worry, we'll find them. Let's look for them together."
They looked under the bed, in the closet, and even outside in the yard. Finally, they found the shoes on the top step of the stairs. Lily was so happy that she did a little dance and said, "My shoes fit perfectly! Thank you, mommy!"
Later that day, Lily's friend came over to play. She saw that Lily was happy and asked her why. Lily said, "I found my shoes! I suffered for a little bit, but now I'm happy." Her friend didn't understand what "suffer" meant, so Lily explained, "It means I was sad because I couldn't find my shoes, but now I'm not sad anymore."
