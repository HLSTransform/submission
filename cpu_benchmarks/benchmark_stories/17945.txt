One day, a fast red car was driving down the road. The car had a very important job. It had to go to the hospital for an operation. The car was very nervous, but it knew it had to be brave.
As the car drove, it started to rain. The road became wet and slippery. The car tried to be careful, but it began to slip and slide. It was scared it would not make it to the hospital on time.
The car saw a big truck coming. The truck saw the car slip and knew it needed help. The truck helped the car get back on the right path. They went to the hospital together. The car got its operation and was very thankful for the truck's help.
