Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and her favorite color was orange. One day, Lily's mom gave her a spool of thread to play with. 
Lily was so happy and started to pull the thread. She saw that the thread was long and thin. She decided to make a necklace with it. 
Lily showed her necklace to her mom and told her how she made it. Her mom was so proud of her. She told Lily that she was very creative. From that day on, Lily loved to play with thread and make new things.
