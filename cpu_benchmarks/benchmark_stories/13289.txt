One day, a crazy reindeer named Remy was playing in the snow. He liked to run and jump with his friends. Remy was very happy and loved to play all day.
Remy met a little boy named Tim. Tim said, "Remy, let's play a game! You try to catch me, and if you do, I will surrender." Remy liked games, so he agreed.
They played and laughed in the snow. Remy tried to catch Tim, but Tim was very fast. Finally, Remy caught Tim, and Tim said, "I surrender! You win, Remy!" They both smiled and played more games together.
