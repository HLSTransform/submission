Once upon a time, there was an old cat. The cat liked to move around a lot. One day, the cat went to a big field with a pitch. The pitch was full of green grass. The cat saw a bird on the pitch and tried to catch it. The bird was too fast and flew away. The old cat went back home and took a nap. The end.
