Once upon a time, there was a parade. There were lots of people marching in a line and some were carrying flags. Everyone was happy and smiling.
One little girl, Mary, wanted to join in the parade, but her mom said no. She was very sad and she felt silly.
Suddenly, she had an idea. She could wear a costume and march by herself. She quickly put on a silly hat and ran outside to join the parade.
But then she saw something that made her stop. She saw all the other people laughing and, now that she was closer, she could see they were all wearing silly, funny costumes. She felt embarrassed. She quickly ran back inside and hid.
Mary was so embarrassed that she wanted to cry. She wished she had listened to her mom. She regretted being so stupid and not listening to more grown-ups.
The End.
