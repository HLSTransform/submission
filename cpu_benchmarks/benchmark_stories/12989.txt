Once there was a little girl who went to the park with her mom. She loved the park, and wanted to run around and have fun.
But then, she saw a dog and panicked. She ran back to her mom and hugged her tightly. Her mom comforted her and said "It's okay, that dog won't hurt you."
The little girl was still scared, until the dog winked at her. She smiled and laughed, it was so funny! The dog had made her not scared anymore.
So, the little girl walked up to the dog and said hi. The dog wagged its tail and lay down to play.
The little girl and the dog ended up playing together for the rest of the day. They had so much fun!
