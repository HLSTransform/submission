Once upon a time there was a little girl called Sara. One day, Sara wanted to find a special key. She decided to go on an adventure and stepped outside her house.
She stepped through the grass and then stepped onto the road. She looked around and saw a dead bird lying beside a tree. Sara felt sad when she saw the bird and stepped away to keep searching.
Everywhere she stepped, she couldn't find the key. Until, all of a sudden, she stepped onto a path and saw the shiny key in between some stones. She stepped closer and saw that the key had a sparkly star on it. 
Sara was so happy! She stepped towards the key and picked it up. Suddenly the key started to shine and sparkle, brighter and brighter until the sparkle was gone. 
Sara had found the special key she was looking for. She stepped home with a big smile, happily holding the key in her hand.
