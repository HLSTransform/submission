Once there was a little girl. She was very excited because she was going to the market with her mommy. When they arrived, she was amazed to see all the things that were there. Her eyes blinked in amazement as she looked around the market.
When they began to walk around, she saw fake jewels. The jewels sparkled so brightly and looked so beautiful, she wanted to have them all. Her mommy noticed this and explained that they were fake.
The little girl was disappointed and started to cry. But her mommy said they might be able to find something else that was real and beautiful.
After walking around, the little girl finally spotted something she knew was real. It was a pretty flower. Its petals were so soft and wispy. She smiled and reached out to take it in her hands. Her mommy smiled too and said that the flower was real and not fake. 
The little girl was very happy and went home with the flower hugged tightly in her arms. Her mommy was proud of her for finding something real and beautiful in the market.
