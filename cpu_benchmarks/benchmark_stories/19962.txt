Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a furry cat sitting on a bench. Lily wanted to take a picture of the cat with her camera. She urged Ben to come with her.
"Ben, Ben, come and see the cat! It is so furry and cute! Let's take a picture of it with my camera!" Lily said.
Ben was not so sure. He was afraid of the cat. He thought the cat might scratch or bite them. He said, "Lily, I don't want to go near the cat. It might be angry or scared. Maybe we should leave it alone."
Lily did not listen to Ben. She ran towards the cat with her camera. She wanted to get a close-up of the cat's face. She said, "Don't be silly, Ben. The cat is friendly. It won't hurt us. Look, it is smiling at us!"
But the cat was not smiling. It was hissing. It did not like strangers coming too close to it. It felt threatened by Lily and her camera. It jumped off the bench and scratched Lily's hand. Lily cried out in pain and dropped her camera. The cat ran away.
Ben ran to Lily and hugged her. He said, "Lily, are you okay? I'm sorry the cat hurt you. Let me see your hand. We should go and tell Mom."
Lily sobbed and nodded. She said, "I'm sorry, Ben. You were right. I should have listened to you. I was too curious and rude. I scared the cat and made it angry. I hope my camera is not broken."
Ben said, "It's okay, Lily. We all make mistakes. But we should learn from them. Next time, we should be more careful and respectful of animals. They have feelings too. Maybe we can find another way to take pictures of them without bothering them."
Lily and Ben learned a valuable lesson that day. They learned to be more cautious and kind to animals. They also learned to listen to each other and work together. They still liked to take pictures, but they did it more gently and wisely.
