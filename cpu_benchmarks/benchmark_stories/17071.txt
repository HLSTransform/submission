Once upon a time, in a modest pond, there lived a small fish named Fin. Fin loved to swim all day with his friends. They would play games and have fun together.
One day, a big bird came to the pond. The bird was very hungry. It saw Fin and his friends swimming and playing. The bird watched them, waiting for the right time to catch one.
Fin's friends saw the bird and swam away to hide. But Fin did not see the bird. He kept swimming and playing, not knowing the danger. The bird saw that Fin was alone and swooped down.
The bird caught Fin and flew away. Fin's friends came out from their hiding spots and saw what had happened. They all began to weep, for they knew they would never see their friend Fin again.
From that day on, the fish in the pond learned to be more careful and watch for danger. They would always remember their friend Fin and the sad day when he was taken away.
