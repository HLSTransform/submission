Anna liked to speak to her toys. She had a bear, a doll, and a frog. She gave them names and voices. She pretended they were her friends.
One day, she was playing with them in the kitchen. She saw a big pot on the stove. It smelled good. She asked her mom, "What is that?"
Mom said, "That is soup. It is for dinner. Do you want to try some?"
Anna nodded. She loved soup. Mom gave her a small bowl and a spoon. Anna took a sip. It was hot and tasty. She said, "Mmm, this is good soup. Do you want some, bear?"
She held the spoon to the bear's mouth. The bear did not open his mouth. Anna was confused. She said, "Bear, why don't you want soup? Soup is good. Don't you like soup?"
She tried the doll and the frog. They did not open their mouths either. Anna was more confused. She said, "Doll, frog, why don't you want soup? Soup is good. Don't you like soup?"
She looked at her mom. Mom smiled. She said, "Anna, your toys can't eat soup. They are not real. They can't speak or open their mouths. Only you can do that."
Anna thought for a moment. She said, "But they speak to me. They are my friends. They have names and voices."
Mom said, "That's because you have a big imagination. You make them speak in your mind. That's fun. But they can't really speak or eat. Only people and animals can do that."
Anna understood. She said, "Oh, I see. So they don't need soup. But I do. Can I have more soup, please?"
Mom said, "Of course, you can. You are a good girl. And you have good friends. Even if they are only toys."
