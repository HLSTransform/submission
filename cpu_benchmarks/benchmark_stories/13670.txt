Anna and Ben were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big brown box near the slide. They ran to the box and looked inside.
"What is it?" Anna asked.
"I don't know. Let's find out!" Ben said.
They climbed into the box and closed the flap. It was dark inside. They could not see anything.
"Are you scared?" Anna whispered.
"No, I'm not. Are you?" Ben whispered back.
"No, I'm not. I'm excited!" Anna said.
They heard a noise outside. It sounded like a dog. They felt something moving in the box.
"What is that?" Ben asked.
"I don't know. Let's open the flap!" Anna said.
They opened the flap and saw a brown puppy. It was wagging its tail and licking their faces.
"Hello, puppy!" Anna and Ben said.
They hugged the puppy and laughed. They were happy. They had found a new friend.
