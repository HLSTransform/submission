Once upon a time, there was a clown who loved to walk around the peaceful park. He had a big red nose and wore colorful clothes. One day, he saw a little girl who was crying. He asked her what was wrong, and she said she lost her favorite toy.
The clown felt sad for the little girl and decided to help her. They walked around the park together, looking for the toy. They looked under the trees, behind the bushes, and near the pond. Finally, they found the toy in the sandbox.
The little girl was happy and thanked the clown. The clown smiled and said, "It's always good to help others when they need it." The little girl learned that it's important to ask for help when she needs it, and it's also important to help others. The clown and the little girl walked away from the park feeling happy and peaceful.
