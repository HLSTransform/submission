On a sunny morning, Mama and Baby went to the park. Mama spread out a beautiful blanket of velvet and Baby began to pray. Mama smiled and said, “That’s a good prayer, Baby.”
Suddenly, a fierce dog came running over the hill. Baby was scared and tried to run away, but Mama held Baby tight. Mama said, “We must pray. So, close your eyes and pray.”
So, Baby closed his eyes and prayed as fierce as he could. Mama hugged Baby and said, “Pray with me.” Then, the fierce dog changed and nuzzled against Baby and Mama.
They all laughed with joy. After Baby and Mama finished their prayer, they all ran, jumped and laughed together. Mama packed up the velvet blanket and they walked home.
