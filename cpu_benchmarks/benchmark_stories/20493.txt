Once upon a time, there were two friends, Jack and Jill. They wanted to see what was at the top of a big hill.
So they started to walk up the hill. It was steep, so they had to take lots of little steps. Soon they were at the top.
But it was very uncomfortable up there. The wind was chilly and the hill was very high.
Jack and Jill started to look around. They wanted to find something special.
Suddenly they saw it! It was a big group of colorful butterflies. They were gathering in a circle, fluttering around in the sunshine.
Jack and Jill were so happy. They watched the butterflies until they were all gone. Then they hopped down the hill and went home.
