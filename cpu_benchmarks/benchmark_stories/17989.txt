Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a good friend named Sam. They liked to play together with their toy cars and color pictures.
One day, Tim and Sam found a big box of paper. They wanted to make a print with their hands. They put paint on their hands and pressed them onto the paper. "Look, Sam!" said Tim, "We made a print with our hands!"
But Tim did not see the paint on the floor, and he slipped. "Ouch!" he cried. Tim's knee was hurt, and he suffered. Sam saw Tim and said, "Don't worry, Tim. I will help you."
Sam helped Tim stand up, and they went to Tim's mom. She put a bandage on Tim's knee, and he felt better. Tim and Sam learned to be careful when they played with paint. They were still good friends, and they always helped each other.
