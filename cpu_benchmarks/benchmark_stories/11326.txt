One day, a little girl named Alice was playing with her toys in her bedroom. Everything in her room was very organized, with her toys all neatly lined up on the shelf and her blocks all stacked in the corner. Suddenly, she heard a loud snap!
Alice was startled and ran to the window to see what had made the noise. Just then, she saw a Pick—a big bird with a long beak—hanging on the tree branch outside. It seemed to be looking right at her!
Alice stepped away from the window for a moment, then she started to remember. She had left a piece of cheese outside for the pick! She had known all along that the Pick would eventually come!
Alice was excited, but also a little scared. She didn’t know if the Pick would be friendly or not. She slowly made her way to the window and peeked out. The Pick was still there, looking right at her. Then, it reached out its long beak and snapped up the piece of cheese!
Alice smiled. She was happy that the Pick had come and that everything was organized in her room. She knew that she could trust the Pick to visit her every day!
