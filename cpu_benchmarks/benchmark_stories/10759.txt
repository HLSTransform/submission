Once upon a time, there was an honest cat named Tom. Tom liked to move and play with his friend, a little flame. The flame was warm and bright, and Tom loved to be near it.
One day, Tom and the flame went for a walk in the woods. They saw a big tree and a little bird. The bird liked to move too, so they all played together. They had lots of fun, and the flame made sure they were warm.
After playing, Tom, the flame, and the bird went back to Tom's house. They were tired, but happy. They took a nap and dreamt of more fun days to come. And they all lived happily ever after.
