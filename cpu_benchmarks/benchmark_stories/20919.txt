Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved to listen to jazz music. Every morning she would wake up and dance to the sounds of jazz while her family smiled. 
One day, the little girl wanted to provide jazz music to all of her family members. She searched and searched but could not find any music to share. She was very ashamed. 
The little girl thought and thought and came up with an idea. She went around to her neighbour's houses and asked if she could borrow some jazz music. Unfortunately, all the neighbours said no. 
The little girl was very sad. Despite her best efforts, she was not able to provide jazz music to her family. The little girl was so ashamed that she never asked for help again.
