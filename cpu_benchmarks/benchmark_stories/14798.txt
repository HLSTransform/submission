Lily and Ben liked to play with sand. They had a big bucket and a small shovel. They went to the park with Mom and Dad. There was a lot of sand in the park. Lily and Ben wanted to make a castle.
They filled the bucket with sand and turned it over. They made a big tower. They used the shovel to make windows and doors. They found some shells and stones to decorate the castle. They were very happy with their castle.
"Look at our castle, Mom and Dad!" Lily said. "It is so pretty and strong!"
"Yes, it is, sweetie," Mom said. "You did a great job."
"Can we play with it?" Ben asked.
"Of course, you can," Dad said. "But be careful not to break it."
Lily and Ben nodded. They were playful and curious. They wanted to see what was inside the castle. They used the shovel to dig a hole in the tower. They found more sand and some worms.
"Wow, look at these!" Ben said. "They are so wiggly and funny!"
"Let me see!" Lily said. She reached for the shovel. But Ben did not want to share. He pulled the shovel away from Lily. Lily pulled it back. They both pulled hard. The shovel split in two.
"Oh no!" Lily and Ben said. They looked at the broken shovel. They felt sad and sorry. They looked at the castle. The hole was bigger and bigger. The tower fell down. The castle was ruined.
"Oh no!" Lily and Ben said. They looked at the broken castle. They felt sad and sorry. They looked at Mom and Dad. They saw their faces. They were not angry. They were smiling.
"It's okay, kids," Mom said. "You can make another castle. Or you can play with something else. The park has many things to play with."
"Yes, and you can share them," Dad said. "Sharing is more fun than fighting. And it makes things last longer."
Lily and Ben nodded. They hugged Mom and Dad. They said sorry for breaking the shovel and the castle. They said thank you for being nice. They went to play with something else. They shared and had fun. They learned a lesson.
