Once upon a time there were two friends, Tara and Daisy. They liked to play together. One day, Tara wanted to lend Daisy a pretty pebble to keep in her pocket. Daisy said yes and took the pebble from Tara. Daisy thought the pebble was so special that she kept it for herself and wouldn't let anyone else look at it.
Tara was sad because Daisy hadn't kept her promise to lend her the pebble. Tara's feelings started to get noisy. She started to cry loudly and asked Daisy to give it back. Daisy reluctantly gave the pebble back to Tara.
After that, Tara was happy again and shared the pebble with Daisy. They both had the chance to appreciate its beauty and play with it. Both Tara and Daisy had learned a valuable lesson. They had learned that a promise is something special and should never be broken. From then on, they were going to be very careful when they were lending things to each other.
