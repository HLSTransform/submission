Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sally. Sally was 3-years old and loved to march. She would march all around the house with a big smile on her face.
One day, Sally decided to march outside. She put on her shoes, grabbed her hat and was ready to go. As she stepped out the door, she noticed something amazing. There was a parade marching down the street!
Sally watched as the people in the parade marched in a new style that she had never seen before. They moved in all sorts of directions, and the colors of their clothes were beautiful!
Sally was so excited that she started to march in her own style. The people in the parade cheered and clapped when they saw her. They danced and sang around her as they marched.
Soon, Sally realized that everyone in the parade was her neighbor, friends, and family! She was so happy to march along with them and learn their new and unknown style!
