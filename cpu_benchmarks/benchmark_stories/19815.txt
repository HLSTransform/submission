Once upon a time there was a little girl named Ruby. Ruby loved to explore and experience new things. One day she decided to ask her mom for something special. She wanted to go and explore the deep chimney that was outside. Her mom was not sure about this request since it seemed a bit dangerous. She thought for a moment and then agreed to let Ruby go. 
Ruby put on her old cape and asked her mom to come with her. Together, they went outside and Ruby started to climb up the deep chimney. It was so tall that it felt like they were reaching the sky. As they went higher and higher, Ruby could feel the chill of the wind on her face and the warmth of the sun.
When they finally reached the top, Ruby looked out and saw the beautiful city below. It was more amazing then she could have ever imagined. She thanked her mom for agreeing to her request and they both made their way back down the deep chimney. 
The experience of going up the deep chimney still stays with Ruby today, as it was her first brave request and adventure.
