Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was 3 years old and she had the biggest adventure of her life.
One day she saw a tree in the forest. It was big and strong, and it had the most delicious leaves on it. She couldn't resists touching them, so she did.
Then, something magical happened - the leaves started to fold. She couldn't believe her eyes. She kept touching them and more and more folded. It was so fun!
When she was done, the leaves were all in the shape of a heart. She was so excited. She hugged the tree, thanked it, and ran back home to tell her family all about her adventure.
