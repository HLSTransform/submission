Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a jeep. She loved to drive her jeep around her neighborhood. Every night, she pretended her jeep was a race car and went super fast.
One day, the little girl was feeling a bit nervous. She had been asked to lie to her mom. She didn't want to lie, but she was scared her mom would be mad at her.
She decided to take her jeep out for a drive to make her feel better. She hopped in the jeep and drove around the block. As she drove, the nervous feeling started to go away. The fresh air and the safe jeep made her feel much better! 
When the little girl got home, she decided to tell the truth to her mom. She was no longer scared and the truth had to be told. She was very proud of herself and never drove her jeep when she was feeling scared again.
