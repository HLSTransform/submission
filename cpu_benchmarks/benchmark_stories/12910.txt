Once upon a time, there was a wide automobile. It was big and shiny, and it always stayed parked in the driveway. Two kids, Jack and Jill, would always let themselves into the automobile when their parents weren't around and pretend to drive. 
One day, Jack and Jill let themselves into the automobile and were about to start pretending to drive like they usually did. All of a sudden, a loud voice came from outside the automobile. It was the owner of the car! He asked them what they were doing and the kids were so scared they didn't know what to say. 
The owner told the kids that they must pay him a lot of money if they wanted to keep pretending to drive. Jack and Jill did not have any money, so they had to say goodbye to the automobile and walked away with heavy hearts. Even though they had done something wrong, they didn't deserve such a bad ending.
