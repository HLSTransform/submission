Once upon a time, there was a little ant. The ant lived in a small hole in the ground. Every day the ant would wake up and rise with the sun. One day, the ant was walking when it saw a big insect. The insect was very scary, but the ant was brave. The ant asked the insect if it was comfortable. The insect said yes and they became friends. From that day on, the ant and the insect played together every day.
