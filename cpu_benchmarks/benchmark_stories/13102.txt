Mummy and Daddy were going to the post office. They were going to buy a stamp for their letter. Little Johnny wanted to come too as it sounded like fun.
When they arrived, Little Johnny noticed a big box full of stamps. Each one had a different picture on it. He wanted to look at them all but Mummy said he had to be quick. 
Little Johnny picked a stamp with a funny looking animal. Mummy smiled and said he had made a good choice. Little Johnny remembered the stamp forever.
At the post office, they had to wait in a long line to pay. Little Johnny was getting bored as he had to stand still. Suddenly, he spotted a window with lots of toys in it. He was so excited he began to jump up and down. That made Daddy laugh and soon they were out of the boring post office.
