Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her dolls and her teddy bear. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to help fold the laundry. Lily was happy to help. She folded her favorite pink dress and her mommy's blue shirt.
While folding, Lily's mommy asked her, "Do you know any other language besides English?" 
Lily thought for a moment and said, "No, mommy. What is language?" 
"Language is how we talk and communicate with others," mommy explained. 
Lily was very alert and interested. She wanted to learn more about language. 
From that day on, Lily paid attention to the words people used around her. She wanted to learn more about language and how to communicate with others.
