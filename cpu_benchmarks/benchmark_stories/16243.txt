Amy was eager to explore her new home but first she wanted to see the wardrobe in her bedroom. She opened it up and looked at the many colourful clothes inside. She felt a chill go up her spine as she closed the door.
Suddenly something big and purple jumped out of the wardrobe. Amy was scared and stepped back. She noticed two eyes peeking out from the creature's head!
The creature growled, which made Amy even more scared. He said he wanted Amy to help him return home. He said that he was lonely and wanted to be with his friends. Amy felt sorry for him and decided to help.
The creature thanked Amy and looked around the room. He soon noticed a single window in the corner. He said he would use the window to fly back to his friends. He thanked her for her help and flew off.
Amy looked at the window and felt a bit sad. She hoped the creature had gone to see his friends but she would never know.
