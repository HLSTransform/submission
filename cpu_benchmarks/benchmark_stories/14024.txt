Once upon a time, there was a brown dog named Buddy. Buddy was a very good dog. He liked to play and run. Buddy had a little friend named Tim. Tim was a small boy with a big smile.
One day, Tim wanted to teach Buddy a new trick. Tim took Buddy to his room. In the room, there was a big bed. The bed was soft and cozy. Tim said to Buddy, "Buddy, I will teach you to jump on the bed."
Buddy was happy to learn. Tim showed Buddy how to jump on the bed. Buddy tried and tried. At last, Buddy jumped on the bed! Tim and Buddy were so happy. They played on the bed all day long. And that is how Buddy learned to jump on the bed.
