"Come on, Mommy!" said three-year-old Dylan excitedly. "Let's sail!"
Dylan and Mommy got ready to go. Mommy packed a picnic and Dylan brought his stuffed animal.
At the beach, Dylan and Mommy got in the boat and sailed away. The sun shone brightly and the water was blue and sparkly.
Soon enough, they were sailing out to sea, looking for dolphins. Dylan was so excited he couldn't even sit still.
On the way, Dylan and Mommy smelled the sweet smell of coffee coming from a famous boat. 
"Let's sail over there and get a cup of delicious coffee!‚Äù Dylan cried out. So, Dylan and Mommy sailed up to the boat. They decided to take some of the famous coffee home for later.
They both said goodbye to the boat and sailed home, feeling happy and refreshed.
