One day, there was a pebble in the garden. It was very small and round. The pebble was very tired and was rolling around in circles.
Suddenly, a rabbit appeared. She wanted to play with the pebble, so she hopped over to it and pushed it around. The pebble went far away and got stuck in the ground.
The rabbit tried to get it out, but she couldn't. In frustration, she dug around the pebble and destroyed it. The pebble was broken into tiny pieces and scattered in the garden. 
The rabbit was sad. She had wanted the pebble to play with, not to destroy it! But the pebble was gone forever.
