Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a baby. The baby asked his mommy, “Can we go to the zoo?”
The mommy said, “No, I am sorry. We cannot go to the zoo today. The zoo is closed.” 
The baby was very sad and said, “Why can't we go to the zoo?” 
The mommy smiled and said, “The zoo is closed to prevent the animals from getting sick. But don’t worry, tomorrow I will take you to the park. The park has some smooth paths and nice trees.” 
The baby smiled and said, “Ok, I can’t wait to go to the park tomorrow.” 
The mommy hugged the baby and said, “Me too.”
