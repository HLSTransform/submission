Josh and his dad were walking in the park. The sun was so warm and bright that Josh was feeling very happy. Suddenly, his dad pointed to a rotten apple on the ground and said to him, "Josh, look at this apple. You see how important it is to do your work?"
Josh understood what his dad meant. He looked at the apple and nodded, saying, "Yes Dad." His dad nodded too and they kept walking.
But Josh did not like his dad's lesson. So the next day, when it was time to start his work, he decided to do something else. He did not do his work and the day passed by in leisure.
Later that night, his dad came home from work. He had a sad look on his face. Josh wanted to know what had happened. His dad told him, "The apple was rotten because you did not do your work. That is why it is so important to always finish your work."
Josh felt very sad. He wished he had done what his dad had said. He did not like the bad ending that had happened.
