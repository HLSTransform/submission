Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He liked to play outside with his toys. One sunny day, he saw a big shadow on the ground. It was a tall tree. Tim wanted to climb the tree, but his toy was broken.
Tim was sad about his broken toy. He thought if he could destroy the shadow, his toy would be fixed. So, he started to throw rocks at the shadow. But the shadow did not go away. The more rocks he threw, the bigger the shadow got.
Then, Tim's mom came outside and saw what he was doing. She told him that destroying the shadow would not fix his toy. Tim was very sad and cried. The shadow was still there, and his toy was still broken. The end.
