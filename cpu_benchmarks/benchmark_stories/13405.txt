Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Max. Max lived in a big house with his family. Max's family loved him very much and took care of him every day.
One day, Max saw a rag on the ground. He didn't know what it was, but he thought it looked interesting. Max went to sniff the rag, but it smelled bad. Max didn't like the smell, so he walked away.
Later that day, Max's family had a big surprise for him. They had bought him a new toy! Max was so happy and wagged his tail with excitement. Max loved his new toy and played with it all day long. Max's family was happy to see him so happy.
From that day on, Max knew that his family cared about him and wanted him to be happy. Max never went near the rag again and always played with his new toy.
