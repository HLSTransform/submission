Once upon a time, there was a humble triangle. She wanted to count all the stars in the sky. She looked up and tried to count one, two, three…but the stars were too high up and she couldn’t reach them.
Suddenly the triangle saw a star twinkle. With a big smile, she went to say hello. But when she reached it, she discovered the star was a friendly bird! They said hello and the bird offered to help the triangle count the stars.
The bird flew up nice and high. With her long beak, she counted one, two, three stars. Then she flew down, and the triangle counted four, five, six stars. Then the bird flew up, and they counted seven, eight, nine stars! All the way, they kept counting until the triangle had reached the last star.
The triangle thanked the bird for giving her the chance to count all the stars. She had never been so happy before, and they both said goodbye with a big hug. From that day on, the humble triangle always remembered to look up and count the stars.
