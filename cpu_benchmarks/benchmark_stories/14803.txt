Lily likes to chew. She chews her food, her toys, her clothes, and sometimes her hair. She thinks chewing is fun and makes her teeth strong. But chewing can also get her in trouble.
One day, Lily found a teaspoon in the kitchen. She thought it was shiny and pretty. She wanted to chew it. She put it in her mouth and bit hard. But the teaspoon was not soft like food or toys. It was hard and metal. It hurt Lily's teeth and tongue. She cried out loud.
Mom heard Lily cry and ran to the kitchen. She saw Lily with the teaspoon in her mouth. She was worried and angry. She took the teaspoon out and checked Lily's mouth. She said, "Lily, why did you chew the teaspoon? You could have broken your teeth or cut your tongue. Teaspoons are not for chewing. They are for measuring and stirring. You are lucky you are not hurt. Don't ever chew teaspoons again."
Lily felt sorry and scared. She said, "I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't know. I just wanted to chew something shiny. I won't chew teaspoons again. Can I chew something else?"
Mom hugged Lily and said, "I know you like to chew, but you have to be careful. You can chew your food, your toys, or your gum. But don't chew anything that is hard, sharp, or dirty. And don't chew too much or too fast. You might choke or get a tummy ache. Chewing is good, but only in moderation."
Lily nodded and said, "Okay, Mom. I understand. I will chew only good things and not too much. Can I have a cookie?"
Mom smiled and said, "Yes, you can have a cookie. But use a teaspoon to scoop some milk first. And don't chew the teaspoon."
