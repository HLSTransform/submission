Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack. He was very intelligent, and had lots of friends.
One day, Jack was walking through the forest, when he stumbled over a big log. He was worried and afraid, until he saw a little bird sitting in a nest. It chirped happily and made Jack smile.
Suddenly, he heard a loud noise. It was a man with a big stick. He was making threats and scaring the animals away!
Jack was brave and he knew he had to help the animals. He used his intelligence to think of a plan to help them. He quickly ran to the man and pushed him away, so the animals could be safe.
The animals were very happy and gave Jack a big hug. They thanked him for saving them from the big threat.
Jack smiled, happy that he could help his new friends in the forest.
