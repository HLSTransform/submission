Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toy cars. They have a big box of cars. They have red cars, blue cars, yellow cars, and more.
One day, they want to play with their cars outside. They ask their mom if they can go. Mom says yes, but they have to be careful. She says there is a big church near their house. The church is open today. Many people go to the church to pray and sing.
Anna and Ben take their cars and go outside. They find a nice spot on the grass. They make roads and bridges with sticks and stones. They zoom their cars along the roads. They have fun.
But then, Ben sees the church. He wants to see what is inside. He tells Anna to come with him. Anna says no. She says they have to stay on the grass. She says mom told them to be careful.
Ben does not listen. He takes his yellow car and runs to the church. He opens the door and goes in. He sees many people sitting on benches. He sees a man talking in front. He sees candles and flowers and pictures.
Ben thinks the church is pretty. He wants to play with his car in the church. He puts his car on the floor and pushes it. The car goes fast. It makes a loud noise. Vroom, vroom!
The people in the church hear the noise. They turn and look at Ben. They are not happy. They say shh, shh! They say this is not a place to play. They say this is a place to be quiet and respectful.
Ben is scared. He wants to go back to Anna. He picks up his car and runs to the door. But the door is closed. He tries to open it. He cannot. He is trapped.
He cries. He says help, help! He says he is sorry. He says he wants his mom.
Anna hears Ben cry. She runs to the church. She sees the door is closed. She pushes the door. It does not move. She pulls the door. It does not move. She remembers mom taught her a new word. She says reverse.
She reverses the door. She pulls it the other way. The door opens. She sees Ben. He is crying. She hugs him. She says it is okay. She says she is here.
They go out of the church. They see mom. Mom is worried. She asks them what happened. They tell her the truth. They say they are sorry. They say they will not do it again.
Mom is angry. But she is also glad. She says they are lucky. She says they could have been hurt. She says they have to be careful. She says they have to listen.
Anna and Ben nod. They say yes, mom. They say they love mom. Mom says she loves them too. She says they can play with their cars on the grass. But they have to stay away from the church.
Anna and Ben agree. They go back to the grass. They play with their cars. They are happy. They are safe. They are good.
