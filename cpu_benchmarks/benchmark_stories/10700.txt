Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very hungry, so he went to a restaurant with his mom. When they got there, the waiter gave them a menu with lots of pictures of food. Timmy looked at the menu and saw a picture of a hamburger. He hoped he could have a hamburger for lunch.
The waiter came back and took their order. Timmy's mom ordered a salad, but Timmy asked for a hamburger. The waiter said that was a fair choice and went to tell the cook. Soon, the cook brought out Timmy's hamburger and it looked so yummy! Timmy took a big bite and smiled. He was very happy.
After lunch, Timmy and his mom went to the park and played on the swings. Timmy was tired, so they went home. Timmy went to bed and fell asleep. As he closed his eyes, he hoped he could have another hamburger tomorrow. The end.
