Once upon a time there was a little girl named Amy. She was at the playground playing with her friends. All of them were having so much fun!
Suddenly, Amy heard a loud noise. It made her scared. She looked around to see what it was and she saw the biggest dragon she has ever seen! It was so big it covered the whole sky.
The dragon had a big match in its mouth. She was so frightened! She tried to run, but the dragon was so close she couldn't do it. 
But then the dragon passed by her, blowing a huge gust of wind. Amy was so relieved! She watched as the dragon flew away, taking the match with it. 
Amy was so happy that it was gone! She ran back to the playground and ran to her friends. She told them all about her scary adventure with the dragon. They were all so happy she was safe!
