Once upon a time there was an orange circle. It was a very happy circle and liked to polish itself. It liked to polish itself to make its orange colour bright and shiny. Every day, the orange circle polished itself to be nice and sparkly.
One day, a mean blue circle saw how pretty the orange circle was and became jealous. So the mean blue circle tried to splash dirt and mud on the orange circle. And the more the mean blue circle splashed, the less sparkly the orange circle became.
The orange circle was so sad. But then a wise green circle came by and said, "No matter how much dirt the mean blue circle throws, no-one can take away the orange circle's sparkle unless the orange circle gives up polishing itself. So the orange circle should keep polishing, no matter what the mean blue circle does!"
The orange circle was very happy and decided to keep polishing itself every day. And the orange circle was able to keep its sparkle and become even brighter and shinier than before.
Moral of the story: Never give up on yourself, no matter how hard things get.
