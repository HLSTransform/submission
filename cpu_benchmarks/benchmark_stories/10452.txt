Once upon a time there lived a brave little girl. One day her mommy told her that there was going to be a storm. She did not want her to be scared, but the little girl was very fearful. 
The thunder roared and the rain fell hard. The wind howled and the little girl shook with fear. She tried her best to remain brave, but it was too much for her. 
The storm grew stronger and darkness filled the sky. The little girl's fear grew too, and she was too scared to remain brave any longer. 
Finally, the storm stopped, but her fear remained. The little girl still trembled and shook, and was too scared to do anything else. Her mommy tried to help her, but the little girl remained scared. 
The end.
