Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went outside to play in the rain. She loved playing in the wet rain, but her mom told her to put on her raincoat so she wouldn't get too wet. Lily didn't want to put on her raincoat because it made her feel nervous, but she did it anyway. 
As Lily was playing, she found a little worm on the ground. "Hello little worm!" Lily said. "Are you nervous because it's raining?" The worm didn't say anything back, but Lily picked it up and put it on a leaf so it wouldn't get too wet. 
Just then, Lily's friend Sarah came outside to play. "Hi Lily!" Sarah said. "Do you want to play with me?" Lily said yes and they started to play together. They ran around in the rain and got very wet, but they didn't mind because they were having so much fun. 
After a while, Lily's mom called them inside. "Time to come in and get dry!" she said. Lily and Sarah went inside and put on their cozy pajamas. They were tired from playing in the rain, but they were happy because they had so much fun together.
