Once upon a time, there was a kind bunny named Benny. Benny loved to eat berries. He would hop around the forest looking for the sweetest berries to eat. One day, Benny found a berry bush that was about to bloom. He was so excited to see the pretty flowers and taste the juicy berries.
But as Benny was eating the berries, he heard a loud growl. It was a hungry bear! Benny tried to run away, but he was too slow. The bear caught him and ate him up. Poor Benny didn't know that the berry bush was a trap set by the bear. 
From that day on, the other animals in the forest were careful when they saw a new berry bush blooming. They didn't want to end up like Benny.
