Once upon a time, there was an old man. He lived alone in a small house. One day, he was walking around his garden when he found something very special. It was a rose! He was so excited and wanted to show it to everyone.
He went to a nearby village to find someone to show the rose. On the way, he met a little girl playing with a fake rose. The little girl had a big smile on her face.
The old man said, "That's not a real rose."
The little girl replied, "I know. I don't have a real one, so I made this fake one."
The old man said, "Well, this rose belongs to you now. It is a gift from me."
The little girl was so excited, she thanked the old man and ran away with the rose. She hugged it tightly and said, "This rose belongs to me now!"
