Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy who loved to play with his wagon. His wagon was red and big, and he liked to pull it around the yard. One day, Timmy went on an adventure to discover new things. He pulled his wagon behind him and walked through the woods.
As he walked, he saw a big, tough bear. The bear looked at Timmy and growled loudly. Timmy was scared and tried to run away, but the bear chased him. Timmy ran as fast as he could, pulling his wagon behind him. But the bear was too fast, and soon it caught up to him.
Timmy learned that sometimes, it's not safe to go on adventures alone. He should have asked his parents to come with him. The moral of the story is that it's important to be careful and ask for help when you need it.
