George was embarrassed. He was at a big stadium where lots of people were watching him. Everyone was very popular.
George had never been to a stadium before. He saw the people cheering and clapping. He was so embarrassed he couldn’t look up.
George heard a loud voice. It was the crowd shouting, “George, George, George!” He felt his cheeks turning red. He wanted to hide and not be seen, but it was too late.
Then something amazing happened. George was given a medal and everyone was shouting his name. He was so embarrassed, but also so happy! He waved to the crowd with a huge smile and cheered. He felt like a very special person.
