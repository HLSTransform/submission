Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, her mom asked her to bring a tray to the table. Lily was a bit clumsy and almost dropped the tray, but she managed to hold it tight and bring it to the table.
Her mom was so proud of her! She gave her a big hug and said, "You did a great job, Lily! You understand how to be careful with the tray." Lily was happy that her mom was proud of her and she felt very grown up. From that day on, she always helped her mom with the tray and made sure to be careful.
