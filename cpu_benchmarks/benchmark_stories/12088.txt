Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and sing songs. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. There, she saw a magician doing magic tricks. Lily was so happy and amazed by the magic.
But then, the magician asked Lily if she wanted to help with a trick. Lily was scared because she didn't know what to do. Her mom said it was okay to say no if she disagreed with the magician. So, Lily said no and the magician understood.
After that, Lily and her mom went home and had some ice cream. Lily told her mom about the magic and how she was scared to help. Her mom told her it was okay to be scared and that she did the right thing by disagreeing with the magician. From then on, Lily knew that it was important to always speak up if she felt scared or uncomfortable.
