Once upon a time, there was a little duck named Ducky. Ducky loved to swim in the pond all day long. One day, Ducky's mommy said, "Ducky, you need to find a way to be successful in life. Swimming all day won't make you successful." 
Ducky didn't understand what success meant, so he asked his mommy. "Success means doing something really well and being happy about it," his mommy explained. 
Ducky thought and thought about what he could do well. Suddenly, he realized that he was really good at diving under the water and finding things. 
Ducky started to dive and search for things in the pond. He found all sorts of things like rocks, sticks, and even some shiny coins. Ducky was so happy and proud of himself. "I did it! I found things and I'm successful!" he quacked. 
Ducky's mommy was so proud of him too. She said, "You did a great job, Ducky! And now that you're out of the water, you're all dry!" Ducky laughed and quacked, "Yes, I am!" And from that day on, Ducky knew that he could be successful in many different ways.
