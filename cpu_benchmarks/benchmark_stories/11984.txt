Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine and pick flowers. One day, she found a big envelope on the ground. It was white and had a stamp on it.
Lily was curious about what was inside the envelope. She wanted to open it right away, but her mom told her to wait until they got home. Lily was impatient and couldn't wait to see what was inside.
When they got home, Lily's mom let her open the envelope. Inside, there was a beautiful picture of a rainbow. Lily was so happy and excited. She wanted to show her friends the picture, but she knew she had to be careful not to cover it with her fingerprints.
Lily put the picture up on her wall where she could see it every day. She was so happy that she found the envelope and got to see the pretty picture inside.
