Once upon a time, there was a sleepy spider. He wanted to own his own home, so he set off to find one. First, he looked in the trees but all he found was leaves. He scurried around the ground and found a small hole. It was just the right size for a sleepy spider! 
He rushed inside and looked around. It was perfect - a cozy place to rest. The spider wiggled in, like a cuddly toy. He wriggled until he was comfortable and settled down. It felt so good to be in his very own home! 
He stayed there all day, taking nice naps in his safe and dark place. But once it got dark outside, the spider came out and began spinning webs. He spun webs until the morning and then he crawled back into his cozy home and fell back asleep.
Since then, the sleepy spider has been living happily in his own home. He takes cozy naps and spins webs at night. He loves his own little home, and is never too sleepy to tell it so!
