Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the rain. One day, her mom gave her a clear umbrella to keep her dry.
Lily went outside and saw her friend Jack. Jack saw her umbrella and said, "I want to play with your umbrella!" but he was teasing her. Lily didn't like that and said, "No, my umbrella is mine!"
Jack felt bad for teasing her and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. Can we share your umbrella?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, we can share my umbrella!" So they played outside in the rain together, under the clear umbrella.
