Once there was a kid. He wanted to swim in the ocean. But he felt guilty. He thought he didn't know how to swim. So he stayed on the beach.
But then he saw another kid in the water. That kid was swimming! He was having a lot of fun.
So the first kid got brave. He jumped into the water too! He tried to swim. And then he found out he could swim! He was so happy.
He swam and swam and then he went back to the beach. He was no longer feeling guilty. He had learned he could swim!
