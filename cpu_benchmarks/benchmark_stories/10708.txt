Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Teddy. One day, Teddy was very tired and wanted to rest. He found a cozy spot under a tree and lay down to sleep. While he was sleeping, he dreamed about his favorite food - spaghetti with smooth sauce. 
When Teddy woke up, he was hungry and decided to go find some food. He walked through the forest until he came across a little cottage. Inside the cottage, he found a big pot of spaghetti with smooth sauce! Teddy was so happy and ate until his tummy was full. 
After his meal, Teddy felt very full and decided to rest again. He found a soft patch of grass and lay down to take a nap. As he closed his eyes, he thought about how lucky he was to have found such a delicious meal and a comfortable place to rest.
