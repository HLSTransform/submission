Molly and Jenny were best friends. One day they were playing together in the park when they saw a big cat. Molly was scared of the cat so Jenny said to her, "Don't worry Molly, I'll tell him to go away." Jenny told the cat to go away, and it did. Molly felt so happy that Jenny was so bossy with the cat.
The next day the girls were playing together again. This time they found a small white pill on the ground. Molly wanted to pick up the pill but Jenny said no. She was being bossy but she was doing it to help Molly. Jenny told Molly that the pill was not safe, and that she should not touch it. Molly was so happy that Jenny was looking out for her that she hugged her.
Molly and Jenny kept playing happily together for the rest of the day. They were having so much fun. They knew that being best friends meant that Jenny could always tell Molly when something wasn't safe. And Molly knew that Jenny would always look out for her and keep her safe.
