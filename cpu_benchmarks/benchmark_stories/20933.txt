Once upon a time there was a wild figure. He lived in the forest and liked to explore. One day he heard a strange noise. He stopped and wondered, "What is that?"
He followed the noise and found a little girl playing in the field. She had bright eyes and a big smile. The figure said hello and the girl looked up and smiled.
The girl pointed to the sky and asked "What is that?" The figure looked up and saw a bird flying above. He told the girl it was a bird and watched as she twirled and laughed in delight.
The figure was curious and asked the girl lots of questions. He wanted to know all about her. The girl talked about her day and the wild animals she had seen. They laughed together and became friends.
At the end of the day the girl waved goodbye to the figure with a happy smile. The figure watched her walk away and was glad he was able to answer her questions. He continued on his way, content that he had met a new friend. The end.
