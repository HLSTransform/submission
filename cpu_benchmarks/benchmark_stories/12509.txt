Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and watch cartoons on TV. One day, Lily's mom brought home a big surprise for her. It was a new armchair for Lily to sit on and read her books.
Lily was so happy and jumped up and down with excitement. "Wow, Mommy! The armchair is so big and comfortable," she said. "Can I sit on it now?"
"Of course, Lily. It's very flexible and you can sit on it any way you want," her mom replied.
Lily sat on the armchair and tried different positions. She sat cross-legged, with her legs stretched out, and even upside down. She loved how the armchair moved with her and how comfortable it was. "Thank you, Mommy. This armchair is the best surprise ever!" she exclaimed.
