Once upon a time, there was a naughty little monkey called Jim. He lived in the jungle with his family.
One day, Jim wanted to play with metal. He asked his mom, "Can I play with metal?". His mom said, "No, Jim. Metal is very dangerous and you could get hurt". Jim felt sad, but he was a good boy and he respected his mom's request. 
Later, Jim's brother Billy came to play. He saw the metal and asked to play with it. Letting out a big sigh, Jimmy's mom said, "No Billy. I already told Jim that metal is very dangerous and you must not play with it". 
But suddenly, the naughty Billy laughed playfully and ran off with the metal. Jimmy was shocked! He chased after his brother and said, "Billy, you have to put down the metal and listen to Mommy's request". 
In the end, Billy heard his brother's request and put down the metal. Jim was so happy that his brother was now safe. He hugged Billy and smiled.
