Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, while playing on the swings, she saw a colorful magazine on the ground. She picked it up and looked at the pictures inside. They were so lively and made her happy.
Suddenly, she heard a loud noise and turned around to see her friend Emma fall off the monkey bars. Lily quickly ran over to help her up and make sure she was okay. Emma was a bit hurt, but Lily's kindness made her feel better.
After they finished playing, Lily went home and showed her mom the magazine she found. Her mom was happy to see her daughter so excited about reading. They sat down together and looked at the pictures, talking about all the fun things they saw. From that day on, Lily made sure to always look out for her friends and keep a lookout for more lively magazines to read.
