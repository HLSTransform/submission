Once upon a time, there was a brilliant girl named Lucy. She loved life and loved learning.
One day, her parents took her to the circus. Lucy was so excited and she couldn't wait to see the clowns and animals. 
When she got to the circus, she saw everyone wearing masks. She asked her parents, "What are those masks?"
Her dad replied, "Those are funny masks. People wear them so they can forget their everyday lives and just have fun."
Lucy was amazed and asked if she could have one. Her parents agreed and she put it on. She swung around with the mask on, feeling like a different person. She felt supereblliant!
At the end of the circus, Lucy forgot to take off her mask. She went home with it still on. Everyone laughed at her and told her that she looked funny. Lucy laughed along too and eventually took it off. But the feeling of being someone else was still with her!
