Lily and Ben were playing in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They gave him a carrot nose and two rocks for eyes. They were very happy.
"Let's go inside now," said Lily. "It is cold and Mommy made hot cocoa for us."
"No, I want to play more," said Ben. He was stubborn. He did not want to stop.
"But you are wet and shivering," said Lily. "You need to wear a coat. Mommy will be angry if you get sick."
"I don't care," said Ben. He threw a snowball at Lily. It hit her in the face. She cried.
"Ben, that is not nice!" said Lily. She ran to the house. She opened the door and entered. She took off her wet gloves and boots. She saw Mommy in the kitchen.
"Mommy, Ben is mean!" she said. "He threw a snowball at me and he does not want to come inside."
Mommy hugged Lily and wiped her tears. She gave her a cup of hot cocoa. She looked out the window and saw Ben still playing in the snow.
"Ben, come inside now!" she shouted. "You will catch a cold. Put on your coat and come here."
Ben heard Mommy. He did not listen. He was stubborn. He made another snowball and threw it at the snowman. He missed. He slipped and fell. He hurt his knee. He cried.
"Mommy, help!" he said. He wanted Mommy to come and hug him. He was sorry.
Mommy heard Ben. She put down her cup and ran to the door. She opened it and entered the snow. She picked up Ben and carried him inside. She took off his wet clothes and put on his coat. She kissed his knee and gave him a band-aid. She gave him a cup of hot cocoa.
"Ben, you were stubborn," she said. "You should have listened to Lily and me. You could have had fun and stayed warm. Next time, wear a coat and come inside when I call you."
"I'm sorry, Mommy," said Ben. "I'm sorry, Lily. I love you."
"I love you too, Ben," said Lily. She smiled and hugged him. They drank their hot cocoa and ate some cookies. They were happy.
