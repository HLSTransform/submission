Once upon a time, there were two cats who lived next door to each other. The cats were not very friendly to each other, but they wanted to be. To unite them, a tiny mouse found an honest way to bring them closer. 
The mouse ran to the toilet and filled it with water from a nearby river. He created a game that the cats could play in the toilet. They both seemed hesitant, but the mouse convinced them it would be fun.
The cats stepped into the toilet, one after the other, and started playing the game. At first, they were afraid of the water, but soon they started to feel more comfortable. They began to swim around and play together.
The little mouse cheered and clapped his hands. The cats were united! As they played, the cats became friends and were honest with each other. Now the cats always get together in the toilet to have fun!
