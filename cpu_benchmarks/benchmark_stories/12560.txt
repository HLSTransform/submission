Tom and Anna are friends. They like to play together. Today, they are playing in Tom's room. Tom has a big carpet with many colors and shapes. Anna likes the carpet too.
"Look, Anna, this is my carpet. It is soft and fun. Do you want to play with me?" Tom asks.
"Yes, Tom, I want to play with you. What can we do on the carpet?" Anna says.
"We can pretend the carpet is a map. We can go to different places and have adventures. Do you see the blue part? That is the sea. And the green part? That is the forest. And the yellow part? That is the desert. Where do you want to go first?" Tom says.
Anna thinks for a moment. She is excited. She likes to pretend. She points to the red part of the carpet.
"I want to go to the red part. It is the volcano. It is hot and loud. Maybe we can find some dinosaurs there. What do you think?" Anna says.
Tom nods. He likes dinosaurs too. He grabs two toy dinosaurs from his shelf. He gives one to Anna.
"OK, let's go to the volcano. But be careful, it might erupt. This is my dinosaur. His name is Rex. He is big and strong. What is your dinosaur's name?" Tom says.
Anna looks at her dinosaur. It is small and cute. She smiles.
"My dinosaur's name is Lily. She is smart and friendly. She likes to play with Rex. Come on, let's go to the volcano and have fun!" Anna says.
Tom and Anna crawl to the red part of the carpet. They make dinosaur noises and pretend to explore the volcano. They are happy and have a lot of fun. They don't notice that Tom's mom is watching them from the door. She smiles and thinks they are very creative and sweet. She is proud of them.
