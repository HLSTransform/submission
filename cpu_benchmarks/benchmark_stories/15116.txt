Once upon a time there was a young boy called Jack. He was only three years old.
One day, Jack was playing in the garden when he noticed a strange book lying on the grass. He picked it up and tried to examine it. He was curious to find out what was inside.
As Jack opened the book, he heard a little voice saying, "Hello Jack!" Jack looked up in surprise and saw a little fairy smiling at him.
Jack said, "Hello, who are you?"
The fairy replied, "My name is Candy and I'm here to teach you something special. This book contains magical powers and it can help you do amazing things. But only if you really try! All you need to do is examine the book carefully."
Jack was very excited by the fairy's words. He examined the book with great care. He soon found that it was filled with magic spells. 
Jack thanked the fairy for teaching him such a magical thing. He looked up to see that the fairy had magically disappeared.
Jack ran back into the house, excited to show off his new skills. He knew that with a little practice he would definitely make some amazing things happen.
