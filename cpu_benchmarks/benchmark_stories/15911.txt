One day, a little girl called Mandy was playing in her garden. It was a sunny day and she was having lots of fun. Suddenly, she saw something strange on the grass. It was a thing. It was very shiny and sparkly.
Mandy got closer. She reached out to touch it and wipe it. But the thing wouldn't move!
Mandy asked, "What are you?"
A voice said, "I'm a successful gold coin. If you wipe me three times, you can make a wish. Then your wish will come true!"
Mandy's eyes opened wide. She quickly wiped the coin three times and wished for new toys.
Soon enough, Mandy's mommy came outside with a big bundle of toys.
Mandy was so excited! She thanked the coin and gave it a big hug.
"I'm glad my wish came true," said Mandy.
The coin smiled. "I'm glad I was able to help," it said.
