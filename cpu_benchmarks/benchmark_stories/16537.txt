Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to swing on the swings at the park. He wore a blue shirt and pants. One day, he saw a man in a suit walking towards him. The man asked Timmy if he wanted to swing higher. Timmy said yes and the man pushed him. But the man pushed too hard and Timmy flew off the swing and got hurt. The man in the suit ran away and Timmy was sad.
