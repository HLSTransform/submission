Lila and Ben were friends who liked to play with toys. One day, they found a big kangaroo toy in the park. It was soft and brown and had a pouch. They both wanted to hug it and take it home.
"Mine!" said Lila, grabbing the kangaroo.
"No, mine!" said Ben, pulling the kangaroo.
They started to fight and tug on the toy. The kangaroo looked sad and scared.
"Stop!" said a voice. It was Mia, another friend who was watching them. "You are hurting the kangaroo. You should share it. Sharing is good."
Lila and Ben looked at Mia. They felt ashamed. They knew she was right. They let go of the kangaroo and said sorry to each other.
"Can we all play with the kangaroo?" asked Lila.
"Sure," said Ben. "We can take turns. You can go first."
They smiled and hugged. They thanked Mia for being a good friend. They played with the kangaroo and had fun. The kangaroo was happy too. It liked to be with kind and humble children.
