One day, Jack was walking in the park with his mom. It was a cold day and the park was icy.
Suddenly, Jack heard a whistle. He looked around, not knowing where the noise had come from. His mom noticed the sound too.
"Jack, I think someone is calling you." she said.
Jack looked around again and saw a man holding a whistle. The man said "come here Jack, I have an order for you!"
Jack and his mom walked over to the man. The man handed Jack a box.
"I need you to deliver this box to the tree over there," the man said, pointing at a big tree.
Jack was excited. He took the box and ran over to the tree. When he got there, he placed the box on the ground and ran back to the man.
The man gave Jack a big smile and said "well done, Jack! You have done an excellent job!"
Jack and his mom walked back home, both feeling proud of Jack's accomplishment.
