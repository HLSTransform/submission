Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go outside and pick berries. One day, she found a fancy looking berry, but it was too high up on the bush for her to reach. She struggled and struggled, but she couldn't get it. 
Lily decided to ask her big brother for help. He was very tall and could reach the berry easily. He picked it for her and she was so happy! She ate the berry and it was the most delicious one she had ever tasted. 
From that day on, Lily always asked for help when she struggled to reach something. And she never forgot the fancy berry that her big brother helped her get.
