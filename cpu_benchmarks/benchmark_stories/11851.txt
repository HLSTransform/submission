Blossom and Hopper were the best of friends. One day, they went to the meadow together. The meadow was filled with hay and it was a beautiful sight. Blossom and Hopper were so excited that they ran around, playing and laughing happily.
But as they were playing, they saw a little squirrel crying. Blossom asked the squirrel, "What's wrong?" The squirrel said, "I lost my spicy nuts." Blossom and Hopper wanted to help the squirrel so they started looking for the nuts.
But no matter how hard they looked, Hopper and Blossom could not find the nuts. Soon, blossoms eyes were full of tears. She said, "We will never find the nuts!" Hopper said, "Big tears won't help. Maybe we should look harder!"
Hopper and Blossom looked and looked until finally, Hopper found a spicy nut under the hay. They were so happy for the little squirrel that they both wept with joy. The squirrel was so happy to get his nut back and thanked Hopper and Blossom for their help. They all hugged and the squirrel returned back to his home. Hopper and Blossom stayed to enjoy the meadow the rest of the day.
