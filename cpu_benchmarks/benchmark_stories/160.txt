Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to read. He had a big book with lots of pictures and words. One day, he went outside to play and saw a pile of leaves. He wanted to jump in them, but they were too messy. 
Timmy's mom came outside and saw the leaves. "We need to rake these leaves," she said. "Can you help me, Timmy?" Timmy was brave and said yes. They worked together and raked all the leaves into a big pile. 
Then, Timmy's little sister came outside and wanted to jump in the pile. But Timmy said no because they worked hard to make it neat. His sister got upset and started to cry. Timmy felt bad, so he read her a story from his book. She stopped crying and they all played together in the leaves. The end.
