Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was playing outside when she heard a loud noise. She looked around and saw that a bird had gotten stuck in a pipe.
Lily ran to her mom and said, "Mommy, there's a bird in the pipe! We need to save it!"
Her mom quickly came outside and saw the bird. "You're right, Lily. We need to help it. But how can we get it out?"
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I have an idea! We can use this attractive toy to lure the bird out of the pipe."
So they tried Lily's idea and it worked! The bird flew out of the pipe and into the sky. Lily and her mom felt happy that they were able to save the bird.
