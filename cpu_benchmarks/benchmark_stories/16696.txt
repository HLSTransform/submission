Lily liked to write stories. She had a big book with many pages. She wrote stories about animals, fairies, and pirates. She used crayons to make pictures too. She was very proud of her stories.
One day, she wanted to show her stories to her mom. She ran to her room and opened her drawer. But her book was not there. She looked under her bed, in her closet, and on her shelf. She could not find her book. She felt sad and angry.
She went to the kitchen, where her mom was making cookies. "Mom, where is my book?" she asked. "I want to show you my stories."
Her mom smiled and hugged her. "I have a surprise for you, Lily. Come with me." She took her hand and led her to the living room. There, on the table, was a lovely new book. It had a shiny cover and a ribbon. It said, "Lily's Stories".
"Mom, is this for me?" Lily gasped.
"Yes, my sweet. I saw your book in your drawer and I thought it was so wonderful. I wanted to make it more special for you. So I took it to the store and they made it into a lovely new book. Do you like it?"
Lily hugged her mom and the book. She was so happy. She opened the book and saw her stories and pictures. They looked even more beautiful. She thanked her mom and kissed her.
"Can I read you my stories, Mom?" she asked.
"Of course, my darling. I would love to hear your stories. You are a very good writer, Lily." Her mom said.
They sat on the couch and Lily read her stories to her mom. They laughed and clapped and had a lot of fun. Lily felt very proud and loved. She was glad she had a mom who liked her stories and a lovely new book to write more.
