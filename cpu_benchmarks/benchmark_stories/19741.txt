Once upon a time there was a boy called John. One day, he was walking through the woods and he stumbled on a big rock. He didn't know what to do. Then he heard a noise from the far side of the woods.
John walked to the noisy spot and saw a big black bird. It asked him a question with its beak. John was confused. He couldn't understand the bird's question.
Suddenly, the bird flew away. John stumbled and fell again. He got up and decided to keep walking. He kept walking until he heard the bird again. The bird asked him the same question!
John tried to answer this time. The bird cocked its head and smiled. The bird said that John had answered the question correctly.
John was so happy. He said goodbye to the bird and walked back home. He was thankful that he had been able to answer the bird's question.
