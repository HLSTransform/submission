Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat peaches. One day, he saw a peach on the ground and picked it up. But the peach was hard and not ripe yet. Timmy was sad because he couldn't eat it.
Timmy's mom saw him and said, "Don't worry, Timmy. The peach will be ripe soon. Just wait a little longer." Timmy waited and waited, and finally, the peach became soft and juicy. He was so happy that he could finally eat it.
From that day on, Timmy learned that good things come to those who wait. He also learned that sometimes things might seem hard or sharp, but with a little patience, they can become sweet and delicious, just like his peach.
