Once upon a time, there was a bunny. He wanted a new tent to sleep in, so he asked his mom for one. His mom said he could have it, so he was very happy! He received a tent and quickly put it up.
He spent the next day playing in it. He liked to pretend the tent was a castle. He would dress up as a prince and play with his toys. 
Unfortunately, the next morning, he noticed something was wrong. He saw that his tent was broken! He was so sad and started to cry. He didn't know what to do.
 
Suddenly, his mom had an idea. She said she could help him fix the tent. She gave him some glue and showed him how to use it. The bunny worked on the tent for a long time and eventually he was able to fix it so it was as good as new.
The bunny was so happy! He thanked his mom and kept playing in his tent. The bunny was very proud of his tent and thanked his mom every day for helping him fix it.
