Tom and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. Tom had a big van that he liked to drive around. Lily had a small doll that she liked to dress up. They were having fun until Tom had an idea.
"Let's attach your doll to my van!" he said to Lily. "It will be fun!"
Lily did not like Tom's idea. She did not want her doll to be dragged by the van. She liked her doll to be clean and pretty.
"No, Tom, no!" she said. "I don't want to attach my doll to your van. Leave my doll alone!"
But Tom did not listen. He grabbed Lily's doll and tried to tie it to the back of his van. Lily tried to stop him, but he was stronger. He attached the doll to the van and drove away.
"Ha ha, look at your doll!" he said. "She is flying behind my van!"
Lily was very sad and angry. She ran after Tom and his van. She wanted to get her doll back. She shouted at Tom to stop, but he did not stop. He drove faster and faster.
"Stop, Tom, stop!" she said. "You are hurting my doll! Give her back to me!"
Tom did not care. He thought it was funny to see Lily chase him and his van. He laughed and laughed.
But then, something happened. Tom's van hit a chair and flipped over. The doll flew out of the rope and landed on the floor. Tom's van broke into pieces. Tom was not laughing anymore. He was scared and hurt.
Lily saw what happened. She ran to her doll and picked her up. She checked if her doll was okay. She was dirty and torn, but she was still her doll. Lily hugged her doll and cried.
She looked at Tom and his van. She felt sorry for him. He was crying too. He had no van to play with anymore. He had no fun anymore.
Lily decided to be nice. She walked to Tom and offered him her doll.
"Here, Tom, you can play with my doll," she said. "She is a nice doll. She likes to be your friend."
Tom looked at Lily and her doll. He felt ashamed and sorry. He had been mean to Lily and her doll. He had broken his van and his fun.
He took Lily's doll and said, "Thank you, Lily. You are a nice girl. You are a good friend."
He hugged Lily's doll and smiled. Lily smiled too. They decided to play together. They forgot about the van and the rope. They had fun with the doll. They were happy.
