Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a big, red fox running in the field. She wanted to play with the fox, so she called out to him.
"Hello, Mr. Fox! Do you want to play with me?" she asked.
The fox stopped and turned to look at the little girl. "No, I am too busy hunting for food," he said.
The little girl was sad that the fox didn't want to play, but she understood. She watched as the fox ran away, feeling a little bit dry from the hot sun. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. It was a hunter trying to shoot the fox! The little girl quickly ran over to the hunter and said, "Please don't shoot the fox! He's my friend!"
The hunter listened to the little girl and decided not to shoot the fox. The little girl was happy that she saved her friend and they both went on to play together in the field.
