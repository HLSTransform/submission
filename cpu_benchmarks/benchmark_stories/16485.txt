Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play near the lake. They saw a fisherman with a big hat and a long stick. He was throwing something into the water and pulling it back.
"Can we touch your stick?" Lily asked the fisherman.
"Sure, but be careful. It's called a rod and it has a hook at the end. It can hurt you if you are not tidy," the fisherman said.
He showed them how to hold the rod and how to cast the line. Lily and Ben took turns and tried to catch a fish.
"Look, I got one!" Ben shouted. He pulled a small fish out of the water. It was shiny and wet and wiggled in his hand.
"Wow, it's so pretty!" Lily said. She wanted to touch the fish too.
"Here, you can touch it, but gently. It's alive and it needs water to breathe," the fisherman said. He helped them put the fish back into the lake.
"Thank you for letting us play with your rod and your fish," Lily and Ben said.
"You're welcome. You are very good and tidy children. Maybe next time you can catch a bigger fish," the fisherman said.
He waved goodbye and walked away. Lily and Ben smiled and ran back to their mom. They told her all about their adventure with the fisherman.
