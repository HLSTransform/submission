Once there was a beetle, who was small and green. He lived in a flower garden and liked to explore. One day he went for a walk and saw a giant hole in the ground. He looked in and noticed that it was very deep. He was curious, so he crawled down the hole to investigate. 
At the bottom of the hole, he saw a shiny green object. He went closer and questioned what it was. Suddenly, the object started to rustle and the beetle got scared. Before he could figure out what it was, the beetle felt the ground open up beneath him and he fell slowly into the darkness. 
The beetle never returned to the flower garden again.
