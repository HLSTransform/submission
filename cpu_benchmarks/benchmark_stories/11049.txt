Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They see many flowers in the park. Lily likes the yellow flowers. Ben likes the red flowers.
"Look, Lily, a sunflower!" Ben says. He points to a big yellow flower. It is taller than Ben. "It is so pretty!"
Lily runs to the sunflower. She wants to touch it. She reaches up with her hand. But the sunflower is too high. She cannot touch it. She feels sad.
"Ben, help me!" Lily says. "I want to touch the sunflower!"
Ben runs to Lily. He has an idea. He finds a big rock. He lifts the rock. It is heavy. He puts the rock near the sunflower. He climbs on the rock. He is higher now.
"Lily, come here!" Ben says. He holds out his hand. "I can help you!"
Lily climbs on the rock too. She takes Ben's hand. She stands on her toes. She touches the sunflower. It is soft and warm. She smiles.
"Thank you, Ben!" Lily says. "You are a good friend!"
Ben smiles too. He is happy. He and Lily hug. They look at the sunflower. They see a bee. The bee is busy. It likes the sunflower too.
