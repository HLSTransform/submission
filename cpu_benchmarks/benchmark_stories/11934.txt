Once upon a time, there was a funny monkey named Max. Max loved to joke around with his friends in the jungle. One day, Max decided to play a joke on his friend, the elephant. He hid behind a big stack of bananas and waited for the elephant to walk by. 
When the elephant got close, Max jumped out and scared him! The elephant was surprised, but then he laughed and said, "Max, you're such a jokester!" Max was happy that his friend liked his joke. 
Later that day, Max saw a nosy bird peeking into his tree. Max didn't like when others were nosy, so he asked the bird to leave. The bird flew away, and Max went back to playing with his friends. From then on, Max made sure to only joke around with friends who weren't too nosy.
