Once upon a time there was a girl named Jill. She was three-years-old and loved playing with her toys.
One day she found some pages on the ground. She thought they must have been from a book. She wanted to match the pages together so they would turn into a book again.
But it was not easy, as the pages were very small. She got angry, because she couldn't find the right matches. She felt like she was trying forever.
But then something wonderful happened. Her mother came over and saw what she was doing. She showed Jill how to match the pages together. Jill smiled as all of the pieces fit together like a puzzle.
When the book was finished, her mother's friend came over with a surprise. It was a brand new book. Jill was so happy that she gave her mom a big hug.
