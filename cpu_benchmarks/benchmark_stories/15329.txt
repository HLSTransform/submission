Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Robby. He was only 3 years old, but he loved to play chess. One day, Robby's mommy said he could have a black chess set to play with. Robby was so excited!
Robby's mommy went to the store and bought a black chess set for Robby. When she came home, she unboxed it and set it up for her son to play with.
But then, Robby said he wanted to bake a cake for the chess. His mommy said that was a great idea, so she helped him make a big, yummy cake. Robby had great fun mixing the cake ingredients together to make the batter.
After the cake was ready, Robby and his mommy put it in the oven and watched it bake. When the cake was done, it looked delicious and smelled so good! Robby and his mommy cut the cake into pieces and enjoyed it with a cup of tea.
Robby's mommy said the black chess set and Robby's cake made a perfect match. Robby smiled, and he was thankful to have a mommy who let him bake a cake to go with his new black chess set.
