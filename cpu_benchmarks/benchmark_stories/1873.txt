Once upon a time there was a rabbit, named Benny. Benny loved to bounce up and down in the wide field near his home. He was so restless and full of energy!
One day, Benny was hopping around the field, singing and jumping up and down when he heard a voice. He stopped and looked around, but he didn't see anything. Then he heard the voice again.
"Benny, it's me!" the voice said.
Benny looked around some more and saw a little bird in a tree.
"Are you talking to me?" Benny asked.
"Of course!" the bird replied. 
"My name is Betty and I was just watching you bounce around the wide field. It looks like you are having so much fun!"
Benny smiled and said, "I sure am! I love bouncing around the field!"
Betty laughed and said, "Then keep bouncing! Have fun!"
So Benny continued to jump and bounce around the wide field, enjoying the freedom and being as restless as ever.
