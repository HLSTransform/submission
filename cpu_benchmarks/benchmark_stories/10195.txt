Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom. One day, mom asked Lily to go to the store and buy some napkins. Lily was excited to help.
When Lily got to the store, she saw many different napkins. There were big ones and small ones. There were red, blue, and yellow ones too. Lily thought hard about which ones to buy. She wanted to pick the best ones for her mom.
Lily decided to buy the big, blue napkins. She thought her mom would like them. She took the napkins home and showed her mom. Her mom was so happy and proud of Lily for helping. They used the new napkins at dinner, and they all had a great time.
