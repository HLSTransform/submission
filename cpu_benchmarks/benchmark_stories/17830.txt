Once upon a time there was a fierce wolf. He was going for a walk, when he saw a chair. He thought it looked comfy, so he decided to sit down. He noticed that it was a special kind of chair - a throne! He wanted to prepare, so he layed out his best clothes, a shiny crown, and a fancy necklace. He got on the chair and put on the crown and necklace. The wolf immediately felt like a king. He was so fierce, even the birds stopped singing. Everyone around could feel the power of the wolf. He was the king of the forest and everyone lived happily ever after.
