Tom and Lily wanted to ride their bikes in the park. They put on their helmets and got on their bikes. Tom was fast and good at riding. Lily was slow and still learning.
"Come on, Lily, hurry up!" Tom shouted. He was not patient. He wanted to go to the big hill and race down.
"Wait for me, Tom!" Lily cried. She tried to pedal faster, but her legs were tired. She was afraid of the big hill. She wanted to stay on the flat path.
Tom did not listen. He rode ahead and reached the big hill. He looked down and smiled. He was ready to go fast and have fun.
But then he saw a big dog on the road. The dog was barking and running towards him. Tom was scared. He tried to stop, but he was going too fast. He could not prevent the crash.
"Tom, watch out!" Lily shouted. She saw the dog and Tom. She pedaled hard and reached them. She got off her bike and ran to Tom. She hugged him and asked, "Are you okay, Tom?"
Tom was crying. He had a scratch on his arm and a dent on his bike. He was sorry for being mean to Lily. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I should have waited for you. You are a good sister. Thank you for helping me."
Lily smiled and said, "It's okay, Tom. I'm glad you are not hurt badly. You are a brave brother. Let's go home and tell Mom."
They walked back to their bikes and rode home together. They were patient and careful. They learned to be kind and safe.
