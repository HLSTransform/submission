Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved flowers and had a green vase that she used to put them in. One day, she was playing with her toys when she noticed that her vase was broken. She was very sad because it was her favorite vase. 
But then, her mommy came and said, "Don't worry, Lily. We can fix it." Mommy took some glue and attached the broken pieces of the vase back together. Lily was so happy to see her vase all fixed and she put some pretty flowers in it. 
From that day on, Lily was very careful with her vase and made sure not to drop it again. She loved her green vase even more now that it was fixed and she knew that her mommy could fix anything. The end.
