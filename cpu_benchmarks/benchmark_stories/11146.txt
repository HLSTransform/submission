Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was walking in the forest when she saw a weird trap. "What is that?" she asked herself. Suddenly, a little bird flew down and got stuck in the trap.
"Oh no! Little bird, I will help you," said Lily. She tried to open the trap, but it was too strong. "I need to find someone to help us," she said to the bird.
Lily ran to find her friend, Timmy. "Timmy, please come with me. A little bird is trapped in a weird trap," she said. Timmy followed Lily to the trap and together they were able to free the bird. "Yay! We did it! The trap is over and the bird is free!" they shouted.
