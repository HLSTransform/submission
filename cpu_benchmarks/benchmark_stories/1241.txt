John saw something very special. He found a secret file in his dad's bedroom. It looked filthy, but he remembered his dad telling him never to touch it. John was very brave and decided to take a peek inside the file. He opened it carefully and he saw lots of different papers and photographs. He saw pictures of his mom and dad when they were little, and lots of memories came rushing back to him.
John saw lots of things he recognized like an old teddy bear he used to love and a necklace his mom liked to wear. He saw a picture of his dad when he was younger, but he couldn't remember ever seeing it. He was so amazed at all the things in the file. He wanted to tell his dad what he had found, but he was too scared.
John put the file away and he remembered his dad saying that it was very special. He made a silent promise to himself to never touch it again. He cleaned the filthy file until it looked as good as new and he kept his promise to his dad.
