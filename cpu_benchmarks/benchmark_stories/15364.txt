Jimmy was an adventurer. He was always ready to serve and help others. He had a big passport with lots of stamps to prove it.
One day, he spotted a big mountain and he decided to climb it. The climb was long and difficult, but he kept going. When he reached the peak, he found a giant flag at the very top.
Jimmy carefully removed the flag and took it back down the mountain. He showed the flag to the mayor when he arrived in the village. The mayor was so very thankful for Jimmyâ€™s helpful service of returning the flag.
Jimmy was given a medal for his bravery and helpfulness. He was so proud of it. From then on, Jimmy was known as a helpful adventurer with a brave heart.
