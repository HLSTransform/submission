Once there was a little girl who was very brave. She went to the doctor with her mom. The little girl was so scared. She was shaking and holding her mom's hand tightly. 
The doctor smiled at the little girl. He said it would be ok. He wanted her to stay and not go away. 
The little girl stayed and the doctor checked her. He listened to her heart and looked in her eyes. But even though the doctor was very nice, the little girl was still scared. 
The doctor gave the little girl a hug and said she was ok. He said she could go home now. The little girl was so happy that she hugged the doctor and thanked him. 
The little girl knew that even though the doctor was scary, he had helped her. Now she wasn't scared anymore.
