Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to tell jokes to her friends. One day, Lily told her friend Timmy a joke. "Why did the banana go to the doctor?" she asked. Timmy didn't know the answer, so Lily said, "Because it wasn't peeling well!" Timmy laughed and nodded his head.
Later that day, Lily's mom took her to the park. They saw a man in a suit walking by. "He looks rich," Lily's mom said. Lily didn't know what that meant, so she asked her mom. "It means he has a lot of money," her mom explained.
As they were leaving the park, Lily saw Timmy again. She ran over to him and told him another joke. "Why did the chicken cross the playground?" she asked. Timmy didn't know, so Lily said, "To get to the other slide!" Timmy laughed and nodded his head again. They all went home happy and laughing. The end.
