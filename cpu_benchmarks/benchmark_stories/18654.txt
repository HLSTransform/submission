Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to eat melon. He would eat it every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. One day, Tim went to the store to buy a melon. He saw a nosy dog sniffing around the melons. The dog was very curious and kept sticking his nose in the melons. Tim asked the store owner to sign a paper saying the dog wasn't allowed in the store. The store owner signed the paper and the nosy dog had to leave. Tim was happy he could buy his melon in peace.
