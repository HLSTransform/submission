Once upon a time there was a school. All the children were very excited because today the class was getting a new blackboard. The kids rushed to the front of the classroom and eagerly waited for the teacher. She arrived and took her seat behind the big desk.
The teacher smiled and said, "Today, we will write on our new blackboard!" She asked for an erase, but it was too weak. So, she asked one of the children to help. The little girl went to the back of the room and brought a much stronger one.
The teacher smiled and thanked her. Then she asked everyone to get ready. She took a piece of chalk and began writing on the blackboard. Soon, everyone was clapping and having fun.
After the lesson, the children sat down in their seats and began to work on their project. They enjoyed using the blackboard and talked about what a great day it was. Even though the erase was weak, it still did its job. Everyone was so happy that they got the chance to write on the new blackboard!
