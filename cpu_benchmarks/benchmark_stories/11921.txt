Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the rain because she liked to get wet. One day, Lily went outside to play and it started to rain. She was so happy to feel the raindrops on her face and she danced around in the puddles.
Suddenly, Lily saw a friendly dog walking towards her. The dog was wagging its tail and looked very happy to see her. Lily was a little bit scared at first, but then she remembered what her mom had told her about friendly dogs. She asked the dog if it wanted to play with her and the dog barked happily in response.
Lily and the dog played together in the rain and had so much fun. After a while, the rain stopped and the sun came out. Lily said goodbye to her new friend and went back inside. She was happy and excited to tell her mom about the friendly dog she met in the rain.
