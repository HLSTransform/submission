Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint and draw. One day, she went to her school and saw a big blackboard. It was so big that she couldn't see the top of it. She asked her teacher, "Can I paint on the blackboard?"
The teacher said, "Of course, Lily! You can use this pink chalk to draw whatever you want." Lily was so happy and started to draw a big pink flower on the blackboard. Her friends saw her drawing and said, "Wow, Lily! Your flower is so pretty!"
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you! I love to paint and draw. Maybe one day, I can be an artist!"
