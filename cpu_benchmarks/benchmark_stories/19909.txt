Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toys and run really fast outside. One Tuesday, Timmy's mom asked him if he wanted to go to the park. Timmy was so happy and said "yes please!" 
At the park, Timmy saw other kids playing on the swings and slides. He wanted to play too, so he asked his mom if he could go on the swings. She said "of course!" and helped him get on. Timmy went really high and felt like he was flying. 
After playing for a while, Timmy and his mom went home. Timmy was tired from playing so fast at the park. His mom asked him if he wanted to take a nap and he said "yes please!" Timmy fell asleep quickly and dreamed of flying on the swings at the park again.
