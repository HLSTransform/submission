One day, a little girl named Lily went to the zoo with her mom. They saw many animals like lions, tigers, and bears. But Lily's favorite animal was the kangaroo. She loved how they hopped around and carried their babies in their pouches.
As they were watching the kangaroos, Lily saw a noisy bird flying above them. "Mommy, look at that noisy bird!" she said. Suddenly, the bird dropped a feather and it landed on the kangaroo's head.
The kangaroo didn't like the feather on its head and started shaking it off. Lily laughed and said, "Silly kangaroo, you dropped the feather!" Her mom smiled and said, "Let's go see the monkeys now." And off they went to see more animals at the zoo.
