Once upon a time, there was a girl called Maggie. Maggie was nosy, so even though her mum told her not to, she often went for walks in the big woods that was near her house. 
One day she saw something strange between two trees - it was a funny-looking animal. She got closer and saw it was a brown fox, stretching in the sun. 
"Hello!" Maggie said.
The fox jumped up, "What do you want?"
Maggie started to giggle. "I just wanted to say 'hello' - I've never seen a fox before!"
The fox seemed to be in no trouble at all, so it smiled. "My name's Jerry, what's yours?"
Maggie was so excited. She told Jerry all about herself and they soon became best friends. Every day, Maggie and Jerry would go for walks and stretch beneath the trees. 
When Maggie's mum found out, she warned her about being nosy, but there was nothing to worry about - Maggie and Jerry had become the best of friends.
