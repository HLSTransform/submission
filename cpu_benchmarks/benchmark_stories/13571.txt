Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the sun. One day, he climbed up a big hill to see what was on the other side. But when he got to the top, he saw a big cliff that made him scared. Suddenly, he felt very hot and started to sweat. 
Timmy decided to go back down the hill, but as he was walking, he saw a magic potion on the ground. He picked it up and drank it. Suddenly, he started to shrink and became as small as a mouse! 
Now, the cliff didn't look so big and scary anymore. Timmy climbed up it and saw a beautiful view of the whole town. He felt happy and excited that he had discovered something new. From that day on, Timmy loved to explore and discover new things, even if they seemed scary at first.
