Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved animals and always wanted a pet. One day, her mom took her to the pet store to choose a new friend. Lily looked at all the animals, but she saw a dove and knew that was the one for her. 
The dove was very intelligent and could even do tricks! Lily loved spending time with her new pet and teaching her new things. They would play together and the dove would even sit on Lily's shoulder. 
One day, Lily's friend came over to play. She saw the dove and said, "Wow, she's so pretty!" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, I chose her because she's my favorite." From that day on, Lily and her dove were the best of friends.
