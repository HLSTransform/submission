One day, a child named Jack was very tired. He knew it was time for a nap. So he tried to close his eyes for a little rest. But, the sun was so bright, he couldn't sleep.
Suddenly, Jack had an idea. He found a big cardboard box and placed it over his head. He thought he was being very clever.
Jack's dad was watching from afar and said, "That's so stupid, Jack." But Jack was determined to take a nap.
So, he curled up in the box and drifted off to sleep. All of a sudden, he heard thunder! He peeked his head out and saw a huge storm brewing outside. He had set up his own shelter and was safe from the storm. 
Jack's dad couldn't believe it. Despite Jack's seemingly stupid attempt at napping, Jack had found a way to staydry during the storm. His dad smiled and said, "That's my smart boy!"
