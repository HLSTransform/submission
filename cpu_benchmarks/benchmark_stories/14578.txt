Once there was a little girl named Carla. She was 3 years old and loved to explore. One day, Carla decided to take a walk away from home. She wandered in the woods for what felt like forever. Eventually, Carla grew tired. She wanted to go home.
Carla sat down on a log and sighed. She started to feel a little sad. She thought of her sweet home and the yummy cookies her mom always made. She wished that she could go home and eat one.
Suddenly, a beautiful butterfly flew over Carla's head. It was so colorful and happy! Carla smiled and the butterfly flew away. She remembered that at home, the gardens were full of happy butterflies. She stood up, ready to go home.
Carla climbed out of the woods, feeling happy and content. When she reached her house, her mom was waiting with a warm hug and a big, bright smile. Carla smelled her mom's sweet perfume and knew that everything was going to be alright. Carla knew she should never wander too far away from home again.
