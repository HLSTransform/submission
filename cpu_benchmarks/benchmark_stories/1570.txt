Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play outside in her backyard. One day, she found a shiny stone and picked it up. She showed it to her mom and said, "Look, Mommy! I found a pretty stone!"
Her mom said, "That's a nice stone, Lily. But be careful, it's silly to put it in your mouth."
Lily nodded and played with the stone for a while. But then, she put it in her mouth and accidentally swallowed it. She started to feel sick and regretted putting the stone in her mouth.
Her mom took her to the doctor and luckily, the stone passed through her body. Lily learned her lesson and never put anything silly in her mouth again.
