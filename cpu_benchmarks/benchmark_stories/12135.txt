Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his model cars. One day, Timmy's little sister, Lily, wanted to play with his favorite model car. Timmy didn't want to share because he was excited to play with it by himself.
Lily was sad and started to cry. Timmy felt bad and decided to share his toy with her. But when Lily tried to play with it, she accidentally snapped off one of the wheels. Timmy got upset and started to cry too.
Their mom came in and saw what happened. She told Timmy that it's okay and that accidents happen. She helped them both calm down and showed them how to fix the model car. Timmy was happy that he could play with his toy again and Lily was happy that her brother shared with her. From that day on, they learned to share and play together.
