Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her yard with her toys. One day, she saw a serious-looking dog in her yard. She didn't know what to do, so she tried to pet the dog. But the dog growled and scared her.
Lily ran to her mommy, crying. Her mommy hugged her tight and comforted her. She told Lily that she should never approach a dog she doesn't know, and that she should always ask the owner first.
Lily learned her lesson, but she still felt sad about what happened. The next day, Lily saw the dog again, but this time she stayed away and asked the owner if she could pet him. The owner said yes, and Lily was happy. But later that day, Lily saw the dog running into the street and getting hit by a car. Lily felt very sad and cried.
The moral of the story is that we should always be careful around animals we don't know, and we should never run into the street.
