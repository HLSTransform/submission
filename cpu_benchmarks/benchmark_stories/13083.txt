Once there was a crystal in a very special place. It was beautiful and colourful and sparkled in the sun. But the crystal was all alone. 
One day, a little girl came and she thought the crystal was very pretty. She was careful not to break it and she decided to take it home with her. Wherever she went, the crystal sparkled and glittered, but the little girl wanted to make it even more special.
The little girl found some glitter and some paint and mix them together with the crystal. She stirred it gently and the colours swirled together and glowed around her. When the little girl finished, the crystal was even more beautiful! The little girl was so pleased with her work and smiled at the crystal. 
The crystal seemed to smile back at the girl and glittered even brighter. From that day, the little girl and her crystal were best friends. They would play and go on adventures together but the little girl was always careful and the crystal stayed safe and intact.
