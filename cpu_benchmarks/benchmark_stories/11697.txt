Sam was walking down the street, looking up at the church. He was so excited; he couldn't wait to go inside. Suddenly, he tripped and fell on something rough. He looked down - it was a jump rope!
Sam realized this must be a sign - someone had left the jump rope here for him. He quickly grabbed it and jumped up and down the street. Every jump made him even more excited for what he was about to do. 
The church doors opened, and he walked inside. He was welcomed by the warm sunshine that shone through the windows. After a few minutes of awe-inspiring beauty, Sam looked down. There it was again - the jump rope! He couldn't believe it!
Suddenly, he realized the jump rope was meant to be a sign - it had been meant to lead him to this church. With this in mind, Sam knew that he had been preparing for this moment his whole life, and he couldn't wait to find out what was in store for him.
