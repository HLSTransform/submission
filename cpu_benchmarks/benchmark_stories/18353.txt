Once upon a time, there was a little ant named Tim. Tim was very organized. He liked to keep his ant hill clean and tidy. One day, Tim found a big bag of sugar. He was very happy and wanted to share it with his ant friends.
Tim went to his friend, Sam, and said, "Look, I found sugar! Let's share it with our friends!" Sam was excited and they both started to carry the sugar back to their ant hill. But on their way, they saw a big bird. They began to panic.
Tim and Sam quickly hid the sugar under a leaf and ran back to their ant hill. They told their friends about the bird and the sugar. All the ants worked together to make a plan. They decided to go back to the sugar, but this time they would be careful and watch out for the bird.
They all went back to the sugar and started to carry it back to their ant hill. They were very organized and worked together as a team. They watched out for the bird, but it never came back.
In the end, Tim, Sam, and their friends brought the sugar back to their ant hill. They were very happy and enjoyed eating the sweet sugar together. And they learned that even when they panic, they can still find a way to work together and be organized.
