Once upon a time there was a tidy little bear who loved to explore the big sky. He saw lots of interesting things, which included the bright stars at night and the fluffy clouds in the day.
One day he decided to climb a tall tree to get a closer look at the sky. He climbed and climbed, and when he got to the top, he saw something very special. A rainbow had appeared in the sky and was making the sky look even prettier.
The little bear was so happy. He waved and shouted with joy. He wanted everyone to come and see the beautiful rainbow. He even invited all of his animal friends to come, too.
The end.
