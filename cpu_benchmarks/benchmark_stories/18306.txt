Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to fish with his dad. One day, they went to the lake to catch some fish. Timmy's dad gave him a hook and said, "Be careful, it's sharp."
Timmy was excited to catch a big fish, but he wasn't being careful. He accidentally hooked his dad's shirt instead of a fish. Timmy's dad was upset and said, "Timmy, you need to be more careful. You could hurt someone."
Timmy felt bad and wanted to make it up to his dad. He decided to reveal a secret he had been keeping. He had found a shiny rock by the lake and had been keeping it in his pocket. He gave the rock to his dad and said, "I'm sorry, Dad. I found this and wanted to give it to you."
Timmy's dad was happy and forgave him. They continued to fish and Timmy was careful with his hook. He learned that it's important to be careful and honest. The end.
