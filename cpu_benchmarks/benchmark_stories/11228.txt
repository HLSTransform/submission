Once upon a time, there was a nation full of loyal people. They all looked after each other and respected each other. One day, the people of the nation decided to bury something special under the ground.
The leader of the nation, who was a kind and wise man, asked the people to gather around. He said: "My beloved people, let us bury something special that will always remind us of how loyal we are to one another!" Everyone was excited and eagerly waited to see what the special thing was. 
The leader unveiled a beautiful silver plate engraved with the words: "Loyalty Unites The Nation". Everyone was very pleased and one young boy asked: "What can I do to help?". The leader smiled and said: "You can help us to bury it."
The boy was so happy and he eagerly grabbed the silver plate and carefully put it in the ground. He then filled the hole with soil and pressed it down gently with his hands. All of the citizens clapped and cheered as the boy buried the special thing with pride. 
From that moment on, no matter what happened, the citizens of the nation would always remember the loyalty they all shared.
