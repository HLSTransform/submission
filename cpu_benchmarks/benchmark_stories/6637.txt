Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat yummy treats like cookies and ice cream. One day, her mommy decided to teach her how to bake cookies. 
Lily was so excited to learn! She put on her apron and stood on a stool next to her mommy. Her mommy showed her how to mix the ingredients and shape the cookies. Lily thought it was silly how the dough stuck to her fingers. 
Finally, they put the cookies in the oven and waited patiently. When they were done, Lily got to have a treat and eat a warm, delicious cookie. She was so proud of herself for learning how to bake with her mommy's help.
