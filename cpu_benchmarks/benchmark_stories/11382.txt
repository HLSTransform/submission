Once upon a time, there was a little dragon. He really loved flying around and being full of energy. One day, he wanted to try something new. He saw a lovely castle and thought he should have a look. 
He was excited to explore the new place. As he got closer, he heard a loud scream coming from the inside. His heart started to beat faster and he was scared. But he decided to go inside and see what was happening. 
The dragon went into the castle and quickly realised that the scream came from a princess. She was being held by a big mean monster. The dragon was very brave and scared at the same time, but he knew he had to help the princess. 
He took a deep breath and flew up to the monster. He shouted out loud in the most booming voice he could muster, "Let her go!" The monster was so scared, he quickly let go of the princess. She ran out of the castle and thanked the dragon for saving her. 
The dragon and the princess became good friends, and soon he was flying with her every day. The princess always gave him a big smile and thanked him for his kindness. 
The dragon knew he had made the right choice. He was glad he was brave enough to save the princess and they were now living happily ever after.
