Lily liked to wander in the park. She saw many things: trees, flowers, birds, dogs. She liked to say hello to them. Sometimes she picked up sticks or stones and played with them.
One day, she saw a man with a big bag. He was picking up trash from the ground. He had a job to keep the park clean. Lily wanted to help him. She ran to him and said, "Hi, I am Lily. Can I help you?"
The man smiled and said, "Hello, Lily. You are very kind. But this is not a job for a little girl. This trash is dirty and can hurt you. You should play somewhere else."
Lily felt sad. She wanted to do a good thing. She said, "But I like the park. I want to make it nice."
The man said, "I understand. But there is another way to help. You can be careful not to drop any trash yourself. And you can tell your friends and family to do the same. That way, you can keep the park nice for everyone."
Lily nodded. She said, "OK, I will do that. Thank you for your job. Bye!"
She waved to the man and ran to find her mom. She told her what she learned. Her mom hugged her and said, "You are a smart and caring girl. I am proud of you."
They walked home together. On the way, they saw a wild cat. It was hiding under a car. It had yellow eyes and black fur. Lily wanted to pet it, but her mom said, "No, Lily. That cat is wild. It is not like our cat at home. It can scratch or bite you. You should leave it alone."
Lily said, "OK, mom. I will not touch it. But can I say hello?"
Her mom said, "Sure, you can say hello. But be quiet and gentle. Do not scare it."
Lily said, "Hello, wild cat. You are pretty. I hope you are happy."
The cat looked at her and meowed softly. Then it ran away. Lily smiled and said, "Bye, wild cat. Have a nice day."
The end.
