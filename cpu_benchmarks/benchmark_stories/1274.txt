Once there was a person who was walking down the street. Suddenly, they saw a disgusting thing on the ground. It was slimy, and dripping. The person looked around and then they shrugged. They knew that no matter how much they wanted to, they couldn't pick it up.
So they kept on going, and soon they were in a park. There were lots of children playing and having a great time. But then they saw another disgusting thing! This one was a big mess and it was blocking the way. The person looked around and then they shrugged again. They didn't know what to do.
 Suddenly, one of the 3 year old children stepped forward. They looked brave and strong. With a smile on their face, they grabbed the disgusting mess and threw it in the trash. Everyone cheered and thanked the 3 year old.
The person was so happy that the 3 year old helped. They smiled, and shook their head. No matter how much they wanted to, they weren't brave enough to do what the 3 year old did.
