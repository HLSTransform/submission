Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cute puppy named Max. Max was so adorable with his fluffy fur and wagging tail. Lily loved to play with Max all day long.
One day, Lily's mom asked her to help her carry some things. Lily tried to lift them, but they were too heavy. "Mom, this is too much weight for me," she said. "It's okay, Lily. You're still small. You'll get stronger as you grow," her mom replied.
Later that day, Lily and Max were tired from playing. "Max, let's go sleep," Lily said. Max happily wagged his tail and followed her to bed. They snuggled up together and fell asleep, dreaming of all the fun they would have tomorrow.
