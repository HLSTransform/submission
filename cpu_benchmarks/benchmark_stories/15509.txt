Once upon a time there were two friends who were looking for wisdom. They were very curious and wanted to learn more about the world. 
So they went on a journey to find some. After walking for a long time, they finally found an old man. He had a long, white beard and lots of great wisdom. The old man looked at the two friends and said, "I will yield my wisdom to you if you can do something for me first". 
The two friends agreed and the old man gave them a quest. He told them that if they found the biggest, brightest stars in the night sky they could have his wisdom. 
The friends quickly set off in search of the stars. They looked around until they finally found the stars. They were so great and beautiful that the friends could not believe their eyes. 
The old man was very pleased with the friends and he gave them his wisdom. The two friends thanked him and then went off singing with joy, because now they had great wisdom.
