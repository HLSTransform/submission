Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Jack. He wanted to take a ride in the park. He couldn't wait any longer! So he grabbed his pencil and hopped inside his car.
When Jack got to the park, he noticed it was very dirty. All around were pieces of garbage and leaves from the trees.
Jack got out of his car and began to explore. He stepped around the garbage and even found a dirty old pencil! He was so excited that he took it with him.
Suddenly, he heard a voice. A kind old man said, "What a nice pencil, son! Would you like to join me for a walk around the park?"
Jack was overjoyed! He said, "Yes, please!"
The old man and Jack went around the park together, pointing out all the different flowers and animals they found. As they walked, Jack even stopped to pick up a few more pieces of litter that he found. 
When they finished their walk around the park, the old man said, "You're such a kind-hearted boy, Jack! Always remember to keep the park clean!"
Jack smiled. He said, "I will!" And he put his pencil and the litter in his car before he drove away.
