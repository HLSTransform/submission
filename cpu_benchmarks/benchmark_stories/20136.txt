Tim and Mia liked to play with their toy trains. They had a big track with bridges, tunnels and stations. They made the trains go fast and slow, and made noises like engines.
One day, they found a new train in a box. It was shiny and red, and had a lot of details. It looked very delicate. Tim wanted to try it, but Mia was scared.
"Can we play with it?" Tim asked.
"I don't know. It looks too pretty to play with. Maybe it will break," Mia said.
"Let's be careful. It will be fun," Tim said.
He took the train out of the box and put it on the track. He turned on the switch and the train started to move. It made a loud sound and a puff of smoke. Tim and Mia watched in awe.
But then, something went wrong. The train went too fast and hit a curve. It flew off the track and crashed on the floor. Tim and Mia heard a crack and saw a piece of the train break off.
They both trembled and cried. They had broken the new train. They were afraid of what their mom would say.
They ran to their mom and told her what happened. They said they were sorry and they didn't mean to break the train.
Their mom hugged them and said, "It's okay. I know you didn't mean to break the train. It was a gift from your uncle. He wanted you to have fun with it. But it was too delicate for your track. It was not your fault. We can try to fix it or get a new one. The important thing is that you are safe and you learned to be careful with your toys."
Tim and Mia felt better. They thanked their mom and said they loved her. They learned their lesson and played with their other trains. They still liked the shiny and red train, but they knew it was not for them. They hoped their uncle would understand.
