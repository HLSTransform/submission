Once there was a little girl called Lucy. She was three years old and loved to explore. Today Lucy was looking for something special to do.
So she looked in the park and found a magazine! It had pictures of animals and was lots of fun to look at. But Lucy was too slow and the magazine blew away.
She got mad but then kept exploring. She went to the beach and her eyes lit up. She found a magazine and it had pictures of fish! 
Lucy was happy and ran to the water. She was slow but floated the magazine around. She had so much fun looking at all the pictures.
At the end of the day Lucy was tired and happy. She had lots of fun and found the perfect magazine!
