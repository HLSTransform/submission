Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a big drawer in his room where he kept all his toys. One day, Timmy was playing with his ball and accidentally kicked it under the drawer. He tried to reach for it, but it was too far.
Timmy got confused and didn't know what to do. He sat on the floor and looked at the ball under the drawer. Suddenly, he had an idea. He grabbed a stick and used it to push the ball out from under the drawer. Timmy was happy he found a solution and continued playing with his ball.
