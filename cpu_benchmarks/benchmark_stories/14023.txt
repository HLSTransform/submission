Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a cop named Tom. He was a very fine cop. Tom loved to help people and keep everyone safe. He also loved to bake. When he was not working, he would bake yummy treats for his friends.
One day, Tom wanted to bake a big cake for his friend's birthday. He went to the store to buy all the things he needed. He got eggs, flour, and sugar. He also got some fun toys to put on top of the cake.
Tom went home and started to bake the cake. He mixed all the things together and put it in the oven. The cake smelled so good! When it was all done, he put the toys on top and took it to his friend's house. Everyone loved the cake and had a great time. Tom was very happy that he could help make his friend's birthday special.
