Mum was cooking dinner and her three year-old daughter was playing in the garden. Suddenly, the daughter saw a high ghost and started to cry. 
Mum heard the cries and came out to the garden to see what had scared her daughter. But the ghost was gone! 
Mum hugged the daughter and said, "It's ok. It's all gone now."
The daughter took a deep breath and stopped crying. Mum asked, "Why were you scared?"
The daughter said, "I saw a big, high ghost!"
Mum hugged her daughter tightly and said, "That's ok, ghosts aren't real. There isn't anything to be scared of." 
The daughter smiled and gave Mum a big hug. Then the two of them went back inside to finish cooking dinner.
