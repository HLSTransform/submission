Lily and Sam were friends who liked to play in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run around. One day, they saw a new bench in the park. It was big and shiny and had a sign that said "For everyone".
"Let's sit on the bench!" Lily said. "It looks fun!"
"OK!" Sam said. They ran to the bench and climbed on it. They pretended it was a boat, a car and a rocket.
But then, a big boy came to the bench. He was mean and angry. He said "This is my bench! Go away!"
Lily and Sam were scared. They said "No, the sign says for everyone. You have to share!"
The big boy did not like that. He pushed Lily and Sam off the bench. They fell to the ground and hurt their knees and elbows. They cried and cried.
The big boy laughed and said "Ha ha, now the bench is mine! You can't play here!"
Lily and Sam were very sad. They ran to their moms and told them what happened. Their moms hugged them and said "We're sorry, that was not nice. Let's go home and put some band-aids on your hurts."
Lily and Sam said goodbye to the park and the bench. They did not want to play there anymore. They wished the big boy would learn to be nice and include others.
