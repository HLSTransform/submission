Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was a fearful boy who didn't like to try new things. One day, Tom and his mom went to a big store. They needed to go up to find Tom's favorite toy. Tom's mom said, "We will take the elevator to go up."
Tom was scared of the elevator. He had never been in one before. He asked his mom, "What if it's too fast?" His mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, it's not fast. I'll hold your hand."
As they walked to the elevator, Tom saw a man load a big box onto a cart. The man pushed the cart into the elevator. Tom's mom held his hand and they went inside too. The elevator went up slowly, just like his mom said. Tom felt safe and happy.
When they got to the top, Tom saw his favorite toy on a shelf. He was so excited! He forgot all about being scared of the elevator. Tom's mom said, "See? The elevator wasn't so bad." Tom nodded and smiled.
From that day on, Tom wasn't fearful of elevators anymore. He learned that trying new things can be fun, especially when his mom was there to hold his hand.
