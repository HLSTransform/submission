Ben and Lily liked to play with their toy truck. It was big and red and had four wheels. They could push it around the yard and make vroom-vroom noises. Sometimes they pretended it was a fire truck or a garbage truck or a delivery truck.
One day, they decided to play delivery truck. They looked for things to load in the back of the truck. They found some rocks, some leaves, some sticks and some flowers. They put them in the truck and said, "This is our cargo. We have to deliver it to our customers."
They drove the truck around the yard, stopping at different places. They gave a rock to the dog, a leaf to the bird, a stick to the cat and a flower to the mom. They said, "Here is your cargo. Thank you for choosing our delivery truck."
Then they saw a bunch of bananas on the kitchen table. They thought, "Bananas are yummy. We want some bananas." They ran to the table and grabbed the bananas. They put them in the truck and said, "This is our special cargo. We have to deliver it to ourselves."
They drove the truck to their favorite spot under the tree. They unloaded the bananas and peeled them. They ate them and said, "Mmm, these are the best bananas ever. We are mighty delivery truck drivers. We can load and unload anything." They smiled and hugged each other. They were happy and full.
