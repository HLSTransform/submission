Once upon a time there was a furry bear. The bear was very brave and kept the forest safe. He had sharp claws and used them to protect the birds and bunnies that lived nearby.
One day, the bear was out walking when he saw a baby bird. The bear knew the bird was just learning to fly and very scared, so he decided to help.
The bear held out one of his giant bear fingers and used it to help the bird get back into the nest. The bird was so thankful that it wrapped its tiny wings around the bear's finger and said thank you.
The bear smiled and gave the bird a big hug. He then promised to protect the bird, and all of the other animals, from any danger that might come.
The furry bear kept his promise and stayed in the forest to keep it safe. Whenever the birds and bunnies were scared, the bear was always there to protect them. He was the bravest bear in the forest!
