Once there was a girl called Molly. On a bright and sunny day, Molly decided to go on an adventure. She got her hat and her backpack, and set out to explore. After some time, Molly came to a tidy land. She had never been here before so she was excited. She looked around and there were so many fun things to do, from climbing trees to running down big hills.
Suddenly, Molly heard a noise. She looked around and saw a friendly dragon who asked her if she wanted to explore with him. Molly said yes, and they set off together. On their journey they visited some amazing places and Molly discovered lots of new things. 
At the end of their adventure, the dragon invited Molly back to the tidy land. He said she could come whenever she wanted, which made her very happy. Molly said thank you and promised to come back soon.
This was the start of an exciting new friendship between Molly and the friendly dragon. Molly couldn't wait to come back to the tidy land and explore more!
