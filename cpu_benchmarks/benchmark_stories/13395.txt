Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside during the day. But she was always scared of the dark night. Her mommy told her to be careful and not go outside when it was dark. 
One day, Lily and her mommy were playing in the park. Lily saw a butterfly and wanted to catch it. She ran after it, but it flew away. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise and saw a big dog running towards her. She was scared and didn't know what to do. 
Her mommy quickly came to her and raised her up in her arms. She told the dog to go away and it did. Lily felt safe in her mommy's arms. From that day on, whenever Lily saw a dog, she was careful and stayed close to her mommy. She learned that her mommy would always protect her, day or night.
