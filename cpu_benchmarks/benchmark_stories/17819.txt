One Sunday Bob went out for a walk. He was feeling a little bit curious. He wondered if he could find someone famous. He looked around the park, the corner shop and the marketplace - but he couldn't find anyone famous. Bob was feeling a bit disappointed. 
Then, he saw a man walking down the street. He had a big grin on his face and was wearing a hat with 'famous' written on it! Bob couldn't believe it! He shouted out 'hello', and the famous man stopped to talk to him.
The famous man said he was a magician. He said he made things disappear and reappear. Bob was so excited! He asked the famous magician to show him a trick, and the magician said he'd be happy to. The magician made the hat disappear and reappear. 
Bob was so surprised he couldn't speak. He just grinned and waved goodbye to the magician as he continued on his way. Now every Sunday, Bob goes out for a walk and wonders if he'll see that famous magician again.
