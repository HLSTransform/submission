Tim had a pet cat named Spot. Spot was very popular with the other cats in the street. He liked to play and chase and smile. Tim loved Spot very much and gave him food and water and hugs every day.
One day, Tim and Spot went for a walk in the park. They saw many birds and flowers and people. Spot ran after a butterfly and Tim followed him. They had a lot of fun. Tim smiled and Spot smiled.
But then, a big dog came out of nowhere. He was angry and loud and mean. He saw Spot and wanted to catch him. He barked and ran towards him. Spot was scared and tried to run away. Tim was scared too and shouted for Spot.
The dog was faster than Spot. He bit him hard and shook him. Spot cried and hurt. Tim cried and hurt too. He ran to Spot and tried to help him. But it was too late. Spot was gone. Tim hugged him and sobbed. He did not smile and Spot did not smile. The dog ran away and left them alone.
Tim and Spot never played and chased and smiled again. Tim was very sad and missed Spot very much. He wished he could see him again. He wished the dog never came. He wished he could smile and Spot could smile. But they could not. The end.
