One day, all the kids at the park decided it was time for a game. So, they formed a team. Everyone wanted to make sure that the team was modern and cool, so they all hurried to find the best outfits.
Once the team was all dressed up, the kids ran to the playground. They wanted to choose the most exciting game to play. First they tried hide and seek, but it wasn’t very modern. Then they tried tag, but it still wasn’t very modern. 
The kids thought and thought. Finally, a bright little girl suggested they should play a new game. She showed them all how to play it, and the team was very excited. Everyone shouted, “Please, can we play this game!”
The kids played and laughed and had so much fun. They all agreed that their modern and cool team was the best ever!
