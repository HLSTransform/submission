Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Thomas. One day, he was playing in his bedroom and he found a pretty red bracelet. Thomas was so happy, he wanted to put the bracelet on right away. 
"Mommy, look at the bracelet!" he shouted.
His mother saw the bracelet, and said, "No, Thomas. You can't keep the bracelet. It must belong to someone else."
Thomas was very disappointed. But suddenly, he had an idea. He said to his mother, "Let me keep it for just one day. Please?"
His mother thought about it for a moment, and said, "All right. You can keep the bracelet for one day. But then you must shut it away in a safe place and never take it out again".
Thomas was so excited. He put the red bracelet on and ran out to show it to his friends. The day passed quickly and before he knew it, it was time to keep the bracelet safe. 
Thomas shut the bracelet away in a special box and put it in his mother's drawer. Every time he would look inside the drawer, he would remember that special day when he found the pretty red bracelet.
