Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy mole that she loved to play with. One day, Lily's big brother, Jack, came into her room and saw the mole. He wanted to play with it too. Lily said, "No, that's mine!" and held onto the mole tightly.
Jack got fierce and said, "I want to play with it too! Give it to me!" Lily didn't want to give it up, but then she had an idea. She said, "Let's fold some paper together and make a paper mole. Then we can both play with it!" Jack liked this idea and they started folding the paper.
As they folded, Lily and Jack talked about how they could make the paper mole look more like the real mole. They folded and folded until they had a fierce-looking paper mole with big claws and sharp teeth. Lily and Jack were both happy and played with the paper mole together. They even made up a story about the fierce mole going on an adventure. From that day on, they shared the toy mole and the paper mole and played together happily ever after.
