Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his toy car. One day, Timmy's mom told him it was time to clean up his toys. Timmy didn't want to clean up, so he hid his toy car under his bed.
As time passed, Timmy's toy car started to shrink. Timmy was sad when he saw that his toy car was now too small to play with. His mom asked him why he didn't clean up his toys, and Timmy told her he was sorry.
Timmy's mom told him that it's important to be responsible and take care of our things. She said that if we don't take care of our things, they might shrink or even end up in jail (like when we lose them). Timmy learned his lesson and promised to be more flexible and responsible.
