One day, a little boy saw a swan in the lake. He was amazed by the beautiful bird, but he also noticed that the swan was helpless. The swan was stuck and it was stuck in the lake. The little boy was very sad and he wanted to help the swan. 
So he decided to get in the lake and save the swan. He waded into the lake and he tried to push the swan to safety. But then he realized that the swan was too heavy for him. 
So the little boy came up with an idea. He took off all his clothes and he jumped into the lake. He hugged the swan tightly and the water started to soak into both of them. Finally, the swan was able to move and it swam away from the lake. 
The little boy was so happy to have helped the swan. He stood in the lake until his clothes dried, and then he went home feeling proud of himself.
