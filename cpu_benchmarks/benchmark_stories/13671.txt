Tom and Lily were playing in the kitchen. They wanted to make a cake for Mom. They had a big bowl, some flour, some eggs, some milk and some sugar. They also had a big spoon to stir.
"Can I stir, Tom?" Lily asked. She was holding the spoon.
"OK, but be careful. Stir slowly and gently. Don't spill anything," Tom said. He was serious. He wanted the cake to be good.
Lily nodded and started to stir. She liked to see the flour and the eggs and the milk and the sugar mix together. She stirred and stirred and stirred.
But then, she felt something tickle her foot. She looked down and saw a furry tail. It was their cat, Snowy. Snowy was curious. He wanted to see what they were doing.
"Snowy, go away!" Lily shouted. She tried to shoo him with her foot. But she lost her balance and dropped the spoon. The bowl tipped over and the cake mix spilled all over the floor.
"Oh no!" Tom cried. He was not happy. He was angry. He looked at Lily and Snowy. "Look what you did! You ruined the cake! Mom will be mad!"
Lily felt bad. She was sorry. She did not mean to spill the cake mix. She looked at Tom and Snowy. "I'm sorry, Tom. I'm sorry, Snowy. I didn't see him. Can we make another cake?"
Tom sighed. He was still angry, but he was also kind. He knew Lily was sorry. He knew Snowy was just a cat. He looked at the mess on the floor. He knew they had to clean it up.
"OK, Lily. I forgive you. But we have to clean this up first. Then we can try to make another cake. But this time, no cats allowed. OK?"
Lily nodded. She was glad. She hugged Tom and Snowy. "OK, Tom. Thank you. I love you. I love you, Snowy. But you have to stay away from the cake. OK?"
Snowy meowed. He did not understand. He just wanted to play. He licked his paw and tasted some cake mix. He liked it. He wondered if there was more.
