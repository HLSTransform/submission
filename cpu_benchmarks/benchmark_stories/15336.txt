Once upon a time there was a fat pig. He was always hungry and kept on eating and eating. One day his stomach was very empty, and he prayed to God for food.
Suddenly a bone appeared in front of him. He was so glad and happy, and he thanked God for sending him the bone. He picked up the bone and started to eat it. 
The bone tasted yummy and he ate it all. He was very full and content. He thanked God again for sending him the bone.
The fat pig was happy. Every day he would come to the same spot, and pray to God. He believed that God would always take care of him and give him food when he was hungry.
