Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dream about princesses and unicorns. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. They played on the swings and slide. 
Suddenly, Lily's mom said, "Lily, we have to go home now. Don't forget to open the door when we get there." 
Lily replied, "Okay, Mommy! I remember!" 
On the way home, Lily fell asleep in the car. She had a dream about a magical castle with a big pink door. When they got home, Lily woke up and remembered what her mom said. She opened the door and ran inside to tell her dad all about her dream. 
Her dad smiled and said, "That sounds like a wonderful dream, Lily. I'm glad you remember it."
