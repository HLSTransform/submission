Once upon a time, there was a small ant. The ant lived in a small hole in the ground. One day, the ant wanted to go for a walk. So, the ant came out of the hole and walked around. The ant saw a big tree and decided to climb it. When the ant got to the top of the tree, it saw a person. The person saw the ant too and waved hello. The ant waved back and felt happy. Then, the ant climbed back down the tree and went back to its small hole in the ground.
