Anna liked to learn new things. She had a tutor who came to her house every week. The tutor was a nice lady who taught Anna how to read and write and count. Anna liked the tutor a lot.
One day, the tutor brought a big book with many pictures. She said it was a book about animals. Anna loved animals. She wanted to see the book. The tutor opened the book and showed Anna a picture of a crocodile. She said the crocodile had a long mouth with many teeth. She said the crocodile could snap its mouth very fast and catch fish and other animals.
Anna was curious. She wanted to touch the crocodile's teeth. She reached out her hand and touched the picture. But the picture was not soft. It was hard and sharp. It hurt Anna's finger. Anna cried out. She pulled back her hand and saw a drop of blood. She was scared and sad.
The tutor saw what happened. She quickly took a tissue and wrapped it around Anna's finger. She said she was sorry. She said the picture was not real. She said the crocodile was far away in a place called Africa. She said Anna was brave and smart. She said she would get a band-aid and a sticker for Anna.
Anna felt better. She stopped crying. She looked at the tutor and smiled. She said thank you. She said she still liked the book. She said she wanted to see more animals. The tutor smiled back. She said she was glad. She said she had more books and more stickers. She said they could learn more together.
Anna was happy. She hugged the tutor. The tutor was chubby and warm. She hugged Anna back. She said she liked Anna a lot. She said they were friends. Anna nodded. She said they were friends. She said she liked to learn new things. She said she liked the tutor a lot.
