Once there was a yellow pistol. It was moving around everywhere. It was jumping and twirling. Everywhere it went it caused a lot of excitement.
One day the pistol saw something very strange. It was a big, round, yellow ball. It had started rolling and the pistol wanted to follow. So it ran behind the ball, keeping up as best it could.
The ball led the pistol right out the front door and into the garden. It moved all around the garden, hopping over flowers and flying near the trees. The pistol was having so much fun and it kept following the ball.
The ball led the pistol to a wide field full of tall grass. The pistol moved around in the grass and the ball kept rolling. Suddenly, the pistol found a nice big spot to take a rest. It laid down in the grass and the yellow ball stopped beside it. The pistol and the ball were best friends from that day forward.
