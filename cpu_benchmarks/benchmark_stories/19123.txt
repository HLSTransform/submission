Once upon a time, there was a big brown bear. He loved to chew on honey and berries. One day, he went for a walk in the forest and found a cave. He went inside to explore and found an exit at the back. 
As he was walking towards the exit, he saw a little rabbit stuck in a trap. The bear felt sad for the rabbit and decided to help him. He chewed the rope that was holding the trap and set the rabbit free. The rabbit was very grateful and thanked the bear.
From that day on, the bear and the rabbit became friends. They would often meet at the cave and share honey and berries. The bear was happy to have made a new friend and the rabbit was happy to have been saved by the kind bear.
