Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the evening when the sun went down. One day, she discovered a beautiful butterfly in her garden. It had bright colors and fluttered its wings. Lily was so happy to see it!
Her friend, Timmy, saw the butterfly too and became jealous. He wanted to catch it and keep it for himself. But Lily told him that the butterfly was happy in the garden and should stay there. Timmy realized that Lily was right and felt better. They both watched the butterfly fly away into the evening sky.
