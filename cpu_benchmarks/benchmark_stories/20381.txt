Tom hurt his knee when he fell off his bike. It was bleeding and it hurt a lot. He cried and ran to his mom, who was in the kitchen.
"Mom, mom, look at my knee!" he said, showing her his wound.
"Oh, Tom, you poor thing. Come here, let me see." Mom said, taking him in her arms. She got a wet cloth and cleaned his knee gently. Then she got a bandage and wrapped it around his knee. "There, that should feel better. Do you want a hug and a kiss?"
"Yes, please." Tom said, snuggling up to her. He felt her warm and soft. He blinked his eyes and smiled. "Thank you, mom. You are the best."
"You're welcome, Tom. I love you." Mom said, kissing his cheek. "Now, do you want to play with your toys or read a book?"
"I want to play with my toys." Tom said, jumping off her lap. He ran to his room, where he had a lot of cars and trucks and planes. He liked to make them go fast and make noises. He forgot about his knee and had fun. He was happy.
