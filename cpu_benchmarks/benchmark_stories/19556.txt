Once upon a time, there was a cool blue bear. He was so happy living in the woods. But one day, he had to move away.
The bear was sad, but he was sure everything would be alright. He said goodbye to his friends and started walking. Then he found a market.
At the market, people were selling lots of different things. The bear saw something very nice - a blue blanket! He liked it so much and asked the man if he could buy it. The man said yes, so the bear traded his blueberries for the blanket.
The bear was so happy with his new blue blanket. It was so cool and he loved it very much. He happily hugged the blanket and went back home to the woods.
