Once upon a time there was a volcano. It was very big and powerful. Every day when the sun was up the sky was blue and the volcano was peaceful. 
One day it began to rain. This was strange because rain had never come to the volcano before. But it rained and rained for many days and nights.
The rain made the volcano angry. It started to shake and roar. The people around the volcano were very scared. They ran away so they would be safe.
Finally the rain stopped and the sky was blue again. The volcano was calm and peaceful. The people were so happy and thanked the sky for being so kind.
