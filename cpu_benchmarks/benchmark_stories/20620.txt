Once upon a time, there was a hairless cat. He was very sad and lonely, wandering about and looking for someone to play with.
One day, he saw a cobweb and decided to have a closer look. He reached out with his paw to touch the sticky web. Suddenly, a friendly spider popped out and said, "Let me be your friend!".
The cat was so happy and grateful. He promised to always play with his new friend. The cat and the spider had lots of adventures. They played all day, climbing trees, chasing bugs, and playing hide-and-seek in the cobweb.
Together, they were very happy, and the cat told the spider every day how grateful he was to have a friend.
