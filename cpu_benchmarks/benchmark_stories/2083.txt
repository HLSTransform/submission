Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One sunny day, Lily and her friends decided to have a picnic in the park. They brought sandwiches, fruit, and cookies.
As they were eating, Lily's friend Alex noticed that his water bottle was empty. "I need more water," he said. "Can we go to the water line?" 
Lily knew where the water line was. She had seen it before. "Sure," she said. "Let's go." 
When they got to the water line, they saw a big scale. "What's that?" Lily asked. 
"It's a scale," Alex said. "You can weigh things on it." 
Lily thought that was cool. She wanted to weigh something too. "Can we weigh my cookie?" she asked. 
They put the cookie on the scale and saw that it weighed one ounce. "Wow!" Lily said. "That's not very heavy." 
As they walked back to their picnic spot, they noticed that the sun was getting hot. "It's a hot day," Lily said. "But at least we have water and cookies!"
