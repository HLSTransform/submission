George was really excited. He was getting a new armchair! It was a special fancy one and he couldn't wait to sit in it.
Soon, it arrived. It was huge and his dad had to carry it into the house. George ran circles around his dad as he held out his arms, trying to help him.
Finally, the armchair was in the living room. His dad looked at George and said, "Ready to try it out?"
"Yes!" yelled George, jumping into the armchair. It was so comfortable. He squished up into it and said, "This is the best armchair ever!" 
His dad smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it, George." 
George was so proud of his new fancy armchair. He knew it would be the most comfortable chair in the house.
