Once upon a time, there was a playful dog named Spot. Spot loved to run and jump all day long. He had a red ball that he liked to chase and catch. Spot was very happy.
One day, Spot saw a cart. The cart had many toys in it. Spot wanted to play with the toys, but he did not know if they belonged to him. He looked around to see if anyone was there.
Then, a little girl named Sue came running to the cart. Sue said, "These toys belong to me, but I like to share. Do you want to play with me, Spot?" Spot wagged his tail and played with Sue and the toys. They had lots of fun together.
