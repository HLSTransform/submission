Once there was an old man and a young girl. They were walking to the park together. The girl wanted to see what kind of fun they could have. 
The old man had an idea. He said let's try to fold something! He showed the little girl how to pick up the leaves in the park and fold them into tiny shapes. She thought it was really fun. 
But then they stumbled upon a puddle. It was big and deep, and it was difficult to jump over. They tried to figure out how they could get across. 
Finally, the old man had an idea! He said that if they worked together to fold up some leaves and make a bridge, they could get over the puddle. And sure enough, it worked! They crossed the puddle, and the girl was so happy. 
The old man and the little girl had a wonderful time together. They made many more folded creations, and had so much fun in the park!
