Dan and Mia are friends. They like to play outside in the sun. One day, Dan has new sunglasses. He puts them on and says, "Look at me, Mia. I am tough. I can do anything."
Mia wants to try the sunglasses too. She asks, "Can I wear them, Dan? Please?" Dan says, "No, Mia. They are mine. You can't have them. They are only for tough kids."
Mia feels sad. She says, "That is not nice, Dan. You are not a good friend. You should share. Sharing is good." Dan says, "No, Mia. You are not tough. You are a baby. Go away."
Mia runs away and cries. She finds her mom and tells her what happened. Her mom hugs her and says, "I am sorry, Mia. Dan was mean to you. He does not know how to be a good friend. He needs to learn. Maybe you can teach him."
Mia wipes her tears and says, "How can I teach him, mom?" Her mom says, "You can show him how to be kind and share. Maybe he will see that you are a good friend and a tough kid too."
Mia thinks for a moment. She says, "Okay, mom. I will try. Thank you." She goes back to Dan and says, "Dan, I am sorry I asked for your sunglasses. They are very cool. But you hurt my feelings. You should not say mean things. That is not how friends talk."
Dan looks at Mia. He sees that she is sad. He feels sorry too. He says, "I am sorry, Mia. I was mean to you. I don't know why. I guess I wanted to show off. But you are right. That is not how friends talk. You are a good friend. And you are tough too. Do you want to try my sunglasses?"
Mia smiles and says, "Yes, please. Thank you, Dan. That is very nice of you. You are a good friend too. And you are tough too. Can we play together?"
Dan nods and says, "Yes, we can. Let's play together. And let's share. Sharing is good." They put on the sunglasses and play in the sun. They have fun. They learn how to be good friends. They are tough and kind.
