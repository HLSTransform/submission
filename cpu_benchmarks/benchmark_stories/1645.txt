Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a shiny jewel that she loved to wear every day. One day, her friend Timmy came to visit her. Timmy said, "Your jewel is so pretty, can I borrow it?" Lily thought for a moment and said, "Okay, but you have to give it back to me later."
Timmy wore the jewel and went to play with his friends. But he forgot to give it back to Lily. When Lily asked for her jewel back, Timmy said, "I lost it, sorry." Lily was sad and said, "That's boring, I really liked that jewel."
Lily's mother saw her sad and asked what happened. Lily told her the story. Her mother said, "It's okay, we can buy you a new jewel. But next time, make sure you don't lend anything that is important to you." Lily nodded and learned a lesson that day.
