Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who lived in a hut near a big lake. One sunny day, Lily went to the lake to swim with her friend, Timmy. They splashed and played in the water, having lots of fun.
Suddenly, Lily saw a terrible monster in the lake! She screamed and ran out of the water, but Timmy didn't see anything. "What's wrong, Lily?" he asked. "There's a terrible monster in the lake!" she replied.
Timmy laughed and said, "That's just a log, Lily. You scared me!" Lily felt silly for being scared of a log, but she was happy that there was no monster. They continued to play in the water and had a great time in the sun.
