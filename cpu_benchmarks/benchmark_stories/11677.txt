Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jenny. Jenny was very independent for her age. One day, her mommy told her about the amazing treasures in the attic. 
So Jenny crawled over to the attic. She put her hand on the door and was so excited to see what was inside! She took a deep breath and opened the door.
Jenny was surprised to see so many toys! There were dolls, a stuffed bear, books, games and so much more! She saw a rocking horse and couldn't wait to climb on it and ride. 
Jenny's mommy came over to see what was inside the attic. "Isn't this so fun, Jenny? There is so much to play with!" Jenny was so delighted. She felt so independent that she could explore this attic all by herself. 
The mommy and Jenny crawled out of the attic and went downstairs. Jenny hugged her mommy and said "Thank you for letting me explore the attic. I'm so happy to be so independent!" 
The mommy smiled and said "My pleasure, honey. We can explore the attic every day if you would like!" 
Jenny smiled and said of course. She loved adventuring with her mommy, but she also loved having her own independent moments.
