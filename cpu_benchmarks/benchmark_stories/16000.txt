Once there was a wise old man. He held a flag in his hands every day. It was a special flag that he held with pride.
One day, a small 3 year old boy saw the flag. He asked the wise old man what the flag was for. The old man smiled and said it was to show the world how proud he was.
The wise old man then held the flag out for the boy to take. It felt heavy in the boy's tiny hands, but the old man assured him that it was safe. The boy smiled, and nodded his head.
The old man told the boy that the flag made him feel strong and happy. He said that holding the flag showed that he could do anything.
The boy understood, and thanked the old man for sharing his special flag. He promised to never forget what the wise old man taught him on that special day.
