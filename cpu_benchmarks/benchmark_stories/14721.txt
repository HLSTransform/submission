Once upon a time there was a girl. She was so good at coming up with new ideas. One day, she wanted to try something new. She went to the drawer and took out some scissors. 
The girl wanted to use the scissors to cut shapes. She entered the room and smiled. She was so excited to start. 
The girl began to cut the shapes. After a while, she had lots of shapes on her table. They were all very good. 
The girl was so pleased with what she had done. She had made something special with her scissors. 
The girl smiled and said, "I'm so happy with what I've made today". She had made something really good and she was so proud.
