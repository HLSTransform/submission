Once upon a time there was a naughty little pig. He loved to play in the mud and make messes.
One day he got a bright idea. He wanted to get some cookies out of the cookie jar but it was too high for him to reach.
The little pig grabbed a pot and stood on it. He could reach the cookie jar now but he knocked it over.
He heard his mom's footsteps coming. She saw the mess and was not happy. She said, "You need to be punished for making this mess!"
The little pig shook as he looked at his mom with sad eyes. But then he said something very brave. He said, "Please don't punish me. I'll clean up the mess."
His mom smiled. She could see how the little pig had learned his lesson and she knew he was truly sorry.
So instead of punishing the little pig, his mom gave him a hug and said, "You are so attractive when you apologize." Then she kissed him on the head and they cleaned up the mess together.
