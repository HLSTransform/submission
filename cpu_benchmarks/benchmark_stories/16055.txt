Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Joe. He was only three years old, but he was very curious. One day, he decided to go out and explore his neighbourhood. As he was marching around, he saw a tree with an open door. He thought it was so strange! Joe stopped to take a closer look. Then, he heard a voice from inside the tree.
"Hello?" called the voice.
Joe was startled, but he soon realised it was only a friendly squirrel.
"Hi there," said Joe.
"Hello," replied the squirrel. "You can come inside if you want. The door is open!"
Joe was so excited, he marched right inside. The tree was filled with so many wonderful things! Joe was very happy. He stayed in the tree all afternoon.
When it was time to go home, Joe thanked the friendly squirrel and marched off towards home. He was sure he would visit the tree again soon!
