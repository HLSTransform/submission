Once there was a tall boy called Jake. He was going for a walk in the park one day. As he was walking he noticed something shiny lying on the ground. He went up to it to have a closer look and he saw a shoe! Jake was very excited and he quickly grabbed the shoe. He put it on and although it was a bit too big it felt really comfy.
Jake smiled as he walked around the park. He couldn't believe that he found such a nice shoe. He wore it all day and enjoyed every minute.
At home his mum was impressed with the new shoe and she said she'd help Jake to look for the other one. Together they went back to the park and sure enough, the other shoe was there too. Jake excitedly grabbed it and they were a perfect match! From then on Jake enjoyed wearing his new shoes and everyone said he looked very smart.
