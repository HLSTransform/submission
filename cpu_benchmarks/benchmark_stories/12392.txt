One day, True was outside playing. He had a nice stick in his hand and was tapping it against the ground. As he was playing, all of a sudden he heard a deep, loud roar. Startled, he began to shiver. He looked around, but saw nothing. Then he heard the roar again, a little louder this time. True got scared and shouted for help.
Just then, a nice big bear stepped out from behind a nearby tree! True's eyes widened in fear.
"Don't be scared, True," the bear said. "I won't hurt you, I promise."
But True was too scared to move or even speak. He just kept shivering.
"Come now," the bear said. "It'll be ok, I promise. I just wanted to talk to you."
True looked up at the bear and nodded, still shaking.
The bear smiled and said, "See, that wasn't so bad! I just want to be friends. Is that ok with you?"
True took a deep breath and nodded.
The bear smiled and said, "Good! Let's go for a nice walk together, ok?" True and the bear walked side by side, no longer afraid, and soon became the best of friends.
