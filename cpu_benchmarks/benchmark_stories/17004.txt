Lily and Max were best friends. They liked to play together every day. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big box. They pretended the box was a house, a car, a spaceship, or anything they wanted.
One day, they decided to play mail. They made letters and envelopes out of paper and crayons. They wrote their names and drew pictures. They put the letters in the box and took turns to be the mailman and the mail receiver.
"Knock, knock!" Max said, holding a letter. "I have mail for you, Lily!"
"Thank you, Max!" Lily said, opening the letter. She smiled when she saw a heart and a question. "Will you marry me?"
Lily giggled and wrote back. "Yes, I will marry you, Max!"
She gave the letter to Max and he opened it. He was very happy. He hugged Lily and said, "You are the best friend ever!"
They put the letters in a special folder and kept it in the box. They were very organized. They liked to keep their mail safe and neat. They also liked to pretend they were married. They kissed and hugged and said, "I love you!"
