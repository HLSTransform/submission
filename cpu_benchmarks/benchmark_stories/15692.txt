Once upon a time there was a little girl called Mary. Mary was very sweet and always happy. 
One day Mary saw a drawer. Inside the drawer was a little puppy. It was very adorable.
Mary said, "Can I lend the puppy?"
Her mum said, "Yes, you can."
The puppy had a little collar and was very nice. Mary took the puppy and played with him all day. The puppy was so happy to be with Mary and they had so much fun together.
They went for a walk and played in the garden. Mary said goodbye to the puppy at the end of the day. She hugged the puppy and said, "Thank you for lending me your pup today." 
The puppy was so happy to hear this and it jumped around thanks to Mary's kindness. Mary was very happy and gave the pup one last hug before putting it back in its drawer.
