Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily was very happy and loved to smile. She lived in a small house with her mommy and daddy.
One day, Lily went to the park to play. She met a boy named Jack who was crying. Lily asked him, "Why are you crying?" Jack said, "I lost my toy and it's very important to me."
Lily wanted to help Jack, so she looked for his toy with him. They searched and searched until they found it. Jack was so happy and smiled a big smile. He said to Lily, "You are my best friend. I value our friendship." Lily smiled and felt happy too.
