Once there was a shy girl named Ella. She liked to go down to the river to see the boats.
One day she went down to the river and saw a boat that was bigger than the others. She was so curious about it that she asked her Dad to tell her about it. 
He said, "That is a special boat. It has room for lots of people to go on it."
Ella asked, "Can I ride on it?"
Dad said, "Maybe one day. Listen, you can hear the birds singing in the trees. Can you hear them?"
Ella listened and said, "Yes, I can!" She was so happy to hear the birds singing.
