Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy aeroplane. He would fly it around his room and make it do flips in the air.
One day, Timmy went to the park to play. He left his toy aeroplane on the bench while he went to play on the swings. When he came back, his toy aeroplane was gone. "Oh no, someone stole my aeroplane!" Timmy cried.
Timmy's friend, Sally, saw him crying and asked what was wrong. Timmy told her about his stolen aeroplane. Sally said, "Don't worry, we'll find it. Let's look around the park."
As they searched, they saw a wild dog running around with something in its mouth. They followed the dog and saw that it had Timmy's toy aeroplane! Sally bravely grabbed the aeroplane from the dog and gave it back to Timmy. "Thank you, Sally! You saved my aeroplane from the wild dog," Timmy said happily.
