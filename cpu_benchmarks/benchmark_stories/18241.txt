Once upon a time, there was a bird named Blue. Blue liked to fly high in the sky and see all the pretty clouds. One day, Blue was flying and saw a big earthquake! The earth shook and Blue was scared. 
Blue flew down to the ground and saw a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was crying because he was scared too. Blue said, "Don't worry, Timmy. I will keep you safe." 
Blue flew Timmy to a light house where they could be safe from the earthquake. Timmy was happy to be safe and said, "Thank you, Blue. You are my hero!" Blue was happy to help Timmy and they became good friends. From that day on, Blue would fly Timmy to safety whenever there was an earthquake.
