Once upon a time there was a jolly animal. It wanted to fly on a big adventure.
So it stretched out its wings and began to flap. Up, up, up it flew into the sky!
The animal flew and flew, higher and higher. It saw lots of interesting things on its journey. It saw mountains and trees, birds and rivers. 
Soon the animal started to feel tired, so it flew back down, and then it landed back where it started. That was the end of its big flying adventure. 
The jolly animal was so happy! It had lots of fun flying and seeing so many wonderful things!
