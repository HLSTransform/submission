Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and explore her house. One day, she noticed that the knob on her bedroom door was tough to turn. She tried and tried, but it wouldn't budge.
Lily went to her mommy and said, "Mommy, the knob is tough. I can't open my door." Mommy went to see and tried to turn the knob too, but it was still tough. Mommy said, "Let's call Daddy. He can fix it."
When Daddy came home, Lily showed him the tough knob. Daddy said, "I notice the knob is loose. I can fix it." He took a screwdriver and tightened the knob. Now it turned easily.
Lily was happy she could open her door again. She said, "Thank you, Daddy!" And Daddy said, "You're welcome, Lily. I'm happy to help."
