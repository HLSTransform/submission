Tom and Lily are playing in the living room. They have many toys, but they like the lamp best. The lamp is big and shiny and makes funny noises when they touch it.
"Can I have the lamp?" Lily asks Tom.
"No, it is mine!" Tom says. He holds the lamp tight and does not want to share.
Lily is sad and angry. She wants the lamp too. She sees a glass of water on the table. She has an idea. She takes the glass and pours the water on the lamp.
The lamp makes a loud sound and stops shining. Tom and Lily are scared. The lamp is wet and broken.
"Mama! Mama!" they cry. "Help us!"
Mama comes running. She sees the wet lamp and the water on the floor. She is not happy.
"What did you do?" she asks Tom and Lily.
"We were playing with the lamp," Tom says.
"Lily gave it water," Lily says.
Mama sighs. She takes the lamp and the glass and puts them away. She gets a towel and cleans the floor.
"You should not play with the lamp," she says. "It is not a toy. It can be dangerous. And you should not give it water. Water can make it stop working."
Tom and Lily are sorry. They hug Mama and say they are sorry.
"It is okay," Mama says. "But next time, be careful and share your toys. Do you understand?"
Tom and Lily nod. They say they understand. They go to their room and play with their other toys. They do not want the lamp anymore.
