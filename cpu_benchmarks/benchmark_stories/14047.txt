Molly woke up feeling very happy. She looked outside and saw that it was sunny and the birds were singing. She smiled, as she knew what her day was going to be like.
Molly got out of bed and went straight to the bathroom. She opened the door and saw the big bathtub, full of water and bubbles. She slid in, feeling the warm and wonderful water. She splashed around, feeling so refreshed and charming.
After her bath, Molly put on her favourite dress, grabbed her favourite teddy bear and went outside. She felt so cheerful and so energized that she ran around the yard, laughing and playing. She was so happy to be outside, breathing in the fresh air and feeling the bright sun above her head. 
At the end of the day, Molly crawled back into bed, feeling so happy and relaxed. She snuggled up with her teddy bear and went right to sleep, dreaming of fun adventures.
