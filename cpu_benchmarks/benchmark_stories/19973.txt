Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a big tunnel under a hill. It is dark and scary.
"Let's go inside," Ben says. He is brave.
"No, I don't want to," Anna says. She is afraid.
"Come on, it will be fun," Ben says. He holds Anna's hand.
They walk into the tunnel. It is very dark. They can't see anything. They hear strange noises.
"What is that?" Anna whispers.
"I don't know," Ben whispers.
They keep walking. They see a light at the end of the tunnel. They run towards it.
They come out of the tunnel. They see a beautiful garden. It has many flowers and trees. The sun is shining. The sky is blue. They see a white rabbit. It is hopping around.
"Look, a rabbit!" Anna says.
"Hello, rabbit," Ben says.
The rabbit looks at them. It smiles. It says, "Welcome to my garden. Do you want to play with me?"
Anna and Ben are surprised. They nod. They play with the rabbit. They have fun.
They forget about the tunnel. They forget about the dark and the scary. They are happy.
