Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they decided to go on an adventure in the forest. It was so much fun! They saw birds, butterflies, and even a squirrel. 
Suddenly, Lily's friend, Sarah, fell into a hole. "Help! Help!" Sarah cried. Lily knew she had to rescue her friend. She ran to get help from the grown-ups. 
The grown-ups came and rescued Sarah. Lily felt incredible that she helped her friend. "You're my hero!" Sarah said to Lily. From that day on, Lily knew that helping others was the most fun thing to do.
