Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was an enthusiastic boy who loved to play with his toys and his dog, Spot. One sunny day, Tim and Spot were playing in the park when Tim felt something strange in his mouth. He touched his tooth and it was very wiggly.
Tim ran to his mom and said, "Mommy, my tooth is wiggly!" His mom looked at his tooth and smiled. "Don't panic, Tim," she said. "It's just a baby tooth. It will come out and a big tooth will grow in its place."
Tim felt better and went back to playing with Spot. A few days later, while eating an apple, Tim's tooth finally came out. He was so excited! That night, he put his tooth under his pillow and went to sleep.
In the morning, Tim woke up and looked under his pillow. The tooth was gone, and in its place was a shiny coin! Tim ran to his mom and said, "Mommy, the tooth fairy came and left me a coin!"
His mom smiled and said, "I told you not to panic, Tim. Now you have a big tooth growing and a special coin from the tooth fairy." Tim felt proud and couldn't wait to show his friends his new big tooth and his special coin.
