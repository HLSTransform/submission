Once upon a time there was a fierce monster who lived in a big jungle. Every day the monster liked to zoom around the jungle looking for things to do. 
One day the monster found a bowl and he liked it. He wanted to make something so he decided to mix together some things he found in the jungle. He put some leaves, flowers and fruit in the bowl, he stirred them all together and the result was a big, colourful soup. 
The monster liked the soup but he thought it needed something else. He looked around and found a rock, so he added that and mixed it all together again. 
He tasted the soup and it was delicious! The monster smiled and said "Yum, that was fierce!" 
The end.
