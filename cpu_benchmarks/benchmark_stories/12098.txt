Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to run and play outside. One day, she saw a big slide and she wanted to go down it. But when she climbed up the ladder, she felt dizzy and scared. She wanted to go back down, but she decided to resist her fear and go down the slide.
As she slid down the slide, she felt so happy and proud of herself. When she got to the bottom, she saw a big mark on her knee from a scrape she got. But she didn't feel sad because she knew it was just a little bump and it would go away soon.
Lily learned that sometimes it's scary to try new things, but if she resists her fear, she can do anything she wants. And even if she gets a mark or a bump, it's okay because she's brave and strong.
