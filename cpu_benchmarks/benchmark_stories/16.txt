Once upon a time, there was a graceful cat named Kitty. She loved to play with her ball and jump around the house. Kitty was very happy and liked to make her friends laugh.
One day, Kitty saw a tap in the garden. She was very curious about it. She wanted to see if she could make water come out. So, she jumped onto the tap and tried to squeeze it with her paws. But nothing happened.
Kitty tried again and again to squeeze the tap, but still no water came out. Then, her friend, a wise old dog named Rover, came to help her. Rover showed her how to turn the tap on, and water came splashing out! Kitty was so happy, and they both played in the water all day long.
