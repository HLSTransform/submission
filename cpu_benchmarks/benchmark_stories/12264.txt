Once upon a time, there was a boy who liked to explore. He was always very restless and loved to be on the move.
One day, he was feeling extra adventurous and he decided to explore the big bathtub. He started to walk towards it, with a big smile on his face.
Suddenly, his mom appeared and frowned when she saw him. She said, "No, no! No exploring in the bathtub!" She grabbed his arm and took him away.
The boy felt sad, but he knew that his mother was just trying to keep him safe. He was so excited to explore the bathtub, but he had to wait until mom wasn't looking.
The next day, his mom was busy with something else and the boy saw that as an opportunity. He ran to the bathtub and started to explore.
Suddenly, he heard his mom's voice. She had been watching him and she had a big frown on her face. This time, she told him that it was ok to explore the bathtub, as long as he was careful.
The boy smiled, happy that he got to explore the bathtub. He had learned an important lesson - that sometimes, it's ok to be a little restless.
