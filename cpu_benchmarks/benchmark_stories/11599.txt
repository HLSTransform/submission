Once upon a time there was a girl looking for something. She was walking through a long hall in her house. Suddenly she heard a noise. It was coming from a harmless little mouse in the corner.
The girl asked the mouse, “What are you doing?” The mouse scurried over to her and told her that the hall was very dark and scary. The little mouse wanted to change it.
The girl thought that was a good idea, so she decided to help the mouse. She began to grab hold of the light switch, and when she flicked it on the hall suddenly became brighter, less scary and more fun.
Turning to the mouse, the girl said, “See, now the hall has changed and it's not so scary.” The mouse, happy to have his wish granted, smiled and ran off. 
The girl smiled too, feeling proud of all she had achieved.
