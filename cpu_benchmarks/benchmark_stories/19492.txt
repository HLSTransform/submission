Once upon a time, there was a poor boy who had no home. He lived in the forest and went on a long road every day to search for food. He was sad because no matter how hard he tried, he could not find enough food to eat.
One day, he walked through the forest when he saw a big house at the end of the road. The house was very rich and filled with food. The boy was so happy to find food that he did not think twice.
The rich man was not so happy. He chased the boy away and told him to never come back. The poor boy was sad because now he had to suffer without food even more.
But the poor boy was determined. He decided to try again and again, to look for food on the road and never give up. And eventually, he found enough food to eat and was no longer hungry. He was happy and had learned that even when the road is hard, never give up!
