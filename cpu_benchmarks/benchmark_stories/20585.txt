Once upon a time there was a boy. He had skin that was very healthy. One day he was walking around, looking for something fun to do. He came across a tree with a big branch. He decided that he would pull it to see what happened. He pulled and pulled, and the branch started to move. It was so fun that he kept pulling until the branch broke off the tree.
He was so excited, he started to dance with the big branch he had just pulled off. Suddenly, he felt a little pinch on his skin. He quickly looked down and saw that his healthy skin had been scratched! He started to cry and rubbed the scratch to try to make it feel better.
The boy was sad, so he decided he was going to put the branch back on the tree. He worked and worked until the branch was back in place. He stood back and looked at the tree, happy that his healthy skin was okay.
