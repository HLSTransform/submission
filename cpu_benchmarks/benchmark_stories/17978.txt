Once upon a time, in a land full of bright colors, there was a crane. The crane had a name, and his name was Bob. Bob the crane loved to play with his friends in the sun.
One day, Bob met a new friend. The new friend was a frog. The frog said, "Hi, my name is Lily. What is your name?" Bob the crane smiled and said, "My name is Bob. Nice to meet you, Lily!" They played together all day long.
As the sun went down, Bob and Lily were tired from playing. They said bye to each other and went home to their families. Bob the crane was happy to have a new friend. He could not wait to play with Lily the frog again tomorrow.
