Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the zoo with her daddy. They saw many animals like lions, tigers, and bears. Lily loved the lions because they would roar very loud.
Lily said, "Daddy, can we go see the lions again? They roar so high!"
Daddy said, "Sure, let's go!" So they went to see the lions again. But this time, one lion was very angry. He roared so loud that Lily and her daddy got scared. They tried to run away, but the lion was too fast.
The lion caught up to them and Lily's daddy tried to protect her, but the lion was too strong. It was a very bad ending.
