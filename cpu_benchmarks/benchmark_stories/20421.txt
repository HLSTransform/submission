Once upon a time, there was a big boat. The boat had a big anchor to stop it from moving. One day, the boat went on a trip. The water was smooth and calm. The boat ran through the water, making big waves. The people on the boat were happy and shouted with joy. Suddenly, the anchor fell off the boat and went into the water. The boat couldn't stop and ran away. The people were scared, but they found another way to stop the boat. They threw a big rope and it caught onto a rock. The boat stopped and everyone was safe.
