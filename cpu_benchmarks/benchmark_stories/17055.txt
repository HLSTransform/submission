One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park. It was a peaceful day. The sun was shining, and the birds were singing. Lily saw a big slide and she wanted to play on it.
Lily climbed up the slide and saw her friend, Tim. "Hi, Tim!" she said. "I want to tell you something." Tim looked at her and said, "What do you want to tell me, Lily?"
Lily smiled and said, "I love this slide! It's so much fun!" Tim smiled back and said, "I love it too! Let's play together!" So, Lily and Tim played on the slide all day, laughing and having a great time.
