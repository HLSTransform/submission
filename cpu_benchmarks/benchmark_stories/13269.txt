Once upon a time there was a crocodile who was very hot. He wanted to learn something, so he decided to go on an adventure. He started walking in a valley and soon enough he saw a big pond. The pond was filled with lots of fish and he thought this was the perfect place to learn. 
He decided to jump in and started to swim around and explore. He watched the fish swim around and spotted a pretty green frog in the pond. The frog was swimming around, having a great time! The crocodile was so amazed by all the animals in the pond and wanted to learn from them. 
He came close to the frog and asked if he could learn to swim like him. The frog was very happy and said yes. The frog taught the crocodile how to swim in circles and how to move quickly. The crocodile was so lucky to learn from the frog, and he thanked him many times. 
The crocodile practiced swimming for the rest of the day and it made him so happy. He was grateful for learning how to swim and thanked the frog for teaching him. Even though it was very hot, it was the best day ever!
