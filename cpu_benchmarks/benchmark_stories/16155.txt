Once upon a time there was a village. It was filled with happy people who cared for one another very deeply.
One day, a group of brave children decided to explore a nearby cave. The children were very careful, making sure that none of them strayed too far from the group. 
As they traveled deeper and deeper into the cave, it suddenly grew very dark. Frightened by the sudden darkness, the children huddled closer together while they tried to find their way out. 
Suddenly, a voice called out from the darkness. "I will help you out of this cave, if you please," the voice called. A rope soon appeared and the children grabbed onto it and were miraculously pulled out and into the light of day.
Once they were out of the cave, the children saw a man standing before them, smiling. "I knew you could do it. I can always tell when someone cares for something as much as you cared for each other," he said. 
The children thanked the man for his help and ran back to the village, full of joy and feeling very proud of themselves. From then on, the villagers were always careful to look out for each other.
