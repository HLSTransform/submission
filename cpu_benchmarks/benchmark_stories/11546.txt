Once upon a time, there was a friendly cop named Tim. Tim was very attractive. He had a big smile, and his uniform was always clean. Everyone in the town liked him.
One day, Tim wanted to create something special for the kids in the town. He thought and thought, and then he had an idea. Tim decided to make a big, colorful ball for the kids to play with.
Tim worked hard to create the ball. He used red, blue, yellow, and green colors. When the ball was ready, he took it to the park. The kids saw the ball and were very happy. They played with the ball all day, and they thanked Tim for his wonderful gift.
