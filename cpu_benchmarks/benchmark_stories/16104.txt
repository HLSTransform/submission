Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl. She had big dreams and she wanted to explore the world.
One day, she found a pattern in the clouds. It was a swirling shape, like a maze. The brave little girl loved the pattern and she wanted to try it.
She flew up to the sky and she followed the pattern around and around. She flew in circles and followed the maze. 
When she was tired, she rested on a cloud. She looked down and she could see how brave she was. 
She stayed in the sky until the sun went down, and then she flew back to the ground. She was proud of herself for following the pattern, and she was very proud of how brave she had been.
