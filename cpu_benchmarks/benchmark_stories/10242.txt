Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved her aunt very much because she always brought her candy and toys. One day, Auntie came to visit and brought a modern toy for Lily. It was a robot that could talk and dance!
Lily played with the toy all day long but then she accidentally broke it. She felt very sad and regretted playing too rough with it. Auntie was upset too but she hugged Lily and told her that it was okay.
The next day, Auntie came back with a new modern toy for Lily. This time, Lily promised to take better care of it and not play too rough. She was very happy and grateful for her kind Auntie. The end.
