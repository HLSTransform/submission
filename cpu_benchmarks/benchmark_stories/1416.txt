Once upon a time, there was a little tree who was very anxious. All her friends had leaves and beautiful flowers, but she was the only one without any. Everyday, she worried that no one would want her because she was so different.
But then one day, the wind blew over a special root. The little tree was excited, so she quickly reached down to pick it up. She knew it was the perfect thing to attach to her branches so she held onto it tight. 
The root was filled with power and soon enough, beautiful leaves started to appear on the tree. The little tree was so happy - she had never been so happy before! All her worries were gone and she thanked the wind for bringing her this special root. 
From then on, the little tree was not anxious anymore. She was so proud of her beautiful leaves and all her friends were so happy that she now looked the same as them.
The end.
