Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a band that he loved to play with. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play with him. Billy wanted to play with the band too, but Timmy didn't want to share.
"Can I play with your band?" asked Billy.
"No, it's mine," Timmy replied.
Billy got upset and threw a toy hard at Timmy. Timmy got mad and threw the band at Billy. The band broke into many pieces.
Now Timmy and Billy didn't have a band to play with anymore. They both felt sad and went home. Timmy learned that it's not nice to not share and throw things at people.
