Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and look out the window. One day, she saw a brilliant bird flying outside. She wanted to go outside and play with it, but her mom said no because it was too dangerous.
Lily was sad and decided to sneak out of the window when her mom wasn't looking. She climbed out and ran to the bird. But when she got close, the bird flew away and she was lost. She didn't know how to get back home.
Lily cried and cried until her mom found her. Her mom was very angry and sad because Lily had disobeyed her. Lily was punished and couldn't play with her toys for a long time. She learned her lesson and promised to never part from her mom's side again.
