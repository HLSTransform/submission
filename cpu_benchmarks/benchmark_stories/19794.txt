Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was three years old and she loved to stretch. She stretched her arms and legs and fingers and toes. Every morning she would stretch her body in the sunshine.
One day when she was stretching, she noticed something shiny under her feet. She bent down and picked it up. It was a little ashtray. She thought it was really pretty so she decided to keep it as a special treasure.
Every day she would take it out and stretch her body. She would imagine that the little ashtray was like her own little friend, watching her and cheering her on as she moved through her stretching routine.
The little ashtray made the girl so happy because it was a reminder of how she could make every day special. She knew that every time she took it out and stretched, she was creating something wonderful. 
And that's the story of the little girl and the little ashtray. It was a reminder of how we can sometimes stretch more than just our bodies but also our imaginations.
