Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat yummy jam on toast. One day, Lily's favorite toy, a teddy bear, fell and broke.
Lily was very sad and didn't know what to do. She asked her mom, "Can you fix my teddy bear?" Her mom said, "Let's bathe him first and then we'll see what we can do."
So, they gave the teddy bear a bath and then tried to fix him. But he was still broken. Lily was even sadder now. Her mom said, "Don't worry, we can buy a new teddy bear. But remember, we need to be careful with our toys so they don't break."
Lily learned an important lesson that day. She realized that sometimes things can break and it's okay to be sad. But it's also important to take care of our things so they last longer.
