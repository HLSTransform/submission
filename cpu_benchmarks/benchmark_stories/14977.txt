Susie was a three year old girl who lived in a big city. One weekend, Susie's mom took her to the park. As they walked, Susie noticed an ordinary cactus by the pond.
Susie was so excited and shouted, "Mom, look! It's a cactus! Can I touch it?" 
Susie's mom said, "Be careful, Susie. Cactuses have spikes so don't touch it with your hands."
Susie leaned in closer to take a better look. She felt brave and touched the cactus with her finger. It felt prickly, but not too bad.
Susie smiled and said, "It doesn't feel too bad! Can we take it home?"
Susie's mom said, "No, sorry Susie. We should leave it here for now." 
Susie nodded and said, "Ok, Mommy. Let's go!" 
Susie smiled as she held her mom's hand and walked back home. She felt happy knowing that the ordinary cactus was still in the park.
