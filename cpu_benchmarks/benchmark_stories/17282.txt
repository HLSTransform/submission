Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to jog around the park with his dog, Max. Max was very popular in the neighborhood because he was so friendly.
One day, as Timmy and Max were jogging, they saw a bright red cord on the ground. Timmy picked it up and put it in his pocket, thinking it might be useful later.
Later that day, Timmy's mom asked him to help fix a lamp. Timmy remembered the cord he found and took it out of his pocket. It was just the right size to fix the lamp! Timmy's mom was so happy and proud of him for being so helpful.
From then on, Timmy and Max continued to jog around the park, looking for more things they could find to help others. And whenever they found a cord, they knew it could be useful someday.
