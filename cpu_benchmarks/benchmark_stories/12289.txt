John was very sad. His skin was dry and itchy and he felt terrible. He was starting to feel even more sad when he heard something. It made him scared. He screamed at the top of his lungs.
John's mother came and looked around. She saw no one. She took John and hugged him and asked him what was wrong. John couldn't explain, but he was still crying. 
John's mother knew that she needed to help him feel better. She softly rubbed his skin and sang to him. She was happy when she saw that John stopped crying.
The next day John felt a little happier. He didn't have to scream again. He was glad that his skin was feeling better and that his mom had made him feel better.
