Jim was very intelligent. He loved to play the guitar. He was very good at it, but he had a tendency to forget to practice.
Today was no exception. Jim had forgotten to practice and his father was not happy. He said to Jim, "You must practice or I will punish you!"
Jim was so scared, he ran away quickly with his guitar. He ran to his neighbour's house and started to play his guitar. He was so smart and made beautiful music.
Jim's neighbour heard the music and was impressed. He said to Jim, "You must practice every day or else you won't get better!"
Jim liked what his kind neighbour said and promised to practice every day. He knew that he needed to do this or he would be punished.
