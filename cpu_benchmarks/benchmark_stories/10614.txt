Once upon a time there was a boy called Jack. He lived near the sea and loved to go swimming in it. Jack went to the beach one day and he saw something very interesting. The sea was glowing blue! Jack was so excited that he went to get his mom.
Jack said, "Mom, look! The sea is glowing blue!"
"Oh, that's amazing," said his mom.
Jack wanted to take a closer look and started walking towards the sea. His mom grabbed his hand and said, "Wait, you can't go into the sea. You might get hurt. 
Jack was sad. He really wanted to explore the glowing sea, but he had to listen to his mom.
In the end, Jack walked away from the sea and thought to himself "Maybe one day I'll come back and explore the glowing sea".
