Sara was a very intelligent girl. She liked to learn new things and play with her toys. One day, she saw a flute in a shop window. She wanted to get the flute and make music with it.
She asked her mom if she could get the flute. Her mom said yes, but she had to save some money first. Sara did some chores at home and helped her mom with the baby. She also did well at school and got a star sticker. She put her money in a piggy bank and counted it every day.
After a few weeks, Sara had enough money to get the flute. She was very happy and excited. She and her mom went to the shop and bought the flute. Sara thanked her mom and hugged her. She could not wait to play the flute.
She went home and opened the flute. It was shiny and pretty. She blew into it and made some sounds. She tried to copy some songs she heard on the radio. She practiced every day and got better and better. She also showed her flute to her friends and played with them. They liked her flute and her music.
Sara was very proud of her flute. She had worked hard to get it and learned how to play it. She was a very intelligent girl and a good musician. She loved her flute and her mom. She was very happy.
