Once upon a time there was a humble van. It was small and simple, and it belonged to a kind old man. Every day, the old man would take the van for a drive around the town.
One day, the old man took the van for a drive and everything was going great. Suddenly, the van started to shrink! It kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller. The old man was very surprised.
The old man looked around and he saw a little girl laughing. She had a magical wand in her hand. The old man was so thankful. The little girl had shrunk the van with her wand!
The old man thanked the little girl and they decided to take a ride in the small van. Everywhere they went, people smiled at the little van. The old man and the little girl had a great time.
The old man was so happy to have a van that was small and humble. Everywhere the two of them went, the little van made a big impression.
