Once upon a time, there was an old man who loved to observe dolphins. One day, he went to the beach to watch them swim. He saw a little girl playing in the water and asked her, "Have you ever seen a dolphin?" 
The little girl shook her head and said, "No, what's a dolphin?" 
The old man smiled and pointed to the sea. "Look out there, see that animal jumping? That's a dolphin!" 
The little girl's eyes widened with excitement. "Wow! Dolphins are so cool!" 
The old man chuckled and said, "Yes, they are. They're very smart too. They can do tricks and even talk to each other." 
The little girl watched the dolphins with wonder and said, "I want to be friends with a dolphin one day." 
The old man smiled and said, "Who knows, maybe one day you will be."
