Once upon a time, there were two friends named Timmy and Tommy. They loved playing together and having fun. One day, they found a big bag of candy and decided to share it. 
However, Timmy wanted more candy than Tommy and started to be greedy. Tommy felt sad and didn't want to play with Timmy anymore. They decided to separate and play with other friends. 
After a while, Timmy realized he was wrong and felt terrible for being greedy. He went to apologize to Tommy and offered him a reward - a toy car he had at home. Tommy forgave him and they became friends again. They learned that sharing is better than being greedy and that saying sorry can make things better.
