Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they were playing on the side of the road. Lily's mommy had told her to stay away from the road because it was dangerous, but she didn't listen.
Suddenly, a car came speeding down the road. Lily's friends quickly ran away, but Lily didn't move. The car stopped just in time, but it was a very close call. Lily's mommy came running over and asked if she was okay. Lily realized how important it was to listen to her mommy's rules and promises to be more careful in the future.
From that day on, Lily always asked her mommy for permission before going near the road. She learned that it's important to listen to those who care about you and keep yourself safe.
