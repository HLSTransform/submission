Once upon a time there was a boy named John. He was very eager to go explore a mountain near his house.
John put on his coat and took his hat, then marched up the mountain. At the top of the mountain, he found a big tree. He smiled and ran to the tree.
John put both his hands on the tree and started to swing back and forth. He felt like he was flying as he went higher and higher. Suddenly, he felt like he was above the mountain and he couldn't believe it.
John stayed there for a while and looked at the mountains and the clouds. He smiled and waved to all the people on the ground who were watching him swing.
John felt so proud and happy. He couldn't wait to swing on the tree again and explore more mountains.
