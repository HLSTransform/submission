Mommy was upset and sent Tom to the store to buy a towel. Tom was excited to go on an adventure and happily skipped out the door. 
When he came to the store, Tom looked around for the towels. He found a big pile of soft, colourful towels and picked out his favourite one. 
Tom paid for the towel and was ready to head back home when he realized he had forgotten his bag at home! He was so upset, but his mommy said it was okay and sent him back with an empty bag. 
Tom made it back home with the towel safely in the bag. Mommy was so pleased to see the towel and gave Tom a big hug. They both laughed and felt happy again.
