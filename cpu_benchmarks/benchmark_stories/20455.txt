Once upon a time there was a smart girl who loved school. She went to the classroom every morning and played with her friends. Every day the teacher brought something new to the classroom.
One day the teacher said she had a very special delivery. She brought in a big box and everyone was excited! The teacher opened it and there were pencils, markers and books! Everyone was very happy and the girl was especially smart because she knew what to do with the materials.
The girl used the pencils to draw a picture of her and her friends. She used the markers to color it in and the books to fill the classroom with stories. Everyone had a lot of fun! 
At the end of the day the class thanked the teacher for the special delivery. That night the girl fell asleep dreaming of how she could use the new tools in the classroom.
