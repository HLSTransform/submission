Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lucy. She was three years old and was very brave.
One day, Lucy went for a walk and found a lock. She was very curious and wanted to open it. But when she tried, it wouldn't open. She was scared.
Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. Lucy was scared and started to cry. She quickly sat down on the ground and put her hands over her ears.
The noise stopped and Lucy opened her eyes. She looked around and saw a beautiful bird on the fence. The bird smiled at her and said, “Don’t be scared. I can help you with the lock.”
The bird flew over and pecked at the lock with its beak. After a few tries, the lock opened!
Lucy was so happy that she hugged the bird. She thanked it for helping her and they said goodbye.
Lucy went home with a smile on her face, feeling brave and proud.
