Sam and Ben were brothers. They liked to play with their toys and make noise. But one morning, their mom said, "Boys, you have to be quiet. Dad is working from home today. He needs to focus on his computer."
Sam and Ben nodded, but they soon got bored. They looked around the living room for something fun to do. They saw a big pile of pillows on the couch. They had an idea.
"Let's make a fort!" Sam whispered to Ben.
"OK!" Ben whispered back.
They grabbed the pillows and started to build a fort on the floor. They used a blanket for the roof and some books for the walls. They crawled inside and pretended they were in a secret cave.
"This is cool!" Sam said.
"Yeah!" Ben agreed.
They played for a while, until they heard their mom call them.
"Boys, breakfast is ready! Come and get your toast!"
Sam and Ben smiled. They loved toast. They quickly got out of their fort and ran to the kitchen.
"Wow, what a nice fort you made!" their mom said, as she gave them each a plate of toast with butter and jam.
"Thanks, mom!" they said.
They ate their toast and drank their milk. They felt happy and full.
"Can we go back to our fort after breakfast?" Sam asked.
"Sure, but remember to be quiet, OK?" their mom said.
"OK, mom!" they said.
They finished their breakfast and went back to their fort. They played some more, but this time they used their inside voices. They did not want to disturb their dad, who was working hard on his dull computer. They were good boys. They knew how to settle down when they had to.
