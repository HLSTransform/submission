Tom liked to play in the garden. He saw many flowers and bugs. He liked to watch the bees. They were busy and made honey. Tom wanted to touch a bee. He thought it was soft and cute.
He reached out his hand to a bee on a rose. The bee did not like that. It felt scared and hurt. It stung Tom's finger. Tom cried out loud. His finger was red and sore. He ran to his mom. She put some ice on his finger. She told him not to touch the bees. They were not toys. They were living things. They needed to be left alone.
Tom felt sorry. He did not mean to hurt the bee. He wanted to say sorry to the bee. He asked his mom how to do that. She said he could restore the bee's home. He could plant more flowers and water them. He could be gentle and kind to the bees and other bugs. He could watch them from a distance and learn from them.
Tom liked that idea. He got some seeds and a watering can. He planted some flowers in a sunny spot. He watered them every day. He saw the bees come and go. They liked the flowers. They made more honey. Tom smiled. He was happy. He learned to respect the bees. He learned to restore what he broke. He learned to be gentle and kind.
