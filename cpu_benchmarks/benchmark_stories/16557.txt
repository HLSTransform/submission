Lily was a little girl who liked to eat. She liked to eat apples and bananas and cheese and bread. She liked to eat in the kitchen with her mom and dad, or in the garden with her dog and cat.
One day, Lily saw something different under the table. It was a big brown box with a red ribbon. Lily was curious. She crawled under the table and opened the box. Inside, she found a lot of yummy things to eat. There were cookies and candies and chocolates and cakes.
Lily was very happy. She took a bite of a cookie and said, "Mmm, this is good!" She took a bite of a candy and said, "Mmm, this is sweet!" She took a bite of a chocolate and said, "Mmm, this is smooth!" She took a bite of a cake and said, "Mmm, this is soft!"
But then, Lily heard a voice. It was her mom. She said, "Lily, where are you? It's time for lunch!" Lily looked at the box. She saw a card. It said, "Happy birthday, Lily! Love, Grandma and Grandpa." Lily realized that the box was a gift for her. She felt bad. She had eaten some of her gift without asking.
Lily crawled out from under the table and said, "Mom, I'm sorry. I found a box under the table and I ate some of it. It was from Grandma and Grandpa. It was for my birthday." Mom smiled and hugged Lily. She said, "It's okay, Lily. I'm sure Grandma and Grandpa would want you to enjoy their gift. But you should always ask before you eat something that is not yours. And you should save some for later. You don't want to spoil your appetite for lunch, do you?"
Lily nodded and said, "No, Mom. I don't want to spoil my appetite. I want to eat lunch with you and Dad and Dog and Cat. And I want to say thank you to Grandma and Grandpa for the nice gift. Can I call them later?" Mom said, "Of course, Lily. You can call them later and tell them how much you liked their gift. And how much you love them. And how much they love you." Lily smiled and said, "I love you, Mom." Mom said, "I love you, too, Lily. Happy birthday, my sweet girl."
