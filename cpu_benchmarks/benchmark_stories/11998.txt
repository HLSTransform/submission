Once upon a time, there was a pretty girl named Lily. She liked to play with her toys every day. She had strong muscles from playing outside with her friends.
One day, Lily decided to play with some new toys she got from the store. She was so excited to open the box and see what was inside. But as she was playing with the toys, she accidentally hurt her muscle. It hurt so much that she had to go to the hospital.
At the hospital, the doctors tried to help Lily's muscle feel better. But they couldn't fix it. Lily was sad that she couldn't play with her toys anymore. She learned that sometimes playing too much can lead to bad things happening.
