Once there was a rock. It was a big, wide rock. A little girl wanted to play with the rock.
She took a bucket of water and poured it over the rock. She said, “I want to see if the rock will melt!”
The sun was shining brightly in the sky. The girl was so excited to see what would happen to the rock.
She waited and waited. Finally, the rock started to melt! The girl smiled a big smile.
“It’s melting!” she said. She laughed and danced around the rock.
The rock melted down to a puddle. The girl said, “Look at the puddle that used to be a rock!”
She was so happy to see her experiment succeed. She watched in amazement as the puddle got bigger and bigger. The wide rock was gone. 
The girl knew she had done a good job. She cheered and said, “I did it!”
