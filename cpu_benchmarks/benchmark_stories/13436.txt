Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint pictures with her fingers and hands. One day, she saw a tall ladder in her backyard. She climbed up to the top of the ladder to see what she could see. She felt very high up and a little scared, but she was very brave. 
After she climbed down, she felt very hungry. Her mom made her a delicious sandwich with peanut butter and jelly. Lily ate it all up and felt much better. Later, she painted a picture of the ladder and the beautiful sky she saw from the top. It was her favorite painting ever. The end.
