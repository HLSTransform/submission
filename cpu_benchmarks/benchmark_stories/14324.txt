Once upon a time there were two babies. One was called Tommy and the other was called Lilly. Tommy was outside playing in the garden with some toys when suddenly he noticed a crib in the middle of the garden. It was a white crib and it was shining in the sun. Tommy was so excited and wanted to play in the crib. He asked Lilly to come and play with him but she just laughed and said no.
So Tommy decided to play alone in the crib. But after a few minutes he started to feel a little lonely and he wanted to have someone to share the fun with him. He then noticed Lilly watching him from the nearby window. She must have been wanting to play with him but she was too shy to come out.
Tommy realized that it was much more fun to share your toys and play together with another person, even if he or she is shy. He called out to Lilly to come and join him and quickly they were both laughing and playing in the crib, having a very nice time together.
The moral of the story is that it's much more fun to share and play together than alone!
