Molly was feeling excited. She was jumping around and singing. Suddenly, she started to yawn. Her mom smiled and said, "Let's get some rest, honey." Molly nodded and they both went to her room.
Molly tucked herself in and yawned again. Her mom said, "Let's have an apple before bed." Molly grinned and jumped out of bed. She found an apple in the kitchen and bit into it. The apple was so delicious! 
Molly was more excited than ever. She started running around, chomping on her apple. Her mom laughed and said, "Time for bed! What a enthusiastic girl you are." Molly yawned once more and put down the apple. She jumped into bed and quickly fell asleep.
