Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy called a microscope. With the microscope, Tim could look at very small things and make them look big.
One day, Tim found a tiny bug in the garden. He said to his mom, "Mom, can I look at the bug with my microscope?" His mom said, "Yes, Tim, you can imagine how big the bug will look!"
Tim looked at the bug through the microscope. The bug looked so big and funny! Tim laughed and showed his mom. His mom smiled and said, "Wow, Tim, that's amazing!"
Tim had a friend named Sam. Sam was deaf, but they still liked to play together. Tim showed Sam the big bug through the microscope. Sam smiled and they both laughed. They played with the microscope all day, looking at all the tiny things they could find.
