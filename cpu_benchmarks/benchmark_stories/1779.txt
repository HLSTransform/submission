One day, Susie was walking in the garden. Suddenly, she saw something wonderful - a beautiful flower blooming! She ran over to smell its sweet scent.
The flower was a bright pink and had petals like ruffled tissue paper. As Susie looked closer, she saw a little bee winking at her. She smiled and waved.
The bee was very busy buzzing around, taking the pollen from flower to flower. It was almost too busy to notice Susie, but it kept winking at her. It seemed to be saying hello!
Soon, Susie had to move on, so she said goodbye to her special flower and the bee. She waved and blew it a careless kiss goodbye. She knew now that there was beauty in the garden for her to find.
