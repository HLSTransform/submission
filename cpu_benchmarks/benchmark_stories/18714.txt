Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Mittens. Mittens loved to play with balls of yarn and chase butterflies in the garden. One day, Mittens' family decided to go on a trip and stay at a hotel. Mittens was very excited to go on a trip and explore a new place.
When they arrived at the hotel, Mittens saw a big mailbox outside. Mittens loved mail, so she ran over to the mailbox to see if there was anything inside. To her surprise, there was a letter addressed to her! The letter said that Mittens' best friend, a little mouse named Squeakers, had passed away. Mittens was very sad and cried a lot.
But then, Mittens remembered all the fun times she had with Squeakers and felt a little better. She decided to write a letter back to Squeakers and mail it in the mailbox outside the hotel. Mittens knew that even though Squeakers was gone, they would always be friends.
