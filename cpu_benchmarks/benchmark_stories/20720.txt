Once upon a time there was a girl named Jane. Jane loved to play outside in the park. She always wore her special red jacket.
One day, while playing in the park, it started to rain. Jane was very upset and frustrated because she couldn't play anymore. She struggled to put on her red jacket, but the wind kept blowing it away.
Jane kept running and struggling to put on her jacket but she couldn't. She became even more frustrated. Suddenly Jane's mom ran to her and put on her jacket for her.
Jane was so happy that she hugged her mom tightly and thanked her for helping. From that day, Jane and her mom put on Jane's jacket together every time it rained so that she could still go and play outside.
