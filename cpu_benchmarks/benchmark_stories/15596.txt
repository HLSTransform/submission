Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Anna, who had long hair and a pink dress. Lily always took Anna with her to bed, and hugged her tight when she had bad dreams.
One night, Lily had a very scary nightmare. She dreamed that a big monster came into her room and tried to take Anna away from her. Lily screamed and held on to Anna, but the monster was stronger and pulled harder. Lily felt Anna slip from her hands and drop to the floor.
Lily woke up with a loud cry and looked around. She saw Anna lying on the floor, and the monster was gone. It was only a dream, but it felt very real. Lily was scared and sad. She wanted Anna back.
She got out of bed and ran to pick up Anna. She hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, Anna. I love you. You're my best friend. Don't leave me."
Anna did not say anything, because she was a doll. But Lily felt that Anna loved her too, and was happy to be with her. Lily carried Anna back to bed and snuggled with her. She felt safe and warm.
She looked at the window and saw the moon and the stars. They were shining and beautiful. She thought they were incredible. She smiled and said, "Good night, Anna. Good night, moon. Good night, stars. Thank you for watching over me."
She closed her eyes and fell asleep. She did not have any more nightmares that night. She had sweet dreams instead.
