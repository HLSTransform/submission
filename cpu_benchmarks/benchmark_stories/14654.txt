Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah. She wanted to go on an adventure, so she set off into the woods. She was a little scared, but she managed to find her way.
As she was walking, she saw a magical shoulder ahead. It was very big and very heavy, but she knew she had the strength to carry it. She managed to pick it up and carry it on her shoulder.
Sarah kept walking and exploring with the shoulder. She went further and further, discovering all sorts of interesting sights. Then she saw a small cottage tucked away in a clearing. It was warm and inviting, and Sarah knew she had found her perfect home.
There, she managed to make a home for herself with the help of the magical shoulder. She was so happy that she could finally explore and relax in her new home.
The young girl was very proud of herself and the adventure she had managed to go on. She thanked the magical shoulder for helping her along the way and always encouraging her to try new things. With her newfound confidence and courage, she knew she could manage anything.
