Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named Liza. Liza loved playing in the forest with her friends. One day, she noticed that the forest was not as organized as it was before. The trees had fallen down, and the paths were all mixed up.
So Liza decided to sort it out. She worked all day, moving the trees and clearing the paths. When she was finished, the forest was organized again.
But then Liza saw a scary wolf. She froze and was too scared to move. But the wolf was very friendly and started to help Liza with her work. The wolf moved the trees for her and cleared the paths.
Together, Liza and the wolf sorted the forest out. When they were finished, the forest was very organized. Liza and the wolf were happy that they had worked together. They lived happily ever after in the organized forest.
