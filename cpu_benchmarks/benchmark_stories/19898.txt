Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play pretend with her toys. One day, she found a shiny copper penny on the ground. She thought it was real and wanted to keep it. But her mom told her it was fake and not worth anything.
Lily was sad that the penny wasn't real, but her mom explained that sometimes things can look real but they're not. She told Lily that it's important to be honest and not pretend to be something you're not. 
Lily learned that it's better to be true to yourself and not pretend to be something fake. She decided to keep the fake penny as a reminder of this lesson. From then on, Lily always made sure to be honest and true to herself.
