Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to have fun, and she had a plan.
Lily wanted to learn to surf. She went to the beach and saw a big, blue ocean. She knew it was the perfect place for surfing.
Lily asked her mom for a surfboard. Her mom said yes, and Lily was so happy. She couldn't wait to try it out.
Lily's dad showed her how to use the surfboard. At first it was hard, but Lily kept trying. After a little while, Lily was surfing all by herself. She was so proud.
Lily had such a great time at the beach that day. She even made a plan to go back and surf again soon.
