Once upon a time there was a little girl who had a delicate doll. She liked to play games with her doll. One day her mom saw her playing a game and said, "No, sweetheart, that is not a nice game to play. You have to be gentle with your doll." The little girl just smiled and kept playing.
The mom got angry and said, "If you don't listen to me, I will have to punish you!" The little girl started to cry, but the mom took her doll away. She said, "You have to understand that this doll is delicate. You have to treat her with love, not play mean games with her."
The little girl was sad, but she understood and apologized to her mom. Her mom hugged her and said, "That's ok sweetheart. Now go and find something more gentle to play with."
The little girl found some nice toys and played happily. She always remembered to treat her toys delicately, so that she would never get punished again.
