One night, the little girl looked up in the sky and saw a pale moon. She knew that if she talked to it, it might answer her.
So, she called out loudly to the moon.
"Are you up there?" she said.
The moon smiled down at her, and in a gentle voice, it said "Yes, I am here".
The little girl was so happy, she jumped for joy!
"Can you stay with me for a while?" she asked, her voice laced with excitement.
The moon said, "Yes, I will stay with you as long as you want".
The little girl was so glad she had made a friend in the moon. Every night, she would talk to it and ask it questions. 
The moon never tired of answering, and soon the little girl knew all about the night sky. 
She was happy and content, and as long as she could talk to her new friend, the moon, she was always happy.
