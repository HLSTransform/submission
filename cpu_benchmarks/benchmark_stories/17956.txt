One day, a girl named Lily went for a walk in the warm sun. She saw a big tree with a symbol on it. The symbol was a happy face. Lily was very excited. She wanted to know who drew the happy face.
Lily asked her friend, Tom, "Did you draw the happy face on the tree?" Tom said, "No, I did not. But it makes me excited too!" They both smiled and wanted to find out who made the symbol.
They went to the park and saw their friend, Sam, playing. They asked Sam, "Did you draw the happy face on the tree?" Sam said, "Yes, I did! I wanted to make everyone excited and happy when they saw it!" Lily, Tom, and Sam all laughed and played together under the warm sun.
