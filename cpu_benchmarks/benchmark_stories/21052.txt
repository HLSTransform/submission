Lily did not like broccoli. She thought it was green and yucky. She always tried to hide it under her plate or give it to her dog. But her mom said broccoli was good for her and she had to eat it.
One day, mom made a big pot of soup for dinner. She put carrots, potatoes, chicken and broccoli in it. She said it was a warm and yummy soup. Lily looked at the soup and saw the green bits. She did not want to eat them.
But mom said she had a surprise for Lily. She said if Lily ate all her soup, she would get a special dessert. Lily loved dessert. She wondered what it was. She decided to try the soup.
She took a small spoonful and put it in her mouth. She tasted the carrots, potatoes and chicken. They were good. She did not taste the broccoli. She took another spoonful. She still did not taste the broccoli. She took a bigger spoonful. She felt something crunchy. It was the broccoli. She did not like it. But she wanted the dessert. She swallowed it quickly.
She managed to eat all her soup. She was proud of herself. She asked mom what the dessert was. Mom smiled and brought out a big bowl of ice cream. It was Lily's favorite flavor. It had chocolate and sprinkles on top. It was not an ordinary dessert. It was a special dessert.
Lily was happy. She thanked mom and ate her ice cream. She thought maybe broccoli was not so bad after all. She decided to try it again next time. But she still liked ice cream more.
