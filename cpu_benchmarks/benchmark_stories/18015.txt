Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who lived on top of a big hill. She loved to play outside and pick flowers, but one day she fell and cut her knee. She cried and cried until her mom came to help her.
Her mom cleaned the cut and put a bandage on it, but Lily was still miserable. She didn't want to play anymore because her knee hurt too much. Her mom suggested they go inside and bake some cookies instead.
As they were mixing the dough, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to help cut the cookies into fun shapes. Lily's eyes lit up and she forgot all about her knee. They spent the rest of the afternoon baking and laughing together. Lily realized that even when things seem bad, there's always something fun to do.
