Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved taking pictures with his camera. One day, Timmy's mommy asked him to send a picture to his grandma. Timmy was happy to do it, so he took a picture of his favorite toy and sent it to his grandma.
As Timmy was walking outside, he saw a big, fierce dog. The dog was barking loudly and Timmy felt scared. He quickly took a picture of the dog and ran back inside. He showed his mommy the picture and she told him that it was good he was safe.
From that day on, Timmy always made sure to bring his camera with him when he went outside. He wanted to take pictures of everything he saw, even if it was a fierce dog. And whenever his mommy asked him to send a picture, he knew just what to do.
