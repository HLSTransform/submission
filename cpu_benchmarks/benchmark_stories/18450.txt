Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy lived in a small village in the west. Timmy's family was very rich and they had a big house with a big garden. Timmy loved to play in the garden and run around with his friends.
One day, Timmy's parents gave him a new toy. It was a big red ball. Timmy loved his new toy and he played with it all day long. But one day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy wanted to play with Timmy's new toy, but Timmy didn't want to share.
Billy felt sad and went home. Timmy felt bad too. He realized that it wasn't nice to not share with his friends. So, Timmy decided to go to Billy's house and apologize. He took his big red ball and stepped over to Billy's house. When he got there, he gave the ball to Billy and they played together happily.
The moral of the story is that it's important to share with your friends and make them happy too.
