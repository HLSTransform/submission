Once there was a girl called Lucy. She liked to go on adventures. One day she decided to take a taxi to the zoo. On the way, she noticed a fierce lion. It was making a surprising noise. Lucy was scared but she decided to be brave. She surrendered to the lion and asked it to be her friend.
The lion didn't move so Lucy took a step forward. Suddenly, the lion roared and Lucy ran back to the taxi. She was so surprised and scared but she had been brave.
The lion followed her and Lucy thought she was in trouble. But the lion just wanted to come with them. Lucy and the lion shared the taxi and they arrived safe and sound at the zoo. After that day, Lucy and the lion were the best of friends. They never surrendered to their fears again!
