Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the mud and dirt. One day, Timmy's mom told him it was time for a bath. Timmy didn't want to take a bath because he was having too much fun playing in the dirt.
Timmy's mom said, "Come on Timmy, let's go take a bath. We don't want you to get sick." Timmy struggled and didn't want to go, but his mom picked him up and carried him to the bathroom.
In the bathroom, Timmy's mom turned on the water and added some soap to the tub. Timmy watched as the water bubbled up and became lively. He jumped into the tub and started to splash around. "This is fun!" Timmy exclaimed.
After his bath, Timmy felt clean and fresh. He hugged his mom and said, "Thank you for making me take a bath. I feel so much better now." From that day on, Timmy didn't struggle to take a bath anymore because he knew it was important to stay clean and healthy.
