Once upon a time, there was a little boy who lived in a house with his mommy and daddy. He liked to go outside and play in the garden. 
One day, he saw some pick growing on a bush near the house! He got so excited that he ran straight to the bush to pick them. 
The pick were fuzzy and hairy. He wanted to take them inside to show his mommy and daddy. He grabbed them carefully, because he didn't want to squish them. 
After he picked the pick, he ran back inside with them. His mommy and daddy saw them and laughed. They said it was amazing how quickly he was growing and learning new things. 
The little boy smiled and hugged his pick tightly. From then on, he continued to go outside and pick things and learn more about the world around him.
