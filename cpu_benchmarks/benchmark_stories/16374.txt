One day, a boy named Tim went to the park. He saw a big vine on a tree. He thought it would be fun to swing on it. So, Tim held the vine and swung back and forth. It was fun and he felt fine.
But then, something strange happened. The vine began to shrink! Tim was scared. He did not want to fall down. He held on tight to the shrinking vine.
Tim's mom saw him and knew he was in trouble. She ran to help him. She caught him just as the vine got too small. Tim was safe and felt fine again. He thanked his mom for helping him. From that day on, Tim never played with vines again.
