Nina was excited. Today was the festival! She had dressed all in white, just like her mommy had told her to. In the morning, she watched all the people set up decorations and stands.
"Mommy, what are they doing?" asked Nina.
"They are preparing for the festival, sweetheart. We will have lots of fun tonight!"
Nina loved festivals. They were always so colourful and exciting! She raced around all day, until finally the sun was beginning to set. The sky had turned from blue to pink and red.
"It's almost time!" said Mommy.
Nina could hardly believe it! Suddenly, there was a loud noise. People began to yell and fight.
"Mommy, what's happening?" asked Nina, frightened.
"Don't worry, sweetheart. This is all part of the festival," Mommy said. 
Nina was relieved. She couldn't wait to find out what would happen next!
