Sam loved to rock. His dad had a big old rocking chair with smooth wood that slid back and forth. Every day after school Sam would head over to the rocking chair, jump inside and start to rock softly. He imagined he was on an adventure - sailing across the sea, flying high in the sky or even exploring a far away land.
“The motion of the rocking chair helps me think up new stories,” Sam said to himself one day.
Just then Mom peered into the room. “Are you sure you’re not swaying too much, Sammy?” she asked.
Sam stopped rocking, embarrassed. “Sorry, mom,” he said.
Mom smiled. “It’s ok, sweetheart. I’m just making sure you’re being careful.”
Sam resumed his rocking, this time moving slower and more gently. He let his thoughts take him away on a new journey and he soon forgot all about his mom.
Soon he was back in his favorite place - the rocking chair. He felt safe and secure as he moved back and forth. Sam smiled - he knew that no matter where his imagination took him, he could always come back to the rocking chair.
