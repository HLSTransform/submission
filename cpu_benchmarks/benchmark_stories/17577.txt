Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her toys. She had a lot of toys in her bedroom. She had dolls, cars, blocks, books and a teddy bear. She liked to make stories with her toys and pretend they were her friends.
One day, Lily was playing with her toys and she felt very tired. She yawned and rubbed her eyes. She wanted to nap, but she did not want to stop playing. She thought she could nap and play at the same time. She was very silly.
She took her teddy bear and put it on her bed. She said, "Teddy, you nap here and I will nap there." She pointed to a pile of blocks. She lay down on the blocks and closed her eyes. She thought the blocks were soft and cozy. She was very silly.
But the blocks were not soft and cozy. They were hard and pointy. They poked Lily in her back and her head and her arms. They made her uncomfortable and sore. She could not nap on the blocks. She opened her eyes and cried. She was very silly.
She heard her mommy coming to her bedroom. She saw her mommy's face and smiled. She said, "Mommy, I tried to nap on the blocks, but they hurt me. I was very silly." Her mommy hugged her and said, "Yes, you were very silly, Lily. But I love you anyway. Come on, let's nap on the bed. The bed is soft and cozy. You will feel better." She picked up Lily and her teddy bear and put them on the bed. She kissed them and said, "Good night, Lily. Good night, teddy. Have a nice nap." She turned off the light and left the bedroom.
Lily snuggled with her teddy bear and felt the bed. The bed was soft and cozy. She closed her eyes and napped. She did not feel silly anymore. She felt happy.
