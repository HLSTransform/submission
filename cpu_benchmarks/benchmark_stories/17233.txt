Once upon a time, there was a big boat. It had a flag that went up high and a big sail that helped it move. The boat sailed on the blue sea and the sun shone bright. Suddenly, an alarm went off! It was loud and made everyone alert. They looked around and saw a big wave coming. The boat sailed fast and they made it through the wave. Everyone was happy and they continued sailing on the sea.
