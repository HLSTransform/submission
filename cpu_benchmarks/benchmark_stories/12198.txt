One day, two players were outside playing tag. They seemed to be having a lot of fun. One of the players had an original idea.
"Let's play hide and seek!" the player said.
The other player agreed and they both decided to hide. The original player thought of the perfect spot to hide.
After what seemed like an eternity, the other player called out, "Ready or not, here I come!"
The player scoured the area, trying to figure out where his friend had gone. He searched under the picnic table and behind the bushes, but nothing was there. Suddenly, he spotted a figure coming out from behind a tree.
The player smiled in relief. There his friend was, the original player, who had come up with the game in the first place!
