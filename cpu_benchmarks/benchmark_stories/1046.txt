Once there was a monkey named Tom. He was a very graceful monkey and he was always looking for new adventures. So one day, he decided to travel to the jungle. His mum said he had to get her permission first, so he asked and she permitted him to go.
Tom was so excited that he started to dance and jump around. He ran off to the jungle right away!
When he got there, he saw lots of things. He saw exotic birds, big snakes and colourful flowers. Tom was having so much fun!
Then he saw a graceful monkey in a tree. She was doing somersaults and playing with the tree branches. Tom wanted to join in the fun, so he climbed up the tree and introduced himself.
The two monkeys spent the day playing together. They chased each other through the trees and sang silly songs. Tom had the best time!
At the end of the day, Tom said goodbye to his new friend and ran back home. His mum was so happy to see him. She gave him a big hug and said he was always welcome to go on more adventures. Tom was so happy!
