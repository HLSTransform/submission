Once upon a time, two kids named Jack and Jill went to the beach. They wanted to get a boat. The boat was red and had two oars. They asked Jack's dad if they could take it out on the water. He said yes and they quickly went to the beach.
Jack and Jill got in the boat and began to row. They rowed around the shore and watched the waves come in and go out. Then they saw something special. It was a regular boat that was bigger than theirs. They wanted to get it and have even more fun.
They both worked together and each took an oar. They rowed towards the big boat and got close enough to touch it. It was bigger than Jack and Jill had ever seen. They were so excited to get it and began to row around with it.
Jack and Jill had a lot of fun with their regular boat. They took turns rowing and went up and down the shoreline. They had so much fun that they wished they could do it every day.
