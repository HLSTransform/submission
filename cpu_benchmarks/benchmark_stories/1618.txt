Sara and Tom were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big bunch of grapes on a table. They were hungry and wanted to eat some.
"Look, grapes!" Sara said. "Let's go and get some."
"But they are not ours," Tom said. "Maybe someone else will come back for them."
Sara did not listen. She ran to the table and grabbed a grape. She put it in her mouth. It was sweet and juicy. She was glad.
"Come on, Tom, they are yummy!" Sara said. "No one is here. We can have some more."
Tom was scared. He did not want to take what was not his. He looked around. He saw a man walking towards the table. He had a big hat and a big bag. He looked angry.
"Uh-oh, Sara, we have to move!" Tom said. "That man is coming. He is the owner of the grapes. He will be mad at us."
Sara did not hear him. She was busy eating more grapes. She did not see the man until he was right in front of her. He shouted at her.
"Hey, you little thief! What are you doing with my grapes? Give them back to me!"
Sara was scared. She dropped the grapes and ran away. Tom followed her. They hid behind a tree. They heard the man looking for them.
"Where are you, you little rascals? I will teach you a lesson!"
Sara and Tom were sorry. They wished they had not taken the grapes. They learned their lesson. They decided to never take what was not theirs again.
