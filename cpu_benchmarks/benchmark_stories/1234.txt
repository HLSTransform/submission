Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to visit her grandma's house because her grandma always had cake for her. The cake was so yummy and Lily always ate it all up. 
One day, Lily's mom told her that she had to be very careful because grandma had a fragile vase in her living room. Lily promised to be careful and not touch it. 
When they got to grandma's house, Lily ran straight to the kitchen to see if there was any cake. Sure enough, there was a big chocolate cake on the counter. Lily was so happy! 
After eating some cake, Lily went to the living room to play with her toys. She remembered the vase and was very careful not to touch it. She had a great time visiting grandma's house and couldn't wait to come back for more cake. The end.
