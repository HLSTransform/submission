Once upon a time there was a boy who loved his guitar. Every day he would take it out and strum away, singing lovely songs. But one day, something strange happened. His guitar began to ignore the boy's strumming and refused to make any sound.
The boy was very sad and asked his mum for help. "Mum, why does my guitar not make sound?" he asked.
Mum smiled and said, "Never worry my lovely, I can fix this. Just let me take the guitar for a few minutes and I'll make it good as new."
The boy was so happy and watched his mum as she worked on his guitar. After a while, his mum said, "There, now your guitar is ready to play."
The boy said thank you and took his guitar outside. When he strummed the strings, beautiful music came out. The boy smiled and played for hours. He even wrote a lovely song about his guitar, which he called 'The Guitar I Love'.
