Once upon a time, there was a big bear named Benny. He loved to eat olives. One day, he went to the forest to find some olives to eat. But he couldn't find any!
Benny met a little bird named Lily. "Hi, Lily! Can you help me solve my problem?" Benny asked. "Sure, what's the problem?" Lily replied.
"I'm hungry and I want to eat olives, but I can't find any," Benny said. "Oh, I know where to find some olives! Follow me," Lily said.
Lily flew to a tree and showed Benny where the olives were. Benny was so happy and said, "Thank you, Lily! You solved my problem!" Benny ate all the olives and felt very full. From that day on, Benny and Lily were good friends.
