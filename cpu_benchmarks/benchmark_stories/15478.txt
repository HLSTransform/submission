Once upon a time there was a boy called Tim. He had a toy car and he loved to play with it every day. One day he wanted to show his car to his mummy and daddy. So he drove it to the living room and asked his daddy to have a look. His daddy was so proud of him.
His daddy said, "This is great, Tim. I recommend you get an arm for this car. It will help push it around and make it even better!" Tim was so excited to get the arm and he dreamed of driving his car with the new arm.
The next day, his mummy and daddy took him to the shop and bought a lovely blue arm for his car. When Tim saw the arm he was so happy. He quickly put the arm on the car and hopped in. He felt so proud and drove happily around the living room. 
Everyone was so proud of him and they were all so happy with the new arm. Timâ€™s happy face, with his car and the blue arm, was a happy sight to see.
