Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run outside. One day, she saw her mom studying a book about herbs. 
"What's that, Mommy?" Lily asked.
"It's a book about plants we can use to make medicine and food taste better," her mom explained.
Lily thought that was cool and wanted to learn more. She asked her mom if she could study with her. 
"Of course, Lily! It's always good to learn new things," her mom said with a smile. 
From that day on, Lily and her mom studied together and learned about all kinds of herbs. They even started growing their own herb garden! Soon, their delicious meals became very popular with their friends and family. And Lily felt proud that she was able to learn something new with her mom.
