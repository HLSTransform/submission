Once upon a time, there was a modest little girl. One day, she opened the door and saw a parade outside. She was amazed! There were colorful floats, brightly dressed people, and loud music. She ran out of the house to join in on the excitement. 
The girl opened her eyes wide and watched with amazement as the parade traveled through her neighborhood. She waved happily at the people in it and smiled at the sounds of the cheerful music. 
When the parade was over, the girl saw that one of the parade visitors had left behind a big, shiny present. She opened it, and inside was a pretty pink and purple kite. She couldn't believe her luck! 
The girl was so excited about her new kite that she ran out to the backyard right away to fly it. She ran back and forth, tugging at the strings and watching her kite fly higher and higher. 
The girl had never been happier. She was so glad she opened the door and saw the parade that day!
