There was once a little girl called Sue. She loved exploring in the woods near her house. One day she found an old tree and thought it would be fun to climb it. She started climbing and once she was in the top she noticed a furry squirrel running through the branches. When Sue tried to touch it, the squirrel ran away. 
Sue was very sad but she suddenly noticed something in the bark of the tree - a small, round hole. She put her finger in the hole and pulled out a furry texture! She was really excited and showed it to her dad. 
Sue's dad looked at the texture and smiled. He said, "I think this texture used to belong to the squirrel. We should restore it to its rightful owner!" 
So Sue went back to the tree, ready to put the texture back. But, when she got there the tree was gone! She was so sad and started to cry. She could not see the squirrel anywhere. 
She wondered what she should do when suddenly she heard the noise of claws against the bark. She looked up and there was the squirrel jumping down the branches with its tail twitching. Sue put out her hand with the texture in it, and the squirrel took it and ran off.
Sue smiled and was happy to have been able to restore the furry texture to its rightful owner.
