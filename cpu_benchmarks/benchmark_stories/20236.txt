Sara and Ben were playing with their toy horses in the yard. They liked to pretend they were cowboys and cowgirls, riding fast and chasing bad guys. Sara had a whip that she used to make loud noises and scare the birds. Ben thought the whip was impressive and wanted to try it.
"Can I use your whip, Sara?" he asked.
"No, it's mine. You have your own toy, use that," Sara said.
"But your whip is more fun. Please, let me have a turn," Ben begged.
Sara shook her head and snapped the whip again. Ben felt angry and grabbed the whip from her hand. Sara tried to pull it back, but Ben was stronger. They started to fight over the whip, pulling and tugging and shouting.
"Stop it, you two!" their mom said, coming out of the house. She saw the whip and took it away from them. "This is not a nice toy to play with. You could hurt yourselves or someone else. And you should not fight over things. You should share and be kind to each other."
Sara and Ben felt ashamed and sorry. They apologized to each other and hugged. Their mom smiled and gave them each a cookie. She said they could play with the whip again, but only if they promised to be careful and respectful. Sara and Ben agreed and thanked their mom. They learned that fighting is not fun, and sharing is better.
