Once there was an infant who wondered what was beyond her backyard. She was very clean and liked to make mud pies. One day her parents took her on a walk to explore. They walked and walked until they saw something very special.
The infant saw a lake for the first time. Her eyes were wide with wonder. The lake was so big and she could see the sky in it's reflection. She wanted to get closer and explore, so her parents carefully took her nearer and she ran close to the water. 
The infant was amazed. She could feel the cool water on her feet, the little plants at the side of the lake and see the ducks swimming. Then some birds flew by and she watched them go. 
The infant was so happy to have seen the lake. She felt so free and knew she would never forget it. She smiled and hugged her parents who had taken her on the special trip.
