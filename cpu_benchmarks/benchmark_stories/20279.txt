One day, a little dog named Max was walking near a track. He saw a big, red ball on the other side of the track. Max wanted to play with the ball, but he felt miserable because he couldn't get to it.
Max saw a boy named Tim near the track. Max said, "Help, please! Ball on other side, can't get it!" Tim wanted to help Max, so he looked around and saw a gate with a lock.
Tim said, "I can open the lock and get the ball for you, Max!" Tim opened the lock, went through the gate, and grabbed the big, red ball. He threw it to Max, who caught it with a big smile.
Max and Tim played with the ball near the track all day. They were both very happy and had lots of fun. When it was time to go home, Max said, "Thank you, Tim!" And they both went home, no longer feeling miserable.
