Once upon a time there was a girl who needed some new pants. She went to the ancient store to try to find some. It was a very old store and she was afraid to go in because it seemed so scary.
When she got inside, she found a nice lady who was happy to help her. The lady showed her lots of different pants, all very old and worn. The girl picked out the nicest pair she could find. 
The girl went outside and put on her new pants. She was so happy to have her new pants. She felt so special and grown up wearing them. Now she had what she needed!
