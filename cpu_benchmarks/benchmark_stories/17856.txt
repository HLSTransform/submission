Once upon a time there lived an elephant. He loved to eat healthy bananas every day. One day, he wanted to learn new words, so he went to the store to buy a dictionary. But when he opened it, he was so surprised to see all the small words inside that he couldn't help but laugh!
The elephant wanted to make the words bigger so he could read them, so he started stretching the dictionary. Suddenly, the dictionary began to shrink! The elephant was amazed and kept stretching it until all the words were back to their original size.
He was so happy with the results and he decided to read the dictionary every day to learn more new words. Not only did he get smarter, but also he became healthy by eating all the tasty bananas.
The elephant was very proud of himself and he was thankful to have such a magical dictionary.
