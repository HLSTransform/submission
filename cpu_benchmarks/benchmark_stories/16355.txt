Once upon a time, a young boy named Tim had a toy microphone. He loved to sing and talk into it all day. One day, his little sister, Sue, took the microphone when Tim was not looking.
"Hey, give it back!" said Tim. Sue just laughed and ran away with the microphone. Tim was very upset and did not know what to do.
Tim thought of an idea to get his microphone back. He found a big chair and said, "Sue, come seat here, it's fun!" Sue saw the chair and wanted to try it. She put the microphone down and climbed onto the chair.
While Sue was busy with the chair, Tim quickly took his microphone back. He said, "Now, we can share my microphone and have fun together!" Sue agreed, and they both sang and talked into the microphone, happy and smiling.
