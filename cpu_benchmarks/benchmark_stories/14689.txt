Once upon a time, there was a lonely prince who parted with his family. He was very sad, but he knew he had to go. He packed his things and headed out.
He traveled for many days and nights. Whenever he saw someone, he waved, but no one waved back. He was very lonely.
One day, he came across a large castle on the other side of the forest. He wanted to explore the castle, so he stepped inside. As soon as he did, he saw a small girl, with a bright smile, walking towards him.
The prince was so happy to see another person. The small girl showed the prince around the castle and they played together all day.
The prince had found a new friend. From that day on, the lonely prince never felt alone again.
