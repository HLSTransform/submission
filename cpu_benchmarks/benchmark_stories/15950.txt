Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Max. Max lived in a big field with his family and friends. One day, Max went on an adventure and got lost in a maze. He looked around and saw many paths, but didn't know which one to take. He started to frown and felt scared.
Suddenly, Max saw a peaceful butterfly flying by. The butterfly saw Max and asked what was wrong. Max explained that he was lost in the maze and didn't know how to get out. The butterfly said, "Don't worry, I'll help you find your way out." The butterfly led Max through the maze and they finally found the way out.
Max was so happy and grateful to the butterfly. He thanked the butterfly and went back to his family and friends. He told them all about his adventure and how he met a peaceful butterfly who helped him find his way out of the maze. From that day on, Max knew that even when things seemed hard, there was always someone who could help him.
