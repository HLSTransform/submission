John was a little boy with a pocket full of blue buttons. He showed them to his mom and she said that they were so pretty. But when John went to school, he put the buttons in his pocket and forgot all about them. 
After school, John was walking home when he saw his friend's toy car. He wanted it so badly but he remembered that he had no money. He thought about taking the buttons from his pocket, but knew it wasn't the right thing to do. He sadly had to walk away.
When he got home, John reached into his pocket and felt the buttons he had forgotten about. He knew he had made the wrong choice and he felt so sad. He wished he had been able to buy his friend's car, but he knew it was too late. He had a deep regret for not listening to his mom. 
John realized that his mom was right and he should always save his treasures. From that day on, John kept his buttons safe in a special box. He never wanted to make the same mistake again.
