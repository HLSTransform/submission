Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she found a dirty stray dog in her backyard. "Hi there, little pup. Do you want to come inside and sleep in my bed?" Lily asked the dog. The dog wagged its tail and followed Lily into her house.
Lily's mom was surprised to see a new furry friend in the house. "Who is this little guy?" she asked. "He's a stray dog I found outside. Can he sleep in my bed tonight?" Lily replied. "I don't know if that's a good idea, Lily. We don't know if he's clean or not. But, I'll lead him to the backyard and give him some food and water," her mom said.
After the dog ate and drank, he fell asleep in his new dog bed outside. Lily watched him sleep and said, "I'm glad we found you, little pup. You're not dirty anymore." The dog opened his eyes and licked Lily's hand. "Woof woof!" he barked, happy to have a new friend.
