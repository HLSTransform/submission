Once upon a time, there was a large hall. Inside the hall, there was a small boy. He was very happy and he was looking for something to give. The boy saw a large purple box and he decided to give it a try. He reached out to touch it, but he heard a loud voice.
The voice said, "Don't give me anything! If you do, something bad will happen to you."
The boy was scared and he quickly stepped away from the box. He felt a chill go down his spine. He started to back away, but then he heard the voice again.
"Give me something," said the voice.
The boy was frightened, but he reached out and grabbed the box. As soon as he did, the room began to shake. Suddenly, the walls started to collapse and the boy was trapped inside the large hall. Unfortunately, the boy was never seen again.
