Sara was a little girl who loved to play with her toys. She had a lot of toys, but her favorite was a teddy bear that could glow in the dark. She called him Glow Bear and hugged him every night before she slept.
One day, Sara went to the park with her mom and Glow Bear. She saw some other kids playing on the swings and slides. She wanted to join them, but she was shy. She held Glow Bear tightly and watched them from a bench.
A boy named Max saw Sara and her teddy bear. He thought Glow Bear looked cool and wanted to have it. He walked over to Sara and said, "Hey, can I see your bear?"
Sara shook her head and said, "No, this is my bear. Go away."
Max got angry and said, "Give me your bear, or I'll take it from you." He reached out his hand and tried to grab Glow Bear.
Sara screamed and pulled Glow Bear away. She felt scared and sad. She wished her mom would come and help her.
But then, something amazing happened. Glow Bear started to glow brightly, like a star. His eyes shone with a warm light. He said, "Don't be afraid, Sara. I'm here for you. You are brave and kind. You don't have to share me with anyone who is mean to you."
Sara felt a surge of courage and happiness. She hugged Glow Bear and said, "Thank you, Glow Bear. You are the best friend ever."
Max was stunned and scared. He saw Glow Bear's glowing eyes and heard his voice. He thought Glow Bear was a magic bear that could hurt him. He ran away, crying.
Sara's mom came and saw what happened. She praised Sara for standing up for herself and her toy. She said, "You did well, Sara. You should always cherish what you love and respect what others love. That's how you make true friends."
Sara smiled and nodded. She learned a valuable lesson that day. She and Glow Bear played happily in the park, and made some new friends who were nice and polite. She never felt miserable again.
