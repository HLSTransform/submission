One day, Sam and Lily went to the park with Mom. They saw a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. They wanted to play with everything.
Sam ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. He saw many shapes on the slide. There was a circle, a square, a triangle, and a star. He liked the star the best. He slid down the slide and shouted, "Whee!"
Lily followed Sam and climbed up the ladder too. She saw the shapes on the slide and smiled. She liked the circle the best. She slid down the slide and giggled, "Yay!"
Then, something funny happened. The shapes on the slide changed color. The circle became red, the square became blue, the triangle became yellow, and the star became green. Sam and Lily were surprised. They looked at each other and said, "Wow!"
They wanted to see what would happen next. They climbed up the ladder again and slid down the slide. The shapes changed color again. The circle became purple, the square became orange, the triangle became pink, and the star became brown. Sam and Lily were amazed. They looked at each other and said, "Cool!"
They had so much fun sliding and watching the shapes change color. They wondered who made the slide so magical. They thanked Mom for taking them to the park. They said, "We love the slide and the shapes!"
