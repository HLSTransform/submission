Once there was a big tree. It had lots of branches, and it was very tall. Because it was so tall, no one could tie anything to the top of it.
But there was a special saw. It could cut through the branches and make them shorter. Everyone was excited to see that the saw could do this.
The saw cut down the branches and made a rope to tie around the top of the tree. It was so much easier to tie to the top now because it was lower. Everyone cheered.
The tree was now beautiful. Everyone was so proud of it. The saw saved the day.
