Lily and Tom were friends. They liked to play with rocks and pages. They made shapes and pictures with rocks on pages. They had fun.
One day, Lily found a big rock. It was shiny and smooth. She liked it very much. She showed it to Tom.
"Look, Tom, I have a big rock. It is pretty. Do you want to see?" Lily said.
Tom looked at the rock. He wanted it. He was greedy.
"Give me the rock, Lily. It is mine. I saw it first." Tom said.
"No, Tom, it is mine. I found it. It is important to me." Lily said.
They fought over the rock. They pulled and pushed. They yelled and cried.
Then, the rock slipped from their hands. It fell on the ground. It broke into pieces.
Lily and Tom were sad. They looked at the broken rock. They looked at each other. They were sorry.
They lost the rock. They lost their fun. They lost their friendship.
