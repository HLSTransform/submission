One day, a little spider went out to play. He saw a wide tree with big branches. He thought, "I want to make my home here." So, he started to stretch his web from one branch to another.
As he was working, a bird came by and asked, "What are you doing, little spider?" The spider replied, "I am making my home on this wide tree." The bird said, "Be careful, the wind can blow very strong here."
The little spider did not listen to the bird. He kept stretching his web. Soon, his home was done. He was very happy. But then, the wind started to blow. The spider's home broke and fell down.
The little spider was sad. He remembered what the bird had said. He learned that it is important to listen to others. Next time, he would make his home in a safer place.
