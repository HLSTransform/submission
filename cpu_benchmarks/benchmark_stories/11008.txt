Lila and Tom were best friends. They liked to play in the park and look at the birds and flowers. One day, they saw a big hill with a sign that said "Do not climb". Lila wanted to climb the hill and see what was on the other side. Tom was scared and said no.
"Come on, Tom, it will be fun!" Lila whispered. "Maybe we will find a new land with magic and treasure. The sign is just for grown-ups who are boring and mean. We are brave and smart."
Tom did not think so. He thought Lila was foolish and did not listen to the rules. He did not want to get in trouble or get hurt. But he did not want to lose his friend either. He followed Lila as she ran to the hill and started to climb.
The hill was steep and slippery. Lila and Tom had to hold on to rocks and roots. They got dirty and tired. They heard a loud noise and looked up. It was a plane flying over the hill. Lila and Tom were scared and ducked. They did not know that the plane was just a toy that a boy was flying in the park.
They reached the top of the hill and looked around. They did not see a new land with magic and treasure. They only saw more hills and trees and houses. They felt sad and silly. They wished they had stayed in the park and played with the birds and flowers.
They decided to go back down the hill and say sorry to the sign. They hoped no one had seen them. They learned their lesson and never climbed the hill again. They were still best friends, but they were more careful and wise.
