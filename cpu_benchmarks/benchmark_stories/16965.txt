They play for a while. Then they see that the toys are dirty. They want to make them clean. They go to the sink and wash the toys. They use soap and water. They scrub and rinse. They make the toys shiny and nice.
They dry the toys with a towel. They look at them. They see that the doll has a pale face and the car has a pale color. They think that the soap and water made them pale. They are sad. They want the toys to have bright colors.
They go to their moms and show them the toys. They tell them what happened. Their moms smile and hug them. They tell them that the toys are not pale. They tell them that the toys have light colors. They tell them that light colors are also pretty.
