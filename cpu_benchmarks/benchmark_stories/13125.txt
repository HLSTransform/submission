Once there was a large object. It was so big and heavy that no one could manage it. All the people in the town tried and tried, but they were too small and weak.
Suddenly one day, a brave little boy ran to the object. He looked large and strong. He said he could manage the object. He grabbed the large object with his hands, lifted it up and put it in the right place. 
The people were delighted. They were so happy they clapped and cheered.
The little boy said, "I'm glad I could manage it". He beamed with pride and everyone smiled at him. 
From then on, the boy was known as the Hero in the town. He could manage anything!
