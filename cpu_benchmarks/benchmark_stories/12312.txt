Once there was a little girl. She was three years old and loved to explore. One day she went into the living room and noticed something. There was a big curtain in front of a window. She blinked her eyes curiously. 
The little girl reached out to touch it, but before she could, the curtain moved. Startled, she gasped and stepped back. Who was behind the curtain? Suddenly, a rude voice said, "Who's there?" 
The little girl trembled as she told the voice her name. But then a friendly face appeared and the girl smiled. It was her family's neighbour! It was nice to meet him and the little girl felt much better. 
The neighbour asked if she wanted to help him with the curtain. Together they moved it out of the way. The little girl was proud of herself for contributing. She smiled and blinked happily.
