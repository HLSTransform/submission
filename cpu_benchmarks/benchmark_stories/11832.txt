Sam was a very tired little boy. He had been playing outside all day. When it came time to go home, Sam started to cry. 
His mommy saw him and said, "Don't worry. I have something special for you at home." 
Sam stopped crying and was so excited. 
When they arrived at home mommy made him his favorite sandwich and gave it to him. Sam gobbled it up and was very happy. 
Mommies special surprise turned out to be something even better than a sandwich- an extra hour of playtime at the playground! Sam was so thrilled, he squealed with delight and hugged his mommy. 
Just like she promised, Sam was no longer tired and had plenty of energy to play at the playground.
