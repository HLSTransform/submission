Once upon a time, there was a little gray mouse named Max. Max loved to play in the fields and eat cheese. One day, Max found a shiny jewel on the ground. He picked it up and showed it to his friend, a little bird named Lily.
"Look, Lily! I found a pretty jewel!" Max said.
Lily flew down to take a closer look. "Wow, Max! That jewel is beautiful!" she said.
Max was so happy that he wanted to bite the jewel to see if it was real. But Lily stopped him. "Don't bite it, Max! You might break it," she warned.
Max listened to his friend and decided to keep the jewel safe in his little mouse hole. From that day on, Max and Lily would visit the jewel every day and admire its shiny beauty.
