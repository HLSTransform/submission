Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved the color purple and always wore a purple dress. One day, Lily's mommy told her they were going on a tour of the park. Lily was so excited!
As they walked around the park, Lily saw a big bell. Her mommy told her that if she rang the bell, something special would happen. Lily couldn't wait to ring the bell!
Finally, they arrived at the bell. Lily took a deep breath and rang it as hard as she could. Suddenly, the sky turned purple! Lily was amazed and her mommy smiled. She had known all along that ringing the bell would make the sky turn purple.
From that day on, Lily knew that sometimes things can be even more special than you expect them to be. She couldn't wait to go on another tour and see what other surprises were waiting for her.
