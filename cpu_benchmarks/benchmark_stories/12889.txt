Tommy was curious. He saw a cartoon playing on the tv, and he wanted to know what it was. He asked his mom, "What's that, Mommy?". She smiled and said, "That's a cartoon. It's a story, just for fun!". Tommy's eyes lit up, and he asked, "Can I watch it?". His mom nodded and said, "Yes, you can watch it, if you want".
Tommy watched the cartoon with joy. He smiled and laughed as he watched the characters in the cartoon. He was so happy. He felt like he could watch the cartoon forever. 
At the end of the cartoon, Tommy looked sad. He had really enjoyed watching it, and he wanted to know what would happen next. He asked his mom, "Can I see the next one?" His mom said, "I don't know, Tommy. We'll have to hope it will come on again soon". 
Tommy smiled and said, "Okay, Mommy. I hope it will come on again soon, too!".
