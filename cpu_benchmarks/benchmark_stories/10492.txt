Once upon a time, there was an olive. He wanted to go outside and play but he was afraid to because it was too noisy. He didn't want to go outside and be surrounded by the loud noises. 
So he stayed very still in his safe tree and just stayed there all day, but eventually he started to get very bored. He looked around and tried to think of something to do, and then he had an idea! 
He decided to use his mind and make something special! He thought and thought, and after some time, he had an idea. He started to imagine a soft, cozy place, and he kept using his mind to create it until it came to life. 
He had made a nest! It was nice and warm and safe, so he curled up into it and felt so happy. He was so proud of himself for using his mind and creating something so special. He stayed in his nest all day, listening to the noisy outside world, but feeling safe and warm inside his mind.
