Once there lived a little girl who was only three years old. She lived in a house with a big backyard. In that backyard was a giant tree with lots of leaves. Every morning, she liked to explore the backyard and every night she liked to watch the sky.
One morning, the little girl decided to be fancy. She put on her prettiest dress and found a pair of shoes with ribbons that would make her even more fancy.
The little girl stood under the tree in the backyard and began to cry, feeling so fancy that she couldn't help it. Suddenly a big yellow bird flew down and said, "Why are you crying?" The little girl said that she felt so fancy that she just had to cry.
The bird said, "Well that's okay! Everyone feels fancy sometimes." The little girl smiled and the bird flew away.
The little girl waved goodbye and went back inside the house to find something else to do with her fancy dress.
