Once there was an oak tree in a field. It was very strong and powerful. One day, a little girl came to the field. She couldn't help but to be curious about the oak tree. 
So, she went up to the tree and asked it, "Can you tell me about your life?" The oak tree was so wise that it knew the girl was special. 
The oak tree told the little girl about how it had seen the world around it change over the years. It hadn't moved, but it had seen the sun rise and set and it had seen the seasons come and go. 
The little girl was fascinated. She thanked the powerful oak tree for sharing its story and ran off to tell everyone she could about it. She will always remember the wise oak tree and its powerful stories.
