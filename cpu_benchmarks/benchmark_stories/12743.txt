Once upon a time, there was a house. It was an original house and it belonged to a family. One day, someone screamed in the house. It was a loud scream.
The mom ran to see what the noise was. She saw a little boy. He had had been crying because he wanted to play outside. So she took his hand and they both went out of the house.
Outside was full of animals, trees, flowers and nice things to play with. The little boy was so happy and he started to laugh. He was screaming and laughing and running around.
Mom was happy too. She saw her little one happy and content; it was the most beautiful thing in the world. So she let him play until his heart's content.
