Once upon a time, there was a powerful frog who lived in a small pond. The frog had a very sharp rock that he liked to sit on. One day, a little bird told the frog about a big pond far away. The frog wanted to go see the big pond, but he was scared to leave his small pond and sharp rock.
The frog thought and thought about the big pond. He knew that if he could find a way to take his sharp rock with him, he would feel safe. So, the powerful frog used his strong legs to push the sharp rock all the way to the big pond. It was hard work, but he did not give up.
When the powerful frog and his sharp rock finally made it to the big pond, he was so happy. He could swim and play in the big pond and still have his sharp rock to sit on. The frog learned that even though he was scared, he could do big things with his powerful legs and his sharp rock by his side.
