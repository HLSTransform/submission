Once upon a time, in a small garden, there was a little squash. The squash was very healthy and grew bigger every day. One day, a girl named Lily saw the squash and thought it would be perfect for her family's dinner. She knew she had to gather more things to make a big meal.
Lily went to the garden every day to see the squash grow. She knew it would be ready soon. She started to gather other things for the meal, like big green leaves and red round fruits. Lily was very excited about the dinner she was going to make.
Finally, the day came when the squash was big enough to pick. Lily gathered the squash, the big green leaves, and the red round fruits. She made a yummy dinner for her family. They all loved it and were very happy. The healthy squash made everyone feel good and strong.
