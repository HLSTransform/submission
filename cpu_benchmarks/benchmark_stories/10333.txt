Ben and Mia were playing on the beach. They liked to dig in the sand and look for shells. They saw a crab walking sideways near the water. It had big claws and a hard shell.
"Look, a crab!" Ben said. "Let's catch it!"
Mia was scared of the crab. She did not want to touch it. She said, "No, Ben, it might pinch us!"
Ben did not listen. He ran after the crab with a bucket. He tried to put the bucket over the crab, but the crab was too fast. It reversed and ran away from Ben.
"Come back, crab!" Ben shouted. He chased the crab again, but the crab was smarter. It hid under a rock and waited for Ben to go away.
Mia watched Ben and the crab. She thought they were both restless. She wished they would stop and sit with her. She said, "Ben, come here. Let's make a sandcastle instead."
Ben heard Mia. He looked at the crab and the bucket. He was tired of running. He said, "Okay, Mia. Let's make a sandcastle. Maybe the crab will come out later."
Ben and Mia went back to their spot. They used their shovels and pails to make a big sandcastle. They decorated it with shells and seaweed. They were happy and proud of their work.
The crab peeked out from under the rock. It saw the sandcastle. It thought it was pretty. It crawled out and walked towards it. It wanted to see it closer. It did not see Ben and Mia. They were behind the sandcastle. They saw the crab. They smiled and whispered, "Shh, look, the crab is back!"
