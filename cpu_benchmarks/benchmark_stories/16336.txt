Once upon a time, there was a nice little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and read books. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. While she was playing, a bird flew by and scared her. She tried to escape from the bird, but it was too fast.
Lily's friends saw what happened and asked her what was wrong. "I saw a bird and it scared me," said Lily. "Don't worry, Lily, we'll protect you," said her friend Tom. They all played together and had a nice time.
Later that day, Lily's mom asked her what she did at the park. "I played with my friends and we had a nice time," said Lily. "Did anything scary happen?" asked her mom. "Yes, a bird scared me, but my friends protected me," said Lily. Her mom gave her a hug and said, "You're a brave girl."
