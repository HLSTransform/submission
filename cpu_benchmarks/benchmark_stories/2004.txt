Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. She had long brown hair and big blue eyes. Every morning Sarah woke up early and knelt on the ground to say her prayers.
One day, when Sarah got down to pray, she noticed something in the distance. It was a white cow and she was mooing softly. Sarah knew it must have been looking for milk, so she ran inside to grab a bucket.
She filled the bucket and brought it back out. Kneeling down, she carefully poured milk into a saucer next to the cow. The cow was so happy that it mooed louder than ever before!
It was then that Sarah noticed a lady standing further away in the distance. She was wearing a long, white dress, with a big smile on her face. Thank you, Sarah!", the lady said, "That cow and I are very grateful". 
Sarah asked who the lady was, but the lady simply smiled and said, "A distant friend". Then she bowed and turned away.
Sarah never saw the mysterious lady again, but every day she would kneel to say her prayers, knowing that she helped a distant friend.
