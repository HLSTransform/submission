Once upon a time, there was a quiet little boat. The boat wanted to sail on a big tour. The boat was very excited.
One day, the boat started its tour. It sailed on the water. The boat went far away from home. The boat was very happy.
But then, the boat sailed into a big storm. The storm was very scary. The boat tried to sail back home, but the storm was too strong. The quiet little boat did not make it back home. The end.
