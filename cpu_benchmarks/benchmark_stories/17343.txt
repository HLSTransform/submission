Lily and Ben were excited to see the fireworks. They put on their warm coats and hats and went outside with Mom and Dad. They saw many people and cars on the street. They heard loud noises and saw bright colors in the sky.
"Wow, look at that one!" Ben said, pointing at a big red firework that exploded like a flower.
"It's so pretty!" Lily agreed, clapping her hands.
But then, a loud bang made them jump. A gray firework flew very close to them and made a scary sound. Lily and Ben felt afraid and hid behind Mom and Dad.
"Mommy, Daddy, what was that?" Lily asked, trembling.
"That was a firework that didn't work right," Mom explained, hugging them. "It was an accident. It's okay, we are safe."
"Are you sure?" Ben asked, peeking out.
"Yes, I'm sure," Dad said, smiling. "Look, the other fireworks are still going on. They are not scary, they are fun. Do you want to watch them?"
Lily and Ben nodded, feeling better. They held Mom and Dad's hands and watched the fireworks again. They saw blue, green, yellow, and pink fireworks. They oohed and aahed and forgot about the gray firework. They had a good time.
