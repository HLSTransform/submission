Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was scared of the dark, so he always brought his flashlight to bed. One night, Timmy heard a noise and shined his flashlight around his room. He saw a spider on the wall and yelled for his mom. 
His mom came in and asked what was wrong. Timmy pointed to the spider and his mom answered, "Don't worry, I'll take care of it." She grabbed a tissue and squished the spider. Timmy was happy that his mom helped him, but he was also embarrassed that he was scared of a little spider. 
His mom hugged him and said, "It's okay to be scared sometimes. We all get scared of things." Timmy felt better and went back to sleep with his flashlight by his side.
