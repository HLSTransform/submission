Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sally. She had long, golden hair and liked to play in the sunshine. One day, when she was playing in the garden, Sally noticed a ladybug on her shoulder.
Sally was so glad to see the little bug and wanted to take care of him. She carefully blew him onto her hand, then ran into the bathroom to get a cloth. 
She was determined to clean her shoulder properly, so she went over it very carefully. She smiled as she remembered her mom showing her how to clean things. 
Soon, Sally felt ready to put the ladybug back. She carefully put him onto her shoulder, and sat still for a moment. Then, she beamed as the ladybug quickly flew away. 
Sally was so glad that she had managed to take care of the ladybug. She ran off to play, feeling happy and content.
