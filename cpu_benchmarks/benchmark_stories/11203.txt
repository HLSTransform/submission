Once upon a time, there was a little bird who lived in a nest in a tree. The bird was very cheerful and flew around the garden, looking for food. One day, the little bird was very hungry and spotted something white and fluffy coming out of the tree.
The bird fluttered down and pecked at the white fluffy stuff. When he tasted it, he found it was delicious! He was eating steam!
"Yum!" the little bird said, as he enjoyed his treat.
Suddenly, a voice from above called out, "Little bird, what have you found?" It was a big owl who lived in the same tree.
"I'm eating steam!" the bird said, happily.
"Ah, how nice," the owl said with a smile. "Have a good meal and enjoy your day."
The little bird ate all the steam and flew off as happy as can be. Since then, he knew to look for steam if he was feeling a bit hungry.
