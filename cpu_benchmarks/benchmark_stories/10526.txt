Once upon a time, there was a big, friendly bear named Charlie. Charlie lived in a deep hole near a forest. One day, a little bird named Lizzie flew into Charlie's hole. She was so tiny and fast!
Charlie was very intelligent and he knew that the bird needed help. He asked her if she wanted to join him in the hole. Lizzie said yes and so Charlie and Lizzie joined together.
 
They became fast friends, and had lots of fun in the hole. They played games, compared nests and explored. As the days went by, their bond grew stronger. 
 
Before long, Charlie and Lizzie were best friends forever. And Charlie was so proud to have an intelligent friend like Lizzie!
