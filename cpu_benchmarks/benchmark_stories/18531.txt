Lily and Sam were at the park with their mom. They saw a vendor with a big cart of ice cream. Lily and Sam wanted ice cream very much. They asked their mom if they could have some.
"Mom, can we have ice cream, please?" Lily and Sam said.
"Not now, sweeties. We just had lunch. Maybe later, okay?" Mom said.
But Lily and Sam did not listen. They ignored their mom and ran to the vendor. They each grabbed an ice cream cone from the cart. The vendor was upset. He shouted at them.
"Hey, you have to pay for that! That's not nice! Come back here!" The vendor said.
Lily and Sam did not care. They licked their ice cream and ran away. They thought they were smart and funny. But they were not. They were rude and naughty.
Mom saw what they did. She was very angry. She caught up with them and took their ice cream away. She made them go back to the vendor and say sorry. She also made them give him some money. Lily and Sam felt ashamed. They learned their lesson. They should not ignore their mom and steal from the vendor. They should be polite and honest.
