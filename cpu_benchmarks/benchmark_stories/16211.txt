Mommy and Daddy were very excited. They had designed a special jeep for their son! He was so excited to see it and hopped in. "Wow!" he said. "It's so cool!" 
Mommy laughed. "It sure is!" She said. "We even added a horn so you could honk it!"
The little boy reached his hand towards the horn. "HONK!" he shouted, pressing the little button. 
He laughed and laughed. The sun was hot, but he felt so happy. Mommy and Daddy started the jeep and drove around the neighborhood. 
The little boy smiled. He felt so special, like the luckiest boy in the world!
