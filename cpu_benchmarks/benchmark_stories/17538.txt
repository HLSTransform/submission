Ben and Lily were best friends. They liked to play in the park, read books, and share snacks. One day, Ben had to move to a new house far away. He was sad and so was Lily.
"Will you write to me?" Ben asked Lily.
"Yes, I will. I will mail you letters and pictures. And you will mail me too, right?" Lily said.
"Of course. You are my loyal friend. I will never forget you," Ben said.
They hugged and said goodbye. Ben got in the car with his mom and dad and waved to Lily. Lily waved back and watched them drive away.
The next week, Lily got a letter from Ben. She was so happy. She opened it and saw a drawing of them in the park. Ben had written: "I miss you, Lily. You are my loyal friend. I hope you like my picture. Love, Ben."
Lily smiled and ran to her mom. "Look, mom, Ben mailed me a letter. He drew us in the park. He misses me," she said.
"That's very sweet, Lily. Do you want to mail him a letter back?" her mom asked.
"Yes, please. Can I draw him something too?" Lily asked.
"Sure. What do you want to draw?" her mom asked.
Lily thought for a moment. She remembered that Ben liked umbrellas. He had a blue one with stars on it. He always said it made him feel like he was in the sky. Lily decided to draw him an umbrella.
She got her crayons and paper and drew a big blue umbrella with stars. She wrote: "Hi, Ben. I miss you too. You are my loyal friend. I drew you an umbrella. I hope you like it. Love, Lily."
She put the letter in an envelope and gave it to her mom. "Can we mail it now?" she asked.
"Sure, honey. Let's go to the mailbox," her mom said.
They walked to the mailbox and Lily put her letter inside. She hoped Ben would get it soon and like her umbrella. She felt happy that she had a loyal friend like Ben.
