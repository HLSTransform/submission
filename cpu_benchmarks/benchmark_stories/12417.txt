Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jane. It was a very cold day and she was feeling chilly. She tried to warm herself up by wrapping her arms around her body and shivering. Suddenly she noticed something.
There was a shelter nearby. She ran to the shelter to find a warm and cozy place she could hide from the cold. She was so very happy to have found a warm place.
But then she noticed someone sharing the shelter with her. It was a hungry old dog, curled up in the corner, shaking from the cold.
"Oh! I'm sorry," Jane said and hugged the dog tight.
The dog looked up surprised and wagged its tail in response. It was happy to have a friend to share its shelter with.
Jane and the old dog hugged until they both felt warm again.
The moral of the story is that when we are in a warm, safe place, we should not forget about others who aren't as lucky. A kind act of sharing can help spread warmth and compassion in the world.
