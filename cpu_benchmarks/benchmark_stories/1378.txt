Bob was a player. Every day he ran, hopped, skipped and jumped. He was very fast and smooth.
One day, Bob wanted to pause. He stayed still and breathed slowly. All around him was quiet. He listened to the birds singing and felt the warm breeze on his face. It was very peaceful.
Suddenly, Bob heard something. It was coming from behind the big tree. He hopped to the tree and found what was making the noise. It was another player.
The two players greeted each other with a smile and began to play. They skipped and hopped around the tree. It was so much fun and felt so smooth! Bob was so happy to find a new friend.
When the game was over, the two players paused and hugged. Later, Bob went home with a big smile on his face.
