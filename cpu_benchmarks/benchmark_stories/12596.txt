Once upon a time, there was an elderly lady who loved to sit on a bench in the park. She would watch the children play and smile at them. One day, a little girl came to sit on the bench next to her. They started to talk and the elderly lady was happy to have a new friend.
As they talked, the little girl noticed that the bench was old and falling apart. She asked the lady if she knew why the bench was like that. The lady explained that many people had sat on the bench over the years and some had not taken care of it. They had left it dirty and broken.
The little girl understood and promised to take care of the bench from now on. She knew that it was important to take care of things that we share with others. And so, she cleaned the bench and made sure that no one would part it again. The elderly lady was proud of her new friend and they continued to sit on the bench together, enjoying the park and each other's company.
