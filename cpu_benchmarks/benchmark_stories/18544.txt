Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Teddy. Teddy was very lonely because he didn't have any friends to play with. One day, he looked at his calendar and saw that it was his birthday. Teddy got very excited and decided to have a party. He went to his forest friends and demanded that they come to his party. 
The animals were happy to come to Teddy's party because they wanted to make him happy. They brought him presents and sang him a birthday song. Teddy was so happy that he didn't feel lonely anymore. He realized that he didn't need to be alone because he had friends who loved him. From that day on, Teddy made sure to mark all his friends' birthdays on his calendar so he could throw them parties too.
