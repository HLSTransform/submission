Once upon a time, there was a funny little dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with his friends in the park. One day, Spot and his friend, a big cat named Whiskers, were playing when a mean dog came up to them.
The mean dog started barking and growling at Spot and Whiskers. Spot was scared and didn't know what to do. Whiskers, being a brave cat, stepped in front of Spot and used his shield to protect him from the mean dog.
Spot was so grateful to Whiskers for protecting him. "Thank you, Whiskers! You really care about me," said Spot. Whiskers just smiled and said, "Of course I do, Spot. You're my friend and I'll always protect you." From that day on, Spot and Whiskers were even better friends and always had fun playing together in the park.
