One Wednesday, Bill and his mom went to the store to get food. Bill looked in the grocery cart and noticed they only had sweet things like candy and ice cream. Bill wanted something sour.
He asked his mom, "I need something sour?" She said, "Yes, you do. Let's look around and see what we can find."
They looked in all the aisles, but they couldn't find anything sour. Finally, they went to the produce department and Bill saw it - a lemon! It looked juicy and sour.
Bill was so excited. He said to his mom, "I need that lemon." She smiled and said, "Ok then let's bring it home."
When they got home, Bill cut the lemon in half, squeezed the juice into a cup, and added a little sugar. Then he tasted it. It was sour and delicious!
From then on, Bill always remembered to get a lemon on Wednesday. He knew that sometimes he just needed something sour.
