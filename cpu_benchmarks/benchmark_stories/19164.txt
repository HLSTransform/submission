Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia had a cool room with many toys. One night, Mia saw a pretty candle on the table. The candle had a bright light that made her happy.
Mia wanted to touch the candle, but her mommy said, "No, Mia! It's hot!" Mia did not listen and touched the candle anyway. It was very hot, and Mia yelled, "Ouch!" Mommy came running and hugged Mia. She said, "I told you not to touch the candle, Mia. It can hurt you."
From that day, Mia learned to listen to her mommy. She knew that mommy was right and wanted to keep her safe. Mia never touched a candle again. The moral of the story is to always listen to your parents because they know what is best for you.
