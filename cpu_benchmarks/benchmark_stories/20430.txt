Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside in the sunshine, but one day the sky turned gloomy and dark. Suddenly, a big tornado came and started to lift everything up in the air! Lily was scared, but her mom picked her up and carried her to the basement. They stayed there until the tornado went away. When they came back outside, everything was a mess, but they were safe. From that day on, Lily was always careful when the sky looked gloomy and knew to go to the basement if a tornado came.
