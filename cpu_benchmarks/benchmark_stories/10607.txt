Once there was a little girl named Sally. She lived in a pretty house by the sea. One day, Sally put on her favorite sock - a yellow one with stars all over it. She went outside to play in the sunshine.
Suddenly, the wind blew and it got very cold. She started to shiver. She had forgotten to put on her coat! She quickly ran back inside, but she was still shivering. Her mom said, "It's not normal to be so cold, so let's get you warmed up with a nice cup of hot chocolate."
Sally sipped on the hot chocolate, and soon she was feeling much better. Her mom found her a cozy blanket to keep her warm. She put on some normal clothes, and then she was ready to go back outside and play in the sunshine again!
