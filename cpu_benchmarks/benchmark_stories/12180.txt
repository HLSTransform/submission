One day, Tom wanted to stretch his legs. He looked around the room and saw an ugly chair.
Tom thought, "I could stretch by sitting on that chair."
So he walked over, but as soon as he put his weight on the ugly chair, it broke into pieces!
Tom was shocked! "Why did this chair break?"
Suddenly, a voice spoke from behind him. It was Tom's mother. She said sternly, "It's because chairs aren't for stretching on, Tom. Now you have to go to your room and think about what you did."
Tom sadly walked away. He was so sad that he had broken the ugly chair and would now have to stay in his room all day.
