Lily and Tom were playing in the sand. They had a bucket and a spade. They wanted to make a big castle. They dug and piled and patted the sand. They made towers and walls and a door.
"Look at our castle!" Lily said. "It is so pretty!"
Tom nodded. He was proud of their work. He saw a shell on the sand. He picked it up and gave it to Lily. "This is for you," he said. "You are my friend."
Lily smiled. She liked the shell. It was shiny and smooth. She put it on the door of the castle. "Thank you, Tom," she said. "You are my friend too." She gave him a kiss on the cheek.
Tom blushed. He felt happy and shy. He kissed her back on the cheek.
Suddenly, they heard a loud bark. A big dog ran towards them. It was black and hairy. It had sharp teeth and a wet nose. It wanted to play, but it did not know how.
Lily and Tom were frightened. They dropped the bucket and the spade. They ran away from the dog. They hid behind a bench. They held each other's hands.
"Go away, dog!" Lily shouted. "Leave our castle alone!"
The dog did not listen. It jumped on the castle. It knocked down the towers and the walls. It bit the shell and the door. It wagged its tail and barked.
Lily and Tom were sad. They watched their castle fall apart. They cried and hugged each other.
A man came running. He was the dog's owner. He saw the mess and the children. He felt sorry and angry.
"Bad dog!" he scolded. "What have you done? Come here, now!"
He grabbed the dog by the collar. He apologized to Lily and Tom. He offered to help them rebuild their castle. He gave them a new bucket and a new spade.
Lily and Tom stopped crying. They forgave the man and the dog. They decided to give them another chance. They went back to the sand. They started to make a new castle. They hoped it would be bigger and prettier than before.
