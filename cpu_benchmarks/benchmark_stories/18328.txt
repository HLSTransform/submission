Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to play and run around all day long. But sometimes, Max didn't behave very well. He would bark and jump on people, and that wasn't very nice.
One day, Max's owner got some mail. It was a big package and it looked very exciting. Max wanted to play with it, but his owner said no. Max didn't behave very well and tried to grab the package. His owner said, "No, no, Max! That's not how we behave."
After a while, Max's owner opened the package and it was full of smelly socks. Max loved the smell and started to roll around in them. His owner laughed and said, "Oh Max, you're so silly!" Max was happy and didn't misbehave anymore.
