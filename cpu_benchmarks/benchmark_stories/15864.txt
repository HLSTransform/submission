Once upon a time, there was a little pig called Polly. Polly was feeling guilty because she hadn't done her test. She went to talk to her mum, who was in the garden.
"Mum, I didn't do my test," said Polly.
"Why not?" asked her mum.
"I was too scared," said Polly.
"It's ok," said mum. "I will help you get ready for the test. You can lean on me for support."
Polly felt a bit better after talking to her mum. She leaned on her mum and slowly made her way to school. When she arrived, she closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Polly opened the door to the classroom, ready to take the test. She was excited and a bit scared, but she was ready to do her best.
When the test was over, Polly felt relieved. She had done her best and she knew it. She leaned on her mum and together they went home together.
