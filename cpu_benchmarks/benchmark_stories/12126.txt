Once upon a time, there was a charming little girl named Lily. She loved to eat muffins and always asked her mommy to make her some.
One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. She saw a boy crying on the swing. She asked him, "Why are you crying?" The boy replied, "I lost my favorite toy car."
Lily felt sad for the boy and said, "Don't worry, I will help you find it." They searched the whole park but couldn't find the toy car. Lily then offered the boy her muffin to make him feel better.
The boy stopped crying and said, "Thank you, Lily. You are so kind." Lily smiled and said, "It's okay. I want to help my friends." As she walked home, she realized she lost her favorite bracelet. She started to cry and wished the boy was there to help her.
