Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy found a glove on the ground. He picked it up and waved it around to show his friends. They thought it was cool!
But then, Timmy's friend Billy wanted to play with the glove too. Timmy didn't want to share because he was feeling selfish. He didn't want Billy to touch his special glove. 
Timmy's other friend, Sarah, saw what was happening and told Timmy that he should share his glove with Billy. Timmy thought about it and realized that sharing was a good thing to do. He gave the glove to Billy and they all played together happily. The end.
