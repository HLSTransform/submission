Once upon a time there was a brave girl. She was always ready to try new things. One day, she decided to explore the woods. She ran and ran and soon found herself in a very wild area. The ground was rough and it was hard to move around.
The brave girl kept going until she arrived at a big wall made of logs. Behind it was a small house. She could see an old man inside. The old man looked very angry. He shouted at the brave girl and said she was breaking the law.
The brave girl was scared so she ran away. But she knew she had to go back. She was a brave girl so she made herself be brave and she went back to the house. When she returned, the old man was still angry. But this time, he listened to her carefully.
The brave girl told him that she was sorry and that she was alone in the woods. The old man was moved by the brave girl's courage and he decided to forgive her.
He told her that she needed to respect the law and be more careful from now on. The brave girl thanked him and promised to be more careful. The old man then let her go. The brave girl smiled and ran back home feeling very brave and happy.
