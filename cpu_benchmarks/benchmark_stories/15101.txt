Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very impatient. Her mom was trying to make a delicious meal that required a special ingredient, wine. But when mom went to the kitchen to get the wine, it was all gone!
The impatient little girl heard her mom calling, "Where is the wine?!" She remembered where her mom kept the wine so she quickly ran to the cabinet and opened the door. Inside she found one bottle of wine hidden away.
The mom was so surprised when she saw the bottle in her daughter's hands that she asked, "Where did you find the wine?"
The little girl proudly said, "I remembered!"
Mom smiled and said, "Thank you for helping me! Can you repeat what you said?"
The little girl smiled and repeated, "I remembered!" And mom thanked her again with a big hug.
