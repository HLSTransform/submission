Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and explore the world around him. One day, Timmy was playing with his toy car when he heard a loud noise coming from the ceiling.
"Mommy, what's that noise?" Timmy asked.
"I don't know, Timmy. Maybe it's just the wind," his mommy replied with a shrug.
But the noise didn't go away. It kept getting louder and louder. Timmy started to get scared.
"Mommy, I don't like this noise. It's too loud," Timmy said, his voice trembling.
"Don't worry, Timmy. I'll go check it out," his mommy said, giving him a reassuring smile.
She climbed up on a chair and looked at the ceiling. Suddenly, she saw a little mouse scurrying across the ceiling.
"It's just a mouse, Timmy. Nothing to be afraid of," she said, giving him another smile.
Timmy felt much better knowing what the noise was. He went back to playing with his toy car, happy and content.
