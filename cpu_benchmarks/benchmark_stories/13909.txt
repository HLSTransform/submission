Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim lived in a big country with lots of trees and animals. He liked to play outside and go for a jog every day.
One day, while jogging, Tim met a small, persistent dog. The dog followed Tim everywhere he went. Tim and the dog became good friends. They played and jogged together every day.
The dog was very happy to have Tim as a friend. Tim was happy too. They jogged and played in the big country together, and they were always there for each other. And they lived happily ever after.
