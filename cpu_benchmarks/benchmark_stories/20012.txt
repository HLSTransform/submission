Ben and Lily are friends. They like to play outside in the sunshine. They gather rocks, sticks and leaves to make a fort. They put the rocks in a circle, the sticks on top and the leaves on the roof.
"Look at our fort!" Ben says. "It is big and strong. We can hide inside and play games."
Lily nods. She likes the fort too. She has a funny idea. She picks up a flower and puts it on her head. She pretends to be a fairy.
"Hello, Ben!" she says in a high voice. "I am a fairy of the fort. I can do magic. Do you want a wish?"
Ben laughs. He thinks Lily is funny. He plays along. He pretends to be a knight.
"Hello, fairy!" he says in a low voice. "I am a knight of the fort. I can protect you from dragons. Yes, I want a wish. I wish for more sunshine and more fun."
Lily waves her flower. She says some silly words. She makes a sound like a bell.
"Ding, ding, ding! Your wish is granted!" she says. "The sun will shine and we will have fun. Come, let us play some more."
Ben and Lily smile. They hug each other. They are happy. They have a lot of sunshine and a lot of fun. They love their fort and their friendship.
