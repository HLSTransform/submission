Ben and Mia like to play pretend. They have a big box that they use as a boat. They put on hats and coats and say they are hunters. They look for animals in the water and on the land.
One day, they see a large shadow in the water. It is a whale! Ben and Mia are excited. They grab their binoculars and watch the whale. The whale makes a loud sound and splashes water with its tail. Ben and Mia pretend they are talking to the whale. They say hello and ask its name.
The whale hears them and comes closer to the boat. It is friendly and curious. It looks at Ben and Mia with its big eye. Ben and Mia are not afraid. They smile and wave at the whale. They tell the whale their names and ask if it wants to play.
The whale nods and says yes. It invites Ben and Mia to follow it. It shows them other animals in the water, like dolphins, seals and fish. Ben and Mia have fun. They pretend they are hunters, but they do not hurt the animals. They only watch and learn.
The whale takes them to a beautiful island. It says goodbye and thanks them for being nice. Ben and Mia thank the whale and say they hope to see it again. They get off the boat and explore the island. They find flowers, fruits and birds. They pretend they are living on the island. They have a picnic and sing songs. They are happy. They love to play pretend.
