Ben and Mia were at the beach with their mom and dad. They liked to play in the sand and splash in the water. They saw many things in the sea, like fish and crabs and shells.
One day, they saw something very big and gray in the water. It was a whale! The whale came close to the shore and made a loud noise. Ben and Mia were scared and ran to their mom and dad.
"Mom, dad, look! A whale!" Ben shouted.
"Don't worry, it's a friendly whale. It just wants to say hello," mom said.
"Hello, whale!" Mia said. She waved her hand at the whale.
The whale waved its tail back at Mia. It made another loud noise and sprayed water from its nose. Ben and Mia laughed. They thought the whale was silly and fun.
They watched the whale for a long time, until it swam away. They said goodbye to the whale and thanked it for the show.
"Can we see the whale again, mom?" Ben asked.
"Maybe, if we come back to the beach another day. But you can always remember the whale in your mind and in your heart," mom said.
Ben and Mia nodded. They remembered the whale and how silly and fun it was. They smiled and hugged their mom and dad. They had a great day at the beach.
