Once upon a time, there was a lizard who wanted to go sailing. He had never sailed before and he was a bit scared. So, he asked his friends for help. His friends said that he should be modest and that he could find a boat to use.
The brave little lizard searched and searched until he finally found a boat that was just the right size. It was bright yellow and had one sail. He quickly jumped inside and was ready to sail.
He pulled the sail up high so he could move faster. He felt the wind on his face and he was so excited. He smiled and the boat took him faster and farther. He felt free and happy and the boat brought him all around the lake.
Finally, the little lizard sailed back to where he started. He was very proud of himself. He had sailed all on his own and he felt brave and adventurous. So, the little lizard went on more sailing adventures and he became an expert sailor.
