Once upon a time, there was a big snowman. He was enormous and had a carrot nose and coal for eyes. One day, the sun came out and it got warm. The snowman started to melt! His nose fell off and his eyes disappeared. 
As the snowman melted, he started to get smaller and smaller. He knew that he would soon pass away. But then, something amazing happened! The snowman's melted body turned into water and flowed into a nearby river. 
The water carried the snowman's melted body downstream until it reached the ocean. The ocean was so big and blue, and the snowman's water body was now a part of it. Even though the snowman had melted away, he was still a part of something great and beautiful.
