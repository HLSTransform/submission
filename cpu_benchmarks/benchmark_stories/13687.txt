Lily likes hockey. She wants to learn how to play. She asks her dad to teach her. Her dad says yes. He takes her to the park with a stick and a ball.
They find a clear spot on the grass. Her dad shows her how to hold the stick and hit the ball. Lily tries to do the same. But it is hard. She misses the ball many times. She gets frustrated. She says, "I can't do it. Hockey is too hard."
Her dad hugs her and says, "Don't give up, Lily. You can do it. Hockey is fun. You just need to practice. Let me help you." He holds her hand and guides her stick. Together, they hit the ball. Lily smiles. She says, "I did it. Hockey is fun. Thank you, dad."
They play some more. Lily learns how to hit the ball better. She has fun. She says, "I like hockey. I want to play more. Can we come back tomorrow?"
Her dad says, "Sure, Lily. We can come back tomorrow. I'm proud of you. You learned something new today. You are a good hockey player." He gives her a high five. They go home happy.
