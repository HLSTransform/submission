Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to spend time with his family. One day, they went to the airport to fly to a faraway place for a vacation. Tim was very excited because he had never been on a plane before.
At the airport, Tim saw many big planes and lots of people. His mom bought him a yummy snack. It was a big, soft pretzel. Tim shared his yummy snack with his little sister, Sue. They both enjoyed it very much. Tim felt happy that he shared with his sister.
On the plane, Tim and Sue sat next to each other. They played games and looked out the window at the clouds. When they got to their vacation spot, they had lots of fun together. Tim learned that sharing and spending time with family makes everyone happy. And that was the best part of their trip.
