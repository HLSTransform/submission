Once upon a time there was a squirrel who lived in the woods. He was fit and strong and he loved the forest. He was often seen scurrying around the trees and frolicking in the meadow.
One day, he saw something he had never seen before - a school. He watched the children playing and enjoying themselves and wondered what was going on.
The next day, the squirrel found his way inside and saw the children learning. He was curious, so he decided to stay and learn too. The children taught him all kinds of things, like how to read and write, and he was getting smarter every day.
The squirrel soon became the best student in the entire school. He amazed all the other children with his knowledge and they were very proud.
The squirrel had become fit and clever. He had learned all kinds of new things and he had made a lot of friends. He was so happy that he decided to stay in the school and learn even more.
