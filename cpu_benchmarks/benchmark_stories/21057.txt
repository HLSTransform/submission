Tim and Lily are twins who like to play in the park. They like to swing, run, and slide on the big slide. One day, they see a small mouse near the slide. The mouse is dirty and has a long tail.
"Look, a mouse!" Tim says. He wants to touch the mouse.
"No, Tim, don't touch it!" Lily says. She is afraid of the mouse. "It is dirty and it can bite you!"
But Tim does not listen to Lily. He runs to the mouse and tries to catch it. The mouse is scared and runs away. It runs up the slide and hides at the top.
Tim follows the mouse and climbs the slide. He reaches the top and sees the mouse. He smiles and reaches his hand to grab it.
But the mouse is clever and fast. It jumps over Tim's hand and slides down the slide. Tim loses his balance and slides down too. He slides very fast and bumps into Lily, who is waiting at the bottom.
"Ouch!" Tim and Lily say. They fall on the grass and rub their heads.
The mouse runs away and finds a hole in the fence. It is safe and happy.
Tim and Lily look at each other and start to laugh. They are not hurt, just dirty and silly.
They hug each other and say, "We are sorry, mouse. We won't bother you again."
They go back to their mom, who is sitting on a bench. She sees them and says, "What happened to you? You are so dirty!"
Tim and Lily tell her their story. She shakes her head and smiles. She says, "You are very brave, but also very naughty. Next time, be careful and listen to your sister. Now, let's go home and have a bath."
Tim and Lily nod and hold their mom's hand. They walk home and say goodbye to the park and the mouse. They learned their lesson and had fun.
