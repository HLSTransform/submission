Once upon a time, there was a big lion. He lived in the jungle with his friends. The lion was very strong and he liked to roar loudly. His friends would always run away when he roared.
One day, the lion saw a comb on the ground. He picked it up and started to comb his fur. His fur became very soft and shiny. His friends were surprised to see how beautiful he looked.
The lion was very fair and kind to his friends. He shared his food with them and played games with them. They all loved the lion very much and they were happy to have him as their friend.
