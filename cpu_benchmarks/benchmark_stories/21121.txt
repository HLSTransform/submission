One day, a little boy named Tim found a small, unknown beetle in his yard. The beetle was black and shiny. Tim was very happy to see the beetle. He wanted to show it to his friend, Lily. So, he decided to carry the beetle to her house.
When Tim got to Lily's house, he said, "Look, Lily! I found a beetle! It is small and unknown." Lily looked at the beetle and said, "Wow, Tim! It is so pretty. Can I carry it too?" Tim said, "Yes, but be careful. We don't want to hurt the beetle."
Together, Tim and Lily carried the beetle to a big tree. They put the beetle on a leaf and watched it crawl away. They felt happy to have found a new friend. From that day on, Tim and Lily loved to look for unknown beetles and carry them to the big tree.
