Once upon a time there was a dog called Spot. Spot was his name because he had a round spot on his back. Spot loved playing with a girl. Every day the girl would give Spot a mineral. Spot however wasn't so sure about the minerals so he took his time to accept them. 
One day the girl said, "Spot, I have an easy way for you to accept the mineral." Spot wondered what the easy way was and the girl said, "If you just close your eyes and take a deep breath, the mineral will be easy to accept." 
Spot did as the girl said, closed his eyes and took a deep breath, and just like that, he accepted the mineral. He was so happy and excited, he even began to smile. From that day on, Spot would accept the minerals without any trouble at all. 
The end.
