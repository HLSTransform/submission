Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big, tough dog named Max. Max loved to play fetch with Lily and they would laugh together when Max brought back the ball. 
One day, Lily's mom forgot to set the alarm and they overslept. Lily was sad because she thought she would be late for school. But Max barked loudly and woke everyone up! Lily was happy and hugged Max, thanking him for being such a good alarm.
At school, Lily's friends were playing a game of tag. Lily was "it" and she chased her friends around the playground. When she finally caught them, they all fell down and laughed together. Lily thought it was the best day ever, thanks to Max and her friends.
