Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play outside. One day, they see a big truck on the road. The truck has many boxes. Lily and Tom are nosy. They want to see what is in the boxes.
They run to the truck. But they do not look at the traffic. The traffic is fast and loud. A car honks at them. Lily and Tom are scared. They try to go back. But Lily slips on a banana peel. She falls down. Tom helps her up. They are both dirty and sad.
The truck driver sees them. He is angry. He yells at them. He tells them to stay away from his truck. He says the boxes are not for them. He says they are for the zoo. He says the boxes have animals inside. Lily and Tom are curious. They want to see the animals. But they also know they are in trouble. They say sorry to the truck driver. They run back to their house. They hope the truck driver will not tell their mom.
