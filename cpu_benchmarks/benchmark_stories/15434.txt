Once upon a time, Jack and Jill were walking down the street. Then, out of nowhere, Jill tripped on a rail and went tumbling to the ground. Jack ran over to help her, but Jill was so sad that she started to cry.
Jack put his arm around Jill and said, "It's okay! I forgive you." Jill stopped crying and thanked Jack. She stopped feeling so sad and hugged him tightly.
They continued walking, but they were both still a bit shaken. When they looked down the street, they saw a thin, old man. He was wearing an oversized coat and was walking slowly with a cane. He looked like he had seen a lot in his life.
Jack said, "Let's forgive him too." Everyone has something in their lives that happened to them, so it's important to try to forgive each other. Jill smiled, and they waved to the old man. He smiled back, happy to be forgiven.
