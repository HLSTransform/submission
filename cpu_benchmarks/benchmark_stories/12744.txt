Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Clara. She was very excited to have her snack. Clara always loved her snacks.
One day, Clara woke up and asked her mom for a snack. However, her mom said no. Clara was very upset. 
"Mommy, why can't I have a snack?" Clara asked sadly.
"Because you haven't finished your dinner yet," her mom replied.
Clara didn't understand. She thought that snack time was right now. She began to cry.
"I want to have a snack! Please mom," she said in between sobs.
Her mom hugged her and said, "It's alright, Clara. Eating a snack too early is not good for you. Soon you will understand why."
Clara hugged her mom tightly, understanding a little better. She waited patiently with her mom until it was the right time for her snack.
