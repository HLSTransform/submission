Anna likes to play with her hoop. She can roll it, spin it, and jump through it. She has a big hoop that is red and yellow. She likes to mark it with her crayons. She makes dots, lines, and shapes on it.
One day, she takes her hoop to the park. She sees a boy with a small hoop that is blue and green. He also likes to mark it with his crayons. He makes stars, circles, and letters on it.
"Hi, I am Anna. Can I see your hoop?" she asks.
"Hi, I am Ben. Sure, you can see my hoop. Can I see yours?" he says.
They swap hoops and look at each other's marks. They like what they see. They smile and laugh.
"Your hoop is big and pretty. I like your shapes," Ben says.
"Your hoop is small and nice. I like your stars," Anna says.
They decide to play together. They roll, spin, and jump with their hoops. They make more marks on them. They have fun. They are friends.
