The little girl was feeling excited as she ran towards the lemonade stand with her mom. She had heard there was a band playing and she wanted to dance.
When they arrived, there was a crowd of people gathered around. Her mom said it was because there was a wise man at the stand.
The wise man was counting the money and making sure everyone got what they wanted. He was the one that started the band!
The little girl wanted to join in the fun, so she asked her mom if she could join the band. Her mom agreed and helped her find a place to sit. 
The wise man saw her and asked her to count the money everyone was giving him. The little girl couldn't believe it, she was so happy! 
She started slowly at first but she soon got the hang of it. The little girl and the wise man smiled at each other as they both knew she did a great job counting. 
At the end of the day, the little girl was exhausted but she was proud to have been part of the band and to have helped the wise man count the money.
