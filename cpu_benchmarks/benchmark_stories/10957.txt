Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big, harmless dog named Bow. Bow was very kind and loved to play with Lily. They were best friends.
One day, Lily and Bow went to a party. At the party, Lily saw a big box with a pretty wrap on it. She wanted to open it, but she knew she had to wait. Bow saw the box too and wagged his tail.
When it was time to open the box, Lily and Bow went to it. Lily pulled the wrap off and found a fun toy inside. Bow jumped up and down, happy for his friend. They played with the toy together and had lots of fun at the party.
