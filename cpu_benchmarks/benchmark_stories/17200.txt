Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine with her friends. One day, Lily's mommy told her that she needed to wear a mask to protect herself from germs. 
Lily didn't like the mask because it covered her nose and mouth, but her mommy explained that it was important to stay healthy. She showed Lily how to put on the mask and made sure it fit properly. 
Lily's friends also wore masks, and they all played together while staying safe. They played games and had fun, but they made sure to keep their masks on. 
Lily realized that the mask was harmless and helped her stay healthy. She was grateful for her mommy's advice to protect herself and her friends. From then on, Lily always wore her mask when she played outside with her friends.
