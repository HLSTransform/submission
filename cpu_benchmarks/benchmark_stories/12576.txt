Tom was a bald boy who liked to eat a lot. He ate bread, cheese, fruit, meat, and cake. He ate more than his mom and dad and his sister Ann. He ate so much that he became very big and round.
One day, he saw a shiny silver spoon on the table. He thought it was candy and he wanted to eat it. He grabbed the spoon and put it in his mouth. But it was not candy. It was hard and cold and bitter. He tried to spit it out, but it was stuck. He cried and cried.
His mom and dad and his sister Ann heard him and came to see what was wrong. They saw the spoon in his mouth and they were scared. They tried to pull it out, but it was too tight. They called the doctor to help.
The doctor came and looked at Tom. He said, "You are very silly, Tom. You cannot eat a spoon. It is not food. It is metal. It can hurt your teeth and your tummy. You have to be careful what you eat. You have to eat only good things that are good for you. And you have to eat less, or you will get sick."
The doctor used a tool to take out the spoon. It hurt a little, but Tom was glad to be free. He said, "I'm sorry, doctor. I'm sorry, mom and dad and Ann. I was greedy and foolish. I will not eat spoons or anything else that is not food. I will eat only good things and I will eat less. I want to be healthy and happy."
The doctor smiled and said, "That's good, Tom. I'm proud of you. You learned a lesson today. Eating is good, but too much eating is bad. And you have to eat the right things, not the wrong things. Remember that, and you will grow up strong and smart."
Tom nodded and hugged his mom and dad and his sister Ann. He thanked the doctor and said goodbye. He went to his room and looked at his toys. He saw a silver car and a silver robot. He liked them, but he did not want to eat them. He played with them instead. He was happy. He learned to be careful and wise.
