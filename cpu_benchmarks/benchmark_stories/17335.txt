Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to do yoga with her mommy. They would stretch and move their bodies in the light of the sun. One day, Lily accidentally tore her favorite shirt while doing yoga. She was sad, but her mommy told her that it was okay and they could sew it back together. So, they got out a needle and thread and fixed the tear. Lily was happy again and they continued to do yoga in the light. The end.
