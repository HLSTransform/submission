Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Yesterday, she went to the park with her mom. They played on the swings and went down the slide. Lily's mom noticed that Lily seemed troubled and asked her what was wrong.
Lily said, "I can't find my favorite toy. It's lost!"
Her mom replied, "Don't worry, we will look for it and hopefully gain it back."
They searched the park and finally found the toy under a tree. Lily was so happy to have her toy back and said, "Thank you, Mommy! You always make things better."
