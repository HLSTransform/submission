Once upon a time, there was a reindeer named Rudolph. He had a red nose that shone bright at night. One day, Rudolph went for a walk in the forest. He saw a mysterious shadow behind the trees. Rudolph was scared, but he wanted to see what it was. 
When he got closer, he saw two other reindeer fighting. They were angry and making loud noises. Rudolph knew he had to do something to help. He used his strong antlers to stop the fight. The two reindeer stopped and looked at Rudolph. 
"Thank you for stopping us," they said. "We were fighting over who gets to eat the best grass." Rudolph smiled and said, "There's enough grass for everyone. Let's share!" From that day on, the three reindeer were friends and always shared their food.
