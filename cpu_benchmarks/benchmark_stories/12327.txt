Once upon a time there was a loyal cat named Felix. He lived with a family of five. Every night at dinner, Felix would sit at the table and wait for his dish.
One night Felix sat down, waiting for his dish and he heard the family talking.
Mama said: "I can't believe we never have leftovers anymore."
Papa replied: "I know, it must be because of Felix."
Mama smiled: "Yes, he is so loyal he eats everything we give him."
The family laughed and then Papa brought Felix his dish. Felix ate it up and licked his plate clean.
The family was so thankful to have such a loyal cat. From then on they made sure to leave him special treats after dinner. Felix was always loyal and happy to have his dish.
