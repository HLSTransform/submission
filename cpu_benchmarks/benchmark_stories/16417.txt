Anna liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Lily. Lily had a pink skirt and long hair. Anna liked to brush Lily's hair and make her dance.
One day, Anna's mom said, "We are going to the park, Anna. Do you want to bring Lily with you?"
"Yes, please, Mom," Anna said. "Lily likes the park too."
Anna put Lily in her backpack and went to the park with her mom. There were many children there. Some were playing on the swings, some were sliding on the slide, and some were running on the grass.
Anna saw a big tree with a bench under it. She thought it was a good place to play with Lily. She took Lily out of her backpack and put her on the bench. She said, "Lily, you can sit here and watch me play. I will be back soon. Don't go anywhere, okay?"
Lily nodded. She was a good doll. She liked to mind Anna.
Anna ran to the slide and waited for her turn. She saw a boy with a red hat and a blue shirt. He was holding a toy car. He looked at Anna and smiled. He said, "Hi, I'm Ben. Do you want to play with me?"
Anna smiled back. She said, "Hi, I'm Anna. Sure, I want to play with you. What is your toy?"
Ben showed her his toy car. He said, "This is my car. It can go fast and make noises. Do you want to try it?"
Anna nodded. She liked cars. She said, "Yes, please. Can I see it?"
Ben gave her his car. He said, "Here you go. Be careful, though. It's my favorite toy."
Anna took the car and pressed a button. The car made a loud noise and zoomed away. Anna laughed. She said, "Wow, this is fun. Thank you, Ben."
Ben laughed too. He said, "You're welcome, Anna. Do you have a toy too?"
Anna remembered Lily. She said, "Yes, I have a doll. She's on the bench under the tree. Do you want to see her?"
Ben nodded. He liked dolls. He said, "Yes, please. Can we go to the bench?"
Anna agreed. She said, "Okay, let's go. But we have to bring your car back. It's your favorite toy."
Ben nodded. He said, "Okay, let's go. But we have to be quick. I don't want to lose my car."
They ran to the bench. But when they got there, they saw something bad. Lily was gone. Anna gasped. She said, "Oh no, where is Lily? She was here. I left her here. Who took her?"
Ben looked around. He saw a girl with a yellow dress and a green bow. She was holding Lily. She was pulling Lily's hair and tearing Lily's skirt. She was not nice. She said, "Look at this doll. She's ugly. She has a pink skirt and long hair. I don't like her. I'm going to throw her away."
Anna felt sad and angry. She said, "Hey, that's my doll. That's Lily. Give her back. She's my favorite toy."
The girl looked at Anna and Ben. She said, "No, she's mine now. I found her on the bench. She was open. You can't have her. Go away."
Anna said, "No, she's not yours. She's mine. I put her on the bench. She was minding me. You can't take her. She's not open. She's mine."
The girl said, "No, she's not. She's mine. I don't care. I don't like her. I'm going to throw her away."
She lifted Lily and threw her in the air. Lily flew over the fence and landed on the road. A big truck was coming. It was going to hit Lily.
Anna screamed. She said, "Lily, no!"
Ben acted fast. He ran to the fence and climbed over it. He ran to the road and grabbed Lily. He saved her. He brought her back to Anna. He said, "Here, Anna. Here's Lily. She's okay. I got her."
Anna hugged Lily. She said, "Thank you, Ben. Thank you so much. You're a hero. You saved Lily. You're my friend."
Ben smiled. He said, "You're welcome, Anna. You're my friend too. I'm glad Lily is okay. She's a nice doll. She has a pink skirt and long hair. I like her."
Anna smiled too. She said, "Thank you
