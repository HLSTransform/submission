Once upon a time, there was a big house with a garden. One day, a family went on a tour to see the house. They saw the flowers and the trees and they liked it a lot. But the family was ignorant about the house's history. They did not know that it was built a long time ago.
The tour guide told them about the house and its parts. He showed them the rooms and the furniture. They saw the kitchen and the bedroom. The family was happy to learn new things. They did not feel ignorant anymore.
After the tour, the family went back to their own home. They talked about the house they saw and how much they liked it. The little girl in the family said, "I want to go back and see the pretty flowers again." And so, they planned to go back on another tour soon.
