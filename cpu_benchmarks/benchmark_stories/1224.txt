Once upon a time, there was a cheerful pig named Piggie. Piggie loved to play in the mud and eat apples. One day, Piggie's friend Cow came to visit. 
"Hi Piggie!" said Cow. "What are you doing?"
"I'm playing in the mud," said Piggie. "Do you want to play too?"
Cow shook her head. "No, thank you. I don't like to get dirty."
Piggie laughed. "That's okay. I'll cover myself in mud and you can watch!"
Cow watched as Piggie rolled around in the mud. She giggled and said, "You look silly, Piggie."
Piggie smiled. "I know, but it's fun!" 
Cow and Piggie played together all day, and even though Cow didn't want to get dirty, she still had a great time with her cheerful friend.
