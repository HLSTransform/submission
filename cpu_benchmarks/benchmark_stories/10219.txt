Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with his ball and run in the park. One day, Spot saw a big tree. He decided to dig under the tree to find a treat.
Spot dug and dug until he found something useful. It was a big, shiny bone. Spot was very happy with his treat. He wagged his tail and barked with joy.
Spot took his treat back to his house. He showed his bone to his friends. They all wanted to play with the useful bone. Spot shared his treat and they all had a fun day playing together.
