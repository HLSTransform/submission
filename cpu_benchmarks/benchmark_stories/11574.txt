Once upon a time, there was a helpful little dog named Buddy. Buddy loved to play with his group of friends in the park. They would run, jump, and laugh all day long.
One sunny day, while they were playing, Buddy's best friend, a little girl named Lily, fell down and hurt her knee. She started to cry. Buddy ran to her side and said, "Don't cry, Lily. I will help you." 
Buddy gently kissed Lily's knee, and the pain went away. Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, Buddy. You are so helpful!" They hugged and continued to play with their group of friends, happy and full of love.
