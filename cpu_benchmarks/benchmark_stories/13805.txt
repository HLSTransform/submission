Sara and Tom were twins. They liked to play with their toys and books. One day, their mom said, "We are going to the store. Do you want to come with me?"
Sara and Tom said, "Yes, yes, yes!" They put on their coats and shoes and got in the car. Mom drove them to the store. It was a big store with many things.
Sara and Tom saw a lot of light in the store. They saw light from the sun, light from the lamps, light from the TVs, and light from the toys. They said, "Wow, this store is amazing!"
Mom said, "You can each pick one thing to buy. What do you want?" Sara and Tom looked around. They saw many things they liked. Sara saw a doll with a pink dress and a hat. Tom saw a truck with big wheels and a horn.
Sara and Tom ran to the things they wanted. They said, "Mom, mom, look! We want these!" Mom smiled and said, "OK, let's go pay for them." She took the doll and the truck and went to the cashier. The cashier scanned the things and said, "That will be ten dollars, please."
Mom gave the cashier ten dollars and got a receipt. She said, "Thank you, have a nice day." The cashier said, "You're welcome, bye-bye." Mom gave Sara and Tom their things and said, "Are you happy?" Sara and Tom said, "Yes, yes, yes! Thank you, mom!"
They hugged mom and got in the car. They played with their things on the way home. They said, "This was an amazing day!" Mom said, "I'm glad you had fun. I love you, Sara and Tom." Sara and Tom said, "We love you, mom!" They smiled and hugged their things. They were very happy.
