Once there was a little girl named Lisa. She was just three years old. One day, she woke up and it was very cold outside. She shivered in her bed and then she got out. She put on her boots, coat and a hat.
She stepped outside and the wind was blowing hard. She shivered even more and her teeth were chattering.
“Why it’s so cold today?” she said to herself.
Then she saw her mom and said, “Mommy, why it’s so cold?”
“Well, because it’s winter sweetheart,” said her mom as she hugged her tight.
Suddenly, Lisa felt a bit better and was no longer shivering. She went inside for a cup of milk.
“Mmm, this milk is so yummy,” she said as warm milk ran down her chin.
But then Lisa heard a loud noise outside and it scared her. She shivered again, but this time it was because of the terrible noise.
“What was that?” she asked her mom.
Her mom hugged her again and said, “It was just the wind my sweetheart. Don’t worry, there’s nothing to be scared of.”
Lisa felt better and finished her milk with a smile on her face
