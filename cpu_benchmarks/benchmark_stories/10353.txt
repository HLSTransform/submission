Tim and Anna were playing in the park with their dog, Spot. They liked to run, jump, and slide on the grass and the swings. Spot liked to chase the birds and the squirrels.
"Look, Tim, there is a man with a whistle!" Anna said, pointing to a man in a blue shirt and a hat. He was blowing his whistle and waving his arms.
"What is he doing?" Tim asked, curious.
"He is a referee. He is in charge of the game. He tells the players when to start and stop and when they break the rules," Anna explained. She had learned about referees from her dad, who liked to watch soccer on TV.
"Can we watch the game?" Tim asked.
"Sure, let's go closer," Anna said. They held hands and walked towards the field, where two teams of boys and girls were kicking a ball.
They sat on the grass and watched the game. Spot lay down next to them and wagged his tail. The game was fast and fun. The players ran, passed, and shot the ball. Sometimes they scored, and sometimes they missed. The referee blew his whistle and shouted things like "offside", "foul", and "penalty".
"Wow, this is exciting!" Tim said.
"I like the red team. They are good," Anna said.
"I like the yellow team. They are compassionate," Tim said.
"Compassionate? What does that mean?" Anna asked.
"It means they are nice and kind. They help each other and they don't hurt the other team. They say sorry when they make a mistake. They share their water and their snacks. They taste good," Tim said.
"They taste good? How do you know?" Anna asked, surprised.
"Because I tasted one," Tim said, smiling.
"You tasted one? When? How?" Anna asked, shocked.
"When we came here, I saw a girl from the yellow team sitting on the bench. She had a cut on her knee and she was crying. I felt sorry for her, so I went to her and gave her a hug. Then I licked her knee to make it better. She stopped crying and smiled at me. She said thank you and gave me a cookie. She tasted good," Tim said, proud.
Anna stared at Tim, not sure what to say. She looked at the girl on the bench, who was now playing again. She looked happy and healthy. She looked at Spot, who was licking his paws. She looked at Tim, who was licking his lips.
"Tim, you are a very compassionate boy. But you are also a very silly boy. You don't taste people. You taste food. People are not food. People are friends. Do you understand?" Anna said, gently.
Tim nodded, a little embarrassed. He understood. He was sorry. He didn't mean to be rude. He just wanted to help.
"OK, then. Let's watch the game some more. And next time, if you want to taste something, ask me first. I have some candy in my pocket. Do you want some?" Anna said, forgiving.
Tim smiled, grateful. He wanted some. He liked candy. He liked Anna. He liked the game. He liked the park. He liked the day.
He blew a kiss to the girl on the bench. He gave a hug to Spot. He took a candy from Anna. He tasted it. It was sweet. It was good. He was happy.
