Once upon a time, there was a child named Lola. Everyday she would go outside and play with her friends. One day, Lola wanted to show them something. She saw a dark flame and wanted to touch it. 
Lola's friend Tim saw her and said, “Lola, don’t touch it! That’s a dark flame and it could hurt you.” 
Lola thought for a moment, and then decided that she still wanted to touch it. She slowly walked closer to the flame. 
But before she could reach it, Tim shouted, “Lola, stop!”
The dark flame was too hot and Lola knew she should listen to her friend.
Lola stepped back and said to Tim, “I want to go play somewhere else now.” 
So they happily went to play together in a safer place.
