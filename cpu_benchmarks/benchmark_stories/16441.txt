Jen and Sam were twins. They liked to play with their toys and their dog. One day, their mom said they were going to visit their aunt. Jen and Sam were happy. They liked their aunt. She was amazing. She always had fun games and yummy snacks for them.
They got in the car and drove to their aunt's house. When they got there, they saw their aunt waiting for them. She hugged them and said, "Hello, my sweeties! I'm so glad you're here. Come inside, I have a surprise for you."
Jen and Sam followed their aunt into the house. They saw a big box with a bow on it. Their aunt said, "This is for you. Go ahead and open it." Jen and Sam were excited. They tore off the bow and the paper. Inside the box, they found a new toy train. It was shiny and colorful. It had a whistle and a smokestack. It could move on the tracks.
Jen and Sam squealed with joy. They thanked their aunt and hugged her. They said, "This is the best gift ever! You are the best aunt ever! Can we play with it now?" Their aunt smiled and said, "Of course you can. I have more tracks and cars for you. Let's set them up in the living room."
Jen and Sam ran to the living room with their toy train. They started to play with it. They made it go fast and slow. They made it whistle and smoke. They had a lot of fun. But then, something bad happened. Jen wanted to make the train go faster. She pushed the button hard. The train jumped off the tracks and crashed into the wall. It broke into pieces.
Jen was shocked. She looked at the broken train. She felt sad and sorry. She started to cry. She said, "I broke the train. I broke the gift. I'm sorry, aunt. I'm sorry, Sam." Sam was shocked too. He looked at the broken train. He felt sad and angry. He started to cry too. He said, "You broke the train. You broke the gift. You're mean, Jen. You're bad."
Their aunt heard them cry. She came to the living room. She saw the broken train. She felt sorry for them. She said, "Oh, no. What happened? Are you okay?" Jen and Sam told her what happened. They both cried louder. They said, "We're sorry, aunt. We're sorry, we're sorry."
Their aunt hugged them and said, "It's okay, my sweeties. It's okay. It was an accident. You didn't mean to break the train. You're not mean or bad. You're good and kind. I love you both. I'm not mad at you. I'm glad you're safe."
Jen and Sam hugged their aunt back. They said, "We love you too, aunt. We're sorry, we're sorry." Their aunt said, "Don't be sorry. Be happy. I have another surprise for you. Come with me." She took them to the kitchen. She showed them a big cake with candles on it. She said, "This is for you. It's your birthday. Happy birthday, Jen and Sam!"
Jen and Sam were surprised. They forgot it was their birthday. They smiled and said, "Thank you, aunt. Thank you, thank you." They blew out the candles and ate the cake. They felt happy again. They forgot about the broken train. They remembered their amazing aunt. They said, "You are the best aunt ever. You are amazing. We love you, aunt. We love you, we love you."
