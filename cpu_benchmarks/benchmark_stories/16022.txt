Once upon a time, there were two characters. One was called Jane and the other was called Joe. Jane and Joe were the best of friends and always liked to do things together. 
One day, Jane had an idea. She wanted to go on an adventure in search of a rare mineral. Joe thought it sounded like a lot of fun and so he agreed to come with her. 
Jane and Joe made a plan. They decided to go on a walk and explore the woods near their house. They packed some food to have along the way, and Jane made sure to bring a bag for the rare mineral. 
The two friends walked for hours, but they could not seem to find the rare mineral. Jane sat down and sighed. Joe didn't give up. He said that they should keep looking a bit longer. 
In an incredible stroke of luck, they eventually found it! Jane shouted gleefully and hugged Joe. They had discovered the rare mineral! The two friends returned home, excited to tell their families about their adventure.
