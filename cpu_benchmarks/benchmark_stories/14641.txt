Max wanted to go for a walk outside. He grabbed his hat and put it on. Max opened the door and peaked outside. He saw a big tiger in the garden. Max was so excited. He ran out to get a closer look. He smiled and waved at the tiger. The tiger just looked at him. Max thought it was boring watching the tiger, so he decided to play a game. He crept up slowly and tried to sneak past the tiger. It was lots of fun playing with the tiger! Max was so happy. He ran back in doors smiling. What a fun day!
