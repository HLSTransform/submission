Ben and Mia are twins. They go to the same school. They wear the same uniform. But Ben likes to play tricks. He likes to make fake things and hide them in Mia's bag.
One day, Ben makes a fake spider. It is big and black and scary. He puts it in Mia's bag when she is not looking. He thinks it is funny. He waits for Mia to scream.
But Mia does not scream. She finds the fake spider in her bag. She is not scared. She is angry. She knows Ben did it. She takes the fake spider and runs after Ben. She wants to make him say sorry.
Ben sees Mia coming. He sees the fake spider in her hand. He is scared. He does not think it is funny anymore. He runs away from Mia. He does not want to say sorry.
Mia chases Ben around the school. They run past the teacher. The teacher sees them. She sees the fake spider. She is not happy. She stops them. She asks them what they are doing.
Ben and Mia look at the teacher. They look at each other. They look at the fake spider. They feel bad. They know they did something wrong. They say sorry to the teacher. They say sorry to each other. They hug and make up.
The teacher smiles. She tells them to be nice to each other. She tells them to put away the fake spider. She tells them to go back to class. She tells them to wear their uniform with pride. She tells them to say please and thank you. Ben and Mia nod. They say please and thank you. They go back to class. They do not play tricks anymore. They are good twins.
