Once upon a time there was a strong little girl in a small town. Her name was May and she was three years old. Whenever May was out and about people always commented on how well behaved she was and how polite she was. 
One day May went to the library with her mom. She was very excited to browse the shelves and look for books. 
May climbed into a chair and opened up a big book with lots of colourful pages. She said to her mom, "Mom, what is this?" Her mom answered, "It is a page, May! You can learn a lot of things from just one page."
May was so excited to learn with the pages. She quickly learned how to read, count and write. May was so proud of herself and her mom gave her a big hug. She said, "Well done, May. I am so proud of you. You have been so strong and behaved so well today!" May smiled and kept learning.
