Mia and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a big peanut on the ground. It is brown and shiny.
"Look, a peanut!" Mia says. "Can we eat it?"
"I don't know," Ben says. "Maybe it is not good. Maybe it is old."
They look at the peanut. It is attractive. They want to try it.
"Let's spin it," Mia says. "If it lands on the pointy side, we can eat it. If it lands on the round side, we can't."
"OK," Ben says. "You spin it first."
Mia spins the peanut with her finger. It goes round and round. Mia and Ben watch it. They hope it lands on the pointy side.
The peanut stops spinning. It lands on the round side.
"Oh, no!" Mia says. "We can't eat it."
"That's OK," Ben says. "Maybe we can find something else. Maybe we can find a cookie or a candy."
They leave the peanut on the ground. They go to look for something else. They are still friends. They are still hungry.
