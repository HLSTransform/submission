Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bake cookies with her mom. One day, they were making cookies and Lily accidentally spilled sugar all over the counter. 
Her mom said, "Oh no, Lily! You spilled the sugar!"
Lily felt sad and said, "I'm sorry, Mommy. I'll clean it up."
Her mom smiled and said, "That's very thoughtful of you, Lily." 
As they continued to bake, Lily asked, "Mommy, what happens if we burn the cookies?"
Her mom replied, "If we leave them in the oven for too long, they will burn and we won't be able to eat them. We have to be careful and keep an eye on them." 
Lily nodded and said, "Okay, Mommy. I will help you watch the cookies." 
Together, they finished baking the cookies and they turned out delicious. Lily was proud of herself for being a good helper.
