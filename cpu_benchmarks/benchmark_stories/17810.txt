Once upon a time, there was a black cat named Tip. He was always chasing his tail and running around the house. One day he decided to go outside for an adventure. But before he left, his mom warned him to stay away from trouble.
Tip didn’t listen. He ran around outside, jumping from tree to tree and chasing birds. He got so caught up in his fun that he didn’t realize it was getting dark. When Tip realized it was getting late, he raced back home.
On the way, he passed a pond. Suddenly, he remembered that he had been warned not to go anywhere near water. But he was too late. Tip was already in the pond!
It was a mistake that Tip would never forget. When he arrived back home, he felt so much regret. He promised himself to not ever forget his mother's warning again. Tip learned his lesson that day and never went back to the pond.
