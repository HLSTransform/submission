Once upon a time, there was a truck. It was very high. Two little boys were playing with it. They were counting how many wheels the truck had. One, two, three, four - they counted the four big wheels! Then they moved to the back and counted the two tiny wheels. One, two! The boys were so happy. Then they started to count how many bumpers the truck had. One, two. Now they were ready to race with the truck. It was so much fun! They both shouted: "higher, higher!" until the truck was very high in the sky. It was the best day ever!
