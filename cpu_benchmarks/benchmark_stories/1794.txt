The sun was shining brightly one morning when Max decided to explore the creek near his house. He grabbed his bucket and waded into the cool water. Max was having so much fun, splashing and playing.
Suddenly, Max saw something in the water ahead of him. It was a sign. He floated closer and read the sign. It said 'Danger - Do Not Enter'. Max had learned about dangers, and so he backed away from the creek.
Max was sad but he knew it was better to be safe than sorry. He thought of a plan. Max decided to go home, get his binoculars and then he could watch the creek from a safe distance.
Max eventually made it back home but he was careful to keep his distance from the creek. He set up his binoculars and zoomed in on the creek. Through the binoculars he could see the dangerous things that might be lurking in the water.
He was glad he didn't try to go closer. For now, Max will just have to keep watching the creek from a safe spot.
