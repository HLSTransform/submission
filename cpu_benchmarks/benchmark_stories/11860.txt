Once upon a time, there were two birds. One was named Loyal, and the other was the feather. Loyal was a very loyal bird who was always looking out for Feather. One day, Feather was walking in the forest, when she found a big, deep hole. Feather was so tired that she wanted to take a nap in the hole. 
A fox then came out of the hole, and it growled. Feather was so scared, she started to weep. Loyal heard Feather crying and came over to help her. Loyal looked at the fox and said bravely, "Go away!" The fox was scared of Loyal and flew away.
Feather was so thankful that Loyal had helped her. "Thank you so much, Loyal," she said. Loyal just smiled, and they both flew away together, happy in the sky.
