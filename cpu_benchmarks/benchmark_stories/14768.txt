Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to pretend they were lions and roar at each other. They also liked to chase the birds and the butterflies.
But their dad did not like their game. He was trying to water the plants with the hose. He told them to be quiet and obedient. He said they were scaring the flowers and making a mess.
Tom and Lily did not listen. They thought their dad was boring. They wanted to have fun. They decided to sneak up on him and roar as loud as they could.
They crept behind the bushes and waited for the right moment. When their dad was not looking, they jumped out and roared. "Rrrrrrr!"
Their dad was very surprised. He dropped the hose and turned around. He saw Tom and Lily laughing and roaring. He was not happy. He picked up the hose and sprayed them with water. "Shhhhh!"
Tom and Lily were very wet. They stopped laughing and roaring. They felt cold and sorry. They ran to their dad and hugged him. They said they were sorry and they loved him.
Their dad smiled and hugged them back. He said he loved them too and he was sorry he sprayed them. He said they could play lions, but they had to be careful and respectful. He said he would join them and pretend to be a lion too.
Tom and Lily were happy. They liked their dad. They liked to play with him. They roared together and had fun. They were obedient lions.
