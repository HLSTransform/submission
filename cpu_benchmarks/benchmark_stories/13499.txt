Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wander around her garden and see all the pretty flowers. One day, she saw a bee buzzing around a flower. The bee was very busy collecting nectar. 
Lily watched the bee for a while, but then she saw something unknown in the garden. It was a shiny rock! She picked it up and showed it to her mommy. Her mommy didn't know what it was either, so they decided to ask the neighbor who knew a lot about rocks. 
Lily was very excited to learn about the unknown rock and she couldn't wait to wander around the garden again and see what other treasures she could find.
