Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the forest. One day, she saw a deer. The deer had big antlers and was very pretty. 
Lily said, "Hello, deer! You are so pretty." 
The deer replied, "Thank you, Lily. You are very kind." 
Then, Lily saw her friend Jack. Jack said, "Look at that ugly deer! It looks so silly with those big antlers." 
Lily said, "That's not nice, Jack. It's not nice to joke about someone's looks." 
The deer looked sad, but Lily said, "Don't worry, deer. You are still beautiful to me." And they all played together happily ever after.
