One day, Fred the bear went down to the rail. On the rail was a big truck full of supplies. Fred was so excited to see what was inside. He jumped on the truck to take a look. Inside the truck there were a lot of fake supplies. The supplies were not real supplies but they looked like they were. Fred was very entertained by the fake supplies. He enjoyed pretending with them and building things. He even took a few back home to show his friends. Everyone had fun pretending with them and playing in the garden. Fred was so happy he had found the secret rail full of fake supplies!
