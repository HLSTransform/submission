Once upon a time, there was a brilliant boy who lived in a town far away. He was very clever but he needed help with his learning.
One day, he asked his mum if he could have a tutor to help him. His mum said yes!
So the boy and his mum went on a hunt to find a tutor. They looked all around the town, searching for the perfect tutor to help the boy.
Finally, the boy and his mum found a tutor that was just perfect. She was kind and helpful, and could help the boy with his learning.
The boy was so pleased that he got a tutor who could help him. With the help of his tutor he got better and better and now he is even more brilliant than before!
