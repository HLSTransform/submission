Once upon a time, there was a girl who was walking down the road to find a field. She wanted to find a field to have some fun in. As she was walking, she suddenly saw a big, green field and it looked so inviting. She could hardly wait to check it out!
When she reached the field, she saw that it was very flexible. She hopped, skipped, and jumped all around, having a great time. Everywhere she went, it felt so soft. She loved it!
After a few minutes, she decided to take a break. She lay down in the middle of the field and looked up at the sky. All of a sudden, the clouds started to drop and it began to rain. It felt so nice and cool!
The girl lay in the field until the rain stopped. She had a great time and was so happy that she found a flexible field. She thanked the rain for making it even better. She will never forget this magical day in her field.
