Once upon a time, there was a bird named Tom. Tom lived near a big cliff. He had many friends who liked to play with him. They played games and had fun every day.
One day, Tom and his friends decided to play a new game. They wanted to see who could fly the highest. They were excited, but Tom's mom told them to be safe.
Tom and his friends listened to his mom. They flew high, but not too close to the cliff. They had a lot of fun and stayed safe. In the end, they all won the game.
