Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play together. One day, they went to the temple with their families. The temple was a big and beautiful place where people prayed and learned. Lily and Ben saw many things in the temple, like candles, flowers, books, and statues.
Lily and Ben wanted to have some fun, so they decided to play a game. They found a long and colorful scarf and thought of a way to use it. They said, "Let's tie the scarf around the statues and make them look funny!" They giggled and ran to the nearest statue. They wrapped the scarf around its head and neck and made a big bow. They thought it was very funny and ran to the next statue.
But some people in the temple saw what they were doing and did not like it. They said, "Stop that! You are being disrespectful and rude! The statues are not toys, they are symbols of our faith and culture. You should not tie anything around them or make fun of them. You should be quiet and respectful in the temple. That is the normal and right thing to do."
Lily and Ben felt ashamed and sorry. They realized they had made a mistake and hurt the feelings of others. They said, "We are sorry, we did not mean to be bad. We just wanted to play. We did not know the statues were important and special. We will untie the scarf and say sorry to the statues and to you." They did as they said and apologized sincerely.
The people in the temple forgave them and said, "We accept your apology. We understand you are young and curious. But you should always be careful and respectful of other people's beliefs and places. You should learn about them and appreciate them, not mock them or damage them. That is how you can be a good and kind friend to everyone." Lily and Ben nodded and thanked them. They learned a valuable lesson that day and never played with the scarf or the statues again.
