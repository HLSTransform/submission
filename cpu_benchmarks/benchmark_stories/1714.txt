Once upon a time, there was a big bridge over a river. Many cars and trucks would go over it every day. One day, a little duck wanted to cross the river but she couldn't fly. She saw the bridge and thought it was her chance to get to the other side. 
As she walked on the bridge, she saw a big truck coming towards her. The duck was scared and didn't know what to do. But the truck driver saw the duck and yielded to let her pass. The duck was so happy and successful in crossing the bridge. 
From that day on, the duck knew that the bridge was a safe place to cross the river and she would always remember the kind truck driver who yielded to her. The end.
