Once upon a time, there was a sheep. She had white wool all over her body. She absolutely hated her wool because it was so tickly and itchy. She wished she could make it go away.
One day, the sheep decided to take a long walk. She walked and walked, farther and farther away, until she eventually reached the top of a high hill. From the top of the hill, she could see the most beautiful sight she had ever laid eyes on. In the distance, there was a lush green field filled with soft, smooth grass.
The sheep was so excited that she started running down the hill. As she ran, the wool on her body started to slip away. By the time she reached the bottom of the hill, all her wool had gone away! She was so excited that she started to roll and tumble in the soft green grass.
The sheep was so happy. She never had to feel itchy and tickly again. She was so thankful for the high hill that had saved her from her dreaded wool.
