Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Jane who liked to join in a lot of fun. One day she heard a mysterious voice that said, "Let's join a shampoo!" 
At first, Jane was scared by the unknown voice. But then she decided to explore and find out more. She followed the voice and found a really big bucket full of shampoo. 
The voice said, "Jump in and join me for a bubbly ride!" 
Jane couldn't believe it. She was given the chance to join a shampoo! "Yes please," she said. Then she jumped in and let out a giggle.
   
After a few minutes, Jane had the most amazing time. She was having so much fun! She had a big smile on her face and was so happy that she joined the shampoo.
