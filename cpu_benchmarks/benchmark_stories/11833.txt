Once there was a boy who had a stick. He wanted to play with it but his friends did not agree. They thought it was silly and wanted to go and play something else. The boy was embarrassed. He didn't want to do what his friends wanted. So he just stayed playing with his stick. He was happy and had fun with it. Eventually his friends came back and saw how much fun he was having. They wanted to join him after all! Everyone had a great time playing with the stick together.
