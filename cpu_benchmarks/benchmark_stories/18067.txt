Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was a good dog. He always listened to his owner and did what he was told. One day, Max's owner said they were going to visit Max's friend, a cat named Mittens. Max was excited to go see Mittens.
When they arrived at Mittens' house, Mittens' owner invited Max and his owner to stay for dinner. Max was happy because he loved dinner. They had chicken and vegetables. Max was an obedient dog and waited patiently for his owner to give him some food.
After dinner, Max and Mittens played together. They chased each other around the yard and had lots of fun. Max was happy he had visited Mittens and made a new friend.
