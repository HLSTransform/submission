Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the beach with his mommy and daddy. He loved playing in the sand and splashing in the water.
One day, Timmy and his family went to the beach. Timmy was having so much fun playing in the water. Suddenly, a big wave came and knocked him down. Timmy was scared and started to cry.
His daddy picked him up and said, "Don't worry, Timmy. The tide is just very powerful today. Let's go build a sandcastle instead." Timmy smiled and stopped crying. He and his family spent the rest of the day building a big sandcastle and shouting with joy. The end.
