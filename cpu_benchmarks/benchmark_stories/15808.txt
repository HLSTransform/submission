John was feeling uncomfortable. He had to get a haircut but didn't want to. His mom was gentle and tried to pull him closer to the barber. John shook his head and clutched his hands into fists. Mom said, "It will be okay, John. It won't take long." 
John reluctantly sat down and the barber put the cape around him. He gave John a smile. John nervously looked away. The barber began to pull the scissors through John's hair and snip away the uneven pieces. After a few minutes, he was done. 
John's mom said, "See John, that wasn't too bad. Now your hair looks much better." John smiled and rubbed his neck. He was relieved that it was over. 
John thanked the barber and headed out the door with his mom. He was so proud of his new haircut. With his mom by his side, he started to skip down the sidewalk.
