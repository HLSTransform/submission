Once upon a time, there was a soldier who was on a journey. The soldier walked through a gloomy forest, regretting the decision he had made. Suddenly, a loud noise filled the air. It was a monster! The soldier quickly ran away, but he soon became lost. He looked all around, but he couldn't find the way out of the forest.
He felt so scared and alone. He started to cry. Suddenly, a little bird flew down to help him. She showed the soldier the way out of the forest. The soldier was so happy! He thanked the bird, then ran off with a smile on his face. From then on, he never regretted his decision again.
