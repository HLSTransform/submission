Tim and Mia like to play in the backyard. They have a big tent and a flashlight. They pretend they are camping in the woods. They make fake fires and fake animals with sticks and rocks.
One day, it rains a lot. The backyard is muddy and wet. Tim and Mia still want to play in the tent. They put on their boots and coats and run outside. They splash in the puddles and laugh.
They get to the tent and turn on the flashlight. They see something inside the tent. It is brown and furry and has big teeth. It is a fake bear! Tim and Mia scream and drop the flashlight. The flashlight rolls out of the tent and into the mud.
Tim and Mia run back to the house. They are scared and dirty. They tell their mom about the fake bear. She hugs them and says it is okay. She says it is a prank from their big brother. He put the fake bear in the tent to scare them.
She says they have to wash the flashlight and the tent. She says they have to wash themselves too. She takes them to the bathroom and fills the tub with warm water and bubbles. Tim and Mia wash the flashlight and the tent. They wash their hair and their faces and their hands and their feet. They feel better and happy. They say they will get back at their big brother. They have a plan. They will put a fake spider in his bed. They giggle and splash.
