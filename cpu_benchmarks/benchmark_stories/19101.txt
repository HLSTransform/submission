Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a basket of eggs that she collected from her chickens every day. One day, while she was playing outside, she accidentally dropped her basket and lost all her eggs. She was very sad because she loved her eggs and was kind to her chickens.
Her mother saw her crying and asked her what was wrong. Lily told her that she lost all her eggs. Her mother hugged her and said, "Don't worry, we can get more eggs from the store. And remember, it's always kind to be careful with our things."
Lily felt better and went to the store with her mother. They bought a dozen eggs and went back home. Lily was happy again and promised to be more careful with her things from now on.
