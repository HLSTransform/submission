Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys on the floor. One day, she found a big box and wanted to see what was inside. She tried to open it, but it was too heavy. So, she decided to lean on it with all her might. Suddenly, the box opened and out came a cute little puppy! Lily was so happy and they played together on the floor all day long.
