Once upon a time, there was a man who had a wife. They lived in a nice house with a big yard. One day, the man was cooking something yummy in the kitchen. His wife came in and asked, "What are you making?"
The man replied, "I'm making cookies. Do you want to peek and see how they're doing?"
The wife peeked into the oven and said, "They look delicious! Can I have one?"
The man smiled and said, "Of course you can. I made them just for you."
The wife took a bite of the cookie and said, "Mmm, this is so yummy! Thank you, dear."
And they lived happily ever after, enjoying delicious treats together.
