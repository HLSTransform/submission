Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved her daddy very much. One day, she wanted to play with her daddy's toy car, but he said no. Lily felt sad because she really wanted to play with it.
Later that day, Lily's daddy saw her playing with her own toys. He realized how selfish he was being and said sorry to Lily. He let her play with his toy car and they had lots of fun together.
Lily was happy that her daddy was kind and said, "Thank you, daddy, please can we play again tomorrow?" Her daddy smiled and said, "Of course, Lily."
