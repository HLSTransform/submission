Lily liked to play with her toys. She wanted to put them away in her desk. Her desk was red and she liked how it looked.
One day, Lily said to her mom, "Mommy, I want to put my toys in the red desk!"
Her mom said, "Ok, Lily, let's get them all put away."
So Lily and her mom gathered all of Lily's toys and put them away in the red desk. Lily was very happy.
Lily hugged her mom and said, "Thank you, mommy, for helping me put my toys away. Now the red desk looks so nice!"
Lily's mom smiled and said, "You are very welcome, Lily. I'm glad you like it."
