Once there was a lonely gem. It was tucked away in a corner all by itself. Then one day it decided to break free. It tumbled out and was no longer lonely.
The gem rolled and jumped around the room. Everything seemed so new! The walls were so high and the floor so wide. The gem felt so happy and free.
Then suddenly it saw something new. It was a boy! The gem sparkled in the sun and the boy saw it. He picked it up and smiled. The gem felt so special.
The boy brought the gem outside and put it on a rock. Then the boy jumped into a puddle and made a big splash. The gem couldn't help but laugh and smile.
The gem and the boy had so much fun together. They laughed and played around for hours. The gem was so glad it had broken free. Now it was never lonely again.
