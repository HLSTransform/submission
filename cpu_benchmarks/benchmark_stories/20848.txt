Little Sally wandered around looking for a place to have an adventure. She soon came to a big, dark forest. Though she was scared, she boldly stepped inside to explore.
Suddenly, an eerie sound filled the air. Little Sally froze, her heart racing. Suddenly, she heard a voice repeating the same phrase over and over, "This is a dead place, this is a dead place".
Little Sally was scared but she wanted to find out what was causing the voice so she followed the voice deeper into the forest. After wandering for some time, Little Sally found the source of the voice. It was a very old looking ghost.
The ghost turned to Little Sally and said, "I warned you. I've been repeating 'This is a dead place' for years. No one ever listens. Now, you'll be one of us." Little Sally was scared and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, the ghost disappeared and Little Sally was left alone in this dead place.
