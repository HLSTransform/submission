Once upon a time, there was a smart girl. She had lots of jewelry. Every day she would lie down by a big tree. One day, an unusual thing happened. A big bright jewel popped up from the ground! The girl was so excited. She grabbed the jewelry and put it in her pocket. From that day onwards, the girl felt even smarter with her new jewelry. She kept lying down by the tree every day, just in case another jewel came out!
