Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play games together. Sometimes they are competitive. They want to win and be the best.
One day, they play hopscotch. They draw squares on the ground with chalk. They throw a stone and hop on one foot. Lily is good at hopscotch. She can hop fast and far. Ben is not so good. He hops slow and short.
Lily throws her stone and hops to the end. She turns around and hops back. She picks up her stone and smiles. She says, "I win! I win! I am the best!"
Ben throws his stone and hops to the third square. He loses his balance and falls. He hurts his toe. He cries, "Ow! Ow! My toe!"
Lily hears Ben cry. She stops smiling. She cares about Ben. She runs to him and hugs him. She says, "I'm sorry, Ben. Are you okay? Let me see your toe."
Ben shows Lily his toe. It is red and sore. Lily kisses his toe and says, "It will be better soon. Don't cry, Ben. You are good at other games. You are good at puzzles and drawing and singing."
Ben stops crying and smiles. He says, "Thank you, Lily. You are good at hopscotch and many other things. You are a good sister. I love you."
Lily and Ben hug each other. They are not competitive anymore. They are happy and kind. They go inside and play puzzles and draw and sing. They have fun together.
