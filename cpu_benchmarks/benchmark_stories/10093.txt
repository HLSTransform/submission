Tom and Lily were friends. They liked to play with ropes. They made knots with the ropes. They made big knots and small knots. They made knots that looked like animals and knots that looked like stars.
One day, they found a new rope. It was long and red. They wanted to play with it. They took turns to make knots with it. Tom made a knot that looked like a snake. Lily made a knot that looked like a flower. They were happy.
But then, the rope got stuck. They could not undo the knots. They pulled and twisted, but the rope did not move. They were sad.
They saw a man walking by. He had a hat and a tool. He was a gardener. He saw the children and the rope. He asked them, "Do you need help?"
Tom and Lily nodded. They said, "Yes, please. We can't undo the knots. We are sorry."
The gardener smiled. He said, "Don't worry. I can help you. I have a tool that can cut the rope. But you have to be careful. Don't touch the tool. It is sharp."
He took out his tool. It was a pair of scissors. He cut the rope. He freed the knots. He gave the rope back to the children. He said, "Here you go. You can play with the rope again. But be careful not to make too many knots. They can be hard to undo."
Tom and Lily thanked the gardener. They said, "Thank you, thank you. You are very kind. We are grateful."
They hugged the gardener. They hugged each other. They played with the rope again. But they did not make too many knots. They learned their lesson. They were happy.
