Once upon a time, there was a young bunny named Bob. Bob had big ears that he liked to sort leaves with. He would hop around the forest, using his ears to pick up leaves and sort them by color.
One day, Bob met a squirrel named Sue. Sue saw Bob sorting leaves with his ears and said, "Hi, Bob! I like how you sort leaves with your big ears. Can you teach me?"
Bob was happy to help. He showed Sue how to pick up leaves with her paws and sort them too. They had a fun day sorting leaves together.
At the end of the day, Bob and Sue had sorted all the leaves in the forest. They were proud of their work and became good friends. From that day on, they would always play and sort leaves together.
