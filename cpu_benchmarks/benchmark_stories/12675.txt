Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the forest near her house. One day, she went into the forest to find some yummy berries. 
As she was walking, she saw a big tree with a funny looking whip hanging from one of the branches. She was curious and went closer to take a look. Suddenly, she heard a voice behind her. 
"Hello, little one," said a wise old owl. "That whip belongs to the wicked witch who lives in the forest. You must be careful and stay away from her."
Lily nodded her head and continued her search for berries. But as she was picking some, she heard a loud cackle. She turned around and saw the wicked witch standing there with her dead cat in her arms. 
"Ah, I see you found my whip," said the witch with a wicked grin. "Now, it's time for you to pay the price for taking what's mine."
Lily was scared, but she remembered what the owl had told her. She quickly threw the whip at the witch and ran as fast as she could back home. From that day on, she never went into the forest alone again.
