Lily loves to swing. She likes to go high and fast. She likes to feel the wind in her hair and the sun on her face. She likes to see the trees and the sky and the birds.
Daddy pushes her on the swing. He is strong and kind. He makes her laugh and sing. He says, "Hold on tight, Lily. I will push you higher and higher."
Lily says, "Yes, Daddy. Push me higher and higher. I want to touch the sky." She holds on tight and smiles. She feels happy and free.
But then, something happens. Lily feels funny. She feels her tummy go up and down. She feels her head go round and round. She feels dizzy. She says, "Daddy, stop. I feel dizzy. I want to get off the swing."
Daddy hears her and stops. He says, "Okay, Lily. I will stop. I will help you get off the swing." He holds her hand and lifts her off the swing. He hugs her and kisses her. He says, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to make you dizzy. Are you okay?"
Lily nods and says, "I'm okay, Daddy. Thank you for pushing me on the swing. It was fun. But I don't want to swing anymore. I want to sit with you and drink some water."
Daddy says, "That's a good idea, Lily. Let's sit with you and drink some water. And maybe eat a cookie. And maybe read a book. And maybe cuddle. I love you, Lily."
Lily says, "I love you, Daddy." She snuggles with him and feels better. She thinks, "Swinging is fun, but dizzy is not. Daddy is the best."
