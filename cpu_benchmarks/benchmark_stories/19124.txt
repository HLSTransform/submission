Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was playing with her toys when her mom called her on the phone. 
"Hi Mommy!" said Lily.
"Hi sweetie, did you clean up your toys like I asked you to?" asked Mommy.
"No, I forgot," replied Lily, feeling a little bit ignorant.
"Well, you know what happens when you don't listen to Mommy. I have to punish you," said Mommy.
Lily didn't like being punished, but she knew she had to listen to her Mommy. So she put away her toys and promised to be a good girl from now on. And that's exactly what she did!
