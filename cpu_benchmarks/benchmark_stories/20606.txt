Once upon a time there was a young mountain. All day it stood proud and tall and applauded the beauty of the land around it.
One day a small bird flew to the peak of the mountain. It perched on top and clapped it's wings together. Every time it did this, the mountain smiled.
Soon a young rabbit hopped to the base of the mountain and began to hop in a circle around it. The mountain chuckled as the rabbit admired it.
Then, a family of deer walked to the mountain and began to gently touch it with their noses. The mountain cheered and applauded the family in return.
The young mountain was now thankful for all the creatures that made it happy. It stood proud and smiled, knowing it was loved.
