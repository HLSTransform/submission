Once upon a time, there were two best friends called Steve and Alex.
One day, Steve and Alex were playing a game in the garden. They were having fun and laughing together. Suddenly, Steve saw a wide tree and thought it would be fun to climb it. He went over to the tree and started to climb up and up.
Alex was scared, because she had never seen Steve climb that high before. She wanted him to come down but he wouldn't stop. So she got really mad and slapped the tree.
Steve was very surprised and he quickly climbed down. Alex was happy and she hugged Steve. They both agreed that it was a silly game and that it was time to find something else to do. So, they both went inside and played a different game.
