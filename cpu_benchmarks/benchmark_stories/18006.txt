Once upon a time, there was a cat named Mittens. Mittens was a dull cat because she was always sleeping. One day, a little girl named Lily saw Mittens sleeping on the porch. Lily wanted to play with Mittens, but she noticed that Mittens had a dirty face. So, Lily got a tissue and wiped Mittens' face clean. Mittens woke up and meowed happily. From that day on, Mittens and Lily played together every day.
