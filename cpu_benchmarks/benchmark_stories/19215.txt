Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. While playing, Lily saw a shiny penny on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her mommy. "Look, mommy! I found a copper penny!" she said, pointing at it with her finger.
Suddenly, a big boy came and took the penny from Lily's hand. Lily felt embarrassed and sad. She looked at her mommy and said, "He took my penny, mommy. Why did he do that?" Her mommy replied, "Sometimes, people do things that are not nice. But it's important to remember that it's not about what we have, but how we treat others."
Lily realized that her mommy was right. She smiled and said, "You're right, mommy. I don't need the penny to be happy. Being kind to others is more important than having things." From that day on, Lily made sure to always be kind to others, no matter what.
