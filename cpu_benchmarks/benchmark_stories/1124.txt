Once upon a time, there was a huge mitten. It was so big it could fit many hands! One day, a small child stepped up to the big mitten, and held it in their two hands. They pulled and tugged, but the mitten would not yield. The child got bigger and bigger, but still the mitten wouldn't move.
So, the child decided to try something else. They called out to their friends, and soon they all surrounded the mitten, each one grabbing a hold of it. Together, they managed to make the huge mitten yield. They pulled and pulled, and the mitten finally moved! Everyone cheered in joy. 
The child and their friends took the huge mitten to the playroom and used it in lots of fun games! The mitten was a magical toy that taught the children teamwork, patience, and the importance of working together. 
Every day, the mitten yielded to the childrenâ€™s will, bringing them hours of fun and joy.
