Once upon a time there was a girl called Jane. Jane and her family went on a trip to the mountains. It was cold outside, but Jane didn't mind. She wanted to admire the mountains.
When they reached the top, Jane was so excited. She saw the tall, pointy mountains and the blue sky. She was amazed.
Then Jane saw something else. It was the staff of the hotel. They were all wearing warm, thick coats and woolly hats. Jane admired their coats and hats. She wished she had something warm to wear too.
When the family went to check in, the staff welcomed them with friendly smiles and a cup of hot chocolate. Jane drank her hot chocolate and admired how warm and cozy it made her feel.
The family had a lovely holiday and Jane admired the mountains every day. She was glad to be wearing her warm, cozy clothes.
