Once upon a time, there was a white fly. Thefly was very small and it could fly. One day, the white fly went to the meadow to play. It was so much fun!
Letting its wings do the talking, the white fly flew around and around, smiling and laughing. 
But then the white fly saw a big spider and it got scared. So it decided to take a rest and lay on the grass. Little did it know, the spider thought the white fly was asleep!
So the spider crept closer and closer, until it was right in front of the white fly's nose. The white fly was so scared, it decided to pretend to be asleep and lie still.
But then, the white fly heard a little voice. It was a friendly bug, telling the spider to go away. And so the spider did!
The white fly was so relieved and happy, it quickly flew away. From that day on, the white fly was always careful and it never lied again.
