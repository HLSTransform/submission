Once upon a time, there was a little pink bunny. The bunny loved to play in the soft grass. One day, the bunny found a piece of velvet. The velvet was very pretty and soft.
The bunny showed the velvet to his friends. They all liked it very much. The bunny's friends encourage him to make something with the velvet. So, the bunny made a pink velvet hat.
The bunny wore the pink velvet hat everywhere. It made him feel very special. All his friends were happy to see him so happy. And they all played together in the soft grass, with the pink bunny in his new velvet hat.
