Once upon a time there was a girl named Mary. Mary liked to play in the park. She liked to swing and slide. One day she was at the park and she saw something brown. Mary believed it was a puppy. She walked over to it to take a closer look. But when she got closer she saw it was not a puppy but an old brown bear! Mary was so surprised and scared. She ran all the way home! She never expected to see a bear in the park. Mary will always remember what she saw in the park that day.
