Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a red dress that she loved to wear. One day, she went to the park with her mommy. They played on the swings and went down the slide. But then, Lily saw a boy who was sad. He had a frown on his face. 
Lily went over to him and asked what was wrong. The boy said he lost his toy car. Lily wanted to help him find it. She looked all around the park and finally found it under a bench. The boy was so happy and gave Lily a big hug. 
As they were walking away, Lily's mommy noticed that Lily's purse was missing. They looked all over but couldn't find it. Just as they were about to give up, the boy came running back with Lily's purse. He had found it on the ground and wanted to return it to her. Lily was so grateful and gave the boy a big smile. From that day on, they became good friends and played at the park together every week.
