Lily liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls with different names and clothes. She liked to make them talk and do things. She had one doll that was bald. She called her doll Baldy.
One day, Lily took Baldy to school. She wanted to show her to her friends. She put Baldy in her backpack and waited for recess. When recess came, she ran to the playground with her backpack. She opened it and took out Baldy.
"Look at my doll!" she said to her friends. "Her name is Baldy. She is very special."
But her friends did not think Baldy was special. They laughed at Lily and her doll. They said Baldy was ugly and weird. They said Lily was silly and stupid. They pointed at Baldy and made fun of her.
Lily felt very sad and angry. She did not like her friends. She did not like how they treated Baldy. She wanted to make them stop. She grabbed a marker from her backpack and ran to their backpacks. She wrote "Baldy" on their backpacks with the marker. She wrote it big and bold. She wanted them to see how it felt to have a label.
But Lily did not know that the teacher saw what she did. The teacher came to the playground and saw the backpacks. She saw the marker in Lily's hand. She saw Baldy in Lily's other hand. She knew Lily was the one who wrote on the backpacks.
The teacher was very mad. She scolded Lily and took her to the office. She called Lily's mom and told her what happened. She said Lily had to say sorry to her friends and clean the backpacks. She said Lily had to learn to be nice and respectful.
Lily felt very bad. She felt sorry for what she did. She felt sorry for Baldy. She felt sorry for her friends. She felt sorry for herself. She felt embarrassed. She wished she had never brought Baldy to school. She wished she had never written on the backpacks. She wished she had never made the teacher mad. She wished she had never made a mess.
