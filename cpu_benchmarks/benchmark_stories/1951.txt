Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Penny. She was only three years old, but she was very brave and determined.
One day she decided to perform a special show for her family. She got up on a chair and started singing and dancing. Her family watched with big smiles on their faces.
When Penny finished her performance her mom clapped loudly and said, "That was amazing! Well done Penny!"
But Penny just seemed frustrated. She looked around and said, "That's all? Is there more I can do?"
Her parents laughed and said, "Yes, if you want to you can do more. But for now why don't you have a penny for your performance?"
Penny smiled and ran over to get the penny. She held it tightly in her hand and thanked her mom and dad for the extra treat. From that day on, Penny loved to perform for her family.
