Tom and Anna were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun making noise and mess. They did not see their mom coming in with a big basket of laundry.
"Tom, Anna, what are you doing?" mom asked. She was cross. She saw toys everywhere, and dirt on the carpet. "You need to clean up this mess right now!"
"But mom, we are playing!" Tom said. He did not want to stop. He was ignorant. He did not know that mom was tired and had a lot of work to do.
"Playing is good, but you also need to be tidy and respectful," mom said. "You can play after you clean up. And you need to say sorry for making me cross."
Anna was not ignorant. She saw that mom was not happy. She wanted to make mom happy. She put down her doll and started to pick up the toys. "I'm sorry, mom," she said. "I will help you clean up."
Tom saw that Anna was helping mom. He felt bad for being ignorant. He also put down his car and started to pick up the toys. "I'm sorry, too, mom," he said. "I will help you clean up."
Mom smiled. She was not cross anymore. She was proud of Tom and Anna. She hugged them and said, "Thank you, my darlings. You are very good and kind. I love you very much."
