Once upon a time, there was a birdie. The birdie loved to fly high up in the sky. One day, the birdie saw a flashlight on the ground. It was broken and didn't work. The birdie picked up the flashlight in its beak and flew away.
As the birdie continued to soar in the sky, it saw a little boy who was sad. The birdie knew just what to do. It flew down to the boy and gave him the broken flashlight. The boy was happy to have the flashlight, even though it didn't work.
The birdie continued to soar in the sky, feeling happy that it could help the little boy. From that day on, the birdie always looked out for things that might make someone happy, like a broken flashlight that could still bring a smile to someone's face.
