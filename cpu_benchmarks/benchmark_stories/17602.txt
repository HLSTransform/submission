Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside in his backyard. One day, Timmy's dad asked him to help water the plants. Timmy was excited to do this job with the hose. 
As he turned on the hose, he heard a sound coming from the bushes. It sounded like a wild animal! Timmy got scared and ran inside the house. 
Later that day, Timmy's dad went outside to check the bushes. He found a little bunny hiding there. Timmy's dad brought the bunny inside and Timmy was so happy to see it. From that day on, Timmy and his dad took care of the bunny together and used the hose to water its food.
