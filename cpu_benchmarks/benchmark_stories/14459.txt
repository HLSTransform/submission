One day Jack was very excited. He was going on a picnic! He put food in his basket, including a sandwich he really liked. He ran off to the picnic spot.
When he got there he saw a lot of interesting things. He looked at the trees and heard the birds. Then he started to whistle. He was so happy!
Jack liked having picnics. He sat on the grass and ate his sandwich. He laughed and ran around with his friends.
When it was time to go home Jack said goodbye and gave everyone a big hug. Then he put his basket away and whistled as he walked home. It had been a wonderful day at the picnic!
