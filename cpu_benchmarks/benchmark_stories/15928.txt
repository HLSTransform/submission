Once there was a loyal vendor who sold the most delicious treats. Everyone in town was always eager to buy from her, and always cheered with joy when she arrived. 
One day, the vendor saw a little girl who was sad and alone. She asked, "What's wrong?".
The little girl said, "I want a treat, but I don't have any money". 
The vendor said, "That's OK. You can have it for free".
The little girl began to smile and clap her hands in joy. Everyone around them began to applaud the vendor's kind act. 
The vendor said, "Next time you need something, come find me. I will always help". 
The little girl thanked her and left happily with her treat.
The rest of the town was very proud of the vendor's loyalty and thanked her with many more rounds of applause.
