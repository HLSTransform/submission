Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to play outside. One cold day, she went to the park to play with her friends. They played for a minute, but then they heard a loud noise.
The loud noise was a big dog barking. Sue and her friends were scared. They did not know what to do. The big dog kept barking and coming closer to them. Sue wanted to be brave and help her friends.
Sue had an idea. She picked up a stick and threw it far away. The big dog saw the stick and ran after it. The dog was happy to play with the stick. Sue and her friends were not scared anymore. They played in the park all day, and Sue felt proud that she helped her friends.
