Once upon a time, there was a huge grape on the ground. It was so big that it looked like a small melon. Sam was a little boy, who was only three years old and loved grapes. He went to pick up the huge grape and imagine what it would taste like. 
Sam was about to take a bite when an old man stopped him. The old man told Sam he should not eat this grape. He said the grape was special, because it was meant to be made into a jar of wine. Sam was very curious but he knew he had to obey the old man. He put the grape down and looked away.
The old man smiled and said that if everything went according to plan, they would be able to make a special kind of wine. Sam was confused and asked the old man what kind of wine that would be. 
The old man said it would be the kind you don't find anywhere else--and said it would be the best wine in the world. Little Sam was so curious that he could hardly wait to taste it. 
The old man smiled and said that if Sam was patient, he would eventually get to try the special wine. The old man put the grape into a jar and Sam said goodbye to the grape and went back home. The grape was transformed into a delicious jar of wine, and little Sam was very happy that he got to try it!
