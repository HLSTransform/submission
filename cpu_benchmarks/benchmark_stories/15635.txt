Lila and Ben were playing with a ball in the park. They liked to pass the ball to each other and catch it. The ball was smooth and shiny and bounced high.
"Pass me the ball, Ben!" Lila shouted.
"OK, Lila!" Ben said. He threw the ball hard to Lila. But he threw it too hard. The ball flew over Lila's head and hit a big tree. The tree had a hole in it. The ball went into the hole and did not come out.
"Oh no!" Lila and Ben said. They ran to the tree and looked into the hole. They could not see the ball. It was too dark and deep.
"Where is our ball?" Lila asked.
"I don't know, Lila. I'm sorry. I threw it too hard. I regret it." Ben said.
They tried to reach the ball with their hands, but they could not. They tried to shake the tree, but it did not move. They tried to call the ball, but it did not answer.
They were sad and angry. They wanted their ball back. They did not want to play anymore.
"Let's go home, Ben." Lila said.
"OK, Lila." Ben said. They walked away from the tree, holding hands. They hoped that someone would find their ball and give it back to them. They missed their ball. It was their favorite toy.
