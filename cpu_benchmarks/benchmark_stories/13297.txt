Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. He was very confused. He saw a board in the water. The board was floating away. Spot wanted to help.
Spot jumped into the water. He swam to the board. He pushed the board back to the land. Spot rescued the board. He was happy.
Spot's friend, Kitty, saw what he did. She was proud of him. They played with the board together. They had lots of fun. And that is the end of the story.
