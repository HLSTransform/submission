Momma and Papa took Daisy to the beach. Daisy was so excited!
When they got to the beach, Momma and Papa unpacked their things from the car. They put out a big, deep towel in the sand for Daisy.
Daisy loved playing in the sand and swimming in the ocean. Momma and Papa laughed and watched her have fun.
When it was time to go home, Daisy was sad. But Momma and Papa said she could come back again soon. They packed everything up and put the deep, soft towel back in the car.
Daisy was happy and ready to go back home!
