Once upon a time, there was a vehicle. The vehicle was fit and ready to go. One day, a man came to pour something in the vehicle. The man carefully poured the liquid into the tank and it made the vehicle fit and ready to go.
The man started the vehicle and it went vroom vroom! Then, the man drove the vehicle away. The little vehicle drove around the streets. It drove past a park, some trees and some houses.
The man and the vehicle drove off and drove around together. Soon, the vehicle was driving very fast and the man was having lots of fun. The man and the vehicle enjoyed their time together. 
The sun was starting to set and the man decided it was time to go home. He drove the vehicle back to where it started and stopped the engine. Then, the man got out and said goodbye to the vehicle. He was happy because the vehicle was fit and ready to go again.
