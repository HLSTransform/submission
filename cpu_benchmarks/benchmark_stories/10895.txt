Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Jack. Jack loved music a lot. He would listen to it every day and dance to the beat.
One day, Jack's mom took him to a big music concert. Jack was very excited and danced along with everyone. But suddenly, he felt sad because he couldn't see the stage very well. It was too big for his small eyes.
But then, Jack's mom remembered something. She had brought a small stool for Jack to sit on. Jack was so happy and could see the stage perfectly. He danced and sang along with the music all night long.
From that day on, Jack always remembered to bring his small stool to music concerts. He never missed a beat again!
