Jack was a little boy who liked to ride his bike. One day, he decided to ride his bike to the park. He was having lots of fun, until he heard an angry voice coming from the bushes. Jack was scared and he was not sure what to do.
He decided to run away, so he got on his bike and went as fast as he could. He listened closely, but he didn't hear the angry voice anymore. He was relieved, so he slowed down and started to ride back home.
Suddenly, the angry voice was getting closer and closer. Jack was so scared, he took a sharp turn and felt a hand grab his foot! He quickly shook off the hand, and pedaled as fast as he could. He looked back and saw an angry man, but he had no time to stop and find out what the man wanted.
Jack quickly made it back home and decided to never go to the park again. He knew that bad things can happen in unexpected places and he didn't want to be in danger ever again.
