John was playing in his garden, splashing in the water from the hose. His mom watched from the kitchen window with a smile on her face. Suddenly, John's little brother, Tom, stepped into the garden and started splashing in the puddle too. 
John's mom quickly opened the door. "Tom, you need to help your brother," she said. "John was playing here first."
Tom felt guilty and stepped out of the puddle. He looked at his shoes, which were now wet and muddy, and then he looked at John.
John smiled and said, "It's okay Tom! Come back in and splash with me." 
Tom was relieved that he wasn't in trouble anymore. He stepped back into the puddle and joined John. Together, they splashed, laughed and had fun in the garden.
