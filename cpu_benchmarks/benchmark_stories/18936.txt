Jill and Tom were friends who liked to play with blocks. They had many blocks of different colors and shapes. They could build towers, houses, bridges and anything they wanted. They had fun making their own world with blocks.
One day, they decided to play with blocks in the basement. The basement was dark and cold, but they brought a lamp and a blanket. They found a big box of blocks that they had never seen before. They opened the box and saw many charming blocks. They had stars, hearts, flowers and animals on them. They were shiny and pretty.
Jill and Tom were very happy. They started to build with the charming blocks. They made a castle, a garden, a zoo and a rocket. They were so busy that they did not hear the door close behind them. They did not see the sign that said "Danger: Do not touch".
The charming blocks were not really blocks. They were bombs. They had wires and timers and explosives inside them. They were left by bad people who wanted to hurt others. The bad people had forgotten about the bombs, but they had set them to go off soon.
Jill and Tom did not know that. They kept playing with the charming blocks. They did not notice the beeping sound that got louder and faster. They did not see the red light that flashed on the bombs. They did not feel the heat that grew around them.
Suddenly, there was a big boom. The charming blocks exploded. The basement was filled with fire and smoke and noise. Jill and Tom screamed. They tried to crawl away, but it was too late. The fire burned them. The smoke choked them. The noise deafened them. They could not escape. They died.
The end.
