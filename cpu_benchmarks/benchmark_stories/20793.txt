Once there was a little girl. She was so excited because she was going to her first day of school. She was in a very big class, with lots of other children. The teacher was very nice and showed them around the classroom.
Everyone was so happy. The teacher said it was time to start, so they all sat down. Then the teacher asked everyone to clap. So the little girl and all the other children clapped and it was so loud.
The teacher said it was time for a break, so everyone went outside to play. There was a huge playground with lots of fun things to do. The children laughed and clapped and had a great time. 
When it was time to go home, the little girl was so sad to leave. But she knew she would be coming back the next day and couldn't wait to see her new class again.
