One day, a little cat named Graceful was walking in the woods. She saw a small, trembling bird on the ground. The bird was scared and couldn't fly. Graceful wanted to help the bird.
Graceful asked the bird, "Why are you trembling? Can I help you?" The bird said, "I hurt my wing. I need a razor to cut the thing that is stuck." Graceful looked around and found a small razor near a tree.
Graceful used the razor to cut the thing on the bird's wing. The bird felt better and said, "Thank you, Graceful!" The bird could fly again. Graceful and the bird became good friends and played together in the woods every day.
