Once there was an infant who was very bossy. Everywhere he went, he liked to be in charge. But then one day, something strange happened. The infant went for a walk and suddenly he was running backwards! 
He had reversed himself. He moved his little arms and legs in the opposite direction, and he was doing it so quickly that he couldn't stop. The infant was worried, but he kept going, backwards and forwards. 
Finally, his older brother saw him and called for help. He ran to the infant and grabbed him, and then started turning the infant around and around in circles. 
And after the fourth turn, the infant was facing the right way again. He was happy that he could walk forward again, and he vowed to never act so bossy again.
