Once upon a time, there was a big tree with high branches. A little bird lived on the tree. The little bird loved to sing and play with his friend, the squirrel.
One day, the squirrel found a cup of coffee on the ground. He asked the little bird, "What is this?" The little bird said, "I don't know. It smells good, but it might be sharp." The squirrel wanted to taste it, but the little bird stopped him. "We should not try things we don't know," said the little bird.
The squirrel listened to his friend and left the coffee alone. They went back to playing and singing. They learned that it's good to be careful and listen to friends. And they lived happily ever after.
