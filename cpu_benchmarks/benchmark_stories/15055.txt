Once there was a very bad ant. He didn't want to help anyone. He always crawled away whenever he saw someone else in trouble. One day, a nail was stuck in the ground and the ant saw a bee who was trying to get it out. But he still crawled away and didn't help. 
The bee noticed the ant and asked: “Why don’t you help me, ant? Together we can get this nail out.”
But the ant ignored the bee and crawled away. He thought he was too good to help someone else. 
Later, the ant was walking in his garden when he stepped on a nail. He was in terrible pain and started to cry for help. But nobody listened. Because the ant had decided to crawl away from helping others, no one helped him. 
The moral of this story is that it’s always good to help others, because one day you might need help too and might not be able to find it.
