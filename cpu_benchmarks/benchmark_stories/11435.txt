Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She lived in a village with her mom and dad. 
One Sunday morning, Amy and her parents went to the market. When they arrived, there were all sorts of wonderful things to buy! Amy saw the fruits and vegetables and the colorful ribbons and balloons. She even saw some really exciting herbs.
"What is that, Mommy?" she asked, pointing to an herb.
"That is a herb," her mom said.
But then something strange happened. Suddenly, an angry man appeared in the market. Everyone in the market got scared and started to run away.
Amy and her parents ran back home as fast as they could. They were very frightened, but soon they arrived back home safely.
The next day, Amy and her parents decided to go back to the market. This time, they were careful and nothing bad happened. Amy got to buy lots of new herbs and take them home with her.
From then on, Amy had plenty of herbs to play with. She always remembered that scary day in the market and the angry man. But she was happy to be safe and have so much fun with herbs!
