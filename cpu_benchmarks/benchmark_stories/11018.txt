Lily was excited. Today was her birthday. She had a big cake with four candles. She had many presents. She wanted to open them all.
She heard a knock on the door. It was her neighbor, Ben. He was holding a big box with a bow. He smiled and said, "Happy birthday, Lily! I have a present for you."
Lily ran to the door and hugged Ben. She said, "Thank you, Ben! You are very nice. Can I open it now?"
Ben nodded and said, "Yes, you can. I hope you like it. It is something fun."
Lily took the box and opened it. Inside was a beautiful doll with long hair and a pink dress. Lily gasped and said, "Wow! She is so pretty! I love her! What is her name?"
Ben said, "You can name her whatever you want. She is your doll. Do you want to play with her?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, I do. Come on, Ben. Let's go to my room. We can have a tea party with her and my other toys."
Lily and Ben went to Lily's room. They played with the doll and had a lot of fun. Lily was very happy. She had the best birthday ever.
