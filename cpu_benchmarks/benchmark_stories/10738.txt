Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She lived in a pretty house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily and her family went on a hike to see a big cliff. Lily was scared to go too close to the edge, but her daddy held her hand tight.
As they were walking back home, Lily realized she had lost her favorite toy. She started to cry and told her mommy and daddy that she missed it. They searched and searched, but could not find it. Lily felt sad.
When they got home, Lily's mommy surprised her with a new toy that was just as pretty as the one she lost. Lily was happy again and hugged her mommy tight. She still missed her old toy, but she knew she had a lot of love and toys to make her happy.
