Jane was walking through the park when she found an old chest. She was very curious and decided to open it. When she opened the lid, she found a beautiful piece of pink jewelry. She was so thrilled that she couldn't help but jump up and down.
Suddenly, a 3 year old child named John noticed what Jane had found. He asked her, "What do you have there?".
Jane smiled and replied "I found this lovely pink jewelry inside this chest".
John was amazed and he asked, "Can I see it?".
Jane smiled and said, "Sure! Take a look".
John looked closely at the jewelry and said, "Wow, it's so pretty!" Jane was so happy to share the discovery with John and they both smiled.
