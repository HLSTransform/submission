Tom and Sue were friends who liked to play near the mill. The mill was a big house where people made flour from wheat. The mill had many sacks of flour that were brown and soft.
One day, Tom and Sue saw a hole in one of the sacks. They decided to peek inside and touch the flour. It felt nice and smooth. They took some flour and made shapes with it. They had fun and laughed.
But then, the miller came and saw them. He was angry and shouted. "What are you doing with my flour? You are making a mess and wasting my work! Go away and don't come back!"
Tom and Sue were scared and ran away. They felt sorry and ashamed. They knew they did a bad thing. They did not ask the miller if they could play with his flour. They did not respect his property.
They went to their homes and told their parents what happened. Their parents were also angry and disappointed. They made them go back to the mill and apologize to the miller. They also made them help him clean the mess and fix the sack.
The miller accepted their apology and thanked them for their help. He told them that flour is important and valuable. He said that they should not waste it or play with it. He said that they should ask before they touch something that is not theirs.
Tom and Sue learned their lesson. They said sorry to the miller again and promised to be more careful and respectful. They also thanked him for letting them see the mill. They became friends with the miller and sometimes he let them watch how he made flour. But they never touched his sacks again.
