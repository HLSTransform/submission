Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to play outside in the yard. One day, Max's owner came outside with a treat. "Max, come here boy! I have a treat for you!" said Max's owner. Max ran over to his owner and wagged his tail. "Sit, Max," said his owner. Max sat down and his owner gave him the treat. It was so yummy!
After eating the treat, Max wanted to play hide and seek. "Let's play hide and seek, owner!" said Max. "Okay, Max. You hide and I will come find you," said his owner. Max ran to the bushes and hid behind them. His owner looked and looked but couldn't find Max. "Where are you, Max?" said his owner. Max barked and his owner found him. "Good job, Max! You are such a dependable dog," said his owner. Max wagged his tail and was happy to be found.
