Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the kitchen and saw that her fridge was different. It was bigger and had more shelves. She was so excited to see it!
Lily's mom came in and asked, "What do you think of the new fridge?" 
"It's big and different," said Lily. 
But then, Lily accidentally bumped into the fridge and heard a loud noise. "Uh oh, I think I broke it," she said, feeling sad. 
"Don't worry, Lily. It's okay. We'll fix it," said her mom with a smile. 
From that day on, Lily was more careful around the fridge, but she still loved how big and different it was.
