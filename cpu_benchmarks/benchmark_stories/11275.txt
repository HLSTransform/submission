Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jessica. She was walking along a path in the woods with her mom. 
Suddenly Jessica stopped. 
"Mom, look! A deer!" Jessica said. 
Jessica's mom smiled. "Yes, that is a deer," she said. 
The little deer was standing in the sun, and its fur was shining in the light. Jessica and her mom stood watching it for a moment, until suddenly the deer passed by them. Jessica watched it go until it had disappeared into the woods. 
Jessica and her mom continued on their walk, but every time they passed something new, Jessica remembered the little deer in the light and smiled.
