Once upon a time there was a brave little girl called Lucy. Every day Lucy would look out of her window, at the landscape outside. One day when she was looking out, she saw something funny. The sky was covered in a blanket of white!
"Mummy, what is it?" Lucy asked.
"It's snow, sweetheart,” Mummy said. “It's very pretty, isn't it?”
"Yes, it is pretty," Lucy said. She bravely decided to go outside and play in the snow. She pulled on her warm coat and covered her head and hands with a scarf and gloves.
Once Lucy stepped into the winter wonderland, she was filled with joy. She scooped up big handfuls of snow and tossed them in the air. She made a snowman and danced around it as if it were alive. Lucy was filled with courage as she enjoyed the beautiful winter landscape. 
The sun set and before long it was time to go back inside. Lucy's mama tucked her snugly in bed, looking out the window at the star filled sky she saw that night. In the morning, when Lucy opened her eyes the snow had covered the landscape again, and she realized it had been a magical night.
