Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved playing with his toys, especially his ball. One day, he saw an unusual shape in the sky. It was a big, black cloud. Timmy thought it looked like a monster.
Timmy was scared of the cloud monster, so he ran inside his house. He told his mom about the cloud monster and she said it was just a storm. But Timmy was still scared. 
Later that day, the storm came and it was very loud. Timmy's house shook and the lights went out. Timmy was so scared that he hid under his bed. When the storm finally ended, Timmy came out from under his bed. But he saw that his ball was gone. The wind from the storm had blown it away. Timmy was sad that his ball was gone and the day had ended badly.
