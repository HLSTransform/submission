Once upon a time there was a little girl named Emma. She was only three years old, but she was very brave. One day Emma's mommy wanted to teach her something new. She wanted to teach Emma how to swim. Emma was a bit scared at first. But eventually, with lots of patience and gentle teaching, Emma learned how to swim.
At the end of summer, Emma and her mommy went to the big pool. Emma was so proud to show her mommy what she had learned. She swam laps back and forth, and all the other people at the pool were very impressed.
When Emma was done swimming, Mommy gave her a special medal for being so brave and for learning how to swim. It was a beautiful gold medal with a star on it. Emma was so excited. She got the best medal ever!
But then Mommy warned Emma about something terrible. She said, "Now you must remember never to swim alone." Emma promised to never, ever swim alone. She knew it was very important.
So Emma and Mommy both smiled and were very happy. Emma kept the medal safe, and she never forgot her promise to never swim alone.
