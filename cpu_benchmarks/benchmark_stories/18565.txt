Once upon a time, there was a bald man who liked to complain a lot. He would complain about everything, even when things were going well. One day, he was walking in the park when he saw a little boy crying. The boy had hurt his hand and was in pain.
The bald man went over to the boy and asked him what was wrong. The boy showed him his hand and the bald man saw that it was bleeding. He felt sorry for the boy and wanted to help him. He quickly went to get a band-aid and some water to clean the boy's hand.
The boy was grateful and stopped crying. The bald man realized that he had been complaining too much and that he should try to be more helpful like he was today. From then on, he made an effort to be kind to others and not complain as much.
