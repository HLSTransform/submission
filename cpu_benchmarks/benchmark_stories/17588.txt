Lily was a big girl who liked to do things by herself. She was independent and did not want help from her mom or dad. One day, she saw a bottle of lotion on the bathroom shelf. She wanted to smell it and put some on her skin. She climbed on a stool and reached for the bottle.
"Be careful, Lily!" her mom urged. "That lotion is not for you. It is for grown-ups. It can make your skin hurt if you use too much."
But Lily did not listen. She thought she knew better. She opened the bottle and squeezed some lotion on her hand. It smelled nice, like flowers. She rubbed it on her face and arms and legs. She felt soft and smooth.
She was happy until she looked in the mirror. She saw that her skin was red and itchy. She felt a burning sensation. She started to cry. She had used too much lotion and it was not good for her.
Her mom heard her cry and came to the bathroom. She saw what Lily had done and felt sorry for her. She took a wet cloth and wiped off the lotion from Lily's skin. She gave her a hug and a kiss and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I know you wanted to be independent, but sometimes you need to listen to your mom or dad. They know what is best for you. They love you and want you to be safe and healthy."
Lily nodded and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I should have listened to you. I learned my lesson. Next time, I will ask you before I use something that is not for me."
Her mom smiled and said, "That's good, Lily. I'm proud of you. You are a big girl, but you are also my little girl. And I will always be here to help you and teach you."
They hugged and went to the living room. Lily felt better and played with her toys. She did not touch the lotion again. She was independent, but she was also smart.
