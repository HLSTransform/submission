Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They saw a big pole with a sign on it. The sign said "Do not climb". Lily wanted to climb the pole. She thought it would be fun. Tom did not want to climb the pole. He thought it would be dangerous.
"Come on, Tom, let's climb the pole!" Lily said.
"No, Lily, we should not climb the pole. The sign says no. We could fall and hurt ourselves." Tom said.
Lily did not listen to Tom. She ran to the pole and grabbed it. She tried to pull herself up. But the pole was slippery and hard. She could not climb the pole. She slid down and fell on the ground. She scraped her knee and started to cry.
Tom ran to Lily and helped her up. He saw blood on her knee. He was frightened. He did not like blood. He hugged Lily and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. Are you okay?"
Lily nodded. She was sorry too. She said, "I'm sorry, Tom. You were right. I should not have climbed the pole. I was silly. Can you forgive me?"
Tom smiled. He said, "Of course I can forgive you, Lily. You are my friend. But next time, let's resist the pole, okay?"
Lily smiled back. She said, "Okay, Tom. Let's resist the pole. And let's go to the nurse and get a band-aid for my knee."
They held hands and walked to the nurse. They learned their lesson. They did not climb the pole again.
