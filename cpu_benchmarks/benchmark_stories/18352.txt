One day, a big bear named Bob found an enormous box. He wanted to carry it to his home. But the box had a tight knot that he could not open. Bob tried and tried, but he just could not open the knot. He felt sad.
Bob's friend, a small bird named Tim, saw him feeling sad. Tim asked, "Why are you sad, Bob?" Bob told Tim about the enormous box and the tight knot he could not open. Tim wanted to help his friend.
Tim used his small beak to untie the knot. It took some time, but Tim did it! Bob was so happy. Now, they could carry the enormous box to Bob's home together. They were both very happy and they played with the big box all day long.
