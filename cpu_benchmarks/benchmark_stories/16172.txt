Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Chubbs. Chubbs was very excited to go on an adventure! Chubbs hopped through the forest and soon came across a big log.
"Wow!" exclaimed Chubbs. "This log looks so cool!"
Chubbs hopped over to the log and decided to lay down on it. The log was so big and soft that he felt like he was lying on a bed. In no time, Chubbs was fast asleep!
But Chubbs' adventure wasn't over yet. After some time, Chubbs heard a voice. 
"Hey! Wake up!"
It was a spoiled little bear and he wanted the log all to himself. Chubbs woke up and hopped away, and the bear curled up on the log and went to sleep, all cozy and content! 
And they all lived happily ever after. The end!
