Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play hide and seek with his friends. One day, while playing, Tim found an ancient, old house. It was so old, it looked like it had been there forever.
Tim went inside the house and saw a kind doctor. The doctor was wearing a big white coat and a funny hat. The doctor said, "Hello Tim! I'm Dr. Brown. I help people feel better when they are sick. Do you want to play a game?"
Tim was excited and said, "Yes, I want to play!" Dr. Brown told Tim to close his eyes and count to ten. While Tim was counting, Dr. Brown hid in the ancient house. When Tim finished counting, he opened his eyes and started to look for Dr. Brown. He looked behind the door, under the table, and even in the closet. Finally, Tim decided to peek behind a big curtain. There he found Dr. Brown, hiding and smiling.
They both laughed and played hide and seek all day long in the ancient house. From that day on, Tim and Dr. Brown became the best of friends, and Tim learned that doctors can be fun too.
