Once upon a time, there was a very little boy. He was out playing in the park, when he saw a bird in the mud. The bird was so sad, it was miserable. The boy wanted to help the bird, so he thought of a way to rescue it. He went over to the bird and very carefully picked it up. But he saw that the bird had a small white pill stuck in its feathers. He didn't know what to do, so he asked a grown-up. The grown-up said that if he gave the bird the pill, it would be better soon. So, the boy gave the bird the pill, and it flew away happier than ever. The boy was so pleased to have been able to rescue the bird!
