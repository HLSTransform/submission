Once upon a time, there was a boy named John. He loved to pretend! He loved playing pretend football with his friends. He would make a perfect pass and always pretend he was the best in the game.
One day it was John's birthday and his mama had a surprise. She bought him a real football! John was so excited, he could not believe it. He ran outside and started to play with his new football. He kicked it as hard as he could and it flew across the yard.
John and his friends spent the rest of the day playing football. John pretended he was a professional football player. He dropped back and looked for a perfect pass to make. He threw a perfect pass down the field and scored a touchdown.
John's friends were so impressed! They all cheered for him, it was a perfect day. That night, John put his football under his bed so he could dream about his perfect touchdown pass.
