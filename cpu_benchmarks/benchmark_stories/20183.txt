Sara likes to read novels. Novels are books with many pages and stories. Sara has a big novel with a picture of a wild lion on the cover. She wants to know how big the lion is.
She asks her brother Tom to help her measure the lion. Tom has a ruler. A ruler is a stick with numbers and lines. Tom and Sara put the ruler on the book and look at the numbers.
"The lion is 15 centimeters long," Tom says.
"That is very big," Sara says. "Is the lion bigger than our cat?"
Tom thinks for a moment. He looks at their cat, who is sleeping on the sofa. He picks up the ruler and goes to the sofa. He tries to measure the cat, but the cat does not like it. The cat wakes up and hisses. The cat jumps off the sofa and runs away.
"Oops," Tom says. "The cat is wild too."
Sara laughs. She thinks the cat is funny. She hugs her novel and says, "I like my lion better. He does not run away."
