Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a pet dog named Max. Max was big and furry. He loved to play with Lily all day long.
One day, Lily and Max went to the park. They were having so much fun playing fetch with a ball. Suddenly, Max barked very loud. Lily asked Max what was wrong. Max needed to go potty!
Lily took Max to the bushes and waited for him to finish. Max was a good boy and did his business quickly. Lily was happy that Max told her he needed to go. They continued playing fetch and having fun at the park.
