Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a wallet that he loved to carry with him wherever he went. One day, Timmy was playing at the park when he accidentally dropped his wallet in the sand. The sand was rough and it scratched his wallet.
Timmy started to cry because his wallet was his favorite thing. A kind lady saw Timmy crying and asked him what was wrong. Timmy told her about his wallet and how it was now rough. The lady said, "Let me see your wallet." Timmy let the lady take his wallet and she fixed it so it was no longer rough.
Timmy was so happy and said, "Thank you so much for helping me!" The lady smiled and said, "You're welcome. Always remember to be careful with your wallet." Timmy nodded his head and promised to take good care of his wallet from now on.
