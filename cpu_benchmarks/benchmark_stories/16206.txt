Once upon a time, there was a boy called Tommy. Tommy was always very careless and he liked to play with his toys all day.
One day, Tommy's mommy asked him if he wanted to help make a waffle. Tommy said "yes!" so he and his mommy went to the kitchen.
Tommy was so excited that he couldn't wait to try the waffle. But before he got the chance to, Tommy suddenly dropped the waffle on the ground.
His mommy said: "Be careful Tommy!"
Tommy started to scream as loud as he could. His mommy said: "No Tommy, that was too careless". 
Then his mommy gave Tommy a big hug and said: "It's okay Tommy, don't worry. Mommy will make you a new waffle."
Tommy smiled and said thank you. His mommy soon made the waffle with extra care and soon enough Tommy was eating his delicious waffle! 
The end!
