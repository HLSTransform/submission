Ben and Lily are friends. They like to play on the farm. They help their dads with the wheat. Wheat is a plant that makes bread.
One day, Ben and Lily see a big truck. The truck is full of wheat. The truck driver says he has a gift for them. He gives them a bag of wheat seeds. He says they can plant them and grow their own wheat.
Ben and Lily are happy. They say thank you to the truck driver. They run to their dads and show them the seeds. Their dads are proud of them. They say they are smart and kind.
Ben and Lily plant the seeds in a small patch of land. They water them and watch them grow. They are excited to see the wheat turn yellow and tall. They receive a lot of wheat from their seeds.
Ben and Lily make bread with their wheat. They share it with their families and the truck driver. They enjoy the warm and yummy bread. They are glad they received the wheat seeds. They learned a lot from them. They are smart and happy.
