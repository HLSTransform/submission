Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. One day, she went for a walk in the woods with her mommy and daddy. They found a little creek that was very pretty. 
Lily's mommy said, "Let's make a picnic by the creek." Daddy made sandwiches and mommy made some yummy fruit salad. Lily helped by picking flowers to put on the blanket. 
After they ate, Lily dipped her toes in the creek. She said, "The water is so tasty!" Mommy and daddy laughed and said, "No, silly, water is not tasty. But we're glad you like it!" They all had a fun day by the creek and went home happy.
