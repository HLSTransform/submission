Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie loved to fly in the sky and sing songs. One day, the birdie saw a big market. The market had many things to eat and the birdie got very happy.
The birdie flew down to the market and saw a piece of bread. The bread was very rough, but the birdie was very hungry. The birdie ate the bread and felt very happy.
After eating, the birdie flew away. But, the birdie did not know that the bread had poison in it. The poison spread in the birdie's body and the little birdie fell down and died. The end.
