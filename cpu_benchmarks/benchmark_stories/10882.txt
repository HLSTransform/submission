Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's mom told him to put on his pants so he could go play outside. Timmy was glad because he loved playing outside.
Timmy went outside and played with his friends. They played catch with a ball. Timmy threw the ball to his friend, but his friend missed and the ball went rolling down the street. Timmy ran after the ball and caught it. He was glad he caught the ball.
As Timmy was walking back to his friends, he noticed a dog running towards him. The dog was trying to catch Timmy's pants with his teeth. Timmy was scared, but he knew he had to be brave. He said, "No, dog! Don't catch my pants!" The dog stopped and wagged his tail. Timmy was glad the dog didn't catch his pants.
From that day on, Timmy made sure to always keep an eye on his pants when he played outside. And he was glad to have such good friends and a brave heart. The end.
