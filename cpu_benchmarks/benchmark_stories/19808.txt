Once upon a time there was a brave little girl. She had a sparkly bracelet with her name on it. One day, she went on an adventure and was having lots of fun.
Suddenly, she saw a little puppy in danger. She wanted to help him, so she ran over. She couldn't pick it up, so she put her arms around it and squeezed. The puppy was safe!
The little girl was so happy to have helped the pup that she forgot to check her bracelet. It was gone! She realised that when she had squeezed the puppy, her bracelet must have fallen off. She felt ashamed.
But luckily, a kind man had seen what happened. He had picked up the bracelet and put it back on her wrist. She hugged him in a thankful squeeze and said goodbye.
The little girl was now extra careful not to lose her bracelet ever again. Then she ran off to find more adventures!
