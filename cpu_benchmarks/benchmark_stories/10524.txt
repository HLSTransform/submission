John looked out the window and saw a big van. "Mommy, that is a big van!" he said. His Mommy smiled. "Yes it is," she said.
John watched as the van drove closer and stopped. Two men got out and they didn't look happy. One said something to John's Mommy. He was rude and John wanted to yell at him, but his mommy put her hand on his shoulder.
John's mommy said something back, but he couldn't tell what it was. The men paused. Then the men got back in the van and drove away.
John looked at his mommy. She was sad. "What did they want, Mommy?" he asked. His Mommy hugged him. "They wanted to take our house away," she said.
John was so sad. That was so rude of the men. He looked out the window and watched as the van drove away. He never wanted to see the van again.
