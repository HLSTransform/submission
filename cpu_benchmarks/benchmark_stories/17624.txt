One day, a little girl named Lily went to the doctor's office. She had a sore arm and her mommy wanted the doctor to take an x-ray. The doctor said, "Lily, we need to cover you with a big blanket so we can take a picture of your arm." Lily asked, "Will it hurt?" The doctor shook his head and said, "No, it won't hurt at all."
After the x-ray, the doctor looked at the picture and said, "Lily, you have a small boo-boo in your arm. You need to be careful and not be naughty with it." Lily nodded her head and said, "Okay, I will be careful." Her mommy gave her a big hug and said, "I'm proud of you for being brave at the doctor's office."
Lily and her mommy left the doctor's office and went to get an ice cream cone. Lily felt happy because she wasn't scared of the doctor and she knew she had to be careful with her arm. She also felt proud of herself for being a good listener.
