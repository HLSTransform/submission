Bob was feeling troubled. His work seemed to increase everyday. He felt overwhelmed and didn't know what to do. He decided to talk to his best friend, Jenny. 
"Hi Jenny," Bob said. "I'm feeling troubled. My work is too much and it keeps increasing. Can you help me?"
Bob waited for Jenny's reply. 
 
"Of course," Jenny said. She gave Bob a big smile. "Let's figure this out together. We can take smaller steps to finish your work faster." 
Bob and Jenny got to work. They talked, thought and figured out the best way to manage everything. Soon, Bob's work was done and he felt much better. 
"Thanks Jenny," Bob said. "You helped me a lot. I'm glad I told you." 
"That's what friends are for," Jenny said. She gave Bob a hug and they both smiled. 
And with that, Bob's troubles were gone.
