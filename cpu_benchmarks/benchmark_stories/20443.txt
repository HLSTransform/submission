Once upon a time there was a dad who was planning a surprise. He dressed up in his best boots, grabbed his tidy bag, and went outside. He drove to the park and sat down on a bench. Then he saw a little girl with her mum, who had brought a present. Dad planned to give the present to the little girl.
He opened the tidy bag and took out a shiny red boot. The little girl's eyes lit up with excitement when she saw it! She put on the boot and ran around the park. Everyone laughed as they watched her twirling and dancing. Then, dad gave her a big hug and they went home. 
The little girl wore her shiny new boots every day, and whenever she put them on, she remembered the surprise her dad had planned for her.
