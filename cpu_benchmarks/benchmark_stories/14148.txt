Once upon a time there was a bear named Glad. He was always so full of excitement each day. He wanted to explore the world around him.
One morning, Glad went outside to play. He saw a big, bright tree with lots of leaves everywhere. He noticed that the leaves had a pretty pattern all over them. He wanted to display it to everyone around him.
Glad decides to show his family how beautiful the leaves were. When he told them what he saw, his family was so glad. They ran outside and were amazed to see the beautiful patterns all over the tree. 
They all enjoyed looking at the leaves together. It was a pretty pattern that made everyone feel so glad.  Shortly after, it began to rain, so they all quickly ran back inside.
But Glad had found something magical that day. He had seen a display of patterns that made everyone around him glad.
