Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the garden and look at the flowers. One day, they saw a big cross made of wood. It was near the fence, where the roses grew.
"What is that?" Lily asked.
"I don't know," Ben said. "Maybe it is for the roses. Maybe they need something to hold on to."
They went closer to the cross and touched it. It was rough and hard. They saw some nails on it. They wondered who put it there and why.
The next day, they came back to the garden. They saw something amazing. The roses had bloomed. They were red and pink and white. They smelled sweet and looked pretty. They covered the cross with their petals and leaves.
"Wow!" Lily said. "The roses are so happy! They like the cross!"
"Yes, they do," Ben said. "The cross is their friend. It helps them grow and be strong."
They smiled and hugged each other. They picked some roses and gave them to their moms. They said thank you to the cross. They felt fit and glad. They loved the garden and the flowers.
