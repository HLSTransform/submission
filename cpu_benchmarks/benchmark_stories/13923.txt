Once upon a time, in a big castle, there was a smart queen. She loved to help her people. One day, she went for a walk in the forest.
In the forest, she saw a small cat. The cat looked lost and sad. The queen said, "Hello, little cat! Why are you sad?" The cat told the queen that it could not find its way home.
The smart queen had an idea. She took out her magic wand and made a path appear. The cat was very happy. The queen said, "Follow this path, and you will find your home."
The cat thanked the queen and went on its way. The queen felt good for helping the cat. The people in the castle heard the story and learned to help each other, too. They all lived happily ever after.
The moral of the story is: always help others when they need it.
