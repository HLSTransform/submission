Ben likes to pretend he is a truck driver. He has a big toy truck that he can sit in and steer. He makes loud noises like a truck horn and engine. He drives his truck around the yard and delivers boxes and rocks to his friends.
One day, he sees a real truck parked on the street. It is shiny and red and has a big trailer. Ben wants to see the truck up close. He leaves his toy truck and runs to the real truck. He climbs on the wheel and looks inside the window. He sees a lot of buttons and levers and a radio.
He hears a voice behind him. It is the truck driver. He is angry and tells Ben to get off his truck. He says he is not lazy and he has to deliver his goods. He says Ben's toy truck is better for pretending. He takes Ben off his wheel and puts him down.
Ben feels sad and scared. He runs back to his toy truck and hugs it. He says he is sorry for leaving it. He says he likes his toy truck more than the real truck. He says he will never pretend to be a real truck driver again. He drives his toy truck to his friends and plays with them. He is happy and has fun.
