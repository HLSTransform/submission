A boy named Jack was walking outside. He saw a regular motor lying by the side of the street. He was very curious and wanted to pick it up.
Suddenly, an old man came up to him and offered to let him have it. Jack was so excited and thanked the man. He took the motor and started playing with it. 
Jack soon realized that the motor was broken. He started to feel very sad. The old man noticed Jack's childish disappointment and offered to take him to his garage. 
Jack agreed and followed the old man. In the garage the old man fixed the motor with the help of some tools. After the motor was fixed, the old man offered it to Jack as a present. 
Jack was so happy and thanked the old man for his kind gesture. He happily took the motor home, and from that day forward, his regular motor was his best friend.
