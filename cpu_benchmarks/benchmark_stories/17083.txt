Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy called Mr. Rubber. Mr. Rubber was a fake frog that Lily loved to play with. They would jump and play all day long.
One day, Lily said to Mr. Rubber, "I wish you could grow big like a real frog!" Mr. Rubber did not say anything because he was a toy. But Lily believed that if she wished hard enough, her toy frog would grow.
The next morning, Lily woke up and saw that Mr. Rubber had not grown. She felt sad but did not give up. She took Mr. Rubber outside and said, "Let's play in the sun. Maybe you will grow then!" They played all day, but Mr. Rubber still did not grow.
At bedtime, Lily told her mom about her wish. Her mom said, "Mr. Rubber is a toy and cannot grow. But you can pretend he is a big frog when you play." Lily smiled and hugged Mr. Rubber. She knew he was fake, but she loved him just the same.
