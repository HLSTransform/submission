One day, a fast dog named Spot and a slow turtle named Tim were friends. They liked to play together. They wanted to send a letter to their friend, Cat. But they needed a stamp to send the letter.
Spot said, "I will go to the store to get a stamp. I am fast." Tim said, "I will support you, Spot. I will wait here."
Spot ran to the store very fast. But there was a big rock in the way. Spot could not jump over the rock. He was sad. Tim came and saw Spot was sad.
Tim said, "I will help you, Spot. We can go around the rock together." Spot said, "Thank you, Tim." They went around the rock and got the stamp. They sent the letter to Cat. They were happy friends.
