It was the night before Christmas and George was so excited! He put on his pajamas and went to bed. George was hoping Santa would come to his house.
Suddenly, George heard a sound outside. He got out of bed and looked out the window. He smiled as he saw a reindeer appear in the sky. He was so big and gentle.
George shouted with glee, "Look, mama! I see a reindeer!"
Mama ran over to the window. She said, "You're right, George! That must mean Santa is coming too. Let's go outside and wait for him."
George and mama put on their coats and went out to the front yard. George was so excited. Soon enough, he saw Santa appear in the sky. He was riding in a sleigh full of presents and he waved to George and mama.
George smiled as he waved back. It was the best night of his life!
