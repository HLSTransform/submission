Jack was playing in the park. He looked around and spotted a big slide. He wanted to slide down, but he was scared. He could not see the bottom of the slide, and it looked high.
Jack's mom saw his hesitation and encouraged him. 
"Come on, Jack," she said, "you can do it - surrender your fear and you will win the slide!"
Jack thought about it and agreed. He took a deep breath, walked up the steps and slowly made his way to the top of the slide. To his relief, it was easy to slide down and soon he emerged at the bottom with a big smile. 
His mom was waiting for him. "Well done," she said, "you have won the slide! Wasn't it easy?"
Jack was so proud. He had conquered his fear and won the slide. He smiled and said, "Yes, it was easy!"
