Once there was a tight purple balloon. It floated around in the sky and looked very pretty. One day, a naughty bird flew by and it wanted to play with the balloon. The bird grabbed the balloon tight in its claws and flew away.
The bird flew higher and higher and took the balloon with it. It flew over a big forest and the balloon kept getting smaller and smaller. The bird kept flying and soon the balloon was all gone.
The bird had stolen the balloon. But it had a surprise when it opened its claws. Inside were lots of pretty purple stars that fell down and sparkled in the sky!
The naughty bird had stolen the balloon, but it was very happy to see the stars in its place.
