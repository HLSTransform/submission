Once upon a time, there was a queen. She lived in a big castle with many rooms. One day, she invited all the animals in the forest to come to her castle. They were very happy and excited to meet the queen.
When they arrived at the castle, the queen came out to greet them. She was wearing a beautiful dress and a crown on her head. The animals were so impressed that they started to applaud.
One little rabbit, however, did not applaud. The queen asked him why he was not clapping. The rabbit said, "I don't want to applaud for someone who is selfish." The queen was surprised and asked the rabbit to explain. The rabbit said, "You only care about yourself and your castle. You don't help the animals in the forest who need food and shelter." The queen realized the rabbit was right and promised to be less selfish from that day forward.
