Once upon a time, there was a big boat. The boat liked to sail on the water. One day, a man wanted to sail the boat. The man did not know much about boats. He was ignorant.
The man saw a big pit in the water. He did not know what it was. The boat tried to tell the man about the pit, but the man did not listen. The boat was scared.
The man sailed the boat right into the pit. The boat sank into the water. The man was very sad. The boat was gone. The man learned he should listen and learn before sailing a boat.
