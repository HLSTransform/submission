Once upon a time, there was a little three year old girl named Lily. She liked to go to the park with her mom. They would play on the swings and run around, and sometimes even laugh at the funny squirrels.
Today, however, Lily was feeling kind of nervous. She was sitting on the bench with her mom, watching the other kids running around and clapping. Lily was very quiet and she kept fidgeting with the cushion she was sitting on.
Suddenly, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to join the other children and play. Lily stopped fidgeting and looked up at her mom, wide-eyed. Lily was so nervous, but she really wanted to join them.
So, finally, Lily nodded. Her mom smiled and said, "Let's go clap with them." Lily smiled too, and the mother and daughter stood up and clapped together. Soon, Lily was clapping and laughing, forgetting how nervous she was before. The other children clapped with them, and it was a wonderful, happy moment.
