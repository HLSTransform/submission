Jemma was a big girl, three years old and very brave. She wanted to play with her friends at the park, but it was all so dirty. Everywhere she looked the grass was mucky and the sand was gritty. But Jemma didn't give in.
Jemma decided to make her own game. She used a stick to mark a goal in the sand. She and her friends took turns taking shots at the goal by throwing pebbles. Jemma cheered every time her friends made a shot.
The game was going well until a big, mean cat came by. It jump over the goal and even tried to take the stick. Jemma had to be brave and take a stand. She clapped her hands and yelled so loud at the cat that it ran away in a fright.
Jemma and her friends cheered. They were so proud of their brave leader. The game was able to continue and the goal was made even stronger. The cat never came back and Jemma was proud of her goal. The game was a success and everyone had great fun.
