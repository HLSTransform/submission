Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max was a very busy dog. Today, Max wanted to spend time with his best friend, a little cat named Luna.
Max went to Luna's house and said, "Luna, do you want to play today?" Luna said, "Yes, Max! Let's play outside."
They played all day under the sun. They ran, jumped, and laughed. Max and Luna were very happy to spend the day together. At the end of the day, they were both very tired but had so much fun.
