Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Sarah. Sarah loved the fall time, it was her favourite time of year. One special day, Sarah was looking out her window and it was very beautiful outside. All the trees were turning yellow and orange, and the leaves were falling.
Sarah wanted to send some of the leaves to her friends as a surprise. So she opened up the window and carefully started to pick up some of the fallen leaves.
Just then, her mommy came in the room with a big smile.
Mommy: "What are you up to Sarah?"
Sarah: "I am sending leaves to my friends."
Mommy: "That is so sweet, but how will you send them?"
Sarah looked around the room and saw her toy mail box.
Sarah: "I can put the leaves in this box and give it to my friends!"
Sarah carefully put the leaves in the mail box and gave it to all of her friends. They all loved it, and it was such a great way to share the beauty of fall with them all.
