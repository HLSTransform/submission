Once upon a time, there was a march of four animals. There was a brave bird, a curious fox, a shy deer and a helpful bear. They all wanted to go to the mill, but they had never been there before.
The brave bird took the lead and started marching. The other animals followed behind, but even with the helpful bear guiding the way, they soon got lost.
Suddenly, the curious fox stopped and said, "I smell something, it smells like the mill!" So, the march of animals followed their noses until they reached the mill.
When they arrived at the mill, the animals were so happy. All the animals cheered and the helpful bear said, "We did it! We found the mill!"
