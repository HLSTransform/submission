One day, a fat cat named Tom found a ball of yarn. He wanted to play with it. Tom tried to open the door to get the yarn, but it was too high for him. He jumped and jumped, but he could not reach the door handle.
Tom saw his friend, a small dog named Max. Tom said to Max, "Can you help me open the door? I want to play with the yarn." Max said, "Yes, I can help you!" Max jumped high and opened the door for Tom.
Tom and Max went inside and found the yarn. They played with the yarn all day. They rolled it and chased it. They were very happy. At the end of the day, Tom said to Max, "Thank you for helping me. We had fun!" Max said, "You're welcome, Tom. Let's play again tomorrow!"
