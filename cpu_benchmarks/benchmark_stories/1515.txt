Once upon a time, there lived a purple monster. He lived in a far away forest and was lonely - he had no friends. One day, the purple monster had a special delivery. When he opened the box he found a magical purple ball. 
He was so excited and decided to show his new toy to the world. He called his new friends - the birds, the squirrels and the foxes – to come and play. They all had lots of fun bouncing and throwing the ball.
They even made up a game called ‘Delivery’. They took it in turns delivering the ball to each other. When the sun went down, the purple monster had made lots of new friends. He was so happy and never lonely again.
