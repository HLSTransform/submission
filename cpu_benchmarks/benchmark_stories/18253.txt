Once upon a time, there was a man who liked to jog. He would go outside and run around the park every day. One day, he met a woman who became his wife. She was very sleepy and would often take naps during the day. The man loved his wife very much and would always bring her a glass of water before she went to sleep. They lived happily ever after and continued to jog together every day.
