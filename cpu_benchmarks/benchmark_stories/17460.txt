Ben and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to look for bugs and flowers. Ben saw a big red bug with black spots. He wanted to catch it and show Lily.
"Look, Lily, a red bug!" he said. He ran after the bug and tried to grab it.
But the bug did not like that. It pinched Ben's finger with its hard mouth. Ben cried out loud. It hurt a lot.
"Ow, ow, ow!" he said. He dropped the bug and shook his finger.
Lily heard Ben's cry. She ran to him and saw his finger. It was red and swollen.
"Are you okay, Ben?" she asked. She felt sorry for him.
"No, it hurts!" he said. He showed her his finger.
Lily had an idea. She remembered that her mom had a bell in the kitchen. She said it was useful for making noise and calling people.
"I'll get the bell!" she said. She ran to the kitchen and got the bell. She came back to Ben and rang the bell.
Ding, ding, ding! The bell made a loud and happy sound. Ben heard the bell and looked at Lily. He saw her smiling and holding the bell.
"What's that?" he asked.
"It's a bell!" she said. "It makes noise and makes you feel better. Here, you can ring it too!"
She gave the bell to Ben. He took it and rang it. Ding, ding, ding! He liked the sound. He smiled and forgot about his finger.
"Thank you, Lily!" he said. "You are a good friend. The bell is useful and fun!"
They hugged and played with the bell. They forgot about the bug and the pinch. They were happy.
