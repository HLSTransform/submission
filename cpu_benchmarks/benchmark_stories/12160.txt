Once upon a time there was a cheeky bird named Joe. Joe was very clever and liked to fly around and explore. He often landed on high branches or rooftops, to get a better view of the world around him. 
One day, he landed on the top of a tall tree and saw a butterfly fluttering around. Joe cocked his head to one side and asked the butterfly a question:"Why are you flying around so fast?" 
The butterfly stopped and looked at Joe curiously. She thought it was a clever question and wanted to answer it. She said, "I am just trying to find somewhere to be happy and have fun - that is why I am moving so quickly!"
Joe thought about this for a moment, then said, "Maybe we can be happy in the same place - if we fly together, we will both have lots of fun!" 
The butterfly agreed and the two of them fluttered away, side by side. The moral is this - when you're clever and tolerant, you can find happiness in unexpected places.
