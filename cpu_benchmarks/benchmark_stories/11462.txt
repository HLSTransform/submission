Once upon a time, there was a popular copper robot named Copper. Copper loved to speak to everyone. 
One day, Copper went to the park. At the park, he noticed two children playing nearby. Copper decided to join in on the fun. 
He waved and said, “Hello! What’s your name?”
The two children stared at Copper, surprised to see a robot. One of the kids, a little girl, smiled and said, “Hi! My name is Izzy. What’s your name?”
Copper replied, “My name is Copper. I love to be popular.” 
The other kid, a little boy, laughed. “It’s weird that you can talk!”
All three of them laughed together. 
The two children and Copper played together for the rest of the day. They became firm friends and spoke to each other again soon. 
In the end, Copper was very popular in the park.
