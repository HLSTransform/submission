Bobby was in his bedroom, staring out of the window. It was morning, and the sky was a beautiful blue. The sun shone brightly, and the birds sang in the trees. Everywhere, there were peaceful sounds.
Suddenly, Bobby noticed a rabbit! It was hopping around in the garden, munching on some tasty leaves. Bobby couldn't believe his eyes. He stared in wonder as the rabbit hopped around.
Then, the rabbit stopped and looked right at Bobby! Bobby couldn't help but smile. He kept staring at the rabbit until it hopped away.
Finally, Bobby turned away from the window. He felt peaceful and happy inside. It was going to be a beautiful day.
