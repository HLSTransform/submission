Once upon a time, there was a wise old man who lived on a street. He knew how to fix many things. People liked him because he was very helpful.
One day, a girl had a broken toy. She was very sad. The wise old man saw her and said, "Don't worry, I can repair your toy." The girl was happy and gave him her toy. The wise old man fixed it and gave it back to her. She was very thankful.
From that day on, the wise old man helped everyone on the street. He repaired many things for them. The people on the street were always happy because they knew the wise old man was there to help them.
