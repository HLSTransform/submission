Once upon a time there was a little girl called Sophie. Sophie had a big job to do. She had to organize the toys in her room. It was not easy, the toys were all over the place. 
Sophie took a deep breath and started to work. She moved all the toys into one corner. Then, she started to put the toys away. She put the cars in the box and the dolls in the drawer. 
Sophie was getting tired, so she decided to take a break. She looked up and realized that something else was still out of place. On the wall, there were some pictures that were not in order. Sophie was so determined that she decided to organize them too. 
She began with the face at the top. It was a happy face, so she placed it in the middle. Then she worked around it, putting the other faces in order. Soon, all the faces were in the right place. 
Sophie was so proud of her work that her face lit up. She knew that organizing can be a heavy job, but she was so happy with the results. Maybe organizing isn't so bad after all.
