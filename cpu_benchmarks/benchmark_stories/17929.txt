Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. Jack lived next to the ocean and loved watching the waves come onto the shore. One day, Jack decided to go to the shore. He was so excited to touch the sand!
As he walked closer, Jack noticed something very interesting on the shore. It was a funny-looking clam! He wanted to pick it up, but his mom said he should not touch it. She insisted he stay away.
Jack was very sad, but he listened to his mom and stayed away. Then, he heard another voice. It was the clam! The clam told him that it was okay and he could pick it up. Jack was so happy and he talked to the clam and they were friends. 
Jack went to the beach every day to visit his new friend. He even brought more of his friends to the beach so they could meet the interesting clam too! They had lots of fun playing together all summer. 
Jack and his friends had a wonderful summer, thanks to the persistent clam!
