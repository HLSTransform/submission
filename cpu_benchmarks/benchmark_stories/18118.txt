Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a big orange ball that he loved to play with. One day, Timmy decided to tie the ball to his wrist so he wouldn't lose it. But when he threw the ball, it flew away and pulled Timmy with it! 
Timmy's mommy saw what happened and quickly ran to him. She told him to release the ball from his wrist so he wouldn't get hurt. Timmy listened to his mommy and let go of the ball. It flew high into the sky and Timmy watched it until it was too small to see anymore. 
Timmy was sad that he lost his ball, but his mommy gave him a hug and said they could get a new one together. Timmy smiled and felt better knowing he had his mommy to help him. From that day on, Timmy never tied anything to his wrist again.
