Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside on Sundays. One day, she went to the park with her mommy and daddy. She ran and played on the slide and swings. 
But then, Lily's feet slipped on the wet grass and she fell down. She cried and her parents came to help her. They saw that Lily's knee was bleeding a little bit, but it was not too bad. 
Lily's face was pale and she did not want to play anymore. Her parents took her home and gave her a band-aid for her knee. They cuddled with her on the couch and watched her favorite movie. Lily felt better and was happy to spend time with her family. The end.
