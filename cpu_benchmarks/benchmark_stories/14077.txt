Once upon a time there were two people. One was called Tom and the other was Jackie. Tom was a nice person and often did nice things. Jackie was jealous of Tom, because he wanted to do the same things.
One day, Tom did something special. He drew a picture for Jackie. Jackie was very happy and it made her smile. Tom was happy too.
Afterwards, Jackie asked Tom if she could do something special too. Tom said yes and helped her draw a picture. This made Jackie feel very special.
The next day, Tom did something really kind. He gave Jackie a present. Jackie was so excited and thanked Tom. This made Tom feel really happy.
Afterwards, Jackie was no longer jealous of Tom. She was happy that he was doing nice things and she was happy to be doing nice things too.
