One day, a little boy named Tim went to the farm with his mom. They wanted to observe the animals. Tim saw a big goat. The goat was elderly and had a long beard. Tim liked the goat very much.
"Mom, can I touch the goat?" Tim asked. His mom said, "Yes, but be gentle." Tim slowly touched the goat's soft fur. The goat made a funny sound, "Baa-aa-aa!" Tim laughed and the goat seemed happy too.
Every day, Tim and his mom visited the elderly goat. They fed it, and Tim played with it. They became good friends. The goat and Tim had many fun days together at the farm.
