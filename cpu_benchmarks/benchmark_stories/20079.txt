Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Benny. Benny was always hungry and loved to eat honey. One day, he ate too much honey and got a stomach ache. His mom gave him some medicine to help him feel better.
Benny learned his lesson and didn't eat too much honey again. He also realized that it's important to listen to his mom when she tells him not to eat too much. 
One day, Benny's friend Timmy came to visit him. Timmy was also very hungry and wanted to eat all the honey in Benny's house. But Benny remembered his lesson and told Timmy that they should only have a little bit of honey so they don't get sick.
The moral of the story is that it's important to listen to your parents and not eat too much, even if you're really hungry. And it's always good to share your food with your friends when they come to visit.
