One day, two hungry little bunnies were hopping through a field. They were very eager to find something to eat and spotted some corn. They hopped closer, their eyes bright and eager to eat the corn. 
Suddenly, a little dog came running towards them and barked and the bunnies quickly hopped away, scared. They didn't want the dog to get the corn! 
The bunnies hopped all around, looking for a way to come back and get the corn. Suddenly, the little dog disappeared and the bunnies saw their chance. They quickly hopped back and eagerly ate the corn, happy to have found something to eat. 
The bunnies were full and content, and they hopped away back to their burrow. They were very grateful they were able to come back and get the corn, despite the little dog. They were glad to have something to eat.
