Once upon a time there was a girl called Lucy. She was three and very happy. Every day she did something different.
One day, she found a puzzle. It had lots of pieces and was very colourful. She was so excited!
She sat down and started to put all the pieces together. Lucy was so clever and she finished it quickly.
Once she had finished it, she saw a charming little bird on the puzzle. The bird was waving at her with its wings.
Lucy waved back and the bird flew away, leaving Lucy with her puzzle. She was very happy.
