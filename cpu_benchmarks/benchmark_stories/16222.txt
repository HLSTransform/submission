Jack was on the subway with his mum. He was very excited about going to the beach. All the other people were looking at him, and Jack felt very happy.
Suddenly, though, the subway stopped. Everyone was quiet and couldn't understand why the train had stopped. Jack's mum explained that the delay was because of repairs. Everyone else was grumpy about the delay. 
Jack, however, was very envious. He thought it was quite exciting to stop on the train. He looked out the window and saw so many people walking around in the sunshine. Jack just wanted to get out and explore. 
They finally arrived at the beach and Jack ran off to find a place to explore. He was so happy that the delay hadn't stopped his plans.
