Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide and swing. They saw a big oak tree with many leaves and acorns. They decided to climb the tree and see how high they could go.
"Look, Lily, I can reach this branch!" Tom said, pulling himself up.
"Wow, Tom, you are very brave!" Lily said, following him. "Can you see the birds and the sky?"
"Yes, Lily, I can see them. They are very pretty!" Tom said, looking around.
They climbed higher and higher, until they reached the top of the tree. They felt the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They smiled and laughed and hugged each other.
"Tom, Lily, it's time to go home!" their mom called from below. "Come down, please!"
"OK, mom, we are coming!" Tom and Lily said. They decided to climb down the tree carefully and slowly. They did not want to fall or hurt themselves.
They reached the ground and ran to their mom. They were very tired from climbing the tree, but also very happy. They hugged their mom and thanked her for taking them to the park.
"Did you have fun, Tom and Lily?" their mom asked.
"Yes, mom, we had a lot of fun!" Tom and Lily said. "We climbed the big oak tree and saw the birds and the sky!"
"That's wonderful, my loves!" their mom said. "Now let's go home and have some snacks and rest. You must be hungry and sleepy!"
Tom and Lily nodded and held their mom's hand. They walked home, talking about their adventure in the park. They decided they liked the big oak tree very much. They hoped to climb it again soon.
