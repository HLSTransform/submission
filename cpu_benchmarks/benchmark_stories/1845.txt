Once upon a time there was a bossy little girl named Lily. She was very excited one day because it was time to decorate her room. Lily climbed up on a chair and started to hang colorful pictures on the wall with some help from her mom. 
Next, the two measured how high to hang the pictures with a ruler. They wanted to make sure the pictures were even. 
Finally, it was time to put up the pretty curtains. Lily was bossy again, telling her mom to open them wide so all of the sunshine could come in. 
When they were finished, Lily was so proud of all their hard work. Her room looked beautiful and it was all thanks to their decorating. The End!
