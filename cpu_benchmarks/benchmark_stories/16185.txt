John was an eager friend who liked to rise early and play in the park. One day, he happily opened his eyes and quickly jumped out of bed. He raced to the park to find it empty. Suddenly, he heard a noise coming from the other side.
John shouted, "Who's there?"
A voice shouted back, "It's me, Lucy! I wanted to come early so we can play together."
John smiled and said, "Great idea! Let's have lots of fun." 
Lucy was equally as eager and the two quickly rushed to the play area. Here, they would run, climb and explore for hours, always finding something new each time. 
John and Lucy were the best of friends and were the first to rise each morning so they could start the day with fun in the park.
