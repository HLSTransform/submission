Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat spicy food and she would always ask her mom to make her food extra spicy. One day, Lily's mom made her a big plate of spicy noodles for lunch. 
As Lily was eating her noodles, she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her mouth. She realized that she had accidentally swallowed a spicy chili pepper whole! Lily started to panic and cry. Her mom knew it was an emergency and quickly called the doctor. 
When the doctor arrived, he knew just what to do. He gave Lily a special medicine that would make the spicy feeling go away. Before leaving, the doctor gave Lily a big kiss on the forehead and told her to be more careful when eating spicy food. From that day on, Lily always made sure to chew her food carefully before swallowing.
