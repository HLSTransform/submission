Once there was a little girl who lived in a small house with a porch. She was eager to explore and play outside, so one day she went out to her porch and found a fierce-looking animal. She didn't recognize it, but she was brave and wanted to make friends.
"Hi there," she said. "My name is Henrietta. What's yours?"
The animal blinked and looked at her. He seemed unsure if he could trust her.
"You can trust me," she said. "I just want to be your friend. I won't hurt you. Please tell me your name."
The animal stepped closer and sniffed her. She didn't run away, but smiled. "My name is Max," he said. 
Henrietta smiled. "Max? That's a nice name," she said.
Max recognized that she was friendly and kind. He felt relieved, and the two of them became fast friends. They played together for hours on the porch. 
From that day on, Henrietta and Max were always together. Whenever Henrietta went out to her porch, Max was there too, greeting her with a loving meow.
