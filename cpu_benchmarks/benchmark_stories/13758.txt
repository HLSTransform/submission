Lila was a cat who liked to carry her tail high in the air. She thought it made her look graceful and proud. She liked to walk around the garden and show off her tail to the birds and the bugs.
One day, she saw a big dog in the garden. The dog was barking and running after a ball. Lila did not like the dog. She thought he was loud and clumsy. She wanted to scare him away. She decided to carry her tail even higher and hiss at him.
The dog saw Lila and stopped barking. He tilted his head and wagged his tail. He thought Lila wanted to play with him. He ran towards her and said, "Hi, cat! Do you want to play with me? You have a nice tail!"
Lila was angry and afraid. She did not want to play with the dog. She wanted him to leave her alone. She tried to run away, but the dog was faster. He caught up with her and grabbed her tail with his mouth. He thought it was a toy.
Lila screamed and scratched the dog's nose. The dog yelped and let go of her tail. But it was too late. Lila's tail was broken and bleeding. She limped to the house and hid under the sofa. She was sad and hurt. She wished she had not carried her tail so high. She wished she had left the dog alone.
