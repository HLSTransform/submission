Once upon a time, there was a pink cow named Rosie. Rosie loved to eat grass and play with her friends. One day, Rosie's friend Billy the bull told her that he heard a scary story about what happens to cows when they get too big. He said they get sent away to a place called the "slaughterhouse" and never come back.
Rosie didn't understand what Billy meant, so she asked her mommy. Her mommy explained that sometimes cows get turned into beef for people to eat. Rosie was very sad and scared. She didn't want to be turned into beef!
So, Rosie decided to eat less and exercise more so she wouldn't get too big. She also told all her cow friends to do the same. They all worked together to stay healthy and happy. And because they were so healthy, they never had to worry about being turned into beef.
The moral of the story is to take care of your body and be healthy. And if you work together with your friends, you can accomplish anything!
