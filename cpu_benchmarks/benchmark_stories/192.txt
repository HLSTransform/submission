Anna and Ben were friends who liked to play in the garden. They had a small plant that they watered every day. The plant had green leaves and purple flowers.
One day, Anna was feeling bossy. She wanted to water the plant by herself. She said to Ben, "Go away, this is my plant. You can't touch it."
Ben was sad and angry. He said, "No, it is our plant. We share it. You are not nice."
Anna and Ben started to fight. They pulled the plant from each other. The plant was hurt. Some of the leaves and flowers fell off.
Anna and Ben stopped fighting. They saw the plant and felt sorry. They said to the plant, "We are sorry, plant. We did not mean to hurt you. Please forgive us."
The plant did not say anything. But it still looked alive. Anna and Ben decided to be nice to each other and to the plant. They hugged and said, "We are friends. We share the plant. We are not bossy."
They watered the plant together and put it in a sunny spot. The plant was happy. It grew new leaves and flowers. Anna and Ben were happy too. They played in the garden and took care of the plant. They learned to forgive and share.
