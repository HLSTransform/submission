Once upon a time, there was a little girl who didn't know where to go. She needed the toilet. She looked around but could not find one - she did not know where the toilet was. 
She asked her Mom for help. Her Mom told her that there should be a toilet around but she did not know where. 
The girl went on a hunt. She searched up and down the street, but found nothing. Finally, after a while, she saw something. It was a big sign that said "Toilet Available". She was so excited - she knew where to find her toilet. 
She ran to the toilet and was so pleased to find it available. She rushed to use it and then came out feeling relieved. From then on, the toilet was always available to her. 
The little girl was happy. She now knew where the toilet was - and she didnâ€™t have to worry about being caught short again!
