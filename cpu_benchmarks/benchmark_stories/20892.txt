Once there was a playful little girl. She liked to go outside and play. She would run around in the green grass and on the soft ground. She would also have fun hopping and twirling.
Sometimes she liked to bring a bucket and a shovel when she went outside. She would then dig holes in the ground and fill them with dirt and sand.
The little girl also liked to watch the birds in the sky fly around. She liked to feel the sunshine and to smell the fresh air. She was always very playful and happy.
One day, she decided to explore the ground. She walked and walked over the grass and rocks until she found a little pond. It had ducks swimming around in it! The little girl was so excited. She watched the ducks for a long time.
The next day, the little girl decided to go back and explore the ground again. Who knows what she would find the next time?
