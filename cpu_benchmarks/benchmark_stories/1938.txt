Once upon a time there was a university that glowed. It was so very cheerful, making everyone around it smile.
One day, a little girl came to explore the university. She was so excited to see such a happy place. Everywhere she looked, the university glowed. It made her so delighted.
When she was inside, the girl made a new friend - a puppy! Together, they played different games and laughed together. As they laughed, the university glowed even more.
The little girl had so much fun that she didn't want to leave. But soon the sun had set and the university stopped glowing.
The little girl said goodbye to her puppy friend and went home. She was so cheerful and happy that she had visited the wonderful university with it's special glow.
