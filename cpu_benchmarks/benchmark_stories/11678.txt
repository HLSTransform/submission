Once upon a time there was a great yacht. It was very comfortable and sailed on the blue sea. One day a small bird flew down to the yacht and asked the people for help. The people said yes and made the bird a comfortable home in the yacht.
The bird liked the new home and thanked the people for helping him. The bird was so happy that he decided to help the people too. Every day the bird found things from the sea to build a nice home for the people. He also brought food from the sea so the people could eat.
One day the people wanted to thank the bird for helping them. They built a safe place on the yacht for the bird and all his friends. The bird and his friends were so happy and thanked the people for helping them.
The moral of the story is that when you help someone, others will help you too. So always help others and kindness will come your way.
