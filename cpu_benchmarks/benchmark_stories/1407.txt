Once there was a boy named Fred. He was 3 years old. One day, he decided to invite his friends over for a playdate. He asked his mom for some olives to share with his friends.
Fred's mom gave him some olives and he put them on the table. He then went outside to wait for his friends to arrive.
It started to rain and soon the olives got wet. Fred was so disappointed!
Fred's friends still came over and he was really happy. He invited them to play in the rain and they had lots of fun.
After the playdate, the olives had dried out and Fred was able to eat some with his friends. They had a great time together!
