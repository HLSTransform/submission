Once upon a time there were two friends, Sam and Jane. Sam always had strong ideas, so one day he decided to supply them to Jane.
"I have a plan," said Sam. "Let's go outside and build a bridge together."
Jane smiled. She liked Sam's ideas, so she agreed.
The two friends went outside and started building their bridge. Sam found strong logs and Jane dug deep holes to put them in. Finally, after lots of hard work, their bridge was finished!
"Look! Our bridge is complete!" exclaimed Sam.
The result was strong and impressive, thanks to their hard work. They crossed the bridge and felt proud of themselves.
"Thanks for your ideas and help, Sam!" said Jane. "Our bridge was a success." 
Sam smiled. "It was our success," he said.
