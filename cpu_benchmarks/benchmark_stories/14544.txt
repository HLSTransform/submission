Little Jack was very scared. He was playing hockey for the first time and he was afraid. His legs trembled as he slowly stepped on the ice. He did not want to fall and hurt himself. His dad grabbed his hand tightly and told him not to be scared. 
The bigger players skated fast and Jack was scared they might bump into him. But his dad held him tightly so he knew he was safe. His dad pointed out the goal at the other end and encouraged him to skate. 
Jack was hesitate but he started to slowly skate. Little by little he became more and more confident. He moved his legs faster and enjoyed himself. He did not feel scared at all.
Before long, Jack was skating faster than ever! He was proud of himself and happy that he had conquered his fears. He smiled as he stopped skating and looked up at his dad. Together they laughed as Jack skated off the ice, no longer trembling with fear.
