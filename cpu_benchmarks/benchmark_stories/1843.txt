Once upon a time there were two very good friends called Tony and Isabella. They were always creative and very adventurous. One day they decided to take a walk and explore the world. 
As they walked, they saw a bright light shining in the distance. It was so bright that it lit up the whole sky! Tony turned to Isabella and said "let's go and explore the light!" They walked carefully and soon they arrived by the bright light.
They saw that it was a foot shining. It was the most creative and scariest thing they had ever seen. Tony was very brave and he touched the foot while Isabella was too scared to try. Tony said to Isabella: "It's okay, you don't have to be worried. Let's touch it together!"
They touched it together and were surprised to find that it felt warm and comforting. They realized that it was just a friendly foot and not something to be scared of. They laughed and smiled and soon the two were on their way again, exploring more of the world.
