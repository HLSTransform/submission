Once upon a time there was a girl named Lucy. She was a brave girl and loved to explore. One day, Lucy decided to climb the high hill. As she started to climb, Lucy got very muddy. She looked at the mud and decided she still wanted to go up the hill. 
At the peak, she saw a giant tree. The tree, bigger than Lucy had ever seen before, was full of ripe fruits. Lucy wanted to pick the fruits and started to climb the tree. 
But she was scared of falling. She was too high and thought she might get hurt. The wind was strong and it made the tree shake. 
Then a small bird came up to Lucy. He told her to trust in him and his wings. He said he could help her to the top. Lucy hesitated but finally trusted the small bird. 
With the bird's help, Lucy was able to reach the fruits of the tree. She was so happy that she made it. Lucy thanked the little bird and they became friends.
