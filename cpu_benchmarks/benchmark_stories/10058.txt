Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big tree with many leaves. They run to the tree and hug it.
"Look, Anna, the leaves are light green. They are new," Ben says.
"Yes, they are. And they are soft, too. Can you hear them?" Anna asks.
They put their ears to the tree and listen. They hear a soft rustle. It is the wind spreading the leaves.
"Wow, they make a nice sound. Like a song," Ben says.
Anna nods. She likes the sound, too. She closes her eyes and smiles.
They stay by the tree for a long time. They feel happy and calm. They are friends with the tree and the wind.
