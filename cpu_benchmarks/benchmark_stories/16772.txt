Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a new cross on the road. The cross is red and green and yellow. It has a button.
"What is that?" Tom asks.
"I don't know. Let's go and see," Sue says.
They hold hands and walk to the cross. They press the button. The cross makes a beep sound. Then the red light turns green.
"Look, the light changed!" Tom says.
"Yes, it did. Maybe we can cross the road now," Sue says.
They look both ways. There are no cars. They cross the road safely.
"That was fun!" Tom says.
"Yes, it was. Let's do it again!" Sue says.
They press the button and wait for the light to change. They cross the road again and again. They are happy. They discuss the new cross and how it works. They think it is a magic cross. They don't know it is a traffic light.
