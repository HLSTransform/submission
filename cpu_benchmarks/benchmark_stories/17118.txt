Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to school because she had a special folder that she kept all her papers in. One day, Lily was very excited because she had a big test at school. She studied very hard and felt confident that she would get a good grade.
When it was time for the test, Lily sat down at her desk and opened her folder. But to her surprise, she realized that she had forgotten to bring her pencil! She started to panic and didn't know what to do. But then she remembered what her teacher had told her: "Always be prepared for anything."
Lily took a deep breath and asked her friend if she could borrow a pencil. She finished the test and felt proud of herself for remembering the important lesson of being prepared. From that day on, Lily always made sure to double-check that she had everything she needed before going to school.
