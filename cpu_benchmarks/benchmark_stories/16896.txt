Anna liked to play with her pink ball. She would throw it and catch it and bounce it and roll it. She had fun with her ball every day.
One day, Anna saw a big flower in the garden. It was yellow and smelled nice. Anna wanted to smell the flower, so she went closer and put her nose on it. But the flower had a lot of dust on it, and the dust tickled Anna's nose.
Anna felt a big sneeze coming. She tried to stop it, but she could not. She sneezed so hard that her pink ball flew out of her hand and into the air. She watched as her ball went higher and higher, until it was as small as a zero.
Anna was sad. She lost her pink ball. She did not know how to get it back. She cried and cried and wished she had not sneezed.
But then, she heard a voice. It was her friend Ben. He had a big smile and a big surprise. He had caught Anna's pink ball when it came down. He ran to Anna and gave her the ball. He said he saw her sneeze and her ball fly away, and he wanted to help her.
Anna was happy. She hugged Ben and thanked him. She had her pink ball again. She learned to be careful with flowers and dust. She and Ben played with the ball and had fun. They were good friends.
