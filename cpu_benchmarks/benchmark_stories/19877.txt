Once upon a time, there was a big, red house on a hill. The house had a stubborn door that wouldn't open easily. One day, a little girl named Lily went to visit the house. She tried to open the door, but it wouldn't budge. She yelled, "Open sesame!" but the door still wouldn't open. 
Lily decided to try another way. She climbed up the hill and peeked through the window. She saw a little cat inside the house, meowing for help. Lily knew she had to get inside and help the cat. She took a deep breath and pushed the door with all her might. Finally, the stubborn door opened and she rushed inside to help the cat. 
From that day on, Lily visited the big, red house often. She and the cat became best friends and they played together every day. And whenever the door was stubborn, Lily knew just what to do - she would yell and push until it opened!
