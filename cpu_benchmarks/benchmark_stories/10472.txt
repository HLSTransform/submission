John was a three- year-old boy living with his parents in a nice house on a hill. Every day, he would look out of the window, watching the birds in the sky and dreaming.
One day, John noticed something special – a rabbit! Curious, he decided to go outside in search of the animal. After a few minutes of searching, John saw the rabbit again!
Seizing the opportunity, John quickly grabbed the animal into his hands. But the rabbit was too scared and ran away quickly. Feeling defeated, John began to pray, asking God to help him catch the rabbit.
Unexpectedly, God answered John's prayers! A strong wind blew an eraser right next to John, who was ignorant of this divine intervention.
John picked up the eraser and threw it at the rabbit. Just then, the rabbit couldn’t escape any more, and John had caught it! Now, he could finally bring the rabbit home and show it to his parents.
