Once upon a time, there was a kind mommy who loved to cook. She always wore a big apron to keep her dress clean. One day, she decided to make a yummy cake for her little daughter. 
The mommy took out her big bowl and mixed all the ingredients together. She used a wide spoon to stir the batter. Her daughter watched her carefully and asked, "Mommy, can I help you?" 
The mommy smiled and said, "Of course, my dear! Let's record this special moment." She took out her phone and took a picture of her daughter wearing a mini apron and holding the wide spoon. They both laughed and continued to make the cake together.
