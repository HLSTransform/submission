Once upon a time there was a little girl who lived in a big city far away. Every day she would go out and play with her friends. One day, while they were playing, a big earthquake shook the city! It was very hard and it made the ground shake and the buildings rattle. 
The little girl was very scared. Suddenly, her friends all disappeared! She thought maybe they had gone home, but when she called them, nobody answered. She looked everywhere but she couldn't find them.
After the earthquake, the little girl was all alone. She was so scared, she started to cry. But then, much to her relief, her friends suddenly reappeared! They had been hiding because they were scared too. 
The little girl and her friends were glad that they were all safe and together. They hugged each other and promised never to disappear like that again. The earthquake had made them feel so small and helpless, but together they were strong.
