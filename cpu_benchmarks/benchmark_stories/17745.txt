Once there was a big dog named Bob who loved to eat squash. Every day he would pick one up and take a big bite. One day, Bob picked up his squash and it was full of worms! He was so sad because he couldn't eat it.
Bob decided to go and find an honest farmer who could give him a new squash. He trotted down the dirt road until he found a small farm. Bob ran up and asked the farmer for a new squash. The farmer was so kind and happy to help Bob out.
The farmer took Bob to his garden to find a new squash. Just as Bob saw it, he knew it was perfect. The farmer said that Bob could have it for free, as a thank you for being so honest. Bob thanked the farmer and took his squash home.
Bob felt so happy to have a new squash. He took a big bite, and it was delicious. Bob smiled and happily ate his squash. Bob was glad he replaced his old squash with a new one.
