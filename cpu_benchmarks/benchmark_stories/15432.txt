Once upon a time there was a white magnet. It loved to stick to things, but it was tired of always being stuck. It wanted to be free. So one day it asked a bird if it would help him to be released.
The bird agreed and flew as high as it could. It flew up, up into the sky and released the magnet. The white magnet floated down, down, down until it hit the ground gently.
The magnet was so happy that it wanted to do something nice for the bird. So it found a shiny object and stuck it to the bird's leg. The bird was very thankful.
The white magnet was now free and it went wherever it wanted. It explored the world around it and made lots of new friends. It was so happy to be released!
