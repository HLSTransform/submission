Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, she went to the store with her mommy to buy a new toy. She saw a big teddy bear and asked her mommy to buy it for her.
Mommy said, "Lily, that teddy bear is fake. It's not real. Let's find a better toy."
Lily was sad but then she saw a cute doll on the shelf. She asked her mommy to raise her up so she could see it better. Her mommy lifted her up and Lily saw the doll was perfect. She said, "Mommy, can we buy this doll? It's so pretty!"
Mommy smiled and said, "Yes, Lily. Let's buy it and take it home to play with." Lily was happy and hugged her new doll tightly.
