Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and twirl around in her pretty dress. One day, she went to the pool with her mommy and daddy. After swimming, Lily wrapped herself in a big towel to dry off.
Suddenly, Lily's towel flew up high into the air and landed on a big, mean dog. The dog growled and tried to bite the towel. Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. 
But then, Lily's mommy and daddy came over and talked to the dog's owner. They explained what happened and the owner apologized. He gave Lily a new towel and the dog went away. Lily was happy and danced around with her new towel. She learned that sometimes things can go wrong, but it's important to talk to others to make things right.
