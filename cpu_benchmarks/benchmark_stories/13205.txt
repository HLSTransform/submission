Once upon a time there was a little boy. 
He was walking in the forest and he was scared. He wondered what he might see. 
Suddenly he saw something moving on the ground. He looked closer and he guessed it was a snake! It was the scariest snake he had ever seen. 
He was so scared and he wanted to run away. But then he noticed the snake wasn't moving. He guessed it was asleep. 
He was brave and he decided to take a closer look. He was careful not to get too close and to not wake it up. He looked at it and thought it was so cool.
The boy went home and told everyone about the scary snake he had seen. Everyone said he was so brave. He was so happy that he had seen the snake.
