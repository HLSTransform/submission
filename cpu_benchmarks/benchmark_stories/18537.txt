Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play in their room. They had many toys and clothes, but they did not like to tidy up. They threw their toys in a big sack and hid it under the bed. They hung their clothes on a hanger and put it in the closet. They thought their mom would not see the mess.
One day, mom said they had to go to grandma's house for a visit. She told them to pack their things in a small bag. Lily and Ben ran to their room and opened the closet. They saw the hanger with their clothes, but it was empty. The clothes had fallen off the hanger and were wrinkled and dirty. They opened the sack under the bed, but it was full of toys. They could not find any clean clothes to wear.
They went to mom and said they had nothing to wear. Mom was angry and said they had to learn to take care of their things. She said they had to wear their old red pajamas to grandma's house. Lily and Ben felt ashamed and sad. They wished they had tidied up their room.
At grandma's house, Lily and Ben saw their cousins, who were wearing nice clothes and had neat bags. Their cousins laughed at them and said they looked silly in their red pajamas. Lily and Ben felt even more ashamed and sad. They wished they had listened to mom.
Grandma saw them and hugged them. She said she loved them no matter what they wore. She said she had a surprise for them. She took them to a room where she had made them new clothes from her old fabrics. She said she had used the hanger and the sack that they had left at her house last time. She said she had turned them into something beautiful and useful. She said she hoped they would like them and take care of them.
Lily and Ben were amazed and happy. They thanked grandma and tried on their new clothes. They fit them perfectly and had bright colors and patterns. They felt proud and happy. They learned that they should not waste their things and that they should tidy up their room. They also learned that grandma was very clever and kind. They hugged grandma and said they loved her. They decided to give some of their toys and clothes to their cousins, who were sorry for laughing at them. They all played together and had fun.
