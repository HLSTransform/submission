Lily and Ben were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big slide. Lily wanted to go on the slide, but Ben was scared.
"Come on, Ben, it will be fun!" Lily said. "You are brave, you can do it!"
Ben shook his head. "No, Lily, it is too high. I don't like it. Let's play something else."
Lily was sad. She wanted to change Ben's mind. She had an idea. She said, "I will go first, and then you can follow me. It will be easy. Trust me!"
Ben nodded. He wanted to make Lily happy. He watched Lily climb up the stairs and sit on the slide. She smiled and waved at him. Then she slid down.
But something bad happened. Lily slid too fast and hit her head on the ground. She cried out loud. She was hurt.
Ben ran to her. He was scared and sorry. He said, "Lily, Lily, are you okay? I'm sorry, I should have gone with you. I should have listened to you."
Lily looked at him. She was angry and sad. She said, "No, Ben, you should not have listened to me. I was wrong. I should have listened to you. You were right. The slide was too high. It was not fun. It was bad. You are not my friend anymore. Go away!"
Ben felt sad and alone. He wanted to help Lily, but she did not want him. He did not know what to do. He wished he could change what happened. He wished he could change the order of things. He wished he could change Lily's words. But he could not. He had lost his friend. He had lost his brave. He had lost his fun. He had lost his happy. He had a bad ending.
