Once there was a bunny and a bear. The bunny was envious of the bear's new red glove.
The bunny complained that she wanted a glove too. The bear said he would share, and the bunny was very happy.
The bear gave the bunny one of his old gloves. But the bunny wasn't very pleased, she was still envious of the bear's red glove. She complained and said she wanted a glove just like the bear's.
The bear had a bright idea. He said they could make a new glove together. So they spent the day picking flowers and gathering pretty leaves. When the sun went down, their glove was finished.
The bunny was so happy! She said it was even better than the bear's red glove. Both the bear and the bunny wore their new gloves and were never envious of the other again. They were best friends forever!
