One day, a little girl named Lucy wanted to play a game. She thought of a fun quiz for her friends. She made a fake key and a real key. Lucy put the keys in a box and locked it.
Lucy called her friend Tom to play the quiz. She said, "Tom, I have a fun game. Guess which key is fake and which one is real. If you guess right, I will give you a prize!" Tom was excited to play the game.
Tom thought hard and picked the fake key. Lucy opened the box with the real key and gave Tom a prize. They both laughed and had a great time playing the quiz. They played many more games and had a fun day together.
