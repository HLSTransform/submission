Anna loves to wear her furry bee costume. It is yellow and black and has wings and a stinger. She likes to buzz around the garden and pretend she is a real bee.
One day, she sees a flower with some honey on it. She thinks it is a gift for her. She flies over to the flower and tries to lick the honey. But it is not honey. It is glue!
"Help! Help!" Anna cries. "I am stuck to the flower!"
A real bee hears her and comes to see what is wrong. He sees Anna in her furry bee costume and thinks she is a strange bee.
"Who are you?" he asks. "Why are you wearing that?"
"I am Anna," she says. "I like to wear this. It is fun. But now I am not having fun. I am stuck. Can you help me?"
The real bee feels sorry for Anna. He flies around the flower and finds a way to pull her off. He is very strong and brave.
"Thank you, thank you!" Anna says. "You are a good bee. You saved me."
"You are welcome," he says. "But be careful next time. Not everything that looks like honey is honey. And not everything that looks like a flower is a flower. Some things are traps."
Anna nods. She has learned her lesson. She hugs the real bee and says goodbye. She flies back to her house and takes off her furry bee costume. She decides to play something else. Maybe she will be a lion or a princess. But she will always remember her friend, the real bee.
