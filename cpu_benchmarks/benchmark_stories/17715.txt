Once upon a time there was a big, old train. It was dull and duller than all the other trains. Every day it sat in the same spot. It never went anywhere. One day, something came to show the train a new way. It was a bird, and it was very cheerful. The bird showed the train how to move and travel. 
The train was so excited. He moved and grooved. He had so much fun. Soon the train was off and moving. He was happy and full of life. The train now went to places he never had before. He loved the new journeys and wonderful sites he saw along the way.
From then on, the train was never dull or boring. He showed everyone else how to explore and enjoy life. Everywhere he went, the train was greeted with love and joy. 
The end!
