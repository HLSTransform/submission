Once there was a healthy little girl named Anna. She was curious and always full of wonder. One day she looked at the sky and thought, "What if I could fly up and touch the clouds?" She asked her mom and dad if she could fly. 
"No, Anna," her mom replied, "you can't fly! That's not possible."
But Anna was so full of wonder, she did not want to believe them. She was determined and wanted to find out if she could really fly. So, on a sunny day she jumped up and tried to flap her arms, hoping to fly up. But she just tumbled back to the ground. 
Anna felt sad and she regretted not listening to her parents. She looked up at the sky and decided she would just have to be content to dream about what it was like to fly.
