Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play with their toys. One day, they got a new toy from their grandma. It was a light train that made sounds and moved on the tracks. Tom and Lily were very happy and thanked their grandma.
They took the train to their room and set it up on the floor. They took turns to press the button and watch the train go round and round. They had a lot of fun with their new toy.
But then, Tom had an idea. He wanted to see what was inside the train. He took a screwdriver from his dad's toolbox and opened the train. He saw wires and batteries and a speaker. He pulled and twisted them, trying to understand how they worked.
Lily saw what Tom was doing and got angry. She shouted at him, "Stop it, Tom! You are spoiling the train! Grandma gave it to us and you are breaking it!"
Tom did not listen to Lily. He kept playing with the wires and the batteries. He did not notice that he made a short circuit and the train started to smoke. He dropped the train and ran away.
The smoke set off the fire alarm and the lady who lived next door heard it. She called the firemen and they came to the house. They saw the smoke coming from Tom and Lily's room and broke the door. They found the train on the floor, burnt and melted. They put out the fire and checked if anyone was hurt.
The lady who lived next door told Tom and Lily's mom what happened. She was very angry and sad. She scolded Tom for spoiling the train and being careless. She told him to apologize to Lily and to grandma. She also told him to never touch his dad's toolbox again.
Tom felt very sorry and ashamed. He said sorry to Lily and to grandma. He promised to be more careful and to respect his toys. He hugged Lily and they cried together. They learned a lesson that day: spoiling things is not fun.
