One day, a little boy named Tim was in his room. He saw a bird outside his window. Tim was confused. He did not know what the bird wanted.
Tim went to his mom and said, "Mom, there is a bird at my window. What does it want?" His mom smiled and said, "Maybe the bird has a request. Let's go see what it wants."
They went to Tim's room and looked at the bird. The bird chirped and flew away. Tim's mom said, "I think the bird wanted to say hello. Let's open the window and say hello back." Tim opened the window and said, "Hello, bird!"
The bird came back and chirped again. Tim was happy. He knew the bird's request now. From that day on, Tim and the bird became good friends. They said hello to each other every day.
