Once upon a time there was an open field in the countryside. In the middle of the field was a tree and next to it was a big hill.
One day, a little boy and his mum were walking in the field. They happened to stop next to the tree. Suddenly, a big, colourful cartoon appeared from behind the hill. The little boy was mesmerised.
The cartoon said hello to the toddler, introducing itself as Rainbow. It said it wanted to play with the little boy. The boy and his mum were both happy and joined in.
Rainbow and the boy played in the open field. They had the most fun ever! They ran around and laughed, played hopscotch and swing.
At the end of the day, the little boy had made a new friend. He was very happy!
