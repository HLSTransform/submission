Sara and Tom are playing with a big puzzle. The puzzle has many pieces of different colors and shapes. Sara likes the blue pieces and Tom likes the green pieces. They try to fit the pieces together to make a picture of a farm.
"Look, Sara, I found a piece of the cow!" Tom says, holding a white and black piece. "Where does it go?"
Sara looks at the puzzle and points to a spot near the bottom. "It goes here, Tom. See, this is the cow's leg."
Tom nods and puts the piece in the right place. He smiles and looks for another piece.
Sara picks up a pale yellow piece. She thinks it is part of the sun. She looks at the top of the puzzle, but she does not see where it fits. She feels confused.
"Tom, can you help me?" Sara asks. "I don't know where this piece goes. Is it part of the sun?"
Tom looks at the piece and shakes his head. "No, Sara, that is not part of the sun. That is part of the chicken. See, this is the chicken's beak."
He points to a small orange piece that is next to a brown piece. He takes the pale yellow piece from Sara and puts it next to the orange piece. He shows Sara how the pieces make a chicken's head.
"Oh, I see!" Sara says. "Thank you, Tom. You are very smart."
Tom blushes and says, "You're welcome, Sara. You are very nice."
They hug and continue to play with the puzzle. They have fun and learn new things. They are happy friends.
