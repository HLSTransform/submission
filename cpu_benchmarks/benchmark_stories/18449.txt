Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to pick berries in the forest. One day, she saw a big and juicy berry, but it was too high for her to reach. She asked her friend, a kind bear, to help her get the berry. The bear promised to help her.
But as the bear was reaching for the berry, he accidentally knocked down all of the other berries from the bush. Lily was sad because she wanted to share the berries with her family. The bear felt bad and promised to make it up to her.
The next day, the bear brought Lily a basket full of nice and sweet berries. Lily was happy and thanked the bear. The moral of the story is that it's important to keep your promises and to help others, even if you make a mistake.
