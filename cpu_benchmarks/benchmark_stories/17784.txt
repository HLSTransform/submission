Once upon a time, there was a lazy queen who lived in a big palace. Every day, the queen lounged on her sofa, not wanting to do any work. One day, the queen realized that she was bored so she decided to do something new.
The queen decided to replace all of the furniture in the palace. Every day, the queen got rid of the old furniture and found new pieces to replace them with. The queen picked out the softest pillows, the biggest chairs and the brightest colors. 
Soon the palace looked different. Instead of being lazy, the queen was working hard to decorate the palace. Finally, the queen was happy with the way the palace looked. 
The end.
