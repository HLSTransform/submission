Once there was a brave little girl. She was scared of the dark, so she kept a night light near her bed. She was worried a monster might sneak in, so every night she made sure to shut the door tightly. She didn't want even an inch for a monster to get through.
One night the little girl noticed a crack under the door. She got out of bed and looked closely, and sure enough she could see a tiny space. It was only an inch wide, but she was scared a monster would fit through.
The brave little girl knew she had to shut the door completely. She grabbed a towel and carefully stuffed it underneath the door. Then she shut the door as tight as she could and her room became completely dark.
The brave little girl smiled to herself. She knew she had made her room safe. There was no way a monster could fit through the inch-wide crack anymore!
