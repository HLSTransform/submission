Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to find things in the grass and dirt. Sometimes they found rocks, leaves, or bugs. They put them in a big box and pretended they were treasure.
One day, they found a shiny ring. It was gold and had a red stone. Lily wanted to keep it. She said, "This is the best thing we ever found. It is mine."
Tom said, "No, it is not. We found it together. We have to share it."
Lily and Tom started to fight. They pulled and pushed and shouted. They were not quiet at all.
A lady came over. She looked sad and worried. She said, "Excuse me, have you seen a ring? I lost it here yesterday. It was my grandma's ring. It has a lot of value to me."
Lily and Tom stopped fighting. They felt sorry for the lady. They showed her the ring. They said, "We are sorry. We found it here. We did not know it was yours. Here, you can have it back."
The lady smiled and thanked them. She said, "You are very kind and honest. You did the right thing. You know what? I have something for you. It is not as shiny as the ring, but it is very sweet." She gave them each a candy.
Lily and Tom were happy. They shared the candy and hugged. They learned that finding things is fun, but giving them back is better. They learned that value is not only about how things look, but how they make you feel. They learned that being quiet is not always good, but being loud is not always bad. They learned to be good friends.
