Sophie was a cute girl who liked to play in her garden. Every day she would help her mum and dad water the flowers and plants in the garden. She liked to make things grow.
One day, Sophie wanted to explore outside of her garden. She crept quietly out of the door, looking around to make sure her mum and dad didn't see her. Just then, her mum caught her and said “Where do you think you’re going?” 
Sophie was scared but was determined to make her parents permit her to explore. She said “Please mum and dad, can I go explore? I promise to be quiet." 
Mum and dad thought for a moment and then realised there was nothing wrong with letting their daughter go out a little bit. They said, “Ok Sophie, you can go but make sure you stay safe”.
So, off Sophie went, exploring her garden and the world around her. She was so excited to see all the cute animals and plants around her. 
Sophie couldn't believe how much fun she was having! She had permission from her parents to explore and it felt great.
