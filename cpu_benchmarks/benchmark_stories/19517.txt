Once upon a time, there was a yellow duck. She lived in a pond, and her favourite game was to swim with her friend, the frog. One day, the duck was swimming across the pond, and when she turned her head, she saw a shiny thing. It was a big, yellow horn!
The duck was so excited, she tried to slip and grab it with her beak. But it was too slippery and it slipped away! The frog laughed at the duck, but she didn't mind. She kept trying and after a few tries, she finally managed to slip her beak around the horn and lift it up out of the water.
The duck was so proud of herself, she couldn't wait to show it to the rest of the pond. The frog was still laughing, but now he was laughing because he was happy for the duck. They both went off around the pond, showing everyone the shiny yellowhorn the duck had found.
