Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore the world around him. One day, he found a big rock and tried to pick it up, but he struggled because it was very heavy.
After a few tries, Timmy finally managed to lift the rock and he was so proud of himself. He decided to mark the spot where he found the rock so he could come back and visit it again. He used a stick to make a mark in the dirt.
As Timmy continued to explore, he saw a butterfly fluttering around. He followed it for a while until it flew away. Timmy realized that even though he struggled with the heavy rock, he didn't give up and eventually succeeded. He felt happy and proud of himself for trying. The end.
