Once upon a time there were two friends, Dave and Jay. Dave and Jay always liked to play together, but Dave liked to play with things that were not dependable. One day, as they were playing, Dave allowed Jay to try one of his toys. The toy was not dependable and it broke. When Jay saw it, he cried. Dave felt bad and said sorry. But the toy was not able to be fixed, so the two friends could not play together anymore. The bad ending was that Dave and Jay never played together again.
