Once upon a time there was a girl named Rachel. Rachel was three years old and loved to write. 
One day, while she was writing, Rachel heard a noise coming from outside her bedroom window. She peered through and saw a monster! The monster was very big and scary. 
Rachel was worried the monster would come in and get her, so she quickly ran to hide.
The monster was trying to be nice. He asked Rachel why she was hiding, and she told him about her writing. The monster was bored, so he asked Rachel to write a story for him. Rachel was very brave and decided to write a story for him.
Rachel wrote a story about a brave girl who faces scary monsters and overcomes them! The monster was no longer bored â€“ he was excited to read the story! He thanked Rachel for the story and promised to never bother her again. 
Rachel was so happy that the monster was no longer boring, and he could never bother her again. They became friends and Rachel happily continued writing her stories.
