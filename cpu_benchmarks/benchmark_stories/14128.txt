Once upon a time, there was a girl called Lizzie. She loved to read and often went to the local library with her mom. One day, when Lizzie was returning from the library, she noticed an icy closet close by. She wanted to read in the closet and asked her mom if she could go inside. 
Her mom said no and warned Lizzie that it was dangerous. But Lizzie didn't listen and opened the icy closet door. As soon as she stepped inside, she heard a loud snap. All of a sudden, the door closed, locking Lizzie in. 
Her mom soon figured out what had happened and called for help, but it was too late. Lizzie was stuck inside the icy closet and no one was able to rescue her.
The moral of this story is to listen to your parents. They are always looking out for you and know what's best for you â€“ even when it seems silly at the time.
