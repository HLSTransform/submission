Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. They played on the swings and the slide. They even played a game of hide and seek.
After a while, Lily's friend threw a ball to her. She tried to catch it, but it went over her head and into the street. Lily ran after the ball to pass it back to her friend, but she didn't see the car coming. The car hit her and she became dead.
Lily's friends were very sad and missed her very much. They learned a very important lesson that day about being careful when playing near the street.
