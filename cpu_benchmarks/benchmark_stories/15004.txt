Once upon a time there was a fierce tiger. He was walking down a hall, wearing his favorite stripes. All the other animals ran away in fear when they saw him.
He heard a tiny voice calling out to him. He saw a little rabbit with big eyes. The tiger stepped closer and asked, "What do you want little one?".
The rabbit replied, "Will you please wear something else? Your stripes are too fierce for me to bear!".
The tiger smiled and said, "Okay, I'll wear something else so the hall will be a little less scary for you!".
The next day, the tiger returned down the hall wearing his spotty polka dots. He was delighted to see that the rabbit was now hopping around playfully. 
The tiger said goodbye, with a smile on his face, as he continued walking down the hall.
