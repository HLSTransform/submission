Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, they found a long pole lying on the ground. They decided to play a game with it.
Lily's friend, Timmy, suggested they sort themselves into teams. Lily happily agreed and they started to play. Lily's team was winning, and she was having so much fun. But then, suddenly, Lily slipped and fell on the pole. She hurt her leg badly and had to go to the hospital.
Lily's parents were very worried when they heard what happened. They went to the park and saw that the pole was left lying on the ground, not tidy at all. They wished someone had put it away properly so that Lily wouldn't have gotten hurt. From that day on, Lily and her friends always made sure to tidy up after themselves and put things away safely.
