Once upon a time, there was a king who wore a shiny crown on his head. One day, the crown broke and fell off his head. The king was sad and didn't know what to do. He asked his friend, "Can you help me repair my crown?"
His friend replied, "Of course, I can help you fix it. But first, we need to find out what's wrong with it. The problem is unknown to us."
So they both went to the crown maker and showed him the broken crown. The crown maker said, "I know how to repair it. I will fix it for you."
The king was happy and thanked his friend and the crown maker for their help. He put the repaired crown back on his head and it looked as good as new. From that day on, the king was careful with his crown and it never broke again.
