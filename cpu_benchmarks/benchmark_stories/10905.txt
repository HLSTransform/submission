Once upon a time, there was a baby named Lily. She loved to crawl around the house and explore new things. One day, she saw a big gate that was pink. She wanted to go through the gate to see what was on the other side.
Lily crawled over to the gate and tried to push it open, but it was too heavy. She looked around and saw a key on the ground. She picked it up and put it in the gate's lock. The gate opened and she saw a beautiful garden with flowers and trees.
Lily crawled through the gate and explored the garden. She saw a butterfly and tried to catch it, but it flew away. She had so much fun in the garden and was happy she crawled through the pink gate.
