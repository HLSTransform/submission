Once upon a time, there was a strong queen. She wanted to go on a long walk, so she decided to visit the nearby forest.
At the entrance of the forest, the strong queen bumped into a little fox. 
"Hello," said the fox.
"Hello," replied the queen. "Why do you look so sad?"
"I'm sad because I can't find my way home," the fox replied.
The queen felt sorry for the poor fox and decided to help him. She took the fox by his paw and said, "Don't worry, I'll show you the way home."
The strong queen and the little fox walked together until they reached the fox's house. 
"Thank you for helping me," said the fox.
The queen smiled and said," You're welcome! I'm glad I could help." 
The strong queen happily waved goodbye to the fox and walked back through the forest. She was very proud that she had decided to help the fox find his way home.
