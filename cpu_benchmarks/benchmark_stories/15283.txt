Melanie was smart. She was three years old and she loved to balance her grocery bags. She would spend lots of time figuring out which bag should go where. She always wanted to make sure the bags were balanced just right.
One day, she decided to go to the grocery store. She was so excited to go there and balance her bags. She grabbed the biggest bag and put it on her left hip and a small one on her right. She also had a big one in each hand. 
At the store, Melanie went up and down the aisles, excitedly picking out her favorite things. She put them all in her bags, making sure she balanced them just right. She was so proud of herself.
When she got home, she had to carefully carry her bags into the kitchen. She was so careful with them, making sure she kept them balanced. Her mom was so proud of her!
Melanie smiled to herself as she put all of her groceries away. She had been so smart to remember to balance her bags. She was so happy that she had done it all by herself!
