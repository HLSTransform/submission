One day there was a little girl named Lila. She was three years old and very shy. She was outside playing with her puppy when she spotted a flame in the grass. She was scared of the flame and peeking from behind a tree, she asked her puppy, "What is that?". The puppy barked, "It's a flame!" Lila got a little bit closer and cautiously asked the flame, "What do you do?". The flame said, "I make pretty shapes and colours in the sky!". Lila smiled and slowly moved towards the flame. She said, "I'm not so scared of you anymore. Will you show me your pretty shapes?". The flame said, "Yes, of course!" and together they made the most beautiful shapes and flames in the sky. Lila was so happy and even though she was still a bit shy, she was no longer scared of the flame.
