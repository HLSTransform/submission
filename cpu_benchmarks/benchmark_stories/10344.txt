Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. They liked to gather flowers and leaves and make art with them. They used napkins to glue their art on. They were very proud of their art and showed it to everyone. Everyone said their art was pretty and popular.
One day, a big boy came to the park. He saw Lily and Ben's art and wanted to have it. He said, "Give me your art, or I will break it." Lily and Ben were scared and said, "No, this is our art. We made it. Go away." The big boy got angry and said, "Fine, then I will break it." He grabbed their art and tore it apart. He threw the napkins and the flowers and the leaves on the ground. He laughed and ran away.
Lily and Ben were very sad and cried. They looked at their art and saw it was ruined. They could not make it again. They had no more napkins or glue. They felt like they had lost something very important. They hugged each other and wished the big boy would say sorry. But he never did. The end.
