Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her toys, especially her dollhouse. One day, Lily's friend came over to play. Her name was Sarah and she also loved playing with toys.
Lily showed Sarah her dollhouse and said, "This is mine. Do you want to play with it too?" Sarah said yes and they started playing together. But soon, Sarah started taking Lily's toys without asking. Lily didn't like that and said, "Please behave and ask before taking my toys."
Sarah said sorry and gave the toys back. They continued playing together and had lots of fun. But then, Sarah tried to take the toys again without asking. This time, Lily remembered what happened before and said, "Remember to behave and ask before taking my toys. I don't like it when you just take them."
Sarah said sorry again and they continued playing together. From then on, Sarah always asked before taking any of Lily's toys and they had a great time playing together.
