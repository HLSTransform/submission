Once upon a time, there was a playful little dog named Max. Max loved to run and jump and play with his toys. He would wag his tail and bark happily whenever his owner came home.
One day, Max's owner decided to plant a garden. Max watched as the owner dug holes and put little seeds in the ground. Max was curious and asked, "What are you doing?"
"I'm planting a garden," the owner replied. "Soon, we will have lots of fruits and vegetables to eat."
Max was excited and said, "I want to help too! Can I grow something?"
The owner smiled and said, "Of course, Max. You can help water the plants every day."
Max was happy to help and watered the plants every day. But one day, he got too excited and dug up all the plants. The owner was very upset and said, "Max, you can't dig up the plants. That was a bad thing to do."
Max felt sad and knew he had made a mistake. He learned that growing things takes time and patience, and that sometimes we don't get a reward if we don't do things right.
