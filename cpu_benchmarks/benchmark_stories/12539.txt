Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play together at the park. One day, they see a big sign. The sign says: "Free cake! Come and meet our new puppy!"
Anna and Ben love cake and puppies. They run to the sign. They see a table with many cakes. They also see a woman with a small dog.
"Hello, kids!" the woman says. "Do you want some cake? And do you want to meet our new puppy? His name is Spot."
"Yes, please!" Anna and Ben say. They take some cake and pet the puppy. The puppy is soft and cute. He licks their faces.
The woman smiles. She says: "I'm glad you like Spot. He is very friendly. But he is also very hungry. He likes to eat cake, too. So you have to be careful with your cake. He might try to take it from you."
Anna and Ben laugh. They think the woman is joking. They eat their cake and play with Spot. They do not see that Spot is looking at their cake. He is waiting for a chance to grab it.
Soon, Anna and Ben finish their cake. They thank the woman and say goodbye to Spot. They start to walk away. But then they hear a loud bark. They turn around. They see Spot running after them. He has a big piece of cake in his mouth. He took it from the table when they were not looking.
"Hey, that's our cake!" Anna and Ben shout. They chase Spot. But Spot is faster. He runs away with the cake. He is very happy.
Anna and Ben are sad. They lost their cake. They look at the woman. She looks sorry. She says: "I'm sorry, kids. I told you Spot likes cake. He is very sneaky. But don't worry. I have more cake available. Do you want another piece?"
Anna and Ben nod. They forgive Spot. They take another piece of cake. They eat it quickly. They do not want Spot to take it again. They learn a lesson. They have to watch their cake when there is a hungry puppy around.
