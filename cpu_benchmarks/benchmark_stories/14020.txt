Once upon a time, there was a cow named Bessie. Bessie was different from the other cows. She could understand what people said. Bessie liked to listen to the farmer and his wife talk.
One day, Bessie heard the farmer's wife say, "We need more beef for dinner." Bessie did not know what beef was. She asked her friend, the horse, "Do you know what beef is?" The horse said, "I don't know. Let's ask the pig." So, Bessie and the horse went to the pig.
The pig said, "Beef is what people eat. It comes from cows." Bessie was scared. She did not want to be beef. Bessie told her friends, "I don't want to be beef. I want to live and be happy." The horse and the pig wanted to help Bessie. They made a plan to hide Bessie so the farmer could not find her.
The plan worked. Bessie hid in the woods and the farmer could not find her. The farmer's wife said, "We will have to eat something else for dinner." Bessie was safe and happy. She knew her friends loved her and would always help her.
