Once upon a time, there was a happy little duck. The duck loved to swim in the pond and splash around. One day, the duck saw a shiny symbol on the other side of the pond. The symbol looked like a star and it was very pretty. The duck wanted to go see the symbol, but it was too far away. So, the duck swam as fast as it could and splashed its wings in the water. Finally, the duck reached the other side of the pond and saw the symbol up close. The duck was very happy to have found something so special. From that day on, the duck would visit the symbol every day and splash around in the pond.
