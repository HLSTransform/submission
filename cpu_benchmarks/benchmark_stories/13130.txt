Once upon a time there was an angel who loved to eat. Every day, the angel would fly around looking for something delicious to eat.
One day the angel found a disgusting pie on the ground. The angel was not sure if it was safe to eat, so it decided to take a small bite. The angel was not happy when it realized how bad the pie tasted!
The angel was so disappointed that it flew away in search of something better. It flew until it found a yummy apple tree full of juicy apples. The angel ate one apple after the other until it was full and happy again. 
From that day on, the angel never ate anything disgusting again. It only ate yummy food it liked and happily flew away.
