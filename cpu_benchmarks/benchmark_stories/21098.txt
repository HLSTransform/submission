Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He lived in a small house with his mom, dad, and dog, Spot. One day, Tim found a deep hole in his backyard. He was very curious and wanted to see what was inside.
Tim called his dog, Spot, and they looked into the hole together. They saw a little leak coming from the hole. Tim said, "Spot, let's find out where the leak is coming from!" So, they both went inside the deep hole.
As they went deeper, they found a tiny frog. The frog was making the leak by crying. Tim asked, "Why are you crying, little frog?" The frog said, "I am sad because I can't find my way home." Tim and Spot decided to help the frog find its home. They followed the leak and found the frog's home.
When they reached the frog's home, the frog's family was very happy. They all started to applaud for Tim and Spot. Tim felt very proud and said, "We are happy to help you, little frog." Then, Tim, Spot, and the frog family had a big party to celebrate.
From that day on, Tim, Spot, and the frog family became best friends. They always played together and had lots of fun. And whenever someone needed help, they were always there for each other.
