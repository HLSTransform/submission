One day, a nosy cat named Kitty saw a beautiful scarf on a chair. The scarf was red, blue, and green. Kitty wanted to play with it. She jumped up and grabbed the scarf with her teeth. She ran around the house, dragging the scarf behind her.
Kitty's friend, a dog named Buddy, saw her playing with the scarf. He wanted to play too. Buddy said, "Kitty, can I play with the scarf too?" Kitty nodded, and they both played with the scarf together. They had so much fun running and jumping.
But then, the scarf got stuck on a door. Kitty and Buddy tried to pull it free, but it was too hard. They knew they had to separate the scarf from the door. They worked together, and finally, the scarf was free. They were so happy and continued to play with the scarf all day long.
