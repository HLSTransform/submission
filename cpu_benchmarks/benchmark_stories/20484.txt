Freddy the cat was having a great day. He went for a drive in his car around the neighbourhood. When he was driving, he saw his good friend, the dog sitting outside. Freddy waved as he drove past and the dog barked back.
Freddy was feeling happy, so he decided to do something special for his friend. He drove to the store and bought some of the tastiest treats he could find. Then he drove back home to deliver the treats.
When he arrived back, the dog was so excited to see him. He immediately started sniffing the treats. Freddy was so pleased with his task and gave the dog the treats. The dog ate them all so quickly, it was obvious how tasty they were! 
Freddy drove away with a big smile on his face. He was sure he had made his friend the happiest dog in the world.
