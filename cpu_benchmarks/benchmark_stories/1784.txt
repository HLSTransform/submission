Once Upon a Time, there was a little girl named Daisy. Daisy was feeling cold on a chilly day. Her toes began to shiver, and she could not get warm.
Daisy looked up at the sky and noticed a big, enormous bus in the distance. She figured if she hopped on the bus, she would get warmer. So with a hop, skip, and a jump, Daisy made her way to the enormous bus.
Daisy hopped onto the bus and a warm feeling filled her body. She no longer felt cold and her toes stopped shivering. Daisy looked around the bus and saw her friends on there, smiling and laughing. She grinned from ear to ear and had a wonderful time on the bus. 
The bus drove on and on, taking Daisy and her friends to a warm and cozy place. Daisy never had to shiver again!
