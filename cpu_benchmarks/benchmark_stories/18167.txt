Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a huge tree near a rail. The tree was so big that all the kids loved to play under it. One sunny day, a little girl named Mia and her friend Tom went to play near the rail.
As they played, Mia saw a sign on the tree. She asked Tom, "What does the sign say?" Tom looked at the sign and said, "It says, 'Be careful near the rail!'"
Mia and Tom knew they had to be safe, so they played far away from the rail. They had lots of fun under the huge tree. They laughed and played all day long. And every time they played near the rail, they remembered the sign and stayed safe.
