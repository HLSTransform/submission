Once, there was a little girl called Lola. She was three years old and she was so full of energy. She loved to play outside in the park, especially on the big swing.
One day, Lola decided to try something different. She took a twig she found on the ground and tried to swing on it like she would on the swing. She was so proud of herself when it worked.
But then she heard a voice say, "That twig is fake, Lola." It was the park keeper.
Lola was so scared that she quickly got off the twig. The park keeper told her off, saying she had been naughty. He said she wasn't allowed to swing on the fake twig anymore.
Lola felt sad. She had been having so much fun swinging on the twig. Now she wasn't even allowed to pretend.
The end.
