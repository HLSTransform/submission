Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He had a friend named Bobby who he liked to play with. One day, Timmy found an original toy car in his room. He wanted to show Bobby, so he asked him to come over and play.
Bobby came over and Timmy showed him the toy car. Bobby liked it a lot and asked if he could play with it too. Timmy said yes and they took turns playing with the toy car. Bobby even let Timmy lead the playtime and choose the games they played. They had so much fun together and were happy to have each other as friends.
