Once there was a girl who loved the color pastel. She was very happy when she was surrounded by pastel hues and she even painted her room in various pastel shades. But she had one problem: no one understood her love for pastels. Her parents thought she was crazy for decorating with so many pinks, purples, and blues.
One day, she decided that she wanted to go on an adventure to a place filled with pastel colors. She wanted to see all the crazy pastel hues of the world. So, she asked her parents to take her on a trip to the land of pastels.
To her surprise, her parents agreed, and they set off on a long journey. As they flew over the world, the girl marvelled at all the amazing pastel shades below her. Everywhere she looked she saw a new color of pastel. 
When they arrived, the girl went exploring and she was amazed by all the wonderful things she saw. She was finally able to understand why she loved pastels so much! Everywhere she looked, she was surrounded by the crazy hues of pastel. 
From that day forward, the girl never felt alone on her journey to understand the meaning of pastel shades. She knew that wherever she went, there would always be a creature painted in the beautiful, crazy hues of pastel.
