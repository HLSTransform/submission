Once upon a time there was a little girl. She loved to write. She would take out her pencil and write stories and letters.
One day, she and her friend were writing in a park. They took out some bubble mixture and started to blow bubbles. They laughed and watched the bubbles float in the air.
Suddenly, it started to rain and the little girl became upset. All the bubbles faded away and she couldn't write anymore.
The little girl was so upset she started to cry. But her friend gave her a hug and said, "Don't be upset! We can write some more stories tomorrow."
The little girl smiled and agreed. She was no longer upset and they both went home to nestle in for the night.
