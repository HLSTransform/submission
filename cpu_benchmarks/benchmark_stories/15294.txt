There was a chubby little bunny rabbit. She liked to pull her neck back and forth. It made her feel so happy and made her giggle with joy! One day, the bunny was hopping around the field when she saw something she'd never seen before. It was a big carrot patch! She scurried over to take a closer look. She started to pull the longest, sweetest carrots she had ever seen. She ate the carrots until she was so full she could barely move.  It was the best carrot feast ever! With a happy tummy, the bunny hopped along, full of delight.
