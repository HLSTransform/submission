Ben and Lily wanted to see the parade. They liked the big balloons, the loud music and the funny clowns. They asked their mom to take them to the street where the parade was.
But mom said no. She said it was too difficult to go to the parade today. She said there were too many people, too much noise and too much traffic. She said they could watch the parade on TV instead.
Ben and Lily were very sad. They did not want to watch the parade on TV. They wanted to see it for real. They started to weep. They wept and wept and wept.
Mom felt sorry for them. She did not like to see them weep. She hugged them and kissed them and said she loved them. She said she had a surprise for them. She said they could go to the park and have a picnic.
Ben and Lily stopped weeping. They liked the park and they liked picnics. They smiled and said thank you to mom. They got ready to go to the park. They hoped they would see some balloons, some music and some clowns there.
