There was an ordinary girl who loved jewelry. Whenever she see a pretty necklace or ring, she would want to buy it. One day she went shopping on the street, and she saw a woman who was tying lots of beautiful jewelry. 
The girl thought the jewelry was so nice, she asked the woman if she could buy some. The woman said yes, so the girl chose a pretty necklace and a bracelet. She was so happy with her jewelry. 
She went home and tried it on. It was so pretty and made her feel special. 
Every day the girl would wear her jewelry and tie it around her neck and wrists. She was so proud of it and was so happy that she found the woman who was selling it on the street.
