It was a sunny day and two friends were walking near the lake. They saw two frogs fighting by the lake. The two were surprised as they had never seen frogs fighting before. The fight went on and on until they felt it was time to go.
The two friends continued their walk and talked about the frogs fighting. They started to wonder who had won the fight, as it was unknown to them.
They reached the other side of the lake and the sky suddenly got dark and it started to rain. So they ran back to their homes.
The next day, they went back to the lake, but the frogs were nowhere to be seen. They looked and looked but they couldn't find the frogs. They never found out what had happened but it was clear that the frogs had stopped fighting.
