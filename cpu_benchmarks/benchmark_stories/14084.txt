One day, a little boy named Sam was playing in the park. Suddenly, he felt something poke him in the back. He turned around and saw a big, nosy dog. Sam was scared at first, but then he noticed the dog had a big smile on his face. 
"Hello," said Sam, "What's your name?"
The dog replied, "My name is Spot, and I was just trying to get your attention."
Sam thought it was funny and smiled. He asked Spot if he wanted to go get a dessert. Spot was very excited and immediately started running to the ice cream store.
When they arrived, Sam chose a chocolate ice cream and Spot chose a strawberry ice cream. Together, they enjoyed their delicious desserts and laughed about their funny adventure. 
Sam and Spot became good friends after that and Spot was always nearby when Sam was playing in the park. He was so nosy that he often made Sam laugh!
