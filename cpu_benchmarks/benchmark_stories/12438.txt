John and his mother went for a walk. It was a beautiful day with lots of sunshine. They went to a mill and it was very lively. There were lots of people working there. 
John was fascinated by the mill. He asked his mother, "What do they do here?" 
His mother smiled and said, "This is a place where people work to make food." 
John wanted to explore, but his mother said no. He was sad and started to cry. "I want to help too, mummy!" he said. 
His mother felt bad but said, "You are too small. It is not safe for you to work here. Let's go on our walk and look at the flowers." 
John reluctantly agreed, and soon he was running and laughing. He had forgotten all about the lively mill.
