One day, Jack and his family were going to celebrate. Jack was very excited. He put on his best clothes and danced around the house.
First, they had a big cake. It was orange and smelled delicious. Then, the family had a picnic together in the garden. It was so much fun! Jack was so happy, he was clapping and singing.
Then, it was time for presents. Jack was so excited. He was running around, but he was also very clumsy. He was tripping over his feet, but he was laughing too.
Finally, it was time to go home. Jack was full of excitement and very tired. It had been such a wonderful day to celebrate.
