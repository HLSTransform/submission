Once upon a time, there was a little bird. The bird liked to fly high in the sky and look down at the world below. One day, the bird saw a big spider web. The web was like a network of string that the spider had made. But the web was broken in some places. The bird wanted to help the spider fix the web. So, the bird flew down and picked up some sticks with its beak. Then, the bird put the sticks in the broken parts of the web. The spider was very happy and said thank you to the bird. From that day on, the bird and the spider became good friends and the web was strong again.
