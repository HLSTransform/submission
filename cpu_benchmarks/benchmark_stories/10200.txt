Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He lived on a ranch with his mom, dad, and his dog, Spot. They were a happy family. Tim loved to play with Spot every day.
One day, Tim found a fake toy snake in his room. He thought it would be fun to play a trick on Spot. He put the snake in the grass and called Spot. Spot saw the snake and got scared. He tried to protect Tim and bit the snake. But it was just a toy, so nothing bad happened to Spot.
Tim felt bad for scaring Spot. He learned that it's not nice to trick our friends. From that day on, Tim and Spot played together without any tricks. They lived happily ever after on their ranch. The moral of the story is to always be kind and not play tricks on others.
