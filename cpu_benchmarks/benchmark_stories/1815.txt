Once upon a time, there was a girl called Poppy. Poppy was only three years old and she was out for a walk in the park. Suddenly, Poppy saw a buckle on the ground. It was a really pretty buckle, but it was also very dirty.
Poppy wanted to pick up the buckle, so she bent down and pinch it. Then she saw a strange thing - the buckle began to move. It wasn’t a buckle at all - it was a tiny little mouse!
The mouse said to Poppy: “Oh help me! I am stuck inside this buckle and I cannot get out!”
Poppy was not scared, so she bent down and carefully opened the buckle. Then the little mouse thanked her and scurried away.
Poppy smiled and put the buckle in her pocket. She was happy she could help the little mouse.
