Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Fin. Fin lived in the big sea. The sea was very deep and had lots of light.
One day, Fin met a big fish named Bubbles. Bubbles wanted to play with Fin. Bubbles said, "Let's swim to the top of the sea where there is more light." But Fin did not want to swim to the top. Fin said, "No, I disagree. I like it here where it is not too light."
Bubbles did not listen to Fin. Bubbles swam to the top of the sea where it was very light. Fin stayed down where it was not too light. Bubbles played in the light for a long time. But then, a big bird saw Bubbles and ate him. It was a very bad ending for Bubbles. Fin was sad but he knew it was not safe to go where it was too light.
