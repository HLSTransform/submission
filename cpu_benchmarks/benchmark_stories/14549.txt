Once upon a time there was a very special reef. This reef was unique, unlike any other reef in the world. Every night, it would blink and sparkle like thousands of twinkling stars.
One night, a brave little fish went on an adventure to explore the reef. He zig-zagged through the coral, hiding beneath the rocks and dodging other sea creatures. As he swam further and further, he noticed something strange.
The reef was blinking! Tiny lights were flashing in the darkness, like tiny fireflies. The little fish was amazed! He'd never seen anything like this before.
He got closer and closer and soon he could see the blinking was coming from tiny creatures, who were clinging to the reef. They were glowing and shining brightly. The little fish smiled and as he watched, the creatures blinked again, turning the reef into a magical underwater garden. 
The little fish was so excited. He knew he'd discovered something special, a unique reef all lit up with beautiful twinkling lights.
