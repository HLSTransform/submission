Once upon a time there was a tall man who lived in a big house. Everyday he would stand in front of his stove and stir a pot of soup.
One day, as he was stirring, he heard a strange sound coming from the corner of the room. He leaned over and looked to see what it was. A small foot was poking up from under a blanket!
The man was surprised and yelled, "Who are you?" A little voice said, "It's me, I'm a tiny boy!"
The tall man was amazed and asked the little boy what he was doing in his house. The tiny boy told him that he had followed a mouse in and curled up under the blanket to take a nap!
The tall man smiled and said, "Oh, ok! How about I make you a bowl of soup?" The tiny boy was delighted and said yes please!
So the tall man stirred the soup and served the little boy. And they both enjoyed their soup. The end.
