Once upon a time, there was a mighty planet full of wonderful creatures. But the planet was very sad. None of the creatures had ever met each other before. They wanted to be friends, but they did not know how.
One day, a brave little creature flew to the planet. She wanted to help the creatures meet each other. She flew around the planet, calling out to all the creatures.
At first it was a little scary, but soon the creatures started to meet each other. They talked and laughed, and some even gave each other hugs. The little creature was thrilled, she had helped the planet become happy again.
The creatures all gathered to thank the brave little creature for bringing them together. They were so happy to have someone who cared about them. Since then, the mighty planet has been full of friendship and joy!
