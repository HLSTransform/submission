Once upon a time, there was a big turkey. He was very rich and had lots of feathers. One day, his feathers got all messy and he needed to remove them. He asked his friends for help, but they didn't know how. Then, a little girl came by and offered to help. She gently removed all the messy feathers and the turkey felt much better. From that day on, they became good friends and the turkey shared his riches with her. The end.
