Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jackie. She was three years old. Jackie liked to jog. Every day she felt so energetic and she loved to move her legs quickly. 
One day, Jackie went to a fun park and saw a big menu on the wall. It had so many items on it! She wanted to try them all. First Jackie chose an ice cream. Then she wanted a cookie. After that, she wanted to try a milkshake. Jackie thought it was all so crazy but delicious.
After Jackie finished all the yummy snacks, she decided to go joggling around the park. She jogged and jogged until she was very tired. Soon Jackie stopped. She was so happy she got to do some joggling and eat some amazing food!
