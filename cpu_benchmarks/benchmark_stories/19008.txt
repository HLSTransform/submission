Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to sail on his boat with his dad. They would go to the lake and sail all day long. One day, they saw a big library near the lake. Timmy was curious and asked his dad what it was. His dad told him it was a place where you can borrow books to read. 
Timmy was excited to go to the library and see all the books. When they arrived, Timmy saw a book with a bitter taste on the cover. He asked his dad if they could borrow it. His dad said yes and they took it home. Timmy read the book and learned about different flavors. He realized that bitter was just one of them. From that day on, Timmy loved to read books from the library and sail on his boat with his dad.
