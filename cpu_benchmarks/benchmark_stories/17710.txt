Mark was playing outside in his yard. He saw a wagon in the field and ran to it. He was so excited! The wagon was the perfect size and it fit him perfectly. Mark wanted to take it for a ride. He grabbed the handle and started pulling the wagon across the grass. He was playing so hard he didn't even notice his mom getting closer. She was so happy to see Mark having so much fun with the wagon! She helped him move the wagon around and they went on an adventure together. Mark was so happy they even stopped to pick some flowers along the way. Finally, they were back in the yard and Mark got to mark his adventure with some chalk. He made the biggest smiley face he could and proudly showed it off to his mom. Together, they both laughed about the amazing time they had. What a great adventure!
