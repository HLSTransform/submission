Once upon a time, there was a girl. She was very special because she loved pink. Everywhere she went, she had a pink hat and a pink coat.
One day, the girl had a special button. It was pink and sparkly. She looked at it and smiled.
The girl wanted to show her button to her friends. So, she decided to stand up. She stood very tall and held up the button. Her friends were so excited to see it!
The girl laughed and smiled. She was so happy that everyone could see her beautiful pink button. From that day on, she always wore her pink coat and hat, and showed her button to her friends.
