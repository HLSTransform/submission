Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play sports. He played soccer, basketball, and baseball. He was very good at all of them.
One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy said he didn't like sports because he wasn't good at them. Timmy encouraged Billy to try playing with him. "It's okay if you're not good at first," Timmy said. "I can teach you."
Billy decided to give it a try. Timmy was very wise and showed Billy how to play each sport. Billy had so much fun playing with Timmy that he decided he loved sports too. From that day on, they played sports together every day.
