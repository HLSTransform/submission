Once upon a time, there was a big party at the castle. All the people in the kingdom were invited. The king was very rich and he wanted everyone to have fun. But then, something bad happened. The food for the party was delayed. 
The people were getting hungry and angry. They wanted to eat! The king didn't know what to do. He asked his helpers to find out what was happening. They found out that the cook had burned the food and had to start over. This was a big problem. 
But then, the king had an idea. He asked his helpers to bring out a big strip of paper and some crayons. They started drawing and coloring on the paper. Soon, everyone was having fun again. They forgot about the food delay. They were happy just drawing and coloring. And when the food was finally ready, it tasted even better because they had all had so much fun together. The end.
