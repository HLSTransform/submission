Once upon a time there was a crazy sailboat. It was made of cauliflower! All the other boats were made of wood and metal, but this one was made of cauliflower.
The little sailboat floated on the big, blue ocean all day. It sailed over big waves, small waves and crazy storms. Nothing could stop the cauliflower sailboat!
Suddenly, a strong wind blew the sailboat off course. It sailed faster and farther than ever before and went to a magical island. On this island, the cauliflower sailboat met many other boats of all shapes and sizes. They danced and played for days and days!
At the end of their journey, the cauliflower sailboat and its new friends sailed back to the shore. The little sailboat was feeling sad to be leaving its new friends, but it was also happy to be back home.
The cauliflower sailboat sailed and sailed, until finally it reached its destination: a place where it would feel safe and be happy forever.
