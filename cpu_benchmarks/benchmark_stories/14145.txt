There was once a clumsy girl named Sue. She had a nice vest that made her feel happy and special. Every day, Sue would put on her vest and show it to her friends.
One Saturday morning, Sue went to put on her vest. But, as she reached for it, Sue tripped and the vest flew into the air. She reached up to grab it, but it was too late. She watched as her vest flew away towards the sky.
Sue was very sad. She realized that she had been too clumsy and now her vest was gone. She said goodbye and waved at her vest as it got further and further away.
Sue never found her vest again. She realized that she had been too clumsy and lost something special.
