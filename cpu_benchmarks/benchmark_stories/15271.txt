Once there were two friends. They were walking in the dark. It was very quiet, and they were a little bit scared. Suddenly they saw a light. The light was coming from a small hole in the ground. One of the friends looked into the hole. He became very excited and said “Let’s pull the light out!”
So they both grabbed hold of the light and started to pull. Suddenly the light came out of the hole. But the friends were troubled. The light looked funny. It had thick fur and two big eyes!
The friends were scared and they started to run. But the light followed! It chased the poor friends all the way home.
The next day, the friends asked their parents if they had seen a funny looking light. But their parents just laughed and said “No, it must have been your imagination!” 
The friends weren’t sure. Was it a light or something else? They never found out…
