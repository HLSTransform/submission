One sunny day, Mandy was walking around the playground with her friend Emily. Suddenly she noticed the stove and stared at it with admiration. 
“Let’s go and look at it,” said Mandy. 
Emily nodded her head in agreement and the two girls ran to the stove.  
Mandy was fascinated by the graceful shape of the stove. She reached for the big handle and began to turn it. 
“What are you doing?” asked Emily.
Mandy replied, “I’m locking the stove so no one can use it.” 
Emily laughed and said, “That’s silly, Mandy. Who would want to use a stove in the playground?”
Mandy smiled and shrugged her shoulders. 
“It was worth a try!” she said.
The two girls laughed and skipped away, off to find something else to explore.
