Once upon a time, in a big sky, a little star lived. The star was very tight with all the other stars. They liked to play together.
One day, the little star and his friends decided to play a game. They raced to see who could get to the end of the sky first. The little star was fast, but his friends were faster.
The little star did not win. But he was happy because he had fun with his friends. At the end of the day, they all went back to their homes in the sky, feeling tight and close. They knew they would play together again soon.
