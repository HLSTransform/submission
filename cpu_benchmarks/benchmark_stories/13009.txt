Once, a long time ago, there was a purple cat. The cat loved to play in the sun. One day, the cat went to a big field full of tall grass. The cat wanted to explore, but something else was in the field. It was a big, purple hole! The cat was scared, so it started to stretch out its long body and look into the purple hole. It wanted to see what was inside.
But the hole just kept going deeper and deeper until it seemed like it might never end. The cat was sure there was something down there, but it couldn't reach it. Suddenly, the cat had an idea. It bent down and stretched its head one more time. To its surprise, the cat's head fit into the hole! Instead of being scared, the cat was curious now. What would it find down there? 
Slowly, the cat started to stretch itself more and more until it fit inside the hole. As it went further down, the cat heard the most beautiful sound. It was birds singing in an old tree. The cat was so excited that it didn't even notice it was down in a very deep purple hole. But it didn't matter. The cat had found a magical place and it was happy.
