Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to feed the pigeons in the park. One day, she met a boy who was also feeding the pigeons. His name was Jack.
"Hi Jack, do you want to feed the pigeons with me?" Lily asked.
"I'm too impatient to wait for the pigeons to come," Jack replied.
Lily suggested, "Maybe we can sing a song while we wait for the pigeons to come. It will make the time go faster."
Jack thought that was a great idea. They sang a song together and soon the pigeons came to eat the seeds they had scattered on the ground.
Afterwards, Jack said, "Thank you for suggesting we sing a song. I had fun waiting for the pigeons with you."
Lily smiled and said, "You're welcome, Jack. It's always better to be patient and have fun than to be impatient and miss out on the fun."
