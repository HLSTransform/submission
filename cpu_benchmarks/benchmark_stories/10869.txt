Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mom gave her a new jacket with a zipper. Lily loved her new jacket and wore it every day. One day, while playing outside, Lily accidentally spilled some ice cream on her jacket. She was sad because now her jacket wasn't clean anymore.
Lily's mom saw her sad face and asked her what was wrong. Lily told her about the ice cream stain on her jacket. Her mom said, "Don't worry, Lily. I know how to clean it. Let's go inside and I'll show you." They went inside and her mom showed her how to clean the stain with soap and water. Lily was happy because now her jacket was clean again.
Lily hugged her mom and said, "Thank you, Mommy. You always know how to fix things." Her mom smiled and said, "I love you, Lily." And Lily replied, "I love you too, Mommy."
