Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the rain. One day, Lily saw that her favorite bucket was empty. She wanted to fill it up with rainwater, but it was too high for her to reach.
Lily asked her mommy for help, but her mommy was busy cooking dinner. "I'm sorry, sweetie. I can't help you right now," her mommy said.
Feeling helpless, Lily tried to climb on a chair to reach the bucket. But she slipped and fell down. Her mommy rushed over to her, but it was too late. Lily had hurt herself badly.
From that day on, Lily never played in the rain again. She learned that sometimes it's better to wait for help than to try to do things on her own.
