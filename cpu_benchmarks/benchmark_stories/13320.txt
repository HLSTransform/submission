One day, Tom and Sue were playing in the park. They wanted to create something fun. Tom had an idea. "Let's make a big sandcastle!" he said. Sue liked the idea and they started to build.
As they were building, a troubled boy named Tim came by. He did not know how to make a sandcastle. Tom and Sue wanted to teach Tim. "Come join us, Tim!" Sue said. Tim was happy and started to learn.
Together, they made the biggest sandcastle in the park. Tim was not troubled anymore. He was happy and had new friends. They all played together and had a great day.
