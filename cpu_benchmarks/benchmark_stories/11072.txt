Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play catch with a ball. They throw the ball to each other and run and laugh.
One day, Lily brings a new toy to play with. It is a book of stamps. Lily likes stamps. They have pictures of animals and flowers and cars. Lily shows Tom her stamps. Tom thinks they are pretty.
"Can I have one?" Tom asks.
"OK, you can have one. But only one," Lily says. She gives Tom a stamp with a lion on it. Tom likes lions. He says thank you and sticks the stamp on his shirt.
They play catch with the ball again. But the ball is too fast and too hard. It hits Tom on his chest. Tom falls down and cries. The stamp falls off his shirt and flies away.
Lily runs to Tom and helps him up. She sees that his stamp is gone. She looks around and sees the stamp on the grass. She runs to get it.
But a bird sees the stamp too. It thinks it is food. It flies down and picks up the stamp with its beak. It flies away with the stamp.
Lily and Tom are sad. They lost the stamp. They watch the bird fly away.
"Bye, bye, stamp," they say. They hug each other and go home.
