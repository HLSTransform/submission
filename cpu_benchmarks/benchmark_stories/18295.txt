Once upon a time, there was a little frog. He lived in a pond. One day, the sun was very hot and the pond was dry. The little frog was very sad because he couldn't swim in the pond. He wanted to play in the water. 
Suddenly, he saw a big leaf. He hopped on the leaf and it floated on the water. The little frog was happy because he could play in the pond again. He saw a bug and he picked it up with his tongue. The little frog was so happy to have a friend to play with in the pond. 
From that day on, the little frog played on the leaf every day. He picked up bugs and had fun in the pond, even when it was dry.
