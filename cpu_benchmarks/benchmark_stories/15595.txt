Sara and Ben were very happy. Today, a new kitten would arrive at their home. They loved animals and wanted to play with the kitten. They waited and waited for the car to come.
At last, they saw the car in the driveway. They ran outside and saw their mom holding a small box. She opened the box and showed them the kitten. It was fluffy and black, with green eyes and a pink nose. Sara and Ben smiled and clapped.
"Hello, kitten!" they said. "We are your new friends. What is your name?"
The kitten looked at them and meowed. It was a little scared, but also curious. It sniffed their hands and let them pet it.
"Her name is Luna," their mom said. "She is very sweet and smart. She was the most successful kitten in her litter. She learned how to use the litter box and how to play with toys very fast."
"Wow, Luna is amazing!" Sara and Ben said. "Can we take her inside and show her our room?"
"Of course, but be gentle and quiet," their mom said. "She needs some time to get used to her new home."
Sara and Ben nodded and carried the box inside. They put it on the floor and opened it. Luna came out and looked around. She saw their bed, their toys, their books, and their pictures. She walked over to them and rubbed her head against their legs.
Sara and Ben hugged her and kissed her. They felt very happy and lucky. They had a new kitten and a new friend. Luna felt happy and safe. She had a new home and a new family. They all loved each other very much.
