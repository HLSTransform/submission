Once upon a time, there was a little squirrel named Sammy. Sammy loved to play and have fun. One day, Sammy found a funny looking nut. 
"Wow, this nut is funny!" said Sammy.
Just then, Sammy's friend Timmy came over.
"Hi Sammy, what are you doing?" asked Timmy.
"I found a funny nut!" said Sammy.
"Can I see it?" asked Timmy.
"Sure!" said Sammy.
Timmy tried to enter Sammy's treehouse to see the nut, but he was too big to fit.
"I can't enter your treehouse, Sammy. It's too small," said Timmy.
"That's okay, I'll bring the nut to you," said Sammy.
And so, Sammy brought the funny nut to Timmy and they both had a good laugh. The end.
