One day, Bob the bear saw winter coming. He wanted to prepare so he went on a journey. As he walked, the cold air made him feel dizzy and he started to nod off. He was so exhausted, he decided to take a nap. When he awoke, the snow had blanketed the ground. Winter had arrived and Bob was happy. He had the perfect plan for how to make the most of the winter months. He would build a snowman! 
Bob went off in search of the perfect place to build. After hours of walking, he finally found the perfect spot. But when he arrived, he spotted something strange. In the middle of the snow was another snowman! Bob was surprised. He thought he was the only one who had the idea. As he got closer, he noticed something even more peculiar. The other snowman looked just like him! 
Bob was amazed and slightly dizzy by the sight. Suddenly, he realized why. It was a reflection! The snow on the ground was so bright and shiny that it had created a mirror image of Bob's snowman. He smiled and walked away, nodding in appreciation. He knew winter could be a magical season.
