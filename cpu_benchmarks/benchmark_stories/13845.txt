Once upon a time, there was a big, friendly bear. He loved to eat lots of food. One day, his stomach was very full.
Bear saw a tree with yummy fruits. He wanted to get the fruits down. So, he decided to shake the tree.
Bear shook the tree with his big paws. The fruits fell down. He was very happy and ate them all. His stomach was full and he smiled. And from that day, Bear always shook the trees to get his favorite fruits.
