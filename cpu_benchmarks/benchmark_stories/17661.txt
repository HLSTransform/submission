Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tommy. Tommy was just three years old and loved exploring!
One day, Tommy was outside in the sunshine. He saw an anthill and wanted to explore it. He peered in and noticed something shiny inside.
He carefully reached in and grabbed the shiny thing. It was a wet stamp! Tommy was so excited and decided to keep it.
He ran back inside the house and put the stamp safely on the table. He wanted to show it to his Mommy and Daddy. 
Tommy's parents saw how excited he was, so they let him use the stamp. He set it on some paper and gave it a big press. 
Tommy was delighted - it made him feel so grown up! He couldn't wait to share it with his friends. 
He ran outside, stamp in hand, and showed it to all of his pals. They all cheered and gave him big hugs. 
Tommy had a great time that day and was very happy. He couldn't wait for his next adventure!
