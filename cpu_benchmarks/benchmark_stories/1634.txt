Sara likes to sing. She sings all day long. She sings in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. She sings to her toys, to her mom, and to her dad. She sings happy songs and sad songs. She sings loud and soft.
One day, Sara wants to learn a new song. She asks her mom to teach her. Her mom says, "OK, Sara, I will teach you a new song. It is called 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'. Do you know it?" Sara shakes her head. She does not know it.
Her mom says, "Listen to me, Sara, and repeat after me. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are." Sara tries to say the words, but they are difficult. She says, "Tinkle, tinkle, little tar, how I wonder what you far." Her mom says, "No, Sara, not tinkle, twinkle. And not tar, star. And not far, are. Try again."
Sara tries again, but she still says the words wrong. She says, "Pinkle, pinkle, little car, how I wonder what you jar." Her mom says, "No, Sara, not pinkle, twinkle. And not car, star. And not jar, are. Try again."
Sara tries again and again, but she cannot say the words right. She gets angry and sad. She says, "I don't like this song. It is too difficult. I don't want to learn it. I want to sing my own songs." She runs away from her mom and goes to her room. She slams the door and cries. She does not sing anymore.
