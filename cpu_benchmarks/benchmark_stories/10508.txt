Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Sarah. She was three years old and loved to explore her house. One day, Sarah found a big circle in the shower. She went over and touched its hard surface, and it felt cold and uncomfortable.
Sarah went to ask her mom why it was there.
"Mommy, what is this big circle?" she asked.
"Oh that? That is a drain, honey" replied her mom. 
"Why is it there?"  asked Sarah.
"We need it so the water can drain away after we bathe" replied her mom.
Sarah smiled in understanding.
The next time she was in the bathroom, Sarah looked at the circle with a new appreciation. She could see how it was an important part of the family's bathing routine.
