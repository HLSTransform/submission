Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mary. She loved to play with her toys, and one of her favorites was a small radio. Every day, Mary would pick up the radio and hold it close in her arms. 
One day, Mary was feeling very hungry and wanted a snack. She grabbed her radio and went downstairs to the kitchen. Her Mom was there, and she was cooking some yummy food. It smelled so tasty!
Mom gave Mary a plate of food, and Mary ate it all up. She also grabbed a big glass of cold milk to wash it down. Mary was so happy that she took her radio and ran outside to play. 
The sun was out and it was such a beautiful day! Mary sat in the grass and held her radio close as she played in the sun. She was so happy, and her snack was so tasty!
