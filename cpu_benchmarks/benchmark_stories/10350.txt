Lily liked to peek at things. She peeked at her mom when she cooked. She peeked at her dad when he read. She peeked at her cat when he slept. She liked to see what they were doing.
One day, Lily saw a mysterious box on the table. It was big and brown and had a ribbon on it. She wondered what was inside. She wanted to peek at it.
She waited until her mom and dad were busy. Then she tiptoed to the table. She reached for the box. She lifted the lid. She peeked inside.
She saw a lot of oat. It was white and fluffy and smelled good. She touched it with her hand. It was soft and warm. She smiled. She liked oat.
But then she heard a noise. It was a squeak. It came from the box. She looked closer. She saw a tiny nose. And two black eyes. And two long ears. It was a bunny!
Lily gasped. She was surprised. She was happy. She loved bunnies. She picked up the bunny. She hugged it. She said, "Hello, bunny. You are my new friend."
The bunny licked her cheek. It said, "Hello, Lily. You are my new friend, too."
Lily and the bunny laughed. They played with the oat. They had fun. They were happy.
Lily's mom and dad came to the table. They saw Lily and the bunny. They smiled. They said, "Surprise, Lily. This is your birthday present. We hope you like it."
Lily nodded. She said, "I love it. Thank you, mom and dad. This is the best birthday ever."
