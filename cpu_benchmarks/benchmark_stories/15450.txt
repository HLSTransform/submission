Once upon a time there was a clever little boy named Jack. Every morning, his Mommy would give him a bowl of cereal and ask him to sign. He didn't understand why but he was too clever not to listen. 
Every time he signed, he got a little bit of a special treat. He got some chocolates or an extra cereal bar. Jack really loved signing and he would do it every morning. 
One day, Jack found out why his Mommy wanted him to sign. His Mommy said that signing was a way to say thank you. Hearing this made Jack happy and he kept signing every morning with a great big smile. 
Jack was so happy that he started teaching his friends how to sign. He would show them how to make the shapes with their hands and it made his friends very happy. From then on, Jack would make sure to sign for his Mommy every morning and to thank her for his bowl of cereal.
