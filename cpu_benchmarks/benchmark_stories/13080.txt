Once upon a time there was an elderly lady. She lived in a small house that lay at the edge of the forest. Every morning the lady would rise from her bed and make her way to the kitchen. There, she would carefully mix together cream, sugar, some fruit and some special spices. She would lay them all in a bowl and carefully stir it together until it was all mixed together.
Then, the elderly lady would lay a spoon in the bowl. She slowly closed her eyes, and with a wish, she took the spoon and started to eat the creamy mixture. As she slowly ate the yummy treat, the elderly lady felt a warm happy feeling growing inside of her.
The next morning, the lady did the same thing. She rose from bed early, went to her kitchen and carefully mixed, stirred and layed her mixture in the bowl. She smiled as she ate her spoonful of yummy cream.
The elderly lady did this routine everyday, obviously enjoying every spoonful!
