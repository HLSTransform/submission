Jack looked out of his window and wondered what was in the garage next door. He knew there was something special inside because he could hear loud noises coming from it. He watched as the door opened and a wild car came out. He had never seen anything like it before! 
Jack wanted to explore the garage, but he knew he wasn't allowed. He thought for a while, and then he came up with an idea. He would sneak over to the garage and peek inside from behind the bushes.
So, Jack grabbed his coat and ran outside. He hid behind the bushes and peered inside the old, creaky garage. He couldn't believe his eyes! There were lots of cars, tools and strange machines inside. Jack wondered what all these things were used for, and why they were so wild! 
Jack just sat there, watching and wondering, until the sun began to set. He knew then that it was time to go home. But deep down, Jack knew that he would be back soon, to explore the wild garage again.
