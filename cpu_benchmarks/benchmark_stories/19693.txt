John wanted to go for a swim. His mommy invited him to go to the lake. It was a big lake with a lot of fish. John was so excited. 
John and his mommy started walking to the lake. It looked so pretty. The blue water was glistening in the sun. John couldn't wait to get in!
When they got to the lake, John jumped right in! The water felt nice and cool. John splashed around and saw lots of fish swimming by. 
John got out of the lake feeling refreshed and happy. Mommy then invited him to get some lunch. She had made some yummy sandwiches that tasted really tasty. 
 
John was so happy to enjoy a delicious lunch after his swim in the lake. Mommy and John had so much fun and were so happy together.
