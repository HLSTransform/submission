Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she found a red symbol on the ground. It was shaped like a heart, but she didn't know what it meant.
She showed it to her mom and asked, "What is this, mommy?"
Her mom kneeled down to look at the symbol and said, "That's a symbol of love, Lily. It means someone cares about you very much."
Lily smiled and hugged her mom. "I love you too, mommy," she said.
From that day on, Lily kept the symbol in her pocket as a reminder that she was loved. She showed it to all her friends and told them about the special meaning behind it. And every time she saw her mom, she gave her a big hug and said, "I love you, mommy."
