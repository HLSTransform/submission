Once upon a time there were two friends, Jak and Sam. Jak was very interested in unusual fashion, so every Sunday he went to the mall to record all the new and strange styles.
One day when Jak was walking around the mall, he saw a really unusual hat. 'Oh wow, what's that?' he said to Sam. 
'It looks cool!' Sam said. 'Let's try it on!'
The two friends grabbed the hat and put it on. Right away they both started laughing. 'This looks so funny!' Jak said. 
Jak took out his phone and said, 'I have to record this' as he took some pictures. When they finished, they put the hat back on the shelf and ran off to find more unusual fashion.
