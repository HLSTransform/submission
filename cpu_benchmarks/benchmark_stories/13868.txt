One day, a little girl named Lily wanted to build a house. She had many pink blocks to use. Lily started to stack the blocks one on top of the other. She tried to balance the blocks to make the house stand tall.
Lily's brother, Max, came into the room. He saw the pink house and said, "I want to help!" Max tried to put a block on the house, but it fell down. Lily was sad and said, "No, Max! You made my house fall!"
Max felt bad and wanted to make Lily happy. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. Let's build the house together." They worked together to balance the pink blocks. Soon, the house was even taller than before. Lily and Max were both happy and proud of their pink house.
