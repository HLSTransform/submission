Once upon a time, there was a kind elephant named Ellie. Ellie loved to play her trumpet every day. One day, Ellie decided to surprise her friend, a monkey named Max, with a present. She went to the store and bought a shiny new trumpet for Max. 
When Ellie got home, she carefully wrapped the trumpet in colorful paper and tied a big bow on top. She was so excited to give the present to Max. 
The next day, Ellie went to Max's house and gave him the wrapped present. Max was so happy and thanked Ellie with a big hug. He quickly opened the present and saw the shiny new trumpet. Max was so grateful to have such a kind friend like Ellie. From that day on, Max and Ellie played their trumpets together every day.
