Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Emma. Emma loved to bake with her mommy. One day, they wanted to make a tasty cake. They needed to measure the ingredients first.
Emma and her mommy used a scale to measure the flour, sugar, and butter. They put them all in a big bowl. Emma's mommy said, "Now we can mix them all together!"
Emma mixed and mixed until it was all done. Then they put the cake in the oven to bake. When it was done, they took it out and let it cool. Emma said, "Yummy! This cake will be so tasty!"
Emma and her mommy cut the cake and shared it with their family. Everyone loved the tasty cake. Emma was so happy that she helped her mommy make such a yummy treat.
