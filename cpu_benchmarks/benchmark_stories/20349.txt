Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play with their scooters. They have different scooters. Tom's scooter is red and big. Mia's scooter is pink and small. They share their scooters and have fun.
One day, Tom and Mia go to the park with their scooters. They see a big hill. They want to go down the hill with their scooters. Tom says, "Let's go fast!" Mia says, "OK!" They go up the hill and get ready to go down.
But they do not see the cook. The cook is walking with a big pot of soup. He is going to the picnic table. He does not see Tom and Mia. They do not see him. They go down the hill very fast. They hit the cook. The cook falls down. The pot of soup falls down. The soup is hot. It burns Tom and Mia. They scream. They cry. The cook is angry. He shouts. He says, "You are bad kids! You ruined my soup! You hurt me!"
Tom and Mia are sorry. They say, "We are sorry, cook. We did not see you. We did not mean to hurt you." But the cook does not listen. He takes their scooters. He says, "These are mine now. You can't have them back. You can't play with them anymore." He walks away with their scooters.
Tom and Mia are sad. They have no scooters. They have no fun. They have burns. They have a bad day. They wish they did not go down the hill. They wish they saw the cook. They wish they had different scooters.
