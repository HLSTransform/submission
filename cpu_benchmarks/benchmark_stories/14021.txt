One day, a girl and a boy went to the park. They saw a tree with a prune on it. The girl wanted the prune, but the boy did not want to share. They started to discuss who should get the prune.
The boy got frustrated and began to cry. The girl got frustrated too, and they both stopped talking. They did not know what to do about the prune. They just looked at it and felt sad.
In the end, a bird came and took the prune away. The girl and the boy were both very sad. They did not get the prune, and they did not play together anymore. It was a bad day at the park.
