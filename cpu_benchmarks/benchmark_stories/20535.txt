Molly was excited to go to the playground. She saw many different things there. She counted the swings and the slides. She waved to the birds and counted their colors. Everything she counted was interesting and different. 
Suddenly, Molly heard clapping. She looked up, and there were all her friends. They were all clapping as if to welcome her to the playground. Molly smiled and waved back. 
She wanted to count everyone's fingers, but she couldn't keep track. That's when her friends had a great idea. They all lined up, and counting from the front to the back, they all said their names out loud. When everyone said their name, Molly counted each one, and smiled at how different everyone was. 
Molly was so happy that everyone welcomed her to the playground with such a special counting game. She was ready to play!
