Once upon a time, there was a little tank named Tommy. Tommy loved to push things around with his strong wheels. One day, Tommy saw a big tank named Bob. Bob was not very compassionate and liked to push other tanks around.
Tommy was scared of Bob, but he knew he had to stand up to him. So, Tommy pushed Bob with all his might. Bob didn't like being pushed and got angry. He started to chase Tommy around.
But Tommy had a plan. He led Bob to a muddy puddle and pushed him in. Bob got stuck and couldn't move. Tommy felt compassionate and decided to help Bob out of the mud.
From that day on, Bob learned to be more compassionate and didn't push other tanks around anymore. Tommy was happy he stood up to Bob and made a new friend.
