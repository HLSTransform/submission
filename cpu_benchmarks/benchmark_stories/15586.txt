Sara and Ben are playing in the snow. They make a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They give him a carrot nose and two buttons for eyes. They are very happy with their snowman.
"Look, our snowman is so nice!" Sara says.
"Yes, he is. He is our friend. He is ours." Ben says.
They hug their snowman and smile.
But then, a big dog comes running. He sees the snowman and thinks it is a toy. He jumps on the snowman and knocks him down. He grabs the carrot nose and runs away.
"Hey, stop! That is our snowman! That is our nose!" Sara and Ben shout.
They chase the dog, but he is too fast. He eats the carrot nose and licks his lips. He thinks it is yummy.
Sara and Ben are very sad. They look at their snowman. He has no nose and no hat and no scarf. He is broken.
They start to cry.
"Bad dog! You are mean! You took our snowman! You took our nose!" Sara and Ben say.
The dog hears them and feels sorry. He comes back and wags his tail. He wants to play with them. He thinks they are his friends.
But Sara and Ben are angry. They do not want to play with him. They want their snowman back.
They pick up some snow and throw it at the dog. They make him wet and cold. They make him freeze.
"Go away, dog! You are not our friend! You are not ours!" Sara and Ben say.
The dog runs away and hides. He is sad and lonely. He wishes he had not taken the carrot nose. He wishes he had not broken the snowman. He wishes he had been nice.
