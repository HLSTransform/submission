Once upon a time, there was a nosy armchair in a house. The armchair was always looking around at what was going on. Everywhere the armchair looked, it would see changes. One day, it saw a change outside the window. There was a new playground with lots of fun things for children to do. The nosy armchair was excited to watch the children playing!
The next day brought another change. This time it was inside the house. A new sofa was delivered and put on the other side of the armchair. The nosy chair was a bit worried. What if the sofa took all of its attention away?
But then something amazing happened. Next to the sofa, a new armchair was delivered! The nosy armchair was so happy! Now it had a friend to sit with and watch the children outside the window. The two armchairs became very close and watched everything that changed around them.
The nosy armchair had found a new best friend and could watch all the changes together.
