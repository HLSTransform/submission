Once there was a little girl called Mia. Every day, Mia would go down to the park to play. She loved watching the birds and catching butterflies. Mia was always excited for her adventure each day.
One day, Mia noticed something special. There was a basket full of fruits and vegetables. Mia was so excited that she started to applaud! With a basket filled with healthy snacks, Mia started to eat as much as she could.
Mia enjoyed a variety of delicious snacks and was full and happy. She thanked the basket and continued her day.
From then on, Mia still visits the park every day and loves to fill her basket with healthy snacks. Whenever she finds something interesting and new, Mia will take out her basket and applaud!
