One cold winter morning, a little girl named Jessie was walking near the beach when she saw a group of people waving their arms in the air. She walked closer and noticed they were making funny sounds and saying "zoom, zoom". Jessie was feeling curious so she asked her mum, "What are they doing Mum?" Mum replied, "They're Kiteboarding. It's a sport where you use the wind and a kite to glide across the beach and water". Jessie was excited and asked, "Can I do that too?". Mum smiled and said, "Maybe one day but for now, let's look at the kites". 
Then they walked up to a man waving different kites in the air. He said, "Welcome! These are some of my kites. Take a look". Jessie looked up and saw the colourful kites flying and waving. She felt so happy that she wanted to try it too. She asked her mum, "Can I have one of these kites?". Mum replied, "Yes, but don't forget to hold tight when it starts to zoom!" Jessie was very excited, holding her kite and waving it with the other people. From then on, every cold winter morning, Jessie and her mum were out together, kiteboarding and waving in the cold wind.
