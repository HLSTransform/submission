Suddenly a naughty boy named Tom saw something shiny in the corner of the room. It was a pan. He was very excited and could not wait to take the pan. Without thinking, he grabbed it and hid it behind his back.
His mom saw him, and immediately scolded him. She told him to put the pan back where he found it, but Tom refused. He only grew more naughty and started running around the house with the pan in his hand.
Tom's mom knew that if she let him away with it, he would suffer greatly later in his life, so she tried to be patient and stop him from taking the pan. But Tom was too naughty and quick. He slyly dodged his mom's reach and ran out of the house.
His mom knew she must get the pan back and went after Tom. He had gone so far that she almost lost him. Fortunately, she managed to catch him and take the pan away. She buried it back to the corner of the room and scolded Tom for being naughty.
Tom knew he was wrong and began to cry. He suffered from his mom's scolding, but it also taught him an important lesson that he would never forget.
