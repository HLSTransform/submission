Once upon a time, there was a famous animal. Everyone wanted to see him, but he was stuck in a trap. He had tried and tried to get it open, but he just couldn't do it. So, he began to climb up the walls to try and find a way out. 
The animal climbed and climbed up the trap, looking and feeling his way with his feet and hands. He came to a window and he knew he had to try it. Taking a deep breath, he jumped for it and miraculously he was able to fit through the small window. 
He felt a sense of relief as he ran away from his old trap. He was so excited that he could finally be free and do all the things he wanted to do. He was now famous for his bravery in climbing and no one would ever be able to trap him again!
