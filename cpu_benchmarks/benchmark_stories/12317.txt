Once there was a bird named Bob. Bob loved to fly all around the world. Everywhere he went, he saw attractive things and he meet lots of friends. One day Bob was sad because he felt like he had nowhere to go.
Suddenly, he heard someone call his name. Bob looked around and saw a small purple frog.
"Hello Bob," said the frog.
"Hi! What are you doing here?" asked Bob.
"I'd like to show you something," said the frog.
Bob followed the frog and he saw a beautiful pond.
"This is the best place to take a rest. If you rub these stones, you will feel better," said the frog as he handed a couple of stones to Bob.
Bob rubbed the stones and he felt refreshed.
"Thanks," said Bob.
"Remember," said the frog, "No matter how sad or lonely you feel, there will always be something attractive waiting to be discovered. Never indulge in sadness, just look around and you might find a beautiful surprise!"
Bob thanked the frog, smiled and flew away. He never felt so happy before and he was determined to always look around for beautiful things. 
The moral of the story is to always look around and appreciate the beauty in everything you see. Never give into sadness and you'll be rewarded with unexpected wonders!
