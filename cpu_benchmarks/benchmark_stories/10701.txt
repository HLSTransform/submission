Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice cream so much that she always asked her parents to take her to the ice cream truck. One day, Lily saw a big cone with rainbow colors on top. It looked incredible!
Lily said to her mom, "Mommy, can I have that incredible cone?"
Her mom replied, "Sure, but you have to step up to the truck and ask for it yourself."
Lily felt nervous but she stepped up to the truck and said, "Can I please have the incredible cone?"
The ice cream man smiled and said, "Of course you can, little girl." Lily was so happy and enjoyed every lick of the incredible cone. From that day on, she always stepped up to the ice cream truck with confidence.
