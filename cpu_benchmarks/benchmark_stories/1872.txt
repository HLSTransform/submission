Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved to explore. One day the little girl decided to explore her mysterious porch. She noticed the top of the porch twisted in the wind. As she watched it twist and turn, the little girl knew she should not try to twist it any more.
The little girl heard a voice coming from above. She looked up and saw a friendly angel who was smiling down at her. The angel said "Little girl, you must never twist anything that belongs to others. You have to respect their things."
The little girl thought about this and decided she would remember the angel's words. From that day on, the little girl was careful not to twist anything that was not hers.
The moral of the story is that it is important to respect the things that belong to others. It is not right to twist or change anything without permission.
