Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books every day. One day, she went to the library with her mommy to find a new book. She found an ordinary book with a pretty cover and asked her mommy if she could borrow it. 
Her mommy said, "Sure, Lily! Let's check it out." 
Lily opened the book and started to read. She loved the story so much that she didn't want to stop. Suddenly, the book started to rock back and forth. 
Lily asked her mommy, "Why is the page moving?" 
Her mommy replied, "Maybe it's because the wind is blowing." 
Lily continued to read and the book kept rocking. She thought it was fun and giggled. When she finished the book, she said, "That was the best book ever!" 
Her mommy smiled and said, "I'm glad you enjoyed it, Lily."
