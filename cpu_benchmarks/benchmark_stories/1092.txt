Once upon a time there was a boy who was brave and strong. He was always looking for ways to help people and have fun. 
One day he saw a pole in the field. He dared himself to climb the pole. He grabbed onto it, but it was very tall and he couldn't reach the top. 
He looked around and saw a ladder. It was very dull and made of wood, but it was tall enough to help him reach the top of the pole. He grabbed onto it and bravely started to climb. 
Slowly and steadily, he went higher and higher. He reached the top of the pole and smiled with pride. He had done it! He felt so happy and brave. 
He had taken a daring challenge, and he had succeeded. He was a hero!
