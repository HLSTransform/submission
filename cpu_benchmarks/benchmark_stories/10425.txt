Once there was a boy who loved to read. He was only three years old but he already liked to pick up a book and read.
One day he decided to go on a march. It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining and the sky was blue. The boy felt very attractive in his new cool clothes. He stepped out and started his march.
He marched and marched, and everywhere he looked there was something interesting to read. He read books and newspapers, he read signs and letters. He read until he was so tired, he had to stop.
It was an amazing march, and the boy was very happy he had read so much. He had learned so many new things and seen so many new places. Now, he would always remember his march.
