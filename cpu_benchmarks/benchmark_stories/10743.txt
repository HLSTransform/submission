One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. He saw an ugly bug on the ground. He looked at it and said, "I want to observe the bug." His mom said, "Okay, but be careful."
In the park, Tim also found a toy sword. He picked it up and played with it. He liked to pretend he was a knight. He played with the sword all day. He thought, "Maybe I can use this sword later."
The next day, Tim went back to the park. He saw the ugly bug again. He remembered that he wanted to observe it. He used his sword to move the bug onto a leaf. He looked at the bug and learned a lot about it. Tim was happy that he found the sword and could use it to help him observe the ugly bug.
