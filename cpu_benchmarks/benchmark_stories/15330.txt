Jackie was a smart girl. She loved when her mom gave her special treats like lollipops. She was excited because today was a special day. Her mom had a test for her. She was testing her to see if Jackie knew all the colors. Jackie grinned and licked her lollipop.
Her mom showed her a lot of things. She showed her a blue ball, a yellow truck and a green flower. Jackie named them all correctly. Next, she had a purple bike, a white kite and a pink doll. Jackie smiled and shouted out the colors.
Jackie was so smart! She remembered all the colors! To reward her, her mom gave her an extra lollipop. Jackie smiled and clapped her hands. She loved to be tested and she especially loved sweet treats. All in all, it was a great day.
