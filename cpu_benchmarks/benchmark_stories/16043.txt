Once upon a time, there was a brilliant king. He was the best king in the world.
The king loved to use his imagination. He imagined many wonderful things. One day he decided to go for a walk in his garden.
Suddenly, he heard a small voice. He looked around and noticed a little bird.
The king smiled and said: "Hello, my friend! What is your name?"
The little bird answered: "My name is Tweetie! And I can help you imagine something really special!"
The king was delighted. He said: "I would love to imagine something special! What should I do?"
Tweetie told him that he had to close his eyes, imagine a beautiful garden and then he would be able to see the most brilliant things. The king did as he was told and before he knew it, he was surrounded by the most magical things he had ever seen!
The king was so happy with what he had imagined. He thanked Tweetie for helping him and then continued his walk in his now brilliant garden.
