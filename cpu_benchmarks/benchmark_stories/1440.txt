Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a big owie. She felt sad and sore, so she went to the doctor to get help. The doctor was very kind and gentle. He said that he had a special place for her to go, where she would feel more comfortable and could heal. 
The little girl went to the special place and it was like a secret space. Inside, it was full of pillows, blankets and soft toys. The walls were painted with pictures of stars and she had a cozy corner with a big, comfy chair. 
The little girl stayed in this special place every day. She did puzzles and played with the toys and sometimes she snuggled up in the chair with a blanket and read books. Gradually, her owie began to heal and she felt better. 
The little girl was so thankful for the special space and she felt much better after her visit. She smiled and thanked the doctor for helping her to heal.
