Once upon a time there was a brave little girl called Charlotte. She was only three-years-old and very curious. She loved to explore and learn about the world. One day, Charlotte was walking in the park when she saw a big, fluffy rabbit hopping around the grass. She wanted to get close to the rabbit, but she was a bit scared.
Just then the rabbit hopped into a big hole in the ground. Charlotte peered into the dark hole and could see the rabbit had gone very far down into it. She couldn't get the rabbit out on her own, so she ran to get her mum.
Charlotte's mum said: "Oh no, the rabbit is stuck! We have to save it!"
Charlotte was so excited and said: "Let's do it!"
Charlotte and her mum got some rope, a big bucket and a torch, then they went back to the hole. They shone the torch into the hole and saw the rabbit struggling at the bottom. 
They had to act fast! Charlotte's mum began to lower the bucket down on the rope. Charlotte guided it so that it was close to the rabbit. She said: "Come on bunny, jump in the bucket". To Charlotte's wonder, the bunny hopped into the bucket and they were able to pull it back up carefully.
Charlotte and her mum gave each other a big high-five. They had saved the bunny! Charlotte
