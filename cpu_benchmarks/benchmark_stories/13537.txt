Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to spin around and around until she got dizzy. One day, she went to the park with her mom and dad. They saw a big tent and heard music coming from it. 
"What's that?" asked Lily.
"That's an opera," said her mom.
"What's an opera?" asked Lily.
"It's like a play with singing," said her dad.
Lily was very enthusiastic and wanted to go inside. When they got in, they saw people singing and dancing on a big stage. Lily loved it and started to spin around in circles. 
After the show, Lily said, "I want to be in an opera one day!"
Her mom and dad smiled and said, "We'll support you in whatever you want to do, Lily."
