Once upon a time, there was a small bug. He had a friend, who was an elderly bug. They liked to play together.
One day, they decided to go to a big tree. The tree had many leaves. They were very happy to play there. The elderly bug said, "I like this tree a lot!"
The small bug and elderly bug played all day. They had so much fun. Then, they went home to rest. They were very tired but happy.
