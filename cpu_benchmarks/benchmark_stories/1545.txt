Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved playing with his toy cars. One day, he went to the park to play with his friends. He brought his favorite car with him, a red one with big wheels.
When Timmy arrived at the park, he saw a new boy playing with his friends. The new boy had a toy car too, but it was different. It had big, black wheels and could go really fast. Timmy was curious and wanted to play with the new boy's car, but the new boy said no.
Timmy felt sad and didn't understand why the new boy wouldn't share his car. Timmy's friend, Sarah, explained to him that the new boy was ignorant and didn't know how to share. Timmy recognized that he didn't want to be like the new boy and decided to keep playing with his own car and sharing it with his friends.
