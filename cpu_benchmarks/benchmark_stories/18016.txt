Once upon a time, there was a rich man who lived in a big house. He had many things, but he was not happy. One day, he saw a raven outside his window. The raven looked sad and hungry. The man felt sorry for the raven and decided to give him some food.
The raven was very happy and flew away. But the man was still not happy. He wanted more things. He went to the store and bought many things, but he still felt empty inside. Then he remembered the raven and how happy he was with just a little bit of food.
The man decided to settle down and be happy with what he had. He gave away many of his things to people who needed them more. From that day on, he was happy and content. And sometimes, he would see the raven outside his window and they would both be happy together.
