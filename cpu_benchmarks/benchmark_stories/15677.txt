Once upon a time, there was a boy named John. He wanted to explore!
One day he decided to go for a walk. He packed a snack and left.
John came to a trail. He decided to walk down it. It was different from anything he had ever seen before. He was very excited!
As he walked, he saw some other people. They said hello to John and asked where he was going.
John said, “I'm just exploring!”
John kept walking and then he arrived at a pond. He saw lots of ducks swimming around. He waved at them and they waved back.
John was happy and he couldn't wait to tell his family about his adventure. He waved goodbye to the ducks and continued on his way. 
When he got back home, he was so excited to tell his family about his adventure. “I went on a walk and I saw lots of different things!” he said. His family smiled and said, “we’re so glad you arrived home safely!”
