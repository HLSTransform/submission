One day, a little boy named Tim saw an attractive package near his house. It was big and had pretty colors. Tim was very curious and wanted to know what was inside. He tried to catch the package, but it was too heavy for him. So, he called his friend, Sue.
"Hey Sue, can you help me catch this big package?" Tim asked. Sue came running and saw the attractive package too. Together, they tried to catch the package and bring it inside their house.
As they opened the package, they found a big, shiny ball. They were so excited to play with it. They took the ball outside and started to throw and catch it. They had so much fun playing together.
But then, a big wind came and blew the ball away. Tim and Sue tried to catch it, but it was too fast. The ball went far away and they could not find it. They were very sad.
The attractive package and the big, shiny ball were gone. Tim and Sue went back to their house, feeling sad about the bad ending to their day.
