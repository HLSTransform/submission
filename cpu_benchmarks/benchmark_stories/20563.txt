Once upon a time there was a special girl. She had a lucky leather coat. She would wear it when it was cold outside.
One day, she decided to go for a walk. She was feeling very brave and happy, so she put on her coat and went to the park.
At the park, she saw a special dog. It was a nice dog and it looked so happy. She said hello and the dog wagged its tail.
The girl liked the dog so much, she gave it a big kiss on the head. The dog seemed to smile and they both had a great hug.
The girl gave the dog one last kiss goodbye and then went on her way. She thanked her lucky coat for bringing her such a nice surprise.
