Once there was a wild building. It was tall and strong and very sturdy. But one day a giant monster came and destroyed it! The monster was so big and strong that it knocked the building down. The poor building was ruined and had to be rebuilt.
So the man grabbed his hammer and started to build the building again. He worked for many days and nights and soon the building was standing tall again. This time it was much stronger than before.
But then one day something even more wild arrived. A big tornado! It was so wild that it made a mess of everything. It blew through the city and destroyed the building for a second time. The man was so sad to see his hard work being destroyed again.
But never fear, the man didn't give up. He worked hard to make the building even stronger. Eventually it was standing tall and strong. The wild tornado never returned again. The man was so glad that he had managed to rebuild the building.
