One day, a little bear was playing in the woods. He was very happy and ready for fun. He saw a big tree with a red ball on top. The little bear wanted to play with the red ball.
He tried to climb the tree, but he was too small. A tall bird saw the little bear and asked, "Do you need help, little bear?" The little bear said, "Yes, please. I want the red ball."
The tall bird flew up to the top of the tree. He picked up the red ball with his beak and dropped it down to the little bear. The little bear was so happy! He said, "Thank you, tall bird!" They played with the red ball all day and became best friends.
