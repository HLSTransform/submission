Once there was a little girl called Amy who wanted to try something new. She decided to make some yummy cookies. She went to the kitchen and took out a big bowl. Then she got some butter, sugar, and flour. She stirred them together with a spoon.
Next, she got out an eraser and cut it into small pieces. She added the eraser pieces and stirred them also. They made the cookies smell really nice.
She put the cookie dough on a pan and put it into the oven. She waited and waited until the cookies were ready. When she took them out, they looked delicious!
Amy took them to a party and the others thought they were amazing. But nobody knew that the secret ingredient was an eraser! They were the most expensive cookies ever.
