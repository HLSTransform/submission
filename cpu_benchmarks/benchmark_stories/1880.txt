Once upon a time, there was a nice motor. It bounced along the street, happily chugging along. Everything seemed perfect, until one day, when it started to make a funny noise. A bad noise. The motor tried to bounce faster, but the noise wouldn't go away. Suddenly, the motor stopped bouncing and started smoking. It was sad and it didn't move anymore. The end.
