Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a lot of toys and she loved to play with them. One day, Lily's mom gave her some money and told her she could spend it at the toy store. 
Lily was so happy and excited! She went to the toy store and saw so many things she wanted to buy. She looked at all the toys carefully and finally chose a beautiful doll. She was very happy with her purchase and felt like a rich girl.
When Lily got home, she showed her new doll to her mom. Her mom was happy for her and said, "You spent your money well, Lily." Lily was proud of herself and played with her new doll all day long.
