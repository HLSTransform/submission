Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she walked down the street to check the mailbox with her mom. 
When they got there, Lily saw a big dog that was barking loudly. She felt scared and wanted to go back home. But her mom insisted that they should stay and wait for the dog to calm down. 
After a few minutes, the dog stopped barking and Lily's mom showed her how to open the mailbox. Lily was so brave and opened it all by herself! Inside, there was a letter from her grandma. She was so happy and couldn't wait to read it. 
Lily's mom smiled and said, "See, you're such a brave girl. I knew you could do it." Lily felt proud of herself and insisted on walking back home with the letter in her hand. From that day on, Lily never felt scared of the barking dog again.
