Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to play and run outside. One sunny day, Max was playing in his yard when he saw a big, red ball.
Max was eager to play with the ball. He ran and jumped to catch the ball with his mouth. He was so happy and wagged his tail all around. Max played with the ball all morning.
After playing, Max was hungry. He went inside his house and saw a yummy snack on the floor. Max ate the snack and felt full. He was very happy and went back outside to play with his red ball some more.
