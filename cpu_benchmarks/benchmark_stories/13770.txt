Anna and Ben were twins. They liked to play with their toys and eat yummy food. One day, their mom made a big pie for dessert. It smelled so good!
"Can we have some pie now, mom?" Anna asked.
"Not yet, sweetie. You have to finish your dinner first," mom said.
Anna and Ben ate their dinner very fast. They wanted to have some pie. But mom said they had to wait until dad came home from work.
They waited and waited. They played with their blocks and their dolls. They read some books and sang some songs. They looked at the clock. It was getting late.
"Where is dad?" Ben asked.
"He is stuck in traffic. He will be here soon," mom said.
Anna and Ben were getting sleepy. They yawned and rubbed their eyes. They cuddled with their mom on the couch.
Finally, they heard the door open. Dad was home!
"Hi, everyone! I'm sorry I'm late. I brought you a surprise!" dad said.
He took out a big box from his bag. He opened it and showed them. It was another pie!
"Wow! Two pies!" Anna and Ben exclaimed.
They jumped up and ran to the table. They were not sleepy anymore. They were hungry!
"Can we have some pie now, mom?" they asked.
"Yes, you can. But you have to share, okay?" mom said.
"Okay, mom. We will share," they said.
They cut the pies into slices. They gave one slice to mom and one slice to dad. They took one slice for themselves. They looked at the pies. There were still some slices left.
"Can we have more pie, mom?" they asked.
Mom smiled. She knew they liked pie. She also knew they were good at sharing.
"Sure, you can. But only one more slice each, okay?" she said.
"Okay, mom. Thank you!" they said.
They took one more slice each. They ate their pie with big bites. It was so delicious!
They finished their pie. They licked their fingers. They felt happy and full.
They hugged mom and dad. They said thank you for the pies. They said good night.
They went to their beds. They put on their pajamas. They brushed their teeth. They snuggled with their teddy bears.
They closed their eyes. They fell asleep. They dreamed of pies.
