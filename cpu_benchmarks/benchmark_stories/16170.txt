Once upon a time there were two cute friends, a frog and a bear. They were the best of friends and always had the most fun together.
One day, the frog had something very important to tell his friend the bear. He said, "I need to tell you something!" The bear was very excited and said "What? Tell me!"
The frog said, "I need you to help me find a new pond. I have to move away from my old pond and I'm scared".
The bear could see that his friend was sad, so he said, "Don't worry. I will help you find a new pond. We can have lots of fun together."
The frog and the bear searched all day and eventually they found a perfect, new pond. The frog was so happy and the bear was so proud of his friend. They enjoyed all their fun times together in the new pond, just like they always did.
