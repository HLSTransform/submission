Once upon a time, there was a man who rode a motorcycle. He loved to ride it fast and feel the wind in his hair. One day, he saw a delicate flower on the side of the road. He wanted to pick it, but he didn't want to stop his motorcycle. So, he tried to reach for it while he was still riding. 
But, he lost control and fell off his motorcycle. He hurt himself badly and couldn't get up. He tried to call for help, but no one could hear him. He felt sad and alone. He shrugged his shoulders and wished he had been more careful. 
Sadly, he never got help and eventually passed away. The delicate flower he wanted to pick was the last thing he saw before he closed his eyes forever.
