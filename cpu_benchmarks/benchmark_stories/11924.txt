Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play soccer with his friends. His goal was to score a goal and win the game.
One day, Timmy's friend Billy fell down and hurt himself. Timmy asked, "Are you fine, Billy?" Billy said, "Yes, I'm fine. But I can't play anymore."
Timmy's team was losing and they needed Billy to play. Timmy said, "Please, Billy. We need you to play. Can you speak to your mom and come back?"
Billy said, "Okay, I'll speak to my mom." But when he came back, he brought bad news. His mom said he couldn't play anymore because he was hurt.
Timmy's team lost the game and Timmy felt sad. He learned that sometimes things don't go as planned, but it's important to still be kind and ask if someone is fine.
