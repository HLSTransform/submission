Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Jack. He wanted to stay up all day and play, but his mom wanted him to take a nap.
"Noooo," Jack said. "Naps are terrible."
But Mom was firm. "Jack, it's getting late. You need to take a nap," she said.
But Jack was stubborn. He didn't want to take a nap. He wanted to play all day!
Finally, Mom had an idea. She said, "Jack, if you take a nap, I'll rub your back when you wake up!"
That changed Jack's mind. He agreed to take a nap. After a few minutes, he was snuggled up in bed and fast asleep.
When he woke up, Mom rubbed his back. It felt sooo nice that Jack never resisted a nap again.
The moral of the story is that sometimes it's a good idea to take a break and rest. Not only can it help us be happier, but it might even have a reward!
