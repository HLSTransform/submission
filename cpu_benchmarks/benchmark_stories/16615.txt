Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a white bunny in the grass. The bunny has long ears and a fluffy tail. It hops from one flower to another.
"Look, a bunny!" Tom says. He runs to the bunny. He wants to pet it.
"Wait, Tom!" Lily says. She follows him. She knows bunnies are shy. "Don't scare it!"
But Tom is too fast. He reaches the bunny and tries to grab it. The bunny is scared. It hops away. It hops over a fence and into the woods.
"Come back, bunny!" Tom says. He is sad. He wants to play with the bunny.
"Sorry, Tom," Lily says. She hugs him with her arm. "Maybe we can find another bunny."
"Or maybe we can hop like bunnies," Tom says. He smiles. He likes to hop.
"Okay, let's hop like bunnies," Lily says. She smiles too. She likes to hop.
They hop around the park. They hop over rocks and sticks. They hop under trees and swings. They have fun. They are happy. They are friends.
