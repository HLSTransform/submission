Once upon a time, there was a big factory. In this factory, they made smiles. The factory was owned by a wealthy man named Mr. Happy. Mr. Happy loved to see people smile. He worked hard to make the best smiles for everyone.
One day, a little girl named Lily came to the factory. She looked sad. Mr. Happy asked, "Why are you sad, Lily?" Lily said, "I lost my smile. Can you help me find it?" Mr. Happy wanted to help Lily feel happy again.
Mr. Happy took Lily on a tour of the factory. They saw many smiles being made. Lily started to smile too. Mr. Happy said, "Look, Lily! You found your smile!" Lily was happy and said, "Thank you, Mr. Happy!" From that day on, Lily always had a big smile on her face.
