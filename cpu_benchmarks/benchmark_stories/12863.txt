One day, three happy friends wanted an adventure. The friends wanted to explore a valley. So the friends walked and walked until they reached the valley.
But the valley was weird. The friends didn't like it. It was strange and made them feel scared.
So the friends decided to go back home. But then, something strange happened! A big number appeared in the sky.
The number got bigger and bigger, making the valley darker and darker. Suddenly, it was dark. The friends were really scared.
They ran away as fast as they could until they were far away from the valley. The friends never went back to the weird valley again.
