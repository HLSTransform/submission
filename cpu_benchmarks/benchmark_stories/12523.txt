Once upon a time, there was a boy who loved to eat tasty candies. Every day, he would ask his mommy for some candies. One day, his mommy gave him a big bag of candies. The boy was so happy and he started to eat them all at once.
But then, he accidentally dropped the bag and it broke. All the candies fell on the ground and got dirty. The boy started to cry and his mommy came to him. She told him that he should have been careful and not eaten too many candies at once. She also said that he should learn to take care of his things so they wouldn't break.
The boy learned his lesson and promised to be more careful next time. From that day on, he only ate a few candies at a time and made sure to keep them safe. The moral of the story is that we should take care of our things and not be greedy with what we have.
