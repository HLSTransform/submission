Once there was a boy named Bob. He wanted to spoil himself so he went to the store and bought a peanut. He was so excited to eat it. 
When he opened it, the peanut was very rough. It was so rough that he couldn't eat it. Bob was so sad but then he had an idea. He took the peanut outside and threw it on the ground. Then something amazing happened. 
There were lots of other peanuts in the ground. The ground was full of peanuts! Bob was so excited. He began picking them up and eating them. He was so happy that spoiling himself was so easy and delicious. 
Bob spent the whole day enjoying the peanuts and spoiling himself. It was the best day ever!
