Emma and her mummy were on a safari. Little Emma had never been on a safari before and looked around in wonder. Everywhere she looked there were animals - big elephants, lazy lions and curious zebras. She admired the animals so much.
Mummy asked, "What do you think of it all, Emma?"
"I love it Mummy! There are so many amazing animals. I wish we could come here every day," Emma said.
"Well, it's probably not a good idea," Mummy said. "The animals need their own space and it wouldn't be very wise to disturb them all the time."
"But why not Mummy?" Emma asked.
"It wouldn't be very respectful," Mummy replied gently. "We can admire the animals, but it's foolish to try to get too close."
Emma nodded and looked around in wonder once more. She admired the animals silently, and vowed to always treat them with respect.
