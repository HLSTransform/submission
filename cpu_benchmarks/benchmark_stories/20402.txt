Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play in the park. One day, she saw a big dog that scared her. She ran away and told her mom the news. Her mom hugged her and said it's okay to be scared sometimes. 
A few days later, Lily saw her friend Sarah with a new toy that she really wanted. She felt envious and wished she had it too. But then she remembered what her mom said about being happy with what she has. 
One day, Lily and Sarah were playing together when they heard a loud noise. They got scared and ran to their moms. They found out that it was just a big truck passing by. They laughed and felt happy that they were safe. From then on, they played together and shared their toys, never feeling envious of each other again.
