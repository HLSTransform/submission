Once upon a time there was a kind little girl who loved to play. One day, she found a big trunk and decided to open it. Inside, she saw lots of toys. She smiled and ran to tell her mom.
Her mom was very happy and asked the little girl to help fill the trunk with all her toys. The girl was excited and quickly started taking out all her toys, one by one and placing them all in the trunk. 
She even found some of her old toys in the trunk, forgotten and still in good condition. When she was all finished, the trunk was filled with all kinds of toys - big ones, small ones, old ones and new.
The little girl was so proud. She hugged the trunk and thanked her mom for the surprise. 
Moral of the story: Kindness always brings joy.
