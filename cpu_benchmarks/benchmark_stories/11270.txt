Once, there was a small boy who was feeling very lonely. He wanted someone to play with but no one was around. He decided to go on an adventure and see if he could find someone to help him.
Just as he was about to begin his journey, he spotted a judge. The judge was looking sad and seemed lonely too. The boy asked the judge if he wanted to come along on his adventure. The judge said he would love to!
The two of them went on a wonderful journey and the judge taught the little boy lots of interesting things. The boy was having so much fun and was so appreciative of all the things the judge had taught him that he wanted to show his gratitude.
So, the boy asked the judge if he could lend him some money. The judge said yes and gave the boy enough money to buy a few nice things for his journey.
The boy thanked the judge for his generosity, and the two of them parted ways. The boy was incredibly grateful for the judgeâ€™s kindness and felt less lonely now that he had a new friend.
