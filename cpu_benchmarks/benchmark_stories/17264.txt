Once upon a time, there was a playful little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, she saw her brother playing with a cool toy car that had many gears. 
"Can I play with your car?" asked Lily.
"Sure, you can play with it for a little bit," said her brother, passing the car to her.
Lily was so happy to play with the gear-filled car. She made it go fast and slow, and even made it pass through her toy tunnel. 
"Thank you for letting me play with your car," said Lily, passing it back to her brother.
"No problem, Lily. You can play with it anytime you want," said her brother with a smile. 
From that day on, Lily and her brother played together with the toy car, passing it back and forth, and having lots of fun.
