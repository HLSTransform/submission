Once upon a time there was a big tall tree. One day, a storm came and it began to rain. Lightning flashed brightly in the sky.
All of the animals in the forest were scared of the storm. They started to run and hide. But the little bunny was brave. He wanted to see the lightning!
The bunny hopped to the top of the tall tree. He was so brave! He saw the lightening flashing and he felt happy. He watched the storm until it was over. 
When the storm was done, the animals all came out. They were amazed at how bravely the little bunny had behaved! They all gave him lots of hugs and thanked him for being brave. 
And they all lived happily ever after!
