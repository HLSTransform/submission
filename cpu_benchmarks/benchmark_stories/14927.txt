Sophie looked up at the sky. She saw something twirling and spinning around in the air. It looked like a rope! She clapped her hands together and squealed with joy.
Her dad came over and said, "What is it, honey?"
"Rope! Rope!" said Sophie.
Her dad smiled and said, "Let's go and get it then."
So they ran outside and Sophie pointed up to the dangling rope in the sky. Her dad took one end of the rope, and then he started counting.
"One, two, three," he said.
Then he pulled hard on the rope and it came loose. He handed it to Sophie, and she inspected it closely. It was an empty rope, but she didn't care. She just wanted to have fun with the rope. 
So she grabbed the rope in both hands and started twirling it around like she had seen in the sky.
Her dad smiled and said, "That's the way to do it!" 
And they laughed and laughed as they played with the empty rope.
