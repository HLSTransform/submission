Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jane. Jane was three years old and was about to go on an adventure.
She embarked on a journey to gain a special thing. When she arrived, she saw a large mountain with pieces of ash covering the ground. Jane kept walking and suddenly, she found a big shiny golden pot. 
"What is this?" Jane asked in excitement.
"That is the magical pot of gold. You can have it if you can answer one question," a voice said.
"What is the question?" Jane asked.
"What do you need to have a successful life?"
Jane thought for a while. Then, she proudly said, "Friendship, confidence, and courage."
The voice then said, "Well done! You have gained a successful life. You may now keep the pot of gold."
Jane was very happy and took the pot of gold home with her. She learned an important lesson that day. No matter how difficult something may be, if you work hard enough, you can gain success.
