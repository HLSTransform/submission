Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mommy. While they were playing on the swings, a stranger came up to them. Lily felt scared and started to cry. 
But her mommy told her not to worry because the stranger was a nice person. The stranger talked to Lily and made her feel comfortable. They played together and had lots of fun.
After a while, it was time for Lily and her mommy to go home. Lily waved goodbye to the stranger and smiled. She realized that sometimes strangers can be kind and make us feel happy too.
