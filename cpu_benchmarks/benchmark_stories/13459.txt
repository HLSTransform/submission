Once upon a time, there was a young bird. The bird was delicate and had pretty feathers. One day, the bird was playing outside and got very dirty. The bird's mommy told it to wipe its feathers clean. 
But the bird didn't listen and kept playing. Soon, the bird got sick because it was so dirty. Its mommy tried to help, but it was too late. The young bird died because it didn't listen to its mommy and take care of itself. 
The end.
