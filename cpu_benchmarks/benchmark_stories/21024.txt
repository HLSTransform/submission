Molly was so excited. Today she was going to the park with her daddy. She quickly put on her cute dress and ran outside.
“Wait for me, Molly!” called Daddy.
Molly waved to her daddy as she skipped and hopped. Then, Daddy lifted up Molly and together they walked to the park.
At the park, they played the whole day. Molly pushed the swings and Daddy helped her go higher and higher. They laughed and laughed.
As the sun was setting, they made their way back home. On the way, Molly asked her daddy a question.
“Daddy, do you know that I love you?”
“Yes, I do, Molly. I know,” said Daddy.
Molly smiled. She was so happy that her daddy knew how much she loved him.
The moral of the story is that little expressions of love should always be shared. Parents should take the time to understand what their little ones are trying to tell them.
