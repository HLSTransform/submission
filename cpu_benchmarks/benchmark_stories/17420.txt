Lily liked to study with her cards. She had cards with letters, numbers, colors and animals. She liked to say the names and sounds of the things on the cards. She also liked to make stories with the cards.
One day, she asked her mom to play with her. "Mom, can you study with me?" she said. "I want to show you my cards."
"Sure, Lily, I would love to study with you," her mom said. "What do you want to study today?"
Lily picked up a card with a red apple. "This is an apple," she said. "It is red and round and sweet. You can eat it or make pie with it."
"Very good, Lily, you are so smart," her mom said. "Can I have a card too?"
Lily gave her mom a card with a modest mouse. "This is a mouse," she said. "It is small and gray and shy. It likes to eat cheese and hide in holes."
"Very good, Lily, you are so creative," her mom said. "Can we make a story with these cards?"
Lily nodded. "Yes, let's make a story," she said. "The apple and the mouse are friends. They live in a farm. One day, they find a big cheese in the barn. But there is a cat too. What will they do?"
Lily and her mom took turns to add more cards and more words to their story. They had fun and learned a lot. They studied with their cards until it was time for lunch.
