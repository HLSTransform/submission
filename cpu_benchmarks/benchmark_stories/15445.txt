Once upon a time there was a princess. She was so pretty and loved to dance. One day a terrible monster came into town. She was scared and didn't know what to do.
The princess decided to face the monster and show him her dancing. She twirled and spun on her toes and the monster couldn't help but start to dance too! He spun and twirled around and around with the princess.
The people of the town started to laugh and cheer. They were so happy that the princess had used her dancing to make the monster happy and go away. Everyone thanked the princess and said she was the bravest princess ever! 
The princess smiled and said she was just happy to dance. From that day on, she always made sure to practice her dancing so she could keep the town safe.
