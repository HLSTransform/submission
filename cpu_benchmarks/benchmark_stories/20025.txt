Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play with water. One day, they go to the park with Mom. The park has a big station with many colorful pipes. The pipes spray water in different ways.
Sara and Ben run to the station. They want to get wet and have fun. They see other kids playing there too. They say hello and join them. They spray water at each other and laugh. They make rainbows with the water and the sun.
Mom watches them from a bench. She smiles and takes pictures. She likes to see them happy. She calls them for a snack. Sara and Ben run to her. They are hungry and thirsty. They eat sandwiches and drink juice. They thank Mom and hug her.
"Can we go back to the station, Mom?" Sara asks.
"Please, Mom, we want to play more!" Ben says.
"Okay, but only for a little while. Then we have to go home and change. You are very wet and dirty!" Mom says.
"Yay! Thank you, Mom!" Sara and Ben say. They run back to the station. They spray more water and make more rainbows. They have a lot of fun. They love the colorful station.
