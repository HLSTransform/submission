Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her hoop. She would roll it around and try to make it go up and down. One day, Lily's friend Timmy came to play with her.
"Can I play with your hoop?" Timmy asked.
"Sure!" Lily said. "But it's a little big for you. Maybe we can improve it to make it fit better."
They went to Lily's dad and asked him to help. He cut the hoop down to size and made it fit just right for Timmy. They played together for hours, rolling the hoop back and forth and having lots of fun. 
"Thanks for improving the hoop, Lily's dad!" Timmy said.
"You're welcome," Lily's dad replied. "I'm glad you two had a good time."
