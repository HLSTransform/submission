Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a big box in the park. The box has a lock on it.
"Wow, what is in the box?" Lily asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a treasure!" Ben says.
They want to open the box. But they need a key. They look around the park. They see a man with a key ring.
"Excuse me, sir. Can you help us?" Lily says.
The man is kind. He smiles and walks to them. He looks at the box and the lock.
"Sure, I can help you. Let me see if I have the right key." He says.
He tries different keys. None of them fit. He is about to give up. But then he finds a small key. He puts it in the lock. It turns. The lock opens.
"Yay, you did it!" Lily and Ben cheer.
They open the box. They see many amazing things. They see books, toys, games, and candy. They are very happy.
"Wow, this is the best box ever!" Lily says.
"Thank you, sir. You are very nice!" Ben says.
The man is happy too. He says, "You are welcome, kids. Enjoy the box. It is a gift for you. I was going to donate it to a charity, but I think you will have more fun with it."
Lily and Ben hug the man. They thank him again. They start to play with the amazing things in the box. They have a wonderful day.
