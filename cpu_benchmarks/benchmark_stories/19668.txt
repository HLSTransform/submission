Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Bella. Bella had a best friend called Thomas. They would always play together and really enjoyed each others' company.
One day, Bella and Thomas decided to have a trade. Bella gave Thomas a shiny rock and Thomas gave Bella a toy truck. They were both very happy with their trade. 
However, Bella had been very careless with her new toy truck and soon lost it. She was very sad and didn't know what to do. When Thomas heard about it, he was so kind. He said he would give Bella a replacement truck if she ever wanted one.
Bella was so thankful and was glad to have such a kind friend. From then on she was much more careful with her things and never lost anything again.
