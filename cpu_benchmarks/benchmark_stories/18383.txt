Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a little girl named Lucy. She loved to play with her toys all day. One day, Lucy felt sad because her toy broke. Her mom saw her and thought she could help.
Mom said, "Let's settle down and have some cocoa." They went to the kitchen and made hot cocoa. Lucy loved cocoa. It made her feel warm and happy. She forgot about her broken toy for a while.
As they drank the cocoa, Lucy's mom said, "Don't feel stupid, Lucy. Toys break sometimes." Lucy smiled and felt better. She knew her mom was right. They finished their cocoa and went to find a new toy to play with.
