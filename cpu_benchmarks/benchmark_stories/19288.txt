Once upon a time, there was a big, dark tie. It was very wiggly and made of very soft material.
One day, something special happened. A little girl decided to pass the tie to her friend. She held on to one end with her chubby hand and gave the other end to her friend. 
The little girl and her friend had so much fun with the dark tie. They made it into a long, wiggly snake and pretended to be scared. Then they used it as a rope to pretend they were climbing a mountain.
Finally, the two friends got tired and passed the tie back to the little girl. She held it in her hands for a moment as she said goodbye to her friend. Then she tied it around her neck and ran home in the dark.
