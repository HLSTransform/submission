Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat yummy snacks. One day, her mom gave her a big, juicy apple to eat. Lily took a big bite and it tasted so sweet!
Later that day, Lily's mom asked her to count the number of blocks she had in her toy box. It was easy for Lily because she knew how to count to ten. She counted the blocks and told her mom the number.
As the sun began to set, Lily's dad came home with a surprise for her. He brought a cute, little puppy named Max. Lily was so happy and excited to play with Max. But she had to be careful not to bite him too hard when they played together. Max was so small and delicate, and Lily didn't want to hurt him.
