One day, a boy named Tim went to the fair. He was very excite to see all the fun games and rides. Tim saw a big wheel that went round and round. He went on the wheel with his mom and dad.
As the wheel went up, Tim saw the sea. The sea was big and blue. He saw boats and fish in the sea. Tim liked to watch the sea and the waves.
After the wheel ride, Tim and his family went to play games. They won a big fish toy. Tim was very happy. He took the fish toy home and put it next to his bed. Every night, Tim looked at the fish and thought about the fair and the sea.
