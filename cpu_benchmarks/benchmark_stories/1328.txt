Once upon a time, there was a bear. He was sad because he had lost his ball. But then he found a sand box and he knew what to do.
He scooped up some of the soft sand and put his ball in it. Then he patted down the sand and it made a nice, soft bed for his ball.
The bear was happy and he had a nice snooze in the sun. As he dozed, he had the best idea. He dug a hole in the sand and then he buried his ball deep down.
Afterwards, the bear was happy and he even sang a song. He said goodbye to his ball and skipped away to play.
