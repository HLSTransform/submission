Once upon a time, there was a little flower. The flower was very small and didn't have any color yet. But one day, the flower started to bloom! It grew bigger and bigger, and it turned into a beautiful pink flower.
One day, a little girl was feeling very cold. She asked her mom to make her some soup. Her mom made a yummy soup with carrots and potatoes. The soup was very hot, and it warmed up the little girl's tummy.
The little girl saw the flower outside and thought it was so pretty. She picked the flower and put it in a vase with some water. The flower looked so happy to be inside where it was warm. The little girl smiled and felt happy too.
