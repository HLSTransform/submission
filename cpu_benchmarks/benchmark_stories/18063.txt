Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. One day, Lily went to her room to play. She wanted to open the door, but the knob was too high for her. She said, "Mommy, can you come help me open the door?" 
Mommy came to help and opened the door for Lily. Lily was so happy and said, "Mommy, you're great at opening doors!" 
Lily played with her toys for a while, but then she got bored. She said, "Mommy, can you come play with me?" 
Mommy said, "Sure, I would love to play with you!" They played together and had a great time.
