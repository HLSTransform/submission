Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside in her backyard. One day, she saw her dad building a fence. "What are you doing, Daddy?" she asked. "I'm building a fence to keep the rabbits out of our garden," her dad replied.
Lily watched as her dad started hammering the fence posts into the ground. She was curious and wanted to help. "Can I help, Daddy?" she asked. "Sure, you can help me hold the fence while I hammer it," her dad said.
As they worked, Lily saw a rabbit hop by. "Look, Daddy! A rabbit!" she exclaimed. "Oh no, we need to finish this fence quickly. The rabbits are serious about eating our vegetables," her dad said.
Finally, they finished the fence and Lily was proud of the work they had done together. "We did it, Daddy! The rabbits won't be able to get in now!" she said. Her dad smiled and said, "That's right, Lily. We make a great team."
