Once upon a time, there were two little girls named Candy and Timmy who were best friends forever. They were playing in the yard when all of a sudden Candy said, "I know what a tornado is!" 
Timmy was very excited, but she didn't quite understand what a tornado was. So, Candy explained, "A tornado is a big swirling wind that moves very quickly!" 
Timmy became scared and started to cry. Candy, being the bossy one, said, "Don't worry, Timmy! Tornados are scary, but they can't hurt us!" 
So, the two little girls played in the yard until the sun went down. From then on, they both knew what a tornado was.
