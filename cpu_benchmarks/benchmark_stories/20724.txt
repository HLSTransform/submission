It was a sunny day and Jimmy wanted to make something special. He went to his room and opened his special box. Inside was a big rubber. The rubber was clean and colorful. He put the rubber up to the window and began to print. He would press the rubber onto the window and carefully lift it up. He repeated this until he had made a beautiful picture. He drew some trees, flowers and a rainbow. He was very proud of his masterpiece and he showed it to Mommy. She said it was wonderful. Jimmy was very happy. He hugged his rubber and took it back to his room to keep.
