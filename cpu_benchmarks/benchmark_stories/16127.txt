John and his mom were walking in a beautiful, nature-filled park. Everywhere John looked, he saw impressive trees and big, lush flowers. Everywhere he stepped there was something to discover, but why?
John asked his mom, “Why is everything so special here?” 
Mom replied, “This park has things that no other park does; here you can find something to explore!" 
John said, “That sounds exciting! What kind of things can I find?” 
Mom smiled, “It's a surprise! Keep walking and you’ll find it.” 
The two kept walking and John noticed a squirrel scurry away. He looked around and soon found a massive tree. The tree was so impressive, the trunk looked like it was split in two. John couldn't believe his eyes. 
Mom said, “This is what I was talking about, John. Look around, you can explore nature!” 
John was surprised and excited as he saw a world split in two right in front of him! He couldn't wait to explore! 
The end.
