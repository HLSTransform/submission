Once upon a time there was a clumsy bear who loved to play with his friends. One day the bear found some colorful pins and he wanted to make something special with them. He decided to try and fold the pins but he was having difficulty.
The bear asked a friendly rabbit for help. The rabbit smiled and said “Let me show you how it’s done.” Then the rabbit carefully and carefully folded all the pins together. The bear was impressed and said “Wow, that was amazing! I’ll try it myself!”
The bear tried his best to fold the pins but he was too clumsy and they didn’t stay together. “Oh no!” he said. But the rabbit was still patient and encouraging. Eventually the bear was able to make something beautiful using the pins he’d folded.
The bear thanked the rabbit and said “I’ve made something great! Thank you for teaching me how to do it!” The rabbit was happy to help and said “You did it! Now you can make lots of things with pins!”
The bear and the rabbit became great friends and would often play with pins together. The bear was so proud of all the wonderful things he could make with his pins and his new friend.
