Lila and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a big ball. They can kick it, throw it, and roll it. They have fun with the ball.
One day, a big dog comes to the park. The dog sees the ball. He runs to the ball. He bites the ball. The ball pops. Lila and Sam are sad. They love their ball.
"Hey, dog, that is our ball!" Sam says. "You are bad. You broke our ball."
The dog looks at Sam. He wags his tail. He does not understand. He thinks the ball is his toy.
Lila is flexible. She does not get mad. She cares about the dog. She sees that the dog is lonely. He has no friends.
"Maybe the dog is sorry," Lila says. "Maybe he just wants to play with us. He has no ball. He has no world."
Lila goes to the dog. She pets the dog. The dog licks her hand. He is happy. He likes Lila.
"Can we be your friends?" Lila asks the dog. "We can share our toys. We can play together. We can make a new world."
The dog barks. He nods his head. He wants to be their friend.
Sam is flexible too. He sees that Lila is right. He cares about the dog. He joins Lila. He pets the dog. He smiles.
"Okay, dog, we are your friends," Sam says. "But you have to be nice. You have to be careful. You cannot break our toys."
The dog barks. He nods his head. He agrees.
Lila and Sam find a new ball. They play with the dog. They have fun. They have a new friend. They have a new world.
