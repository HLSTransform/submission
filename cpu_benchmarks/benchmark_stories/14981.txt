Once there was a little girl named Sophie who wanted to explore the world. One day, she decided to go on an adventure. She walked in the forest and suddenly, she heard a voice. It was a very soft whisper. She could not figure out what the voice was saying so she walked closer.
Suddenly, she saw a big head in the trees above her. It had long ears and big eyes. It was a bat! It was whispering harshly to Sophie, telling her to stay away from the forest. Sophie was scared and started to cry.
The bat saw her and felt sorry for her. He no longer whispered harshly but softly and said, "Don't worry, little one. I just want you to be safe. Go and explore the world, but be careful."
Sophie was so glad to have gotten advice from the bat. She never forgot what the bat told her and continued to explore the world.
