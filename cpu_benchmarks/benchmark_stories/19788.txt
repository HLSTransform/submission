Once upon a time, there was a stable. In it, lived two horses. Their names were Sam and Tim. Sam was a strong and sturdy horse who loved to stay in the stable. Tim was very adventurous and wanted to explore the world. One day, in the early morning, Sam gave Tim a nudge and told him to rise and explore the world. So, Tim got up and carefully walked out of the stable. He looked out into the wide open world and was amazed. He saw so many exciting things that he started to run in circles. Sam watched from the stable and smiled, glad that Tim was having an adventurous day.
