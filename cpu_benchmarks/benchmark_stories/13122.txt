Once upon a time, there was a kind old man. He loved giving presents to everyone. One day, he was looking up at the sky and saw how beautiful it was. He wanted to give everyone a piece of the sky to make them happy. So he thought and thought, until he had an idea.
He decided to buy some balloons from the store and fill them with colorful paint. Then, he would give the balloons away for cheap. Everyone in the town was very excited when they heard the news. They all ran to the store to get their own balloons.
The old man then gave each person a special balloon. They all flew their balloons up as high as they could and watched as the beautiful colors spread across the sky. Everyone was delighted, and the old man was very happy to have given them such an amazing gift.
