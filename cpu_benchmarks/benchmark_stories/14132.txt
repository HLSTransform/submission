Once upon a time there was a poor dog called Mint. He was sad because he had no one to play with. So he decided to go on an adventure.
One day he was walking down the street when he heard a loud scream! It scared Mint so much that he started to tremble. He had never heard a scream like that before.
Then suddenly a little boy appeared. He was holding a mint. The boy said "Mint, don't worry. I just screamed because I got a surprise." Mint was so relieved!
The little boy held out the mint and said "Come on Mint, let's go play!" Mint was so excited. He bounded off with the little boy. And they both ran and laughed until the sun went down.
