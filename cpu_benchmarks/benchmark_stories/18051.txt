Once upon a time, there was a chubby little bear named Benny. Benny loved to stay in his cozy cave all day long. One day, Benny decided to go for a walk in the forest. As he was walking, he saw his friend, the rabbit. Benny recognized the rabbit because they had played together before. 
The rabbit asked Benny if he wanted to play hide and seek. Benny was so excited! He loved playing games with his friends. Benny counted while the rabbit hid. Benny looked and looked, but he couldn't find the rabbit. Finally, the rabbit jumped out from behind a tree and scared Benny. They both laughed and had so much fun playing together. 
After playing, Benny was tired and wanted to go back to his cozy cave to rest. He said goodbye to the rabbit and went back home. Benny was happy he went on a walk and played with his friend. He knew he would recognize the rabbit next time they played together.
