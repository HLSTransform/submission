Once upon a time, there was a frog named Freddy. Freddy lived in a swamp with his friends. One day, Freddy saw a butterfly and wanted to be friends with it. But the butterfly ignored him and flew away. Freddy was upset and didn't know why the butterfly didn't want to be his friend.
Freddy's friends, the other frogs, saw that he was upset and tried to cheer him up. They told him that sometimes people ignore others because they are busy or have other things on their mind. Freddy felt a little better and decided to try again to make friends with the butterfly.
The next day, Freddy saw the butterfly again and this time he didn't feel upset. He hopped over to the butterfly and said hello. The butterfly was surprised but happy to make a new friend. Freddy was happy too and realized that sometimes it's important to not ignore your feelings and try again.
