Once upon a time, there was a lion who lived in a big jungle. He liked to roar loudly to show that he was the king of the jungle. One day, he met a little girl who was playing a flute. The lion asked the little girl, "What is that noise?" The little girl answered, "It's my flute. Do you want to hear it?"
The lion said, "Yes, please." The little girl played her flute and the lion loved the sound. He said, "That was amazing! You play the flute so well. I wish I could play an instrument too." The little girl said, "Maybe you can try playing the flute." 
The lion tried to play the flute, but it didn't fit in his big mouth. He said, "Oh no, the flute is too small for me. I guess I'll just have to stick to roaring." The little girl said, "That's okay. Roaring is cool too." The lion smiled and roared happily. From that day on, the lion and the little girl became good friends and they would often play music and roar together in the jungle.
