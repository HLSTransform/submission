Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy was very small and furry. One day, Timmy met a big, friendly cat named Mittens. Mittens said, "Hello, little mouse. Would you like to play with me?"
Timmy was anxious because he knew that cats usually like to eat mice. But Mittens seemed so nice, so Timmy said, "Yes, please!"
Mittens and Timmy played together all day long. They chased each other and had lots of fun. But then, as the sun began to set, Mittens said, "I have to go home now, Timmy. Can you lend me your tail to help me get out of this trap?"
Timmy didn't know what a trap was, but he wanted to help his new friend. So he said, "Sure, Mittens. You can borrow my tail."
Mittens used Timmy's tail to try to escape from the trap, but it didn't work. Mittens was stuck. Timmy was sad and scared because he didn't know how to help his friend. And that's how their day of fun ended in a bad way.
