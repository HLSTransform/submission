Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to sit under a big tree near his house. One day, while he was sitting, he saw a girl named Sue. Sue was very careful with her toys.
Tim and Sue became friends and decided to play together. They had many toys, like cars and dolls. They thought it would be fun to trade their toys with each other. Tim gave Sue a red car, and Sue gave Tim a pretty doll.
They played for hours, being careful not to break their new toys. They were so happy that they decided to trade toys every week. Tim and Sue learned that sharing and being careful with their things made them the best of friends.
