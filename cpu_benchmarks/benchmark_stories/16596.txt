Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play with blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes. They can build towers, houses, bridges and more.
One day, they decide to have a contest. Who can build the highest tower with blocks? They each choose a spot on the floor and start to stack blocks. They count the blocks as they add them.
"I have six blocks," Tom says.
"I have seven blocks," Mia says.
They keep building and counting. Tom has ten blocks. Mia has eleven blocks. They are both very good at building.
But then, Mia's tower starts to wobble. She tries to balance it, but it is too late. The blocks fall down with a loud crash. Mia is sad.
"Sorry, Mia," Tom says. "Your tower was very popular. It had many colors and shapes. I liked it."
"Thank you, Tom," Mia says. "Your tower is very tall. It has many blocks. I like it."
They look at Tom's tower. It is still standing, but it is leaning to one side. It looks like it might fall too.
"Maybe we can make a new tower together," Tom says. "We can use all the blocks. It will be the best tower ever."
"OK," Mia says. "That sounds fun. Let's do it."
They smile and hug. Then they start to pick up the blocks and build a new tower. They count the blocks as they work. They are happy.
