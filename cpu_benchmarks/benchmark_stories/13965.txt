Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her friends. One day, Lily's friend Jack came over to play. Jack brought his trumpet with him. Lily was very curious about the trumpet and asked Jack to play it for her. Jack played a cheerful tune on his trumpet and Lily loved it.
But then, Jack accidentally knocked over Lily's toy castle and it broke into pieces. Lily was very upset and didn't want to play anymore. Jack felt bad and wanted to make things right. He asked Lily if he could help her build a new castle. Lily was hesitant at first, but then she agreed.
Together, Jack and Lily built a new castle even better than the old one. They worked together and had a lot of fun. When they finished, Jack played his trumpet again and Lily danced around the castle, feeling happy once more. From that day on, Lily and Jack were the best of friends and they always helped each other out whenever there was a problem.
