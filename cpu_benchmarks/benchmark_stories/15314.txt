Once upon a time there was a big jar. It was filled with water and the grownups called it a hose. Every day, the kids had fun spraying water from the jar. They ran around, singing and laughing.
One day, the jar got a big hole in it. Water started spilling out of the jar and the kids stopped playing. They watched sadly as all the water drained away.
Suddenly, the grownups came to the rescue. They brought a replacement jar, only this one was even bigger! The kids gasped in amazement and quickly ran to get their toys. They began to laugh and play again and they had so much fun with the new jar.
The kids now loved to spray water even more. It was so much fun to watch the water fly out of the big jar. They knew the grownups had taken care of them and they thanked them with big hugs.
