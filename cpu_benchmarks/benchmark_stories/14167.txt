Once upon a time, there was a wise old owl. Everywhere he went, he opened his eyes as wide as he could, looking for new and exciting things to learn. One night, he opened the door to his cozy treehouse and stepped outside.
The night was dark and gloomy, but the owl wasn't afraid. He kept walking until he saw something ugly. It was big and brown, and very grumpy looking. With a deep and wise hoot, the owl opened the door to the ugly old cave.
Inside the cave, the owl found a wonderful surprise. A treasure chest was tucked away in the corner, and it was filled with wisdom. He opened the chest and found it was filled with knowledge that he had never heard before.
The owl took the wisdom back to his treehouse and thought about it for a long time. He always kept the door open, so the wisdom would be easy to find again. The owl smiled, knowing that he had found a great treasure.
