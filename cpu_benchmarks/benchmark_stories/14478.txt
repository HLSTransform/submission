Once upon a time, a lion went to the open plains. He wanted to find something new to do. He saw a pond and decided to raise his head up high. Suddenly, the lion noticed something at the edge of the water. It was an open door! He decided to explore and see what was inside. 
The lion bravely stepped inside and he was amazed by what he saw. The room was filled with colorful objects, like toys and stuffed animals. The lion looked around and spotted a ball. He picked it up and started to play with it. He batted it around and rolled it across the room. The lion was having so much fun!
Then the lion heard clapping. He turned around and saw a little boy. The boy was smiling and clapping his hands. The lion felt so happy to have a friend! He began to play with the boy and they had a great time together. The boy and the lion raised their hands in the air and cheered together. They were celebrating their friendship. 
The lion and the little boy were becoming the best of friends. They kept playing together every day in the open plains. 
The End.
