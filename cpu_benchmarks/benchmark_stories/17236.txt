One sunny day, a little girl named Lily was playing in her backyard. Suddenly, her friend Timmy came over to play. "Hi Lily! Do you want to play catch with me?" Timmy asked. 
Lily said, "Yes, I want to play catch!" She ran to get her ball and they started playing. 
After a while, Lily's mom came outside and said, "Lily, I have to go to the store. Do you want to come with me?" 
Lily said, "No, I want to keep playing with Timmy." 
Her mom said, "Okay, but be alert and stay in the backyard." 
Lily and Timmy kept playing catch, but then Timmy accidentally threw the ball over the fence. Lily said, "I can get it!" and she climbed over the fence to get the ball. 
But then, Lily fell and hurt herself. Timmy ran to get help, but it was too late. Lily's mom came back and found Lily hurt. She called for an ambulance, but it was too late. Lily had died. 
Timmy felt very sad and guilty. He wished he had offered to go with Lily to the store. He wished he had never asked her to play catch.
