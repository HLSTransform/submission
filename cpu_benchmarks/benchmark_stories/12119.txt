Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy's mommy took him to the park to play with his friends. Timmy saw a big slide and ran towards it. He climbed up the ladder and went down the slide. It was so much fun!
Suddenly, Timmy's friend Billy tried to slap him. Timmy didn't like that and told Billy to stop. Billy said sorry and they continued to play. After a while, Timmy's mommy told him it was time to go home. She showed her license to the park ranger and they left.
As they walked home, Timmy's mommy showed him how flexible she was by doing some stretches. Timmy thought it was funny and tried to do some too. They finally arrived home and Timmy went to bed, dreaming of all the fun he had at the park.
