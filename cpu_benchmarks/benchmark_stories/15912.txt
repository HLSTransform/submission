Once there was a girl named Sally. Sally was three years old and very happy. She had a pink dress that she liked to carry everywhere she went. 
One day, Sally wanted to go for a walk. She put on her pink dress and ran outside. But it was raining. 
Sally said to her mom, "I don't want to get my dress wet. What will I do?" 
Her mom smiled and said, "I have an idea. You can carry an umbrella over your dress." 
Sally did just that. She put up an umbrella, the same color as her dress, and it kept her and her dress dry. 
Sally smiled and said, "I will carry this umbrella everywhere I go!" Her mom laughed and agreed. 
And that is how Sally learned to carry her pink dress, even when it was raining.
