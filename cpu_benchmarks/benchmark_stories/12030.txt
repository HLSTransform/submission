Once upon a time, there was a jolly little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she found a shiny penny on the ground. She decided to attach it to her necklace so she could keep it forever.
As she walked around with her penny necklace, she saw her friend Timmy. Timmy didn't have any toys to play with, so Lily decided to give him her favorite mint candy. Timmy was very happy and thanked Lily for her kindness.
Later that day, Lily realized that giving Timmy her mint candy made her feel even happier than keeping her penny. She learned that sharing and making others happy brings more joy than keeping things for herself. From that day on, Lily made it a habit to share her toys and treats with others.
