Mrs Bear and Little Bear were walking in the park. Mrs Bear picked up a bright red apple from the ground. Little Bear was excited and wanted to try it. 
Mrs Bear took a bite and it tasted sour. She showed Little Bear the apple and said, “It is too sour and it is starting to rot. We should put it in the bin.”
Little Bear was sad as he wanted to eat the apple. Mrs Bear then said, “Let’s go to the other side of the park and find a better apple.” 
They went to the other side and found a big, juicy apple. Little Bear was happy and he bit into it. The apple tasted sweet. Little Bear ate all of it and said, “That was delicious!” 
Mrs Bear said, “See, if the apple had been too sour or if it was starting to rot, then it wouldn’t have been very tasty.” 
Little Bear nodded and said, “Let’s go find more apples.” Mrs Bear smiled and they went off together to find more sweet apples in the park.
