Once upon a time, there was an old crab. He was ancient and wise. 
One day, he was walking along the beach when he met a little girl. She said, "Hello, Mr. Crab! Can I play with you?" 
The crab smiled. "Yes, that would be nice." 
The girl grabbed a shovel and soon, the crab and the girl were playing happily in the sand. After a while, the crab said, "Thank you for the fun, but now I must go." 
The little girl said, "Wait! Can I pay you with a hug?" 
The ancient crab smiled. "Yes, that would be nice." 
The little girl hugged the crab tightly, and the crab felt happy. Then, the crab waved goodbye and walked away.
