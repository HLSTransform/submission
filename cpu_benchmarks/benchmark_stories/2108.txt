Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her yard. One day, she saw a big storm coming. She ran inside to tell her mommy.
"Mommy, there's a big storm coming!" Lily said.
"Oh no, we need to get inside and stay safe," her mommy replied.
Lily watched as the storm got closer and closer. The wind was blowing really hard and the rain was coming down in big drops. Suddenly, she saw something change. The trees were bending and swaying in the wind. 
"Mommy, look! The trees changed!" Lily exclaimed.
"Yes, the storm is making everything move and look different," her mommy explained.
After the storm passed, Lily went outside to see the original beauty of her yard. The sun was shining and everything looked fresh and new. She was happy to see that even though things change, they can still be beautiful in their own way.
