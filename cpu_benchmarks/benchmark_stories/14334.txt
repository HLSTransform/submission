Once upon a time there was a young girl and she loved to explore the world. One day she saw a big, amazing stage. She wanted to get on it and explore, so she asked her mom if she could.
Her mom said, "yes, but you must wash your hands first."
The little girl ran to the sink and washed her hands and then ran back to the stage. She squealed with delight as she walked around it. The stage held so many secrets and she could hardly wait to find out what they were.
She explored the stage for hours and soon night came. All she had ever seen that day was amazing. She looked at the stars and realized it had been the best day ever. She washed her hands again and said goodnight to the stage.
