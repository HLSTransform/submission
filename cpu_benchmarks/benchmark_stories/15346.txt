The dependable dog was always happy. He loved to run around and play with his owner.
One day his owner was playing with another person. They were about to watch a movie. The dog was so excited that he ran over and started to bark.
He was trying to be part of the movie, but his owner was too busy laughing to notice. 
The other person started to yell at him to be quiet. But the dog didn't understand why he had to be quiet.
The dog looked back at his owner and saw they were still laughing. So he started to bark and yell even louder. 
His owner just kept laughing and cuddling him, until he finally stopped barking. The dog felt so special and loved. He knew he was always dependable.
