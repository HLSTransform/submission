Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing in the snow. One day, Lily saw a rare snowman. It was so big and beautiful! She went closer and hugged it. Then she tried to squeeze it, but it was too hard. Suddenly, the snowman's nose fell off! Lily felt sad, but then she realized that she could make a new nose out of snow. She made a carrot nose and put it on the snowman. It looked even better than before! Lily was very happy and went back home to tell her mom all about her adventure.
