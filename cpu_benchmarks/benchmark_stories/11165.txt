Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing in her room, especially when the sun was shining and the sky was blue. But one day, Lily noticed something strange about her ceiling. It was starting to turn yellow!
Lily didn't know what was happening, but she knew she had to tell her mom. Her mom came to look and said they needed to fix the ceiling. Lily's mom told her they would need to buy some paint to cover up the yellow.
The next day, Lily and her mom went to the store to buy the paint. Lily was excited because she got to pick out the color. She chose a pretty blue color. When they got home, Lily's mom painted the ceiling and it looked beautiful. Lily was happy that she now owned a pretty blue ceiling.
