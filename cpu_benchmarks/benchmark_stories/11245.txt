Once upon a time, there was a girl called Bella. Bella was three years old and she liked to pick the prettiest flowers.
One day, Bella heard a noise in the sky. She looked up and saw a big, blue bird. It was so beautiful!
"Hello bird!" she said.
The bird heard Bella, and said, "Hello Bella! Why don't you come and pick me a flower?"
Bella was happy and ran to pick a blue flower. She gave it to the bird and smiled.
The bird thanked Bella and flew away with the blue flower.
Bella waved goodbye and ran home with a big smile on her face.
