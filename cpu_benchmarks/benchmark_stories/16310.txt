Once upon a time, there were two friends, Timmy and Tommy. They loved playing with blocks. Blocks were their favorite toys. They played with them every day. One day, Timmy wanted to play with the red blocks but Tommy wanted to play with the blue blocks. They both wanted to play with their favorite blocks, so they started to argue.
Their argument became louder and louder. They didn't want to stop arguing. Suddenly, Timmy grabbed the blue blocks and Tommy grabbed the red blocks. They both wanted their favorite blocks. They started to pull and push. The blocks fell down and broke. They were sad. Their favorite blocks were gone. They realized that arguing was not good. They promised to never argue again and to share their blocks. Sharing blocks became popular between them. They were happy again.
