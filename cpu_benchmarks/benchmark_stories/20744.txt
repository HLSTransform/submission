Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lila. She had big brown eyes and a thin face.
One day, Lila went to the park with her mom. While they were there, they saw a puppy playing with its friends. Lila was so excited to pet the fluffy puppy.
But then, Lila noticed that the puppy had a thin face. She could tell it was feeling sad. 
So, Lila decided to tell the puppy that it was very beautiful. She smiled and said, “You are so lovely!”
The puppy's face suddenly lit up. It started jumping around and wagging its tail.
Lila and her mom watched as the puppy and its friends had lots of fun. They were so happy that Lila was able to make the puppy smile. 
And from that day onwards, Lila learned that it's always important to be kind and tell others how special they are.
