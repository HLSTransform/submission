Once upon a time there was a tough train. It ran all around the city every day. One day, it got stuck in a valley and couldn't go any further. All the passengers were very scared. But luckily, a brave firefighter saw what had happened and decided to help.
He ran over to the train and tried to push it. But it wouldn't move! He tried and tried, but the train was too heavy. Then the firefighter had a clever idea. He asked everyone to help him push it. So everyone got together and pushed and pushed. After what felt like forever, the brave firefighter managed to save the train!
The passengers clapped and cheered, they were so happy that the brave firefighter had saved the train. He was very happy too, because he had been very tough and worked very hard.
