Once upon a time, there was a big, red barn. Inside the barn, there was a lot of hay. The hay was soft and yellow. It was a nice place for the animals to sleep.
In the barn, there was a tall horse named Sam. Sam was a dependable friend to all the animals. He would stand by them and help them when they needed it. Everyone liked Sam because he was kind and strong.
One day, a little chick got lost in the hay. The chick was scared and called for help. Sam heard the chick and went to find her. He stood by the hay and used his long legs to move it. Finally, he found the little chick and took her back to her mom. All the animals cheered for Sam, the dependable horse who stood by his friends.
