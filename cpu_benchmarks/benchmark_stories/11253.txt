Once upon a time there was a small girl called Lucy. She had so much energy and loved to explore. One day, she decided to visit the village square. 
As she walked through the streets, she found the most beautiful fountain. The fountain was so large and sparkled in the sunshine. Lucy was so excited and decided she must have it. She ran over to the fountain and asked the man who stood next it if she could buy it.
The man smiled and said: "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't sell you this fountain. It is a very special fountain and cannot be bought or sold." 
Lucy looked so sad and said: "Please, I really want it. I'm sorry, but I have to have the fountain." 
The man sighed and said: "Well, if it will make you happy, you can have the fountain. But, I still can't sell it to you. It's a gift." 
Lucy was so excited. She thanked the man and hugged the fountain. She said goodbye and ran home with her fountain. Lucy was so happy and understood that special things should not be sold.
