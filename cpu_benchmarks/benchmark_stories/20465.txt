Once upon a time, there was a girl called Jane. Jane liked to play games. One of her favorite games was to make shapes in the sky. One day, Jane saw a triangle in the sky and she was so excited. She held her hands up and shouted "Triangle!".
Suddenly, she felt a tickle in her nose. Jane started to sneeze! The sneeze was so strong that she could feel the air move. As she sneezed, the triangle she saw before started to change color. The triangle was no longer black, it was white!
Jane was surprised to see the triangle change. She said to herself "Wow! That was so cool." She continued to watch the white triangle until it disappeared from the sky.
