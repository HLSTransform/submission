Once upon a time there was an oak tree. All the animals around the tree loved it very much. But one day, a grumpy squirrel came to the tree. He started to pinch the leaves of the tree until it was all bare. 
The animals in the forest were very sad, they wanted their oak tree back. They asked the squirrel to please stop pinching the leaves, but he wouldn't listen. 
Suddenly, a brave mole came to the forest.She started jumping around the grumpy squirrel and pinching him! The squirrel was very surprised and started running away. All the animals cheered for the mole and thanked her for saving their tree. 
After that, the oak tree gradually started to get green again. All the animals were so happy! They all agreed never to let the grumpy squirrel come back to the tree.
