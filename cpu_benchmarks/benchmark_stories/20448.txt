There once was a giant who wasn't very friendly. He was always grumpy and mean to the other animals. They were scared of him and kept to themselves.
One day, the giant decided he wanted to improve. He wanted to be more friendly and less grumpy. So, he began to try and show more kindness to everyone. He smiled at them and said hello.
Soon, everyone started to notice. They found that the giant was much friendlier. They began to talk to him, and he showed them that he cared.
All the animals were happy to see the giant improving. They were so happy, that they even threw a party for him. They welcomed him into their group and he was filled with joy.
The giant was so happy that he even forgot about how grumpy he was. From then on, he was always friendly and kind to everyone.
