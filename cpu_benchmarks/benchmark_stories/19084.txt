Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mom went to the park to play. While they were playing, Lily saw a thin puppy with no owner around. She got worried and went to her mom to tell her about the puppy.
"Mommy, there's a puppy with no owner. We need to help him!" said Lily.
Her mom saw the puppy and knew it was an emergency. She called the animal rescue and they came to help the puppy. While they were waiting for the rescue team, Lily's mom let her play with her phone. Suddenly, the phone rang and it was the animal rescue.
"They found the owner of the puppy! He's coming to pick him up!" said Lily's mom.
Lily was so happy that the puppy was safe and sound. She learned that it's important to help others in an emergency.
