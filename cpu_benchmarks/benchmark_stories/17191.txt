Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Lily. One day, Lily started to set the table for dinner. She put plates, cups and forks on the table. Her mom was so happy and proud of her.
During dinner, Lily noticed her little brother was sad. She asked him what was wrong and he said he lost his toy. Lily felt sad too and wanted to help. She started to look for the toy and finally found it under the table. Her brother was so happy and gave her a big hug. Lily felt compassionate and happy too.
