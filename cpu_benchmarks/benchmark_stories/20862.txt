Alice was so excited to unpack her new surprise. It was a big, blue box that looked very special. She asked her mom, "Mommy, what is it?" Her mom said, "It's a unique start to something new. Let's unpack it and see what it is." 
Alice eagerly opened the box, and inside, she saw lots of colourful blocks! She was so surprised. She said, "Wow! What are these for?" Her mom smiled and said, "We can use them to build something special. Let's unpack them and get started!" 
So, Alice put on her creative thinking cap and started to unpack the blocks. She had so much fun putting the blocks together. In no time, her mom had helped her build a beautiful castle. 
Alice couldn't believe it! She said, "Mommy, I love my new castle! Thank you for my unique start." Mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, sweetheart!"
