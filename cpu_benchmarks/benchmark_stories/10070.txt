Sara loves stories. She likes to hear stories from her mom and dad, and she likes to look at stories in books. She has many books in her room, but she wants to find a new story today.
She searches in her closet, under her bed, and in her toy box. She does not find a new story. She only finds old stories that she knows by heart. She feels sad and bored.
She goes to the living room, where her mom is reading a magazine. She asks her mom, "Mom, can you tell me a new story?"
Her mom smiles and puts down the magazine. She says, "Of course, Sara. But first, let me show you something. Come with me."
She takes Sara to the basement, where there is a big shelf full of books. Sara's eyes grow wide. She sees many books that she has never seen before. They have different colors, pictures, and words.
Her mom says, "These are stories that I read when I was a little girl. They are very special to me. You can borrow any of them, as long as you take good care of them and return them when you are done."
Sara feels happy and excited. She thanks her mom and picks a book that has a fairy on the cover. She says, "This looks like a good story. Can you read it to me, mom?"
Her mom nods and hugs her. She says, "I'm proud of you, Sara. You love stories so much. Maybe one day, you will write your own stories."
They go back to the living room and sit on the couch. Sara cuddles with her mom and listens to the new story. She feels warm and cozy. She thinks that stories are the best thing in the world.
