once there was a boy. he was only three. he liked to blink and look around. one day he looked out the window and saw something blue far away. it was so beautiful he wanted to go see it. so he put on his shoes and left his home. he walked and he walked until finally he reached the blue thing. it was a big blue balloon! he was so excited he started to jump and laugh. he wanted to take it home with him. so he grabbed it with both hands and walked back home. when he arrived he held up the balloon for everyone to see. he was so happy to have this beautiful blue balloon at home.
