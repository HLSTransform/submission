Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends found a big bottle of oil in the park. They decided to play with it and it was so much fun!
But then, Lily's mom came to pick her up and saw the oily mess. She was very angry and fearful that someone might slip and get hurt. She told the children to clean it up right away.
Lily and her friends tried to clean up the oil, but they didn't do a good job. Later that day, a man came to the park and didn't see the oil. He leaned on a tree and slipped on the oily ground. He got very hurt and had to go to the hospital. Lily felt very sad and scared that someone got hurt because of her mistake. She learned that it's important to listen to grown-ups and be careful when playing outside.
