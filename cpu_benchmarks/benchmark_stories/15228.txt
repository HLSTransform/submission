Once upon a time, there was a big fish named Bob. Bob loved to dive deep into the water. He would swim fast, up and down, and all around. Bob liked to play with his friends in the sea.
One day, Bob found a door with a knob in the water. He was curious about what was behind the door. Bob turned the knob and opened the door. He saw a bright, shiny world with lots of colors and shapes.
Bob went inside and met a new friend named Tim. Tim was a fast turtle who also liked to dive. They played together, diving and swimming fast. Bob and Tim had so much fun in the shiny world. They played until the sun went down and then went back home, happy and tired.
