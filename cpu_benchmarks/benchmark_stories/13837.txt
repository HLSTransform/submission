Tom and Jen are young twins who live in a big house with their mom and dad. They like to play with their toys, read books, and watch cartoons. Sometimes they fight over who gets to use the red car or the blue doll, but they always say sorry and hug each other.
One day, they hear a loud noise and feel the floor shake. They are scared and run to their mom, who is in the kitchen. She tells them it is an earthquake and they have to go to a safe place. She grabs a flashlight and some water and leads them to the basement. She says they have to close the door and stay there until the earthquake is over.
They go down the stairs and close the door behind them. The basement is dark and cold, and they hear more noises and feel more shaking. They hug their mom and each other, and try to be brave. They wonder where their dad is, who was at work when the earthquake started.
After a long time, the noises and shaking stop. They hear their dad's voice outside the door. He says he is okay and he came home as fast as he could. He opens the door and sees them. He is happy and relieved. He hugs them and tells them he loves them. He says they are very lucky that their house is still standing and that they are safe.
They go upstairs and see that the earthquake has made a big mess. Some things are broken, some things are fallen, some things are missing. They feel sad and sorry for their toys and books and cartoons. But they also feel grateful and happy for their mom and dad and each other. They realize that things are not as important as people, and that they should always be kind and share with each other. They say thank you to their mom and dad, and help them clean up the mess. They learn a lesson from the earthquake.
