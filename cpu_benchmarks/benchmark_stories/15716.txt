Once upon a time, there lived a brave little girl. Her name was Daisy. Daisy had a special way to make her work more fun. When ever she had to do a task, such as rake up leaves in the yard, she would count while she worked. 
"One, two, three, four" she counted one day while she was raking. Just then, her mum appeared in the garden.
"What are you doing, Daisy?" asked her mum.
"I'm raking and counting!" smiled Daisy proudly.
Mum laughed. "That's so clever, Daisy. I'm very proud of you for being so brave and working hard!"
Daisy smiled and kept counting. "Five, six, seven, eight!"
 before she knew it, her work was finished. Daisy was happy that her brave efforts had paid off.
