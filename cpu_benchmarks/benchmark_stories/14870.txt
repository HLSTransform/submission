Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to ride his bike around the park. One day, he saw a big chain on the ground. Timmy was shy, so he didn't want to pick it up. But he knew it could be dangerous if someone else tripped on it.
The next day, Timmy went back to the park with his dad. He showed his dad the chain and they picked it up together. Timmy's dad told him that it was important to always be careful and help others. Timmy felt proud that he did the right thing.
Later that day, Timmy went for a ride on his bike. He saw a little girl who had fallen down and hurt herself. Timmy remembered what his dad said and helped the girl up. She smiled and thanked him. Timmy felt happy that he could be brave and help someone in need.
