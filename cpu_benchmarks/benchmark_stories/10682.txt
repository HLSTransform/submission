One day, Alex and his Mom went to the pet store. Alex was excited to pick a pet. He saw a little bird and he wanted to take it home.
But when Alex brought the bird home, it wouldn't move or sing. Mom said they needed to take the bird to a pet doctor.
The pet doctor said the bird was broken. She showed them how to repair it. Mom and Alex did the repairs together - they were very helpful.
Finally the bird was fixed! It could move and it sang sweetly. Alex was so happy! He knew how to take care of his pet and he knew how to do useful repairs.
