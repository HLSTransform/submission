Jane dug a deep hole in the ground. She found a lollipop in her pocket and put it in the hole. She grabbed some dirt from the ground and buried the lollipop. Jane was so happy to have buried the lollipop!
The next day Jane went back to the little hole and found that the dirt was all dirty. She started to dig with her hands and, eventually, she found the lollipop! It was all sticky and yummy! Jane was so excited and she couldn't wait to lick it!
Jane loved eating her lollipop. When she was done she put the stick in the ground near the hole. She covered the lollipop stick with dirt and buried it. She said, "Bye bye lollipop stick!" 
Jane had a lot of fun that day. She was so happy to have buried the lollipop and found it again!
