Tom and Lily were best friends. They liked to play with their toys and share their snacks. One day, they decided to go to the park with their moms. They packed their bags with their favorite things: Tom had his ball and his truck, and Lily had her doll and her book.
At the park, they saw a big slide. They wanted to try it, but there was a problem. The slide was too high for them. They were scared. They looked at their moms, who smiled and nodded. They said they would help them.
Tom and Lily climbed the stairs with their moms. They held their bags tightly. They reached the top and looked down. The slide was shiny and long. They felt a little brave. They decided to go together.
They sat on the slide, one behind the other. They held hands. They pushed off and slid down. They felt the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They laughed and screamed. They had fun.
They reached the bottom and jumped off. They hugged each other. They were happy. They looked at their bags. They had a surprise. Tom's ball had popped out of his bag and rolled away. Lily's book had fallen out of her bag and got wet. They were sad. They looked at each other. They had an idea.
They traded their things. Tom gave Lily his truck and Lily gave Tom her doll. They said they were sorry and they were still friends. They played with their new toys. They were flexible. They had more fun. They learned to share. They were happy again.
