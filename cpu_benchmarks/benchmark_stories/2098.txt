Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, Lily's mom told her to wear her warm sweater because it was cold outside. 
Lily played for a while, but then she started to feel very sleepy. She decided to take a nap on the bench. While she was sleeping, a big gust of wind came and blew away her helpless sweater. 
When Lily woke up, she realized her sweater was gone. She looked everywhere for it, but she couldn't find it. Lily felt sad and cold without her sweater. She cried and cried until her mom came to pick her up. 
Lily's mom was sad too because she knew how much Lily loved her sweater. They went home, but Lily was still cold and sad without her sweater. From that day on, Lily learned to always take care of her things and never take naps with her sweater on.
