Once upon a time there was a little girl named Ann. Ann was so smart and she loved finding out new things. One day she found a bone in the garden. She held the bone in her hands and stared at it. Then, she had a great idea. She wanted to shrink the bone.
So she started to work, mixing different colors and liquids. After a few minutes, she was all finished. She placed the bone in the mixture and waited for a few minutes. Ann watched in amazement as the bone started to shrink. It turned into a smaller and smaller size and soon was so small it fit in Annâ€™s palm.
Ann was so excited and proud by what she had done. She carefully placed the tiny bone in her pocket and ran inside to show her Mum what she had just created. Her Mum was astonished and they talked about how smart Ann was. Ann smiled and enjoyed the feeling of her accomplishment. From that day on Ann knew she was very intelligent and talented.
