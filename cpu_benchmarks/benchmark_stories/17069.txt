Once upon a time, there was a hairy dog named Max. Max lived in a small house with his best friend, a little girl named Lily. They loved to play together all day. One day, Lily's mom told her that they would go to visit grandma later. Lily was very happy and couldn't wait to see grandma.
When they got to grandma's house, Lily and Max ran around in the big yard. They played and played until they were tired. Then, they went inside to rest. Lily saw a telephone on the table. She remembered her mom using a telephone to talk to grandma when they were not together.
Lily picked up the telephone and pretended to talk to Max. "Hello, Max," she said, "do you want to play more later?" Max barked and wagged his tail. Suddenly, the telephone made a loud sound. It scared Max, and he started to weep.
Lily's mom came into the room and saw Max weeping. She picked him up and hugged him. "It's okay, Max," she said, "the telephone was just saying hello too." Max stopped weeping and licked Lily's mom's face. They all laughed and spent the rest of the day having fun with grandma.
