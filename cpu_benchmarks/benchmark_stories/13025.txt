One day, there was a painter. He was an artist and loved to make drawings and paintings. He had a thick brush, which he liked to use to paint. As he was carefully painting a picture one day, he heard a loud scream.
The painter ran over to see what was happening and found a small child. The child had a big scrape on his knee, and his eyes were full of tears. The painter felt sorry for the little one. He knelt down and gently put some soothing cream on the scrape.
The painter then used his thick brush to paint a bright yellow sun on the little one's scrape. As the sun dried, it helped to take the pain away. The little one looked up and smiled with amazement.
The painter laughed and gave the little one a hug. From then on, the little one no longer screamed when he had a scrape. The painter's painting helped to make him feel better.
