Once there was a boy. He was three years old. He always wanted to go to a restaurant. So one day his dad said yes, and they went to the restaurant.
When they got there, the boy was very excited. It was big and had tables and chairs and everything. He looked around and smiled.
They ordered some food. The waiter brought them hot soup with mild spices. The boy tasted it and liked it very much. He said it was yummy!
After their meal, dad and the boy stood up to leave. Dad said "Thank you" to the waiter. The waiter smiled and said "You're welcome!" 
The boy and his dad started walking out of the restaurant. Then the boy turned to the waiter and said, "Bye! Thanks for the tasty soup!" The waiter smiled again and said "Bye! Come back soon!"
