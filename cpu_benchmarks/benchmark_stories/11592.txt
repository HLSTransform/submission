Megan and Mum were walking around the park. Megan loved to play in the sandpit, but today it looked different.
Mum pointed at something and said, "Look, Megan! Something sharp in the sandpit! Let's take it out."
Megan bent down and carefully picked up the lemon. It was strange to find a lemon in the sandpit, but she was excited.
Suddenly, Dad appeared. Dad looked very angry. He shouted, "What are you doing here, Megan and Mum? You know it's dangerous here!"
Mum and Megan looked at each other and both said, "It's OK, Dad! We found a lemon." 
Dad calmed down, smiled and said, "Well done. Now we can go home and have some lemonade!"
