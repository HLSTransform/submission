Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear pretty dresses and play with her dolls. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to help tie her shoes. Lily tried her best, but the knot was too hard for her to do by herself. 
Suddenly, Lily's mommy started to panic. She had to go to work soon and her shoes were still untied. "Don't worry, mommy," said Lily. "I'll ask daddy to help us!" 
Lily's daddy came to the rescue and tied mommy's shoes. "Thank you, daddy," said Lily. "You're the best!" 
After the mild chaos of the shoe-tying, Lily and her family went to the park to play. They had a lot of fun swinging, sliding, and laughing together. And Lily felt happy knowing that she could help her mommy when she was in a panic.
