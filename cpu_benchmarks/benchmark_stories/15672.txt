Once upon a time there was a tiger who loved to rub his body against the leaves of the trees in the forest. One day he was rubbing against a tree when a little bird came flying by.
"Hello, tiger!" said the bird.
"Hi, bird," said the tiger.
"I sure wish I could rub my feathers on the tree leaves like you do," said the bird.
The tiger thought for a moment and then replied, "I'm sorry, but I'm too selfish to let you do that. I want the tree leaves all to myself."
The bird was sad, but decided to try one more thing. "Maybe if you shared some of the tree leaves with me, I won't bother you anymore," she said.
The tiger thought about that for a moment, and then smiled. "You know what? You're right. I think I'll share," he said.
So, from then on, the tiger and the bird could be seen rubbing their feathers and fur against the tree leaves and enjoying the day together.
