Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved chocolate. Every day she would ask for some chocolate, but her parents always said no.
One day, the little girl was walking along when she saw a broken chocolate on the ground. She was very excited and quickly picked it up. 
The little girl then ran home, telling her parents about the broken chocolate she had found. Her parents were not pleased but the little girl didn't stop asking for it.
"Can I have the chocolate?" she asked.
Her parents sighed and said, "Yes, but only if you promise to grow it first."
The little girl was confused but she promised to try. She watered the broken chocolate and over the next few weeks it started to grow bigger and bigger.
Finally, the little girl had a big, juicy chocolate. She was so happy and ate it right away! She kept the broken shell afterwards, as a reminder of all her hard work.
