Once upon a time there was a raven. He was black and shiny in the sun. The raven flew and flew, very high in the sky. One day he saw something. It was small and had arms. The raven watched the little thing move its arms in a funny way. The raven realized the little thing was trying to wave. 
The raven was curious, so he flew down to have a closer look. It was a little boy! The boy waved both of his hands and shouted: "Hi, Raven!" The raven was surprised by this and he flew off, away from the boy. The boy laughed, it was so easy to make the raven fly away.
The raven flew further away, but soon he began to miss the little boy. He remembered how it was easy to make the boy laugh. The raven changed his mind and quickly flew back to the boy. When the raven returned, the boy was waiting and waved both his little hands. The boy smiled and the raven flew down as close as he could.
The boy held out his arm and the raven gently perched on it. For a few minutes they just sat together, the boy waving his hands and the raven enjoying being close. Then, with a few flaps of his wings, the raven flew off into the sky. But the boy knew that the raven would come back one day and would be so easy to find.
