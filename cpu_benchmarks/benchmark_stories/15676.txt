Once upon a time there was a dog named Max. He was a happy dog who liked to play in the park. One day, he saw an interesting bone on the ground. He wanted to take it, so he happily trotted over to it.
â€œDo you want to sign for it?" said a big man. Max tilted his head and wondered what signing meant. The big man saw his confusion and explained it was like a promise. So Max nodded and made a sign with his paw. 
The big man gave Max the bone and he took it over to the most comfortable place he could find - a big green patch of grass in the corner of the park. Max curled up and hugged the bone close as he fell contentedly asleep.
