Once upon a time, there was a cactus that lived in the desert. Every day, it covered itself with a blanket to take a nap. Suddenly, it heard a sound. It was so fearful that it wanted to hide. It covered itself in sand to hide from the sound. With its prickly spikes, the cactus stayed safely in the sand. After a while, the sound went away and the cactus uncovered itself. It was so relieved that it went back to its naps with its blanket. The happy cactus lived happily ever after in the desert.
