Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear a pretty bow in her hair every day. One day, Lily's mommy told her that they were going to the park to play. Lily was so excited and ran to put on her favorite bow. 
When they got to the park, Lily saw a boy who looked worried. He was sitting all alone on a bench with a frown on his face. Lily went over to him and asked if he wanted to play. The boy smiled and they had so much fun playing together. 
But then, it was time for Lily and her mommy to go home. The boy looked sad and asked if they could play again tomorrow. Lily said yes and gave him a big hug. But the next day, when they went back to the park, the boy was not there. Lily looked all around, but he was nowhere to be found. She felt so sad and worried that she would never see her new friend again. 
Lily went home with a frown on her face and her bow drooping down. She missed her friend so much and hoped he would come back soon. But he never did. Lily learned that sometimes, things don't always have a happy ending.
