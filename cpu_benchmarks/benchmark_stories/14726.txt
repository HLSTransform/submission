Once upon a time, there was a big guard. He was strong and very brave. He loved protecting the people of the town. Every day, he would stand guard at the castle gate and make sure nobody came in who he didn't know. He was happy to do this job because he loved to help others. 
One day a little girl came to the castle gate. She was very small and scared. The guard saw her and smiled. He knew she must be lost and wanted to help. He asked where she was going and she said she was looking for her mom. 
The guard felt so sorry for the little girl. He asked if he could help her find her mom. The little girl said yes, so the guard searched all around town but he couldn't find her mom. He decided to take the little girl home with him, so she would be safe. 
The little girl was happy to have a place to stay. She loved the guard and was so grateful for all he had done. The guard was happy too. He knew he had done a good deed and he was glad he could help the little girl. They were both very happy. Love had made them safe.
