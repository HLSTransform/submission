Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy that he loved very much. It was a small, obedient dog toy that would always listen to him. Tim would play with the dog toy all day long.
One day, Tim lost his toy. He looked everywhere for it, but he could not find it. Tim was very sad. His mom saw how sad he was and said, "Don't worry, we can replace your toy with a new one." Tim was happy to hear this and went with his mom to the store.
At the store, Tim picked out a new toy. It was a big, scary monster toy. He took it home and played with it. But the monster toy was not obedient like his old dog toy. The monster toy did not listen to Tim and started to break his other toys. Tim was very sad and missed his old dog toy.
