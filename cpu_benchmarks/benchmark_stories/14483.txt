Once, there was a foolish sun who liked to shine all day long, even when the moon came out. One day, the moon was really mad. The moon shouted, "Enough! Stop shining!" The sun said, "No, I won't stop. It is my job to shine all day long." The moon said, "If you don't stop, I will cover you up with a napkin." The sun said, "You can't catch me!" and kept shining.
So, the moon grabbed a big napkin and covered the sun. The sun was so angry. He shouted, "Let me out!" The moon said, "No, you need to think before you shine too much." The sun didn't understand and kept shouting. After a while, the moon said, "Okay, I will let you out if you promise to shine only when it is daytime." The sun agreed and the moon took away the napkin.
The sun shone every day, but only when it was daytime. Whenever the moon came out, the sun smiled and let the moon take over. The sun had learned his lesson and was no longer a foolish one.
