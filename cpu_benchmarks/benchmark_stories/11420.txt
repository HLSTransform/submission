One day, a little girl was playing in her garden. She was so naughty, she didn't listen to her mother. Suddenly she saw a bird on a nearby tree. The bird was picking fruit from the branches with its sharp beak.
The little girl was fascinated. She wanted to help the bird pick some fruit but she was too small. So she decided to get a ladder.
When the girl returned with the ladder, the bird flew away. The little girl was sad, so her mother hugged her and said, "Why don't you have some tea and put your ladder away?"
The little girl smiled and ran inside. She put away the ladder and the little bird watched from afar. The bird was so impressed with the girl's keen eyesight that it flew away.
The little girl drank her tea and felt better. No matter how naughty she was, she always had a kind heart.
