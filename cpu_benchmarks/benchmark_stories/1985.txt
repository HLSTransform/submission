Once upon a time there was a compassionate owl who lived in the forest. She was beloved by all the woodland creatures, who she helped when they were in need.
One day, a bully fox came to the forest and started to sack food from the other animals. The owl was very angry and tried to stop him but the fox was too strong.
The owl thought hard and came up with a plan. She pretended to be a friend and asked the fox to go hunting with her. The fox agreed and when they were in the forest the owl showed the fox her compassion. She revealed her true identity and explained how the fox had caused so much damage to the others.
The fox felt bad and realized his mistakes. He asked the owl to forgive him and promised to never sack again. The owl was happy that her compassionate words had made a difference. From then on the fox was a changed animal and the forest was peaceful once more.
