Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They saw a big red strawberry on a green plant. Lily wanted to pick it and eat it. She reached out her hand and touched the plant.
"Ow!" she cried. "The plant is rough and prickly. It hurts my hand."
Ben looked at Lily's hand. He saw a tiny drop of blood on her finger. He felt sorry for Lily.
"Here, Lily," he said. "Let me help you. I have a soft cloth in my pocket. I can wrap it around your finger. It will make it feel better."
He took out the cloth and gently wrapped it around Lily's finger. Lily smiled at Ben. She felt better.
"Thank you, Ben," she said. "You are very kind. Can we still have the strawberry?"
Ben nodded. He carefully picked the strawberry from the plant. He broke it in half and gave one half to Lily. They both ate their halves and licked their lips.
"Mmm, the strawberry is sweet and juicy," Lily said. "It is the best strawberry ever."
They hugged each other and laughed. They did not weep anymore. They were happy.
