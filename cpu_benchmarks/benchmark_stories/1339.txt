Once upon a time, there was a lady who was very lonely. She wanted to get married and she wanted a rod to go fishing. But she was helpless and had no way of getting what she wanted.
One day, she went out for a walk and saw a man walking down the street. She asked him if he wanted to marry her and he said yes! She was so happy.
The man said he would get her a rod for fishing. She went looking for a rod but the shop was closed. She was feeling helpless and didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, the man appeared out of nowhere! He had managed to find a rod and he gave it to her with a smile. She was so happy that she hugged him and they got married.
And they both lived happily ever after - fishing with their rod!
