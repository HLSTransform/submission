Once upon a time there was a boy called Bob. He had a net and he loved to play with it. One day, he went to the park with his net and saw a big pond. He decided to use the net to catch some fish.
He started to scoop the water with his net, but every time he only caught weeds. He was very disappointed. Then Bob saw a frog near the pond. He used his net to try and catch the frog.
The frog was very scared and shouted "No! Please do not catch me!" Bob was very surprised. He stopped and put his net away.
"I'm sorry," he said. "Why don't you jump into my net? Then I can carry you away from the disgusting pond."
The frog agreed and jumped into Bob's net. Bob held it carefully and carried the frog away from the pond. He put it down in the grass, safe and sound. He folded his net and went home, happily.
