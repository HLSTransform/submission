Once there was a little girl and she loved to see the world. One night she was looking out of her window and she saw something zoom past. It was the most exciting thing she had ever seen!
The little girl wanted to know where it had gone, so she followed it. She chased it all the way to a big field. When she got there she saw that it was a harmless little animal.
The animal was so cute and she loved it so much! She knelt down and it ran around her, playing. The two were having so much fun together! Then, the animal zoomed away, disappearing into the horizon.
The little girl was so sad that she had to say goodbye to her new friend. But, she knew she had to say goodbye and she was happy that she got to play with the harmless little animal.
