Tom and Sam were best friends. They liked to play football in the park. They had a cheap football that was old and flat. But they did not care. They had fun.
One day, they saw a big sign in the shop. It said: "New footballs! Only five coins!" Tom and Sam wanted a new football. They ran to their homes to get their coins. They had to hurry. They did not want to miss the sale.
They met at the shop. They had ten coins together. They could buy a new football. They were happy. They went inside. They saw many new footballs. They were shiny and round. They picked one. They gave their coins to the shopkeeper.
"Thank you, boys," the shopkeeper said. "But be careful. This football is very bouncy. It can fly away if you kick it too hard."
Tom and Sam did not listen. They were too excited. They ran to the park. They wanted to try their new football. They kicked it and passed it and scored goals. They had more fun than ever.
But then, Sam kicked the football too hard. It flew over the fence. It landed on the road. A big car was coming. Tom and Sam watched in horror. The car ran over their new football. It popped. It was ruined.
Tom and Sam were sad. They had lost their new football. They wished they had listened to the shopkeeper. They wished they had kept their cheap football. They learned a lesson. Sometimes, cheap is better than new.
