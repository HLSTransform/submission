Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He was so excited to go and play in the park. He had a new toy and he wanted to show his friends. As he walked, he saw a big lake. He wanted to row his toy across the lake. 
He tried and tried but he was just too little. He kept dropping the oars. He got so frustrated he started to cry. His mum saw him struggling and said "Don't worry, I can help!" She helped him row to the other side of the lake. 
He was so proud of himself, he had worked so hard! He showed all his friends his toy. They were so impressed and they all decided to go and row together. It was such a fun day. 
The little boy learned that with a bit of hard work, he can do anything!
