Once there was a great girl named Addy. She loved playing with her friends and always had a lot of fun. She was always talking and talking to everyone about anything and everything.
One day, Addy and her friends were outside playing. Suddenly, Addy heard a voice calling her name. She stopped what she was doing and looked all around. She couldn't see anyone, but she could still hear the voice.
Addy asked her friends if they heard the voice, but they said they didn't. She decided to go look for the voice. As she walked, she heard it again. This time the voice said "Addy, come over here". She followed the voice and soon she came to a rainbow-colored bush.
The bush spoke to Addy and asked her if she wanted to be friends. Addy was so surprised she didn't know what to say. But then she smiled and said, "Yes, I would love to be friends with a great bush like you!". The bush smiled back and said, "My name is Rainbow, and it's nice to meet you Addy".
From that day on, Addy and Rainbow were best friends. They talked and laughed and played together all the time. Addy loved telling everyone about her talking bush friend. They all agreed it was the greatest thing they had ever heard.
