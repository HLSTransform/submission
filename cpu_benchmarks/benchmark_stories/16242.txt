Once upon a time, there was a rabbit. The rabbit was hopping around the forest, searching for something delicious and yummy to eat. Then, the rabbit saw something glittery, shiny, and blue - it was a jet! The rabbit was so excited and could not wait to taste the jet. But, when the rabbit got close to the jet, it quickly noticed that the jet was dead. The rabbit was so sad and disappointed. 
The moral of this story is that we should only try to taste things that look alive. Sometimes, what we first notice might not be what we were expecting. So, be careful about what you decide to taste!
