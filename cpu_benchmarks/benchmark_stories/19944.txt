Lila and Ben are playing with their toy cars in the backyard. They pretend that they are racing on a big road. They make noises like vroom and beep.
"Look, I have more fuel than you!" Ben says, showing his car to Lila. "I can go faster and longer!"
"No, you don't!" Lila says, showing her car to Ben. "My car has more fuel and it is stronger!"
They start to argue and yell at each other. They push and pull their cars. They do not share or take turns.
Mom hears them from the kitchen. She comes out and sees them fighting. She is not happy.
"Stop it, both of you!" Mom says, raising her voice. "Why are you yelling and being mean? You are supposed to play nicely and have fun!"
"But he said his car has more fuel than mine!" Lila says, pointing at Ben.
"But she said her car is stronger than mine!" Ben says, pointing at Lila.
Mom shakes her head. She picks up their cars and puts them in a basket. She takes them inside the house.
"You are not playing with your cars anymore today," Mom says. "You need to learn how to share and be kind. Now, go to your rooms and think about what you did."
Lila and Ben feel sad and sorry. They wish they did not yell and fight. They wish they could play with their cars again. They go to their rooms and sit on their beds.
They look out the window and see the sun setting. They see the sky turning red and orange. They see the stars coming out. They see a big moon shining.
They think about the big road they were pretending to race on. They think about how much fun they could have had if they were nice to each other. They think about how they could have explored the deep and dark woods, the high and bright hills, and the wide and clear lake.
They feel a little better. They decide to say sorry to each other and to Mom. They hope that tomorrow they can play with their cars again. They hope that tomorrow they can be friends again.
