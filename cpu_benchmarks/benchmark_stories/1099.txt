John saw a big, tall tent in the yard. He felt so excited and he wanted to explore it. So he quickly ran to it and went inside. But when he opened the door, he saw two cats. They were hissing and looked very worried. John didn't want to separate the cats, so he decided to leave the tent. He slowly walked away and went back to his house. He was so sad he couldn't explore the tent. He thought the cats looked so sad and worried. He wished he could help them stay together.
