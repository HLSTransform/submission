Once upon a time, there was a furry lion. The lion loved to spoil himself with treats. He would eat yummy snacks and take lots of naps. One day, the lion was feeling extra spoiled. He gave himself a bubble bath, put on his favorite green shirt, and ate lots of candy. He felt so happy. But just then, he heard a loud noise. The lion was frightened, and he ran away as quickly as he could. 
Soon, the lion found a cozy cave where he could hide. He curled up and hid until the noise stopped. When it was quiet again, the lion came out of his hiding place. He was relieved that he was safe and still feeling spoiled. 
The lion decided to go back home. He walked around looking for his treats and snacks, until he found them. He enjoyed his treats, and then curled up for a nap in his most comfy spot. The lion fell asleep, all sprawled out and totally spoiled! He slept peacefully until the next morning.
