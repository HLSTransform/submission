Once upon a time there was a beautiful bird called Fly. Fly was always looking for something special to do. One day, Fly decided to soar into a wardrobe. Inside, there was so much to explore! Fly flew over the different shelves and drawers to find all sorts of special things. At last, Fly found a sparkly gem. It was beautiful! Fly flew out of the wardrobe and back into the sky, taking the gem with her. Fly was so excited, she could hardly contain herself. Fly flew faster than ever, feeling the strong wind whistling through her feathers. The gem shone brighter with every beat of her wings. Fly soared higher and higher, with a wonderful feeling of joy in her heart.
