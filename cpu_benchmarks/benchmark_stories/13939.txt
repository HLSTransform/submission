Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but one day she found a big box. The box was heavy, but Lily wanted to lift it. She tried and tried, but it was too heavy.
Then, Lily's mom came to help her. She lifted the box and opened it. Inside, there was a shiny object. It was a new toy for Lily! She was so happy and played with it all day.
From then on, Lily knew that sometimes, it's okay to ask for help to lift heavy objects. And sometimes, when you open those objects, you might find something special inside.
