Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play hide-and-seek. One day, she found a great hiding spot behind a big tree. She was so hidden that no one could find her!
As she sat there, she blinked her eyes and thought about her opinion on the game. She decided that it was the best game ever because it was so much fun. Suddenly, she heard her friend calling out her name.
"Where are you, Lily?" her friend asked.
Lily giggled and replied, "I'm hidden behind the big tree!"
Her friend found her and they both laughed and played together. From that day on, they played hide-and-seek every day and Lily's opinion never changed. It was still the best game ever!
