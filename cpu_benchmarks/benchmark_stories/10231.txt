Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a little cat named Lucy. Lucy loved to play with her soft red ball. She would lift the ball with her paw and chase it all around the house. She was a very happy cat.
One day, Lucy's ball rolled under a big chair. Lucy tried to get her ball, but her ear got stuck. She was very upset. She cried and cried, hoping someone would hear her and help her.
Then, Lucy's friend, a kind dog named Max, heard her cries. Max came running to help Lucy. He used his strong nose to lift the big chair. Lucy's ear was free, and she got her ball back. Lucy and Max were so happy. They played with the red ball together, and they were the best of friends.
