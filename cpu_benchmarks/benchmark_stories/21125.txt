Once upon a time, there was a thoughtful girl named Lily. Lily loved to help people and make them happy. One day, Lily found a shiny penny on the ground. She picked it up and thought about what she could do with it.
Lily saw her friend, Tim, sitting under a tree. She walked over to him and said, "Hi, Tim! Look at this penny I found! Do you want it?" Tim smiled and said, "Thank you, Lily! I value this gift from you."
Lily and Tim went to the store and bought a candy with the penny. They shared the candy and enjoyed it together. They both learned that even a small thing like a penny can bring happiness when you are thoughtful and kind. And they lived happily ever after.
