Isaac and his Mum were playing in the living room. He was having so much fun! Suddenly, Isaac looked up and pointed to the ceiling. "What's that Mum?", he asked.
Mum squinted up at the ceiling, "Oh, that's a fan. It keeps us cool on hot days".
Isaac thought for a moment, "I want it!", he said. Mum laughed, "That's an interesting request, but no, you can't have it".
Just then, a weird noise came from the ceiling. Isaac gasped, "What was that?"
Mum looked up and smiled, "I think the fan needs some attention. Don't worry, it was just a bit weird!" She reached up and fixed the fan.
Isaac smiled, glad that the noise had gone, and the fan was back to normal.
