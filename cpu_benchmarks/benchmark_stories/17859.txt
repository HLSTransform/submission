Once upon a time there was a pig. He wanted to have a fun time. He saw a funny hat on the ground and he wanted to try it on. He thought if he wore the funny hat then maybe he could have a lot of fun. He put the hat on and looked in the mirror. He thought that he looked funny and started to laugh. He wanted to go outside and show the hat to his friends. He had a lot of fun that day and it was the best day ever!
