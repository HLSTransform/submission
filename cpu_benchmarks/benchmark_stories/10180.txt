Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to eat candy. One day, Timmy was eating a piece of candy when he felt a sharp pain in his tooth. He cried out and his mom came running to see what was wrong.
Timmy's mom looked in his mouth and saw that there was a big hole in his tooth. She knew they had to go to the dentist to fix it, but Timmy was scared. He had never been to the dentist before and the thought of someone poking around in his mouth was unknown and scary.
But Timmy's mom knew what to do. She gave him a big hug and told him that the dentist was there to help him. She explained that the dentist would use special tools to fix his tooth and make it feel better. Timmy felt a little bit better knowing that the dentist was going to help him, so they went to the dentist's office together.
When they got there, the dentist was very kind and gentle. He showed Timmy all of the tools he was going to use and explained what each one did. Timmy was still a little bit scared, but he trusted the dentist to make his tooth feel better. And sure enough, after a few minutes, the dentist was able to fix Timmy's tooth and make the pain go away. Timmy was so happy and relieved that he gave the dentist a big hug and thanked him for helping him.
