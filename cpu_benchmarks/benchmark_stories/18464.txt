Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint pictures of flowers and trees. One day, she was painting a picture outside when her mom came up to her.
Mom: "Lily, we have to go to the store now."
Lily: "But I'm not done painting yet."
Mom: "Don't worry, you can finish painting when we come back."
Lily was worried that her painting would get ruined while they were gone. But her mom promised to keep it safe. They went to the store and bought some snacks for later.
When they came back, Lily ran to her painting. She saw that it was still there and hadn't moved at all. She was so happy that she started to rock back and forth with excitement.
Mom: "I'm glad you're happy, Lily. Your painting looks beautiful."
Lily: "Thank you, Mommy. I love painting."
