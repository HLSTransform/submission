Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a gray cat named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to play outside and get dirty. One day, Fluffy played in the mud and got very dirty. Fluffy's friend, a little girl named Lily, saw her and said, "Fluffy, you need to clean yourself!"
Lily took Fluffy inside her house and gave her a warm bath. Fluffy did not like the water at first, but soon she felt nice and clean. After the bath, Lily said, "Welcome back, clean Fluffy!"
Now, Fluffy was happy to be clean again. She thanked Lily and said, "Meow, thank you!" Fluffy and Lily played together all day in the sun. They had lots of fun, and Fluffy tried to stay clean. From that day on, Fluffy always remembered to clean herself after playing outside.
