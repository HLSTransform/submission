Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pet chicken named Rosie. One day, Rosie went missing. Lily searched everywhere for her, but she couldn't find her.
Lily asked her mom, "Where is Rosie? I'm scared she's gone forever." Her mom replied, "Don't be fearful, Lily. Let's search together."
They searched high and low, under the bed and behind the couch. Finally, they found Rosie hiding in the closet. Lily was so happy to see her chicken again.
The moral of the story is that when we lose something, we shouldn't be afraid to ask for help and search for it.
