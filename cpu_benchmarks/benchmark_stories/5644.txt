Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to listen to her mommy read her stories every night before bed. One night, Lily's mommy read her a peaceful story about a bunny who lived in a forest.
After the story, Lily fell asleep and had a beautiful dream about the bunny. However, in the middle of the night, a loud thunderstorm woke her up. She was scared and didn't want to be alone.
Lily went to her mommy's room and said, "Mommy, can I sleep with you? I had a scary dream." Her mommy said, "Of course, sweetie. I'll keep you safe." And they both went back to sleep peacefully. The end.
