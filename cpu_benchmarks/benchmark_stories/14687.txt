One night, a little girl was walking down the hall. She saw something beautiful. It was a soft, fluffy bed. She had never seen one before. She was so excited! She climbed in and snuggled into the soft bed. Before she knew it, she was sound asleep.
The little girl had the most wonderful dream. When she woke up the next morning, she could still feel the softness of the bed. She smiled to herself and climbed out of the bed. She knew she would never forget her beautiful, dreamy sleep.
