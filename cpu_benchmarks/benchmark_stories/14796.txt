Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play outside in the snow. They wear warm hats and coats and boots. They make a big snowman with a carrot nose and a scarf.
"Look at our snowman!" Tom says. "He is very big and nice."
"Yes, he is!" Mia says. "But he looks cold. Let's give him a hug."
They run to the snowman and hug him. But the snowman is very cold and wet. They feel cold too.
"Brrr!" Tom says. "The snowman is too cold. Let's go inside and have some hot cocoa."
"OK!" Mia says. "But first, let's say goodbye to the snowman."
They step back from the snowman and wave to him.
"Bye, snowman!" Tom says. "You are a fair friend. We will come back and play with you tomorrow."
"Bye, snowman!" Mia says. "You are a fair friend. We hope you stay warm and happy."
They hold hands and walk to the house. They are happy and warm inside. They drink hot cocoa and eat cookies. They talk about their snowman and their fun day. They are fair friends too.
