Jack and his Grandma were walking in the park. Jack had a question. "Grandma, why are those flowers so expensive?"
Grandma answered, "That's a very good question, Jack! They are expensive because they are very special flowers."
Jack asked, "What do you mean?"
Grandma smiled. "Take a closer look, Jack. See how each flower is different than the other? They are all like little works of art. That's why they are so expensive."
Jack looked more closely at the flowers. He could see that Grandma was right. Each one had a unique image. They were like little pieces of art. He felt very lucky to be able to look at them.
Suddenly, a rude voice interrupted his thoughts. "Why are you taking such a long time? We don't have all day!"
It was a lady that looked like she was in a hurry. She was pointing at the flowers and scowling at Grandma.
Grandma smiled and said, "We were admiring the beauty of these special flowers. We'll be on our way now."
The woman huffed and walked away.
Grandma said, "Come on, Jack. Let's go find something else to look at."
Jack smiled and nodded. He was glad to have such a special moment with his Grandma.
