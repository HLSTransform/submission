Once upon a time there was a farm. On this farm, there were lots of animals, like pigs and cows and chickens. The farmer was in charge of looking after the animals. He was very busy and always finding things to do.
One day, the farmer needed to find a way to fix the fence of the farm. He tried to think of a way, but he couldn't figure it out. He felt very confused. 
Then he had an idea. He decided to replace the old fence with a new one. He asked his friends to help him get the new fence and they all got to work.
When the new fence arrived, they quickly put it up. The farmer and his friends were very happy with the new fence. It looked much better than the old one. All the animals were happy too, because the fence made them feel safe.
The end.
