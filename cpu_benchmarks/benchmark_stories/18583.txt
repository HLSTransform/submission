Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to do yoga with her mommy every day. They would stretch their arms and legs and take deep breaths together. Lily thought yoga was so much fun!
One day, Lily's mommy gave her a big box of crayons and paper. Lily was so happy and started drawing right away. She drew a picture of her and her mommy doing yoga together. It was very creative!
Lily's mommy told her that her drawing was very special and had a lot of value. Lily didn't know what "value" meant, but she knew it was something good. She smiled and hugged her mommy, feeling very proud of her creative picture.
