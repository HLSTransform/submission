Once upon a time there was a candle. The candle was special, it was big and very bright, but it was dangerous. The candle started to scatter. It jumped up, and down, and it was very exciting.
Suddenly the candle started to jump outside of the window. It ran away, and it was so fast. Everyone outside started to run away, it was so scary.
The candle jumped and jumped, until it landed in a river. Now the candle was wet, and could not jump anymore. But, it still kept flickering, so people knew it was still alive.
The people started to help the candle. They dried it off and put it back in the window. Everyone was happy the candle was back. They all talked, and sang, and were very cheerful. 
The candle was no longer dangerous, and it would stay in the window and scatter no more!
