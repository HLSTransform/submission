Markie was a curious three-year-old who liked to explore with his gear. One day he was in the yard playing with his gear when he asked his mom if he could explore beyond the fence. His mom said no, but Markie was too careless to listen and went anyway.
Markie was excited to explore new lands, but as he walked deeper into the woods he felt a little scared because he couldn't see his mom anymore. He wanted to ask her if he was going the right way, but it was too late.
Markie eventually found himself in a large clearing with two paths. He didn't know which one to take, so he decided to take the one that looked more exciting. Little did he know that it was a path to danger.
As he walked along the new path he saw something shiny in the distance and went to investigate. It was gear like his own, but it was broken. He continued walking until he arrived in a dark room. Fear overtook him and he started to shout for his mom, but it was too late. Suddenly, a large growling sound emerged and he knew he was in trouble. He quickly ran out of the room, but it was no use. In the end, he was too careless to listen and he paid the price.
