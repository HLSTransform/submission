Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his laser gun. He would shoot it at anything he could find, like trees and rocks. One day, Timmy's mom told him to stop playing with his laser gun because it wasn't safe. 
Timmy obeyed his mom and put the laser gun away. But he was sad because he loved playing with it. He asked his mom, "Can I play with my laser gun if I promise to be obedient?" 
His mom thought for a moment and said, "Okay, but you must yield to my rules. You can only play with it outside and you must wear protective glasses." 
Timmy was happy and thanked his mom. He put on his glasses and went outside to play with his laser gun. He felt obedient and safe knowing he was following his mom's rules.
