Once upon a time, there was a big jungle. In the jungle, there lived a lion. The lion was very strong and brave. He would roar loudly and scare all the other animals. But the lion had a problem. He was very clumsy. He would often trip and fall while running.
One day, the lion saw a group of animals gathered around a tree. They were all looking up at something. The lion was curious and went to see what was happening. He saw a bird sitting on a branch of the tree. The bird was chirping loudly.
The lion asked the other animals, "What is the bird saying?" But nobody knew the answer. The lion then decided to climb the tree to ask the bird himself. But because he was so clumsy, he fell down and scared the bird away. The other animals laughed at the lion and he felt embarrassed. From that day on, the lion realized that he needed to be careful and not be so clumsy.
