Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jane. She was very curious, and loved to explore her neighborhood.
One day, she went out to play and found a little owl in the grass. She was so excited that she quickly ran over and kicked it.
The owl was scared, and started to fly away. Jane chased after it. She kept chasing it until the owl flew through a big door.
Jane was confused. She opened the door and stepped inside. To her surprise, the room was very different. The walls were covered in bright colors and there were different kinds of toys scattered all around.
Realizing where she was, Jane quickly put the toys back in their proper places and decided to leave. As she walked out, she waved goodbye to the owl. She knew that the two of them were very different—and that’s okay.
