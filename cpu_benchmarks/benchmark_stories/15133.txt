Once there was a nosy rabbit. The rabbit wanted to know what was happening everywhere. One day, the rabbit decided to get some food from an old farmer's pitch. The rabbit hopped over to the farmer's pitch and started eating the delicious food.
But the farmer was mad. The farmer shouted and chased the rabbit away. The rabbit learned an important lesson: it is wrong to get things that do not belong to you.
The rabbit was so sad and realized how nosy it had been. From then on, the rabbit tried to be less nosy and to be honest and kind.
