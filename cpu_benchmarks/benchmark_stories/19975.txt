Sara and Tom are playing with their dolls. Sara has a pink doll and Tom has a blue doll. They like to make their dolls talk and hug and dance.
"Hello, pink doll. You are very pretty. Do you want to be my friend?" Tom makes his blue doll say.
"Yes, blue doll. You are very nice. Let's play together." Sara makes her pink doll say.
They make their dolls hug and kiss. Sara is excited. She likes Tom and his blue doll.
But then Tom does something bad. He pinches Sara's neck with his fingers. Sara feels pain. She cries.
"Ow, ow, ow! Tom, why did you pinch me? That hurts!" Sara says.
Tom laughs. He thinks it is funny. He pinches Sara again.
"Ha, ha, ha! You are silly, Sara. I like to pinch you. It is fun." Tom says.
Sara is angry. She does not like Tom and his blue doll anymore. She pushes Tom away. She takes her pink doll and runs to her mom.
"Mom, mom, mom! Tom pinched me. He is mean. I don't want to play with him." Sara says.
Mom hugs Sara and kisses her neck. She makes Sara feel better.
"I'm sorry, Sara. Tom should not pinch you. That is not nice. You can play with someone else." Mom says.
Sara smiles. She loves her mom and her pink doll. She does not care about Tom and his blue doll. She finds a new friend to play with.
