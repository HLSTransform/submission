Once there was a boy who had a guitar. He liked to pluck its strings. He would play it all day. One day he was feeling naughty. He decided to forget about his guitar and play outside instead. He ran to the park and started to play in the sandpit. He forgot all about his guitar. After a while he realized it was getting dark and he didn't want to go home yet. He thought about his guitar and ran back home. Luckily his guitar was still there waiting for him!
