Once upon a time, there was a dolphin named Dolly. She was very loyal to her friends in the ocean. One day, Dolly was swimming with her friends when they saw a big shark. The shark was very scary and wanted to eat them all up.
Dolly knew she had to do something to protect her friends. She swam very fast and passed the shark. She made the shark chase her instead of her friends. Dolly was very brave and loyal.
After a while, the shark got tired and went away. Dolly came back to her friends and they all thanked her for being so brave. From that day on, Dolly was known as the most loyal dolphin in the ocean.
