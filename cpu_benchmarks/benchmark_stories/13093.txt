Once upon a time, there was a lazy mint. She liked to lay around and do nothing all day. She lived in a meadow filled with yummy treats and sunny skies. One day, the mint heard about a magical machine that would make her something special. She got up from her sunny spot and hopped over to the machine. She put in coins and pushed the buttons. There was a loud humming noise and then out came a yummy green minty treat! The lazy mint was so happy and ate it all up. It was delicious! From that day on, she used the magical machine every day to make her special mint treats. The end.
