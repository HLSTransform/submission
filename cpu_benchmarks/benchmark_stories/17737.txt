Once there was a little bird, who lived in a birdcage. She was very weak, and couldn't fly. One day, she started to whistle. It made a beautiful sound. The little bird was so happy that she started to whistle louder and louder. Suddenly she heard something else, whistling. It was a bigger bird, who was flying above her birdcage. He had heard her weak whistling and said, "Hello little bird, I can help you fly". The little bird was so delighted, she opened her wings and, with the help of the bigger bird, flew away.
