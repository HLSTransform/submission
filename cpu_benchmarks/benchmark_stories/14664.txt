Once upon a time there was a friendly little boy who liked to go for walks by the river. One day he met a friendly duck on the river bank. They said hello and the duck asked if the boy wanted to join it in a swim. The boy and the duck disagreed because the water was too cold.
But they both had an idea. They cleverly went back to the bank and gathered some stones. They threw the stones into the water, making a little bridge over the river.
Once the bridge was ready, they happily crossed it over the river together. When they reached the other side, they held hands and jumped into the river! They had a great time playing together in the water. They were so happy and friendly.
