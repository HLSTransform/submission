Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine and eat yummy fruits. One day, she noticed that her mommy seemed worried about something. Lily asked her mommy what was wrong, but her mommy said it was nothing to worry about.
Later that day, Lily went to play with her friends in the park. They were playing hide and seek when Lily noticed a strange spirit floating around. She felt scared and ran back to her mommy's side. Her mommy hugged her and told her not to worry, that the spirit was just a friendly one.
The next day, Lily's mommy took her to the doctor for a check-up. The doctor said that Lily was very healthy and that she should keep eating lots of fruits and playing outside. Lily felt happy and relieved that she was healthy. She also felt happy that she didn't have to worry about the friendly spirit in the park anymore.
