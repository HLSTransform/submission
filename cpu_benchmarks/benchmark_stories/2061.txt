Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with balloons. One day, Lily's mom gave her a big, red balloon. Lily was so happy and played with it all day long.
Later that day, Lily's mom made some soup for dinner. Lily asked, "Mommy, can I taste the soup?" Her mom said, "Be careful, it's very hot." Lily blew on the soup and tasted it. She said, "Yummy! It's thick and yummy!"
After dinner, Lily was still playing with her balloon. She accidentally let go of it and it flew away into the sky. Lily was sad, but her mom said, "Don't worry, Lily. We'll get you another balloon tomorrow." The next day, they went to the store and got a new balloon. Lily was happy again and played with it all day long.
