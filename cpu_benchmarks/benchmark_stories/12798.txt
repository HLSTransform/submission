Once upon a time there was a little boy and today was his birthday! He was so happy to be three that he went for a walk to celebrate. As he wandered down the sunny path, he spotted a tiger standing in the grass.
"Wow!" the little boy whispered. "Look at that big tiger!"
He didn't know what to do; tigers can be very scary!
Then he heard a voice say, "It's okay, little boy. That tiger is not dangerous, it's just standing there. Why don't you come a little closer?" 
The boy gathered his courage and stepped closer. Sure enough, the tiger was gentle and easy.
The little boy smiled. He was so glad the tiger wasn't dangerous. He thanked the tiger and waved goodbye before continuing down his sunny path.
