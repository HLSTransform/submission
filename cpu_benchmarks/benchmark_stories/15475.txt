John was in the bathtub. He had lots of fun splashing in the water. He wanted to make sure it was extra clean and bubbly, so his mom grabbed the shampoo. It was mild so it wouldn't sting his eyes. John grabbed some of the mild shampoo and rubbed it between his hands. He made lots of bubbles in the water. He loved seeing the bubbles. Then, he splashed around and enjoyed the bath even more. He was so happy he couldn't stop laughing. When he had enough of the fun, he got out and was squeaky clean.
