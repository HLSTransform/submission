Once upon a time, there was a big race. All the animals in the forest wanted to win. They were very competitive and wanted to be the fastest. The rabbit was the fastest animal in the forest, but the other animals didn't understand how he could be so quick.
The race started and all the animals ran as fast as they could. The rabbit was in the lead, but then he stopped to eat some carrots. The result was that the turtle, who was very slow, won the race! All the animals were surprised, but they understood that it's not always about being the fastest.
