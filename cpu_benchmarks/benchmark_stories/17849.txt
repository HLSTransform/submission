Imagine a prince. He was very thoughtful. He wanted to help other people. So he thought about what he could do. He decided to help his friends first. He gave them toys and treats. He played with them and together they laughed and smiled. They were very happy that he was so thoughtful. The prince was proud that he made his friends so happy. He then went to help more people, spreading more joy and love. Everyone was so thankful for the prince's thoughtful gifts.
