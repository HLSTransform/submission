Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. Lucy loved to make things with her hands. She made toys, clothes, and even shoes for her friends to wear. Lucy had a big heart and was always happy to help others.
One day, Lucy decided to make a very special shoe. She wanted the shoe to be delicious, so she made it out of candy. She used red candy for the bottom, blue candy for the top, and yellow candy for the laces. It was the most delicious shoe anyone had ever seen.
Lucy gave the delicious shoe to her best friend, Tommy. Tommy loved the shoe so much that he didn't want to eat it. Instead, he put it on a shelf in his room so he could look at it every day. Lucy was happy that she could make something so special for her friend. And they both lived happily ever after.
