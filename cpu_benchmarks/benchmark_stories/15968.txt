Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, Timmy went outside to play and it was raining. He got very wet and didn't like it. 
Timmy decided to go back inside, but he couldn't get in because the door was locked. He tried and tried, but he couldn't get the door open. Timmy started to cry because he was cold and wet. 
Just then, Timmy's mom came home and saw him outside. She quickly unlocked the door and let Timmy inside. Timmy was happy to be inside where it was warm and dry. He learned that it's important to lock the door, but also to have a key to get back in.
