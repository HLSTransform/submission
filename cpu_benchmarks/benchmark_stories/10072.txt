Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They had a big bucket of water and some cups. They wanted to soak each other and have fun.
"Ready, set, go!" Lily shouted. She threw a cup of water at Ben. It hit his chest and made him wet.
"Hey, that's not fair!" Ben said. He threw a cup of water back at Lily. It hit her hair and made her drip.
They laughed and threw more water at each other. They were having a good time.
But then, they heard a terrible noise. It was thunder. The sky was dark and angry. It started to rain hard.
"Oh no, we have to go inside!" Lily said. She grabbed the bucket and ran to the house.
"Wait for me!" Ben said. He followed her, but he slipped on the wet grass. He fell down and hurt his knee.
"Ow, ow, ow!" he cried. He was soaked and sad.
Lily heard him and came back. She helped him get up and hugged him.
"I'm sorry, Ben. Are you okay?" she asked.
"It's okay, Lily. It's just a scratch. Let's go inside and get dry." he said.
They went inside and their mom gave them towels and cookies. They were happy again. They decided to play with their toys until the rain stopped. They hoped the sun would come back soon.
