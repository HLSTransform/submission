Once upon a time, there was a mole that lived in a hidden hole in a garden. Everyone called the mole Johnny, and he was very brave.
One day, he heard a noise in the garden, so he rushed out to take a closer look! He saw two children running around and laughing, and he knew they were up to no good.
Johnny was determined to protect his home, so he scurried around the garden until the children had gone. Then he darted back to the safe, hidden hole and waited.
When it was quiet, Johnny came out and explored. Every day he rushed around, finding things he hadn't seen before. He was happy and safe, and never faced danger again!
