Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily was very proud of her toys and never wanted to share them with her friends. One day, Lily's nurse told her that it's important to share with others and accept that they might want to play with her toys too.
At first, Lily didn't want to listen to her nurse. But then, she thought about it and realized that sharing is important. She decided to bring her toys to school and share them with her friends. Her friends were very happy and Lily felt good about herself too.
From that day on, Lily always shared her toys and felt proud of herself for doing so. She learned that it's important to accept that others might want to play with her toys too, and that sharing makes everyone happy. The end.
