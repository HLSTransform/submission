Tom and Lily are playing with their toys on the floor. Tom has a big truck and Lily has a doll. Tom likes to make the truck go fast and loud. Lily likes to make the doll talk and sing.
"Vroom, vroom, beep, beep!" Tom says, as he moves the truck around. "Move, move, get out of the way!"
"Hello, hello, how are you?" Lily says, as she makes the doll wave. "Do you want to be my friend?"
Tom does not hear Lily. He is too busy with his truck. He makes the truck go faster and faster. He does not see the doll on the floor. He runs over the doll with his truck.
"Ouch, ouch, you hurt me!" Lily says, as she picks up the doll. She sees that the doll's dress is torn and her hair is messy. She feels sad and angry. "Tom, you are so clumsy! You broke my doll!"
Tom stops his truck. He sees that Lily is crying. He feels sorry and ashamed. He does not want to make Lily cry. He wants to make her happy.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I did not mean to!" Tom says, as he gets off his truck. He looks at his truck and sees that it has a sticker of a flower. He likes the sticker. He thinks that Lily might like it too. He peels off the sticker and offers it to Lily. "Here, here, this is for you. It is a pretty flower. You can put it on your doll."
Lily looks at the sticker. She sees that it is a pretty flower. She likes the flower. She thinks that Tom is trying to be nice. She wipes her tears and offers a smile. "Thank you, thank you, that is very kind. It is a pretty flower. I can put it on my doll."
Tom and Lily smile at each other. They are not angry anymore. They are friends again. They decide to share their toys and play together. They have fun on the floor.
