Once upon a time, there was a little brown bear named Benny. Benny liked to play in the forest with his friends. One day, Benny and his friends found a sparkly rock. Benny wanted to keep it but his friends said it belonged to everyone. Benny got angry and ran away.
As he was walking, he saw a little bird who was trembling because it was cold. Benny felt bad for getting angry and decided to share his brown fur coat with the bird. The bird was warm and thanked Benny.
Benny learned that it's important to share and be kind to others. He went back to his friends and apologized for being selfish. They forgave him and they all played together with the sparkly rock.
