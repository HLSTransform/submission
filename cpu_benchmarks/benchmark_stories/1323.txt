Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to dance. She would dance all day long and never get tired! One day, she wanted to go outside and play in the sunshine, but it was very dirty.
So, the little girl asked her mommy if she could have a bath. Her mommy said yes, so she got all ready to take a bath. She imagined the bath would be like a magical pool.
The little girl stepped into the bath and let the water wash over her. She enjoyed the warm water and started splashing around. The water felt so good and she wanted to stay in there forever!
When she was done, the girl felt clean and ready to go outside. She danced around, feeling so happy and light! The world felt so magical, and she smiled at all the sunshine. 
The little girl could not believe how clean a bath had made her feel. She danced and laughed and never forgot her magical bath. She always enjoyed taking a bath so she could enjoy the world around her!
