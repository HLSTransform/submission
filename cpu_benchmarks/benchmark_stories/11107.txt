One day, a little boy named Tim found a poem. The poem was on a big tree. Tim liked the poem a lot. He read it and it made him happy. The poem was about a foolish dog that liked to run and play.
Tim wanted to find the foolish dog in the poem. He thought it would be fun to play with the dog. So, Tim started to run. He ran through the park and looked for the dog. He saw many dogs, but he did not find the foolish dog.
Tim felt sad. He sat under the big tree and read the poem again. He closed his eyes and imagined the foolish dog running and playing. Tim smiled and felt happy. Even if he didn't find the dog, he had fun reading the poem and using his imagination.
