Once upon a time there was a clever little girl who loved to build things. She built boxes, castles and towers out of blocks. One day, she wanted to build something really special.
So she asked her daddy for help. He gave her some wheels and told her she could make something that could turn. She thought and thought, until she had a great idea! She started building a car!
She put the wheels on the car and used some big blocks to build the body. She used lots of little pieces to decorate her car. When she was almost finished, she even added a steering wheel so she could turn the car.
Finally, she was done. She stepped back and looked at her car with a big smile on her face. She was so proud of how cleverly she had built her car. She loved to turn it around the whole house.
The End.
