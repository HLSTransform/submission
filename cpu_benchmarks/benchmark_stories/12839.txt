Once upon a time, there was a jolly happy family. One day, the mommy was pointing to the sky and asked her little girl: "Can you see the point at the top of the tree?" The little girl squinted and saw a point near the branches. She smiled and said, "Yes, I can see the point!"
The mommy and the little girl were so happy that they held hands and ran around the yard. As they were running and laughing, they noticed something else pointing out from the ground. It was a big tree stump with a point sticking up. The mommy picked up the little girl and said, "Look at this point. Can you guess what it is?" The little girl thought for a moment and then shouted, "It's a point!"
The mommy and the little girl laughed as they returned to the house. They had so much fun together. From that day on, whenever they saw a point, they would giggle and say, "Look, it's a jolly point!"
