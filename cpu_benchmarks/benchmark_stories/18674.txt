Once upon a time, there was a kind bear who lived in a forest. The bear liked to swim in the river and catch fish for dinner. One day, the bear saw that the river was very dirty and the fish were gone. The bear felt sad and wanted to help.
The bear decided to create a plan to clean the river. The bear asked his friends, the birds and the squirrels, to help. They all worked together to pick up the trash and make the river clean again. The bear felt happy that they could help the fish and other animals who live in the river.
The other animals in the forest saw what the bear and his friends did and felt very grateful. They thanked the bear and his friends for being so compassionate and caring. From that day on, the animals worked together to keep the river clean and healthy. The bear was proud of what they had accomplished and knew that they could make a difference if they worked together.
