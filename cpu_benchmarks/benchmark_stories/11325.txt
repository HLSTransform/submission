Katie was walking in the park when she met a bald man. She noticed his head was very shiny without any hair. She asked the man what he was doing.
"I'm spreading butter on my wheels," he said.
Katie was very interested. She asked what the wheels were for.
"I'm making a big wheel cake," he said. "It will look like a giant wheel and I'm going to put butter on each layer of the cake."
Katie thought it sounded delicious. She asked if she could help spread the butter. The bald man said yes.
So Katie and the bald man spread the butter on the wheels. They took their time and made sure each layer of the cake was evenly covered. When it was finished, the bald man smiled and said it was ready for the oven.
Katie watched as the bald man put the wheel cake into the oven and she couldn't wait to see what it would look like when it was finished. She knew it was going to be delicious.
