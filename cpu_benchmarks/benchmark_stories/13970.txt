Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to look at the stars at night. One night, he saw a bright comet in the sky. He was so excited that he wanted to catch it. 
Timmy ran outside and tried to catch the comet, but it was too high up in the sky. Suddenly, he tripped and fell down. He hurt his knee and started to cry. 
Timmy's mom came outside and saw that he was hurt. She helped him up and cleaned his knee. She told him that it's not good to try and catch things that are too far away. She said that sometimes, we need to ask for help when we can't do things on our own. 
Timmy learned that it's okay to ask for help when he needs it. He also learned that sometimes, things that seem really cool can be bad for us if we try to do them on our own. From that day on, Timmy always asked for help when he needed it.
