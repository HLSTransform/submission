Once upon a time, there was a curious kangaroo named Joey. Joey loved to hop around and explore the world around him. One day, Joey saw a shiny toy in a store window. He wanted it very much and asked his mom if they could buy it. 
His mom said, "We don't have enough money to spend on that toy, Joey. We need to save our money for important things like food and shelter." Joey was sad but understood what his mom meant. 
A few days later, Joey saw a little bird who had fallen out of its nest. Joey remembered what his mom had said and decided to help the bird instead of spending money on toys. He took care of the bird and made sure it was safe until it was strong enough to fly back to its family. 
Joey learned that sometimes it's more important to help others than to spend money on things we don't really need. From that day on, Joey felt happy knowing he made a difference in someone else's life.
