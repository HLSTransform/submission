Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mommy and daddy. They played on the swings and went down the slide. Lily loved to run and jump around. 
But then, she dropped her pen and it rolled away. Lily was clumsy and couldn't catch it. She started to worry that she wouldn't be able to find it. But her mommy and daddy helped her look and they found the pen under a bush. 
Lily was happy again and they continued to play. She learned that it's okay to be clumsy sometimes and to ask for help when you worry.
