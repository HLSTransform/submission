Ben and Lily were twins who lived in a big house with their wealthy parents. They had many toys and books and clothes, but they were not happy. They wanted to go outside and play with other children, but their parents said no. They said the air outside was bad and they needed to stay inside and breathe oxygen from a machine.
One day, Ben and Lily saw a bird flying by their window. It was blue and yellow and sang a pretty song. They wondered how the bird could fly in the bad air and why it did not need a machine. They decided to ask their parents.
"Mom, Dad, can we talk to you?" they said.
"What is it, my darlings?" their mom said.
"We saw a bird outside. It was flying and singing. How can it do that?" they asked.
Their dad sighed and said, "The bird is different from us. It has a special body that can filter the bad air and make its own oxygen. We are not so lucky. We need the machine to help us breathe."
"But why is the air bad, Dad?" they asked.
Their mom looked sad and said, "The air is bad because of the people who do not care about the planet. They make too much smoke and trash and noise. They use up all the good things and leave nothing for others. That is why we are wealthy, because we have the good things and they do not."
Ben and Lily did not understand. They did not think the good things made them happy. They thought the bird was happier than them. They wished they could fly and sing and breathe like the bird. They wished they could meet other children who did not need machines. They wished they could see the planet and care about it. They wished they could be different.
