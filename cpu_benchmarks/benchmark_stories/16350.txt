Once upon a time, there was a grumpy cat named Tom. Tom lived in a small house with his friend, a happy dog named Max. They liked to play together, but sometimes, Tom would get mad and run away.
One day, Tom found a big knot in a long string. He tried to untie the knot, but it was too hard. He pulled and pulled, but the knot just got tighter. Tom got very grumpy and didn't want to play anymore.
Max saw Tom was sad and wanted to help. He walked over to Tom and gave him a sign that said, "I can help!" Max used his paws to untie the knot. Tom was so happy and not grumpy anymore. They played together all day and had lots of fun. And from that day on, Tom knew that Max would always be there to help him.
