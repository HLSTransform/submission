Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to look at the stars at night. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a present. It was a big box with a label on it that said "lucky". 
Timmy was so excited to open the box. He looked at his mom and said, "What's inside?" His mom replied, "It's a surprise! Open it up and see." 
Timmy opened the box and inside was a toy car. He was so lucky to get such a cool toy. He hugged his mom and said, "Thank you!" 
From that day on, Timmy played with his toy car every day and looked up at the stars every night. He knew he was a lucky boy to have such a great mom and a fun toy.
