Once upon a time, there was a bird named Blue. Blue loved to fly high in the sky and feel the wind in her feathers. One day, she saw an elderly bird who needed help. The elderly bird's hanger was stuck in a tree and she couldn't get it out. Blue knew just what to do.
With a flap of her wings, Blue soared up to the tree and used her beak to pull the hanger free. The elderly bird was so happy and thanked Blue for her help. From that day on, Blue and the elderly bird became good friends and would often fly together in the sky. Blue felt proud that she could help her new friend and make her happy.
