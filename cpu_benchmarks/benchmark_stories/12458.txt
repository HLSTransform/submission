Sara and Ben are playing with blocks. They like to build tall towers and knock them down. Sara has a lot of blocks, but Ben has only a few. He wants to make his tower as tall as Sara's, but he does not have enough blocks.
He sees a piece of wood on the floor. It is long and thin, and it looks like a block. He thinks it will make his tower taller. He tries to reach for it, but it is too far away. He stretches his arm, but he cannot touch it. He feels sad and angry.
He asks Sara to help him. He says, "Please, give me that piece of wood. I want to use it for my tower." Sara looks at the piece of wood. She does not think it is a good block. She thinks it is dirty and weak. She says, "No, you cannot have it. It is not a block. It is trash. It will break your tower."
Ben does not listen to Sara. He wants the piece of wood very much. He gets up and runs to get it. He does not see the toy car on the floor. He steps on it and slips. He falls down and hits his head. He cries out loud.
Sara hears Ben cry. She feels sorry for him. She runs to him and hugs him. She says, "I'm sorry, Ben. Are you okay? Do you want a band-aid?" Ben nods. He feels hurt and weak. He says, "I'm sorry, too. I was silly. I should have listened to you. The piece of wood was not a good block. It was trash." Sara smiles. She says, "It's okay. We can share my blocks. We can build a tower together." Ben smiles, too. He says, "Thank you, Sara. You are a good friend." They hug again and go back to play with the blocks.
