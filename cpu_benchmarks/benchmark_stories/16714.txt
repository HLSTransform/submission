Jill and Tom like to sing. They sing songs from their books, from the TV, and from their mom. They sing loud and happy. They make motions with their hands and feet. They clap, jump, and spin.
One day, they sing a new song. It is about a frog and a fly. The frog wants to eat the fly, but the fly is too fast. The fly says, "You can't catch me, you can't catch me, I am a fine and clever fly." The frog says, "I will catch you, I will catch you, I am a hungry and smart frog."
Jill and Tom sing the song over and over. They have fun. They pretend to be the frog and the fly. They chase each other around the room. They laugh and giggle.
Mom hears them sing. She smiles. She likes their song. She likes their motions. She thinks they are fine and clever too. She says, "You are good singers, Jill and Tom. You are good singers and good friends." Jill and Tom hug mom. They say, "Thank you, mom. We love you. We love to sing."
