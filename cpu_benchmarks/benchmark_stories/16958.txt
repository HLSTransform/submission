Lily and Max were playing with clay in the garden. They liked to make different shapes and feel the texture of the clay. It was soft and squishy in their hands.
"Look, I made a cat!" Lily said, showing Max her clay animal.
"That's not a cat, that's a blob!" Max said, laughing. He made a snake and wrapped it around Lily's cat.
"Hey, stop that! You ruined my cat!" Lily said, angry. She grabbed Max's snake and threw it on the ground.
They started to fight over the clay, pulling and pushing each other. They did not see that their dog, Spot, was watching them. Spot was a nosy dog. He liked to sniff and lick everything.
Spot saw the clay and thought it was food. He ran over to the clay and started to eat it. He ate Lily's cat, Max's snake, and some more clay. He did not like the taste, but he was hungry.
Lily and Max stopped fighting when they heard Spot's loud barks. They turned around and saw him with clay all over his mouth.
"Spot, no!" they shouted. They ran to him and tried to get the clay out of his mouth. But it was too late. Spot had swallowed too much clay. He felt sick and started to vomit.
Lily and Max felt sorry for Spot. They hugged him and said they were sorry. They decided to stop playing with clay and find something else to do. They took Spot inside and gave him some water. They hoped he would feel better soon. They learned their lesson. Clay was not food, and fighting was not fun.
