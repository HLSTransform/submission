Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his blocks. He would build tall towers and knock them down with a big crash. One day, Timmy's friend came over to play. His friend had lots of blocks, too. Timmy was happy because now they could build even bigger towers together.
But then, Timmy's friend said something that made him sigh. "I wish I was rich like you, Timmy. Then I could have even more blocks." Timmy didn't understand why his friend would say that. He didn't feel rich. He just had enough blocks to play with.
So, Timmy decided to share his blocks with his friend. Together, they built the biggest tower they had ever made. And Timmy's friend didn't sigh anymore. He was happy to play with Timmy and their blocks.
