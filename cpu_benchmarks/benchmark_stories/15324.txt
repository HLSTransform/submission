Today was a very ordinary day. John wanted to go outside and play but his mom said no. Instead, she wanted him to stay inside with her.
John was sad at first, but then he remembered that Mom always had a surprise. She took out a yummy food and put it on the table. It was a delicious apple pie!
John was so happy. He asked his Mom if he could have some pie. She said yes and he ate it with a big smile.
After eating the pie, John felt very happy and he and his Mom talked and laughed for a long time. She gave him a big hug and the ordinary day ended with a smile.
