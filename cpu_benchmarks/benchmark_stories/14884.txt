Once upon a time, there was a big elephant named Ellie. Ellie had a big boo-boo on her leg and it hurt very much. She tried to walk but it hurt too much. 
One day, a kind doctor came and said, "Don't be afraid, Ellie. I will heal your leg." Ellie felt happy and hopeful. 
The doctor put some medicine on Ellie's leg and wrapped it up with a bandage. Ellie felt much better and could walk again. She was so happy and grateful to the doctor. 
The doctor said, "Don't be ashamed to ask for help when you need it. It's okay to need help sometimes." Ellie nodded and said, "Thank you, doctor. I will remember that." And from that day on, Ellie knew that it was okay to ask for help when she needed it.
