Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there lived a mysterious deer. This deer had a big horn on his head. He was very proud of his horn. All the other animals liked him because he was nice and helpful.
One day, a little bird was stuck in a tree. The deer saw the bird and wanted to help. He went to the tree and started to shake it with his strong legs. The tree shook and the little bird fell down, but the deer caught her with his horn. The bird was very happy and thanked the deer.
From that day on, the deer and the bird became best friends. They played together and helped each other. The other animals in the forest saw their friendship and learned that being kind and helping others is very important. They all became friends and the forest was a happy place.
