Once upon a time, there lived two cats. One was named Fluffy and the other one was called Furry. They both loved to go for walks around the garden.
One day, when the cats were strolling along the rail, something unexpected happened. They heard a loud noise and Fluffy got so frightened that he ran away.
Furry tried to follow him, but he couldn't find him. He felt worried, so he started to rub the rail. Suddenly, he heard Fluffy's meowing coming from the bushes. When Furry rushed over there, he saw Fluffy rubbing himself against the rail. He was so relieved to find him!
They hugged each other and went back home, happy to be safe.
