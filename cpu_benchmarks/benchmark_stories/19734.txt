Once upon a time, there was a girl named Louise who wanted to play in the field. She asked her mom if she could go play, but her mom said she wasn't allowed to go alone. Louise asked her friend, Sarah, if she wanted to go with her and she said yes. Sarah asked her mom and she said yes, so they set off.
When they got to the field, Louise and Sarah could see lots of green grass and flowers. They laughed and ran around, discovering new things. They picked flowers and chased butterflies. Louise found a stick and said it would be useful for digging and making sandcastles. They played in the field for hours and had great fun.
Before they knew it, it was time to go home. Louise and Sarah thanked the moms for letting them play in the field. They knew their moms were always willing to permit fun things. Louise and Sarah were so happy, they couldn't wait to come back again tomorrow.
