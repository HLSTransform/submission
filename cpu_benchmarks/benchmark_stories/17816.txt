Once upon a time there were two friends, Danny and Sarah. They were very happy playing together in a sunny meadow.
Suddenly Danny shouted "I have an idea!". Sarah was excited to know what it was. Danny explained that they could make a game out of uniting the yogurt. 
He ran off to gather lots of yogurt cups. Danny showed Sarah how they could make a line and join the yogurt cups together. He said it was like a game of puzzle. 
Sarah and Danny quickly got on with the task, having lots of fun. They laughed as the line of yogurt cups grew longer and longer. When Sarah and Danny had finished the lively game, they looked proudly at their work in the meadow. 
Their friends were so impressed with the yogurt game. Everyone had a good time and went home feeling very happy. 
The end.
