Once upon a time, there was a big bear named Brownie. Brownie had a long fur coat that kept him warm in the winter. One day, Brownie received an invitation to a party from his friend, Bunny. Brownie was very excited to go to the party and started preparing for it.
As Brownie was getting ready, he heard a noise outside. He went to investigate and saw a little bird that had fallen out of its nest. Brownie knew he had to protect the little bird from any harm, so he carefully picked it up and brought it inside his house. He made a cozy nest for the bird and gave it some food and water.
Even though Brownie was running late for the party, he knew he couldn't leave the bird alone. He decided to bring the bird with him to the party. When he arrived, Bunny was surprised to see Brownie with a little bird. Brownie explained what had happened and Bunny was happy that Brownie had protected the little bird. They all had a great time at the party and Brownie and Bunny became even better friends.
