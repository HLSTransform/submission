Once upon a time there was a little puppy. He was very hungry, so he went to find something to eat. He walked and walked until he stumbled upon a shelter filled with nice, yummy bones. He smiled and began to chew on one. He felt so happy and satisfied.
The puppy was now feeling sleepy after eating the bone so he decided to curl up in the shelter for a rest. He fell asleep right away and felt completely content. As he lay there dreaming, he felt safe and secure in the shelter.
When he awoke, he felt refreshed and happy. He was ready to go explore the world and find even more yummy bones to chew. With a bouncy bark he bounded away, feeling lucky that he had found the shelter.
