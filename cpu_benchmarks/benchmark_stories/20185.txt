Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play ball. One day, they go to the stadium with Tim's dad. The stadium is big and loud. There are many people and cars.
Tim and Sam see a ball on the ground. They run to get it. They do not see the car. The car is fast and red. The car hits Tim and Sam. Tim and Sam fall down. They are hurt and scared.
Tim's dad sees what happens. He runs to help them. He speaks to them. He says, "Tim, Sam, are you fine? I am here. Do not cry. The doctor will come soon."
But Tim and Sam do not speak. They do not move. They do not hear Tim's dad. They are not fine. They are gone. Tim's dad is sad and angry. He cries and screams. The car driver is sorry and afraid. He says, "I did not see them. I am sorry. It was an accident."
But it is too late. Tim and Sam are not fine. They are gone. The end.
