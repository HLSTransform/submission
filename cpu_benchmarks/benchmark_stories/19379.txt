Once there was a number. It was very expensive. It was so expensive that a normal person could not buy it.
One day an old lady wanted the number, but she had no money so she couldn't buy it.
Suddenly a small girl walked up to the old lady and offered her the number. The girl was only three years old but was very smart. She said if the old lady did something for her, she would give the number. 
The old lady was very happy and immediately agreed to do whatever the little girl asked. The little girl told the old lady to give away her favourite toy and the old lady agreed.
When the old lady did as the little girl asked, the little girl gave her the number. The old lady was so happy. She thanked the little girl and hugged her. From then on, the old lady and little girl were good friends.
