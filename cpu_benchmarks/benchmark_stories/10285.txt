Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a lot of hay. He needed to organize it in his barn. He worked very hard and put all the hay in neat piles. 
But then, a cow came and knocked over all the piles! The farmer was very angry. He had to start organizing the hay all over again. 
Finally, the farmer finished organizing the hay and went to bed. The cow came back and tried to knock over the hay again, but this time the farmer was ready. He chased the cow away and went back to sleep, happy that his hay was safe and organized.
