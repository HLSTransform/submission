Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and chase after the pretty butterflies. One day, she saw an impressive butterfly with bright blue and green wings. She tried to catch it, but it flew away.
Lily decided to act like a butterfly and flutter her arms like wings. She ran around the garden, pretending to fly. Suddenly, she saw the impressive butterfly again. This time, it landed on a flower. Lily tiptoed closer and closer, trying not to scare it away.
Finally, she was close enough to see the butterfly's beautiful details up close. It was even more impressive than she thought. Lily smiled and whispered, "Thank you for showing me your beauty, butterfly." From that day on, Lily always remembered the impressive butterfly and how acting like one helped her appreciate the little things in life.
