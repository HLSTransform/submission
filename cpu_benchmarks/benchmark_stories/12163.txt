Once there was a little boy and a little girl. They were best friends. They both liked to play and decided to go have a picnic in the park.
The sun was shining and the children were full of energy! They ran around, playing and laughing. 
All of a sudden, the little boy spotted something that made him stop running. He looked closely and saw that it was a match! He wanted to keep it so he could show it to his friends.
The little girl noticed he had been distracted and ran to him. "What are you looking at?" she asked. The little boy was so excited. He held up the match, and showed it to her. "Look at this! I found a match! Now I am smart!" he yelled.
The little girl smiled. She was happy for her friend. Together they continued playing, until it was time to go home.
