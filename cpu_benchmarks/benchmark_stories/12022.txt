Once upon a time, there was a turkey. The turkey was walking slow in the farm. Suddenly, a boy came and wanted to play with the turkey. The boy chased the turkey and the turkey got scared. The turkey tried to fly away but it couldn't. 
Then, the boy caught the turkey and held it tight. The turkey didn't like it and tried to break free. But the boy was too strong. The turkey got tired and stopped moving. The boy thought the turkey was sleeping, but it was not. The turkey was gone forever. The boy felt sad and didn't know what to do.
