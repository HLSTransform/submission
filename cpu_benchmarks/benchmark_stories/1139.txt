Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a tall man. The tall man had a big dog. They were best friends. They liked to play together in the park.
One day, the tall man lost his red ball in the park. He was sad. He asked his big dog to find the red ball. The big dog nodded his head and went to look for the red ball. He ran and sniffed all around the park.
Finally, the big dog found the red ball near a tree. The tall man was very happy. He gave the big dog a reward for finding the red ball. The reward was a big bone. The big dog wagged his tail and ate the bone. They played with the red ball together and went back to their small house. They were happy.
