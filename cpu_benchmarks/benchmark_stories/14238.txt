Once, there was a little boy named Jack who liked to play outside. One day he heard a whistle and looked up. It was a bird flying high in the sky. Jack smiled, so he decided to whistle too.
Jack wanted to play in the water, so he made a raft. He used a piece of wood and some string, and it floated on the river. Jack hopped on his raft and started to paddle. 
Soon, Jack found a patch of sour berries. He picked one and popped it into his mouth, but it was too sour for him. He made a funny face and then laughed. 
Jack decided to paddle around some more. He whistled and watched the birds fly around the sky. He had a great time, and eventually it was time to go home.
