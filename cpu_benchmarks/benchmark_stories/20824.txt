Once there was a mommy. She wanted to organize a surprise for her baby.
So she made a plan. She went to the store and bought lots of spicy treats.
When she got home, she put the spicy treats in a basket.
The mommy thought the surprise was perfect!
The next morning, the baby was so excited when she saw the basket of spicy treats. She couldn't believe it was for her! The baby munched on all the spicy goodies.
It was the best surprise ever!
