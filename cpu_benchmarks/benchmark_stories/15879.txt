Shelly had an oat. It was round like a ball. She wanted to show her mom. She ran to the kitchen. 
"Mom! Look at my oat!" Shelly said.
Mom paused for a moment and smiled. "That's nice, Shelly," she said.
Shelly was so excited. She wanted to take her oat outside and play. She ran to the door but it was closed. Shelly was a bit fearful. She didn't know how to open it.
Oat rolled to the door. Suddenly it opened! Shelly's mom was behind it. She had opened it and watched the whole time.
"You see, Shelly," she said, "you can open the door, you just have to try".
Shelly beamed with pride. With her oat in tow she ran joyfully outside.
