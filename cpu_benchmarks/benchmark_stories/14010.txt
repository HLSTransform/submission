Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tim. Tim was a very creative bird. He liked to make things with his wings. One day, Tim saw a big window. He had a plan to make something fun.
Tim flew around and found sticks, leaves, and mud. He used these to build a beautiful nest near the window. The nest was very colorful and strong. Tim was proud of his work. He invited all his friends to see it.
Tim's friends loved the nest too. They learned that if they work hard and use their creative ideas, they can make something nice. The moral of the story is, always use your creativity and plan well to make something great.
