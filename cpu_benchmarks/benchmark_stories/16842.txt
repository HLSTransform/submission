Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a friend named Timmy. One day, they went to the park to play. Timmy wanted to climb on the monkey bars, but Lily warned him that it was too high for him. Timmy didn't listen and tried to climb anyway. He got stuck and was very confused. 
Lily went to get help from their parents. They came and helped Timmy down. He was okay, but he realized that Lily was right and he shouldn't have tried to climb so high. 
After that, they played on the swings and had a lot of fun. Timmy thanked Lily for being a good friend and for warning him about the monkey bars. They both went home happy and tired from playing.
