Once upon a time, there was an ugly circle. All the animals wanted to take it away, but they didn't know how. Then one day, the animals decided to gather around the ugly circle and figure out a way to take it away. They couldn't move it, so they tried covering it up with leaves. But the circle was still there!
Then, one of the animals had a great idea. They decided to make a big hole next to the ugly circle and get all their friends to help fill it with dirt. They worked together and, after a few days, the hole was filled up to the top. The circle was gone!
The animals were so happy! They gathered together in a big circle and celebrated their victory. They had worked hard and now they could enjoy the open space. They vowed to never forget how they worked together to make things better.
