Tom and Mia were going to camp with their mom and dad. They were very happy. They packed their bags with clothes, toys and snacks. They got in the car and drove for a long time.
When they got to the camp, they saw many tents, trees and flowers. They also saw other kids and grown-ups. They said hello to them. They found a spot to set up their tent. They helped their mom and dad with the poles and the ropes.
After they finished, they went to explore the camp. They saw a big lake with ducks and fish. They saw a playground with swings and slides. They saw a fire pit with logs and marshmallows. They wanted to try everything.
"Can we go to the lake, mom?" Tom asked.
"Can we go to the playground, dad?" Mia asked.
"Sure, but be careful and stay together," mom and dad said.
Tom and Mia ran to the lake. They threw stones and watched them splash. They fed the ducks and saw them quack. They felt happy and excited.
Then they ran to the playground. They climbed the swings and pushed each other. They slid down the slides and laughed. They felt fun and free.
They ran back to the fire pit. They saw their mom and dad waiting for them. They had sticks and marshmallows ready. They roasted the marshmallows and ate them. They felt warm and sweet.
They hugged their mom and dad and said thank you. They said good night to the other kids and grown-ups. They went to their tent and snuggled in their sleeping bags. They felt tired and cozy.
They closed their eyes and dreamed of the camp. They felt happy and loved. They had an ordinary day, but it was also a special day.
