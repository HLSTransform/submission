Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to eat cereal every morning. She would pour the cereal into her bowl and add some milk. Then, she would use her spoon to eat it all up.
One day, Lily noticed that her cereal kept rolling off her spoon. She tried and tried, but the cereal just wouldn't stay put. It was very persistent.
Lily didn't give up though. She kept trying and practicing until she got better. And one day, she was able to eat her cereal without any of it rolling away. She was very proud of herself and enjoyed her breakfast even more.
