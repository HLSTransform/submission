Billy was a happy little three year old who loved playing in the park. One day, when he was out playing, he saw a skeleton in the park. It looked funny to him and he was a bit scared.
Billy approached the skeleton and said "Hi, Skeleton, what are you doing here?". The skeleton didn't answer. It just smiled and nodded.
 
Billy was a bit confused but he decided to talk to the skeleton anyway. He asked him "Do you want some food? I have some yummy apples in my bag." The skeleton nodded again.
So Billy took out an apple and the skeleton ate it! It was yummy! Then the skeleton said "Thank you, Billy". Billy ran to his mom and said "Mom, I met a skeleton in the park, and it ate my apple!" Billy's mom just smiled and nodded.
