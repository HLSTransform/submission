Once there was a mom and a little girl. Every day, the girl would rub her mom's back, to help make all her worries go away. The mom was so happy and smiled as she felt the warm rubs.
One day, the mom had a lot of work to do, so she was very organized. She had papers to read, emails to write and lots of other things to take care of. The girl saw her mom looking so sad and she knew she had worries.
So the girl took the mom's hand and said, "Come with me!". She led the mom to the couch, put a pillow on her lap, and showed her how to rub her back.
The girl said, "Just close your eyes, think happy thoughts, and I will do the work." She started rubbing the mom's back, and soon enough all of her worries had faded away. 
The mom thanked the girl and said, "Thank you for helping me feel better". 
The little girl smiled a big smile, knowing she was the one who had helped.
