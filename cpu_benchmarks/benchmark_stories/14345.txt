Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to help her aunt. One day, her aunt asked her to load some heavy boxes into the car. Lily felt important and happy to help.
As they were driving down the road, Lily's aunt got distracted and didn't see the red light. Suddenly, another car crashed into them. Lily was scared and hurt, and her aunt was badly injured.
At the hospital, Lily's aunt told her, "It's important to always pay attention when you're driving. Even if you have something important to do, like load boxes, safety comes first." Lily learned an important lesson that day and promised to always be careful in the car.
Sadly, Lily's aunt never fully recovered from the accident, and Lily missed her very much. She realized that even the simplest things, like loading boxes, can have serious consequences if we don't take safety seriously.
