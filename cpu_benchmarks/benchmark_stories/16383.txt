Once upon a time, in a small house, lived a creative girl named Lily. Lily loved to draw and paint all day. One day, she found a secret door in her room. She called her friend, Tom.
"Tom, I found a secret door!" said Lily. Tom came over and they opened the door together. Behind the door, they found a room full of colorful paint and paper.
Lily and Tom played in the secret room. They painted and drew many things. Tom got tired and wanted to quit. "Lily, I want to quit," said Tom.
"No, don't quit! Let's make one more picture," said Lily. They painted a big, beautiful rainbow together. They were happy and proud of their creative work.
