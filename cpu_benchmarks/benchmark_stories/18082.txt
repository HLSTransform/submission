Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside, especially when it rained. One day, Lily went outside to jump in the puddles. She was having so much fun, she didn't even notice her shoes were getting wet.
Suddenly, Lily's mom came outside and said, "Lily, it's time to come inside now. You don't want to catch a cold." Lily replied, "But Mom, I'm having so much fun! Can I please stay outside for just a little bit longer?"
Her mom said, "Okay, but you need to make sure you set a timer so you don't stay outside too long. And make sure you don't get your clothes too tight from being wet!" Lily nodded and continued to jump in the puddles, happy as can be.
