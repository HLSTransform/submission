Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily. She had a gentle cat named Mittens. Lily loved to play with Mittens and cuddle with her.
One day, Lily's mom asked her to go to the store to buy some milk. Lily was scared to go alone, but her mom told her to trust herself and be brave. So, Lily took Mittens with her and they walked to the store together.
On their way, they saw a little bird that had fallen from its nest. Lily picked up the bird and held it gently in her hands. Mittens watched over the bird too, making sure it was safe.
When they got to the store, Lily bought the milk and they walked back home. Lily felt proud of herself for being brave and helping the little bird. She knew she could trust herself and be gentle with animals.
