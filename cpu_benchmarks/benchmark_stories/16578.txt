Lily and Ben were at the beach with their mom and dad. They liked to play in the sand and look for shells. But today the sky was gloomy and the wind was cold. They could not swim or build castles. They were bored and sad.
"Can we go home?" Lily asked her mom.
"Not yet, sweetie. We have to wait for the surf to calm down. The waves are too big and loud. They might tip over our car." Mom said.
Lily and Ben looked at the surf. It was gray and angry. It crashed on the rocks and sprayed water everywhere. They did not like the surf. They wished it would go away.
"Let's play a game." Ben whispered to Lily. "We can pretend we are spies and the surf is the enemy. We have to hide from it and find clues."
"OK." Lily whispered back. "But we have to be quiet. The surf might hear us."
They crawled behind a big log and peeked at the surf. They saw a shiny thing in the sand. They crept closer and picked it up. It was a coin with a picture of a fish on it.
"Wow, a treasure!" Ben whispered. "Maybe the surf is guarding more treasures. Let's look for them."
They searched the sand for more coins. They found a ring, a button, and a key. They put them in their pockets and smiled. They forgot about the gloomy sky and the cold wind. They had fun playing spies and finding treasures. They did not notice that the surf was getting quieter and smaller. They did not hear their mom and dad calling them.
"Come on, kids. It's time to go home. The surf is safe now. We can drive back." Mom said.
Lily and Ben ran to their mom and dad. They showed them their treasures and told them their game. Mom and dad smiled and hugged them.
"You are very clever and brave spies." Dad said. "But you are also very wet and dirty. Let's go home and get warm and clean."
They got in the car and drove away. They waved goodbye to the surf. It was not so angry anymore. It sparkled in the sun and made a soft sound. It seemed to say sorry and thank you. Lily and Ben smiled and said goodbye too. They had a good day at the beach after all.
