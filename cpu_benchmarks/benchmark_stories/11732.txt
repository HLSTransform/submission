Once upon a time, there was a girl. She loved to push her toy car around.
The car had a handle that she could hold onto. She always grabbed it tight.
Every day she would push the car around, making loud noises and smiles.
One day, she met a dog with a friendly face. The dog was loyal, and stayed with her no matter where she pushed her car.
They became friends, and the girl and her new friend would push the toy car around together.
The girl was so happy she had a loyal friend, and the two of them would play together until the sun went down.
