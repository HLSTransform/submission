Once upon a time, there was a gentle bunny named Benny. Benny loved to hop and play in the meadow with his friends. One night, Benny looked up at the sky and saw a bright comet shooting across the stars. He was so excited that he wanted to share the sight with his friends. 
Benny went to his friends and told them to come to the meadow to see the comet. They all gathered together and looked up at the sky. Suddenly, Benny saw something scatter across the sky. It was the comet! They all watched as it disappeared into the darkness. 
Benny and his friends were amazed by the beautiful sight. They decided to make a wish on the comet. Benny wished for carrots, his favorite food. His friends wished for toys and ice cream. They all went to bed with happy thoughts, dreaming of their wishes coming true.
