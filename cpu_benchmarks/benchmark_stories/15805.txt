Once, there was a little girl named Jane who lived on a farm. One day, she saw an ugly woman walking past her house and she wanted to learn more about her.
She ran outside to see what the woman was doing. The woman was picking apples from Jane's apple tree.
Jane went up to her and said, "hello, why are you picking my apples?"
The woman smiled and said, "I'm picking these apples to make a cake for a special dinner tonight. Would you like to help me?"
Jane was excited and said, "Yes please!"
The woman taught Jane all about how to pick the freshest apples and what to do with them. Then, they baked the most delicious apple cake together.
Jane had learned so much from the woman. She was so glad she had seen the ugly woman walking past her house that day.
