Once upon a time, there was a dancer who wanted to put on a show. She arrived in a town and the little people there were all excited. They waited and waited but the dancer did not come.
Suddenly, she arrived! Everyone was so happy and began clapping with excitement. The dancer smiled and twirled and spun around the room, making all the little people laugh. 
One little girl was so excited that she jumped up and down and shouted "Me too, me too!" The dancer stopped twirling and looked confused. 
"You want to dance too?" asked the dancer. 
The little girl was so thrilled that she nodded hard and said "Yes! Yes please!" 
So the dancer picked the little girl up and twirled her around in her arms, just like she had done with everyone else. The little girl laughed and everyone clapped and the show was a huge success!
