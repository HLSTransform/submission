Ben and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park on Tuesday. They have a ball and a bat. They take turns to hit the ball with the bat. They call it strike.
One Tuesday, Ben and Mia go to the park. They see a big dog. The dog is brown and furry. It has a long tail. The dog runs to them and barks. Ben and Mia are scared. They drop the ball and the bat.
"Go away, dog!" Ben says. "We want to play strike!"
The dog does not go away. It picks up the ball in its mouth. It wags its tail. It thinks Ben and Mia want to play with it.
"Hey, that's our ball!" Mia says. "Give it back, dog!"
The dog does not give it back. It runs away with the ball. Ben and Mia chase the dog. They run and run. They cannot catch the dog.
They see a man. The man is the dog's owner. He is sitting on a bench. He is reading a book. He does not see the dog or the children.
"Excuse me, sir!" Ben says. "Your dog has our ball!"
The man looks up. He sees the dog and the children. He smiles. He thinks they are silly.
"I'm sorry, kids," he says. "My dog likes to play, too. He does not know he is being naughty. Here, I have another ball for you. You can have it. It is red and shiny. Do you like it?"
Ben and Mia look at the red ball. They like it. It is bigger and brighter than their ball. They say thank you to the man. They take the red ball. They go back to play strike.
They forget about the dog and their old ball. They have fun with the new ball. They hit it hard with the bat. They laugh and shout. They are happy. It is a good Tuesday.
