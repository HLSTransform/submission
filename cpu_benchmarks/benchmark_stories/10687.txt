Once there was a little girl who loved to sit down in the sun. She looked up at the sky and enjoyed its beauty. One day when she was sitting there, something spooky happened. Out of the open blue sky, a tip floated down and landed right next to her. She was so surprised and amazed that she just sat there and watched. She wondered to herself what it could have been and why it had come from the sky. 
The tip seemed to be open at one end and when she went closer to have a better look, she was surprised to see that it was full of glittery things. She gasped in excitement as she began to pick some of the glittery items up out of the tip. She could feel the cool breeze of the wind gently blowing against her face and she smiled as she thought about how wonderful it was to sit in the sun. 
After she finished playing with the glittery things, she carefully sat the tip back down onto the ground and went on her merry way. She couldn't believe how lucky she was to have had such a magical experience!
