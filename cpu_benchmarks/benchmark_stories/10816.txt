Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big nation with lots of trees and flowers. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. They were having fun on the swings and the slide.
Suddenly, Lily saw her friend Sarah crying. She asked her what was wrong. Sarah said that she had lost her toy. Lily wanted to help her, so she spread out her arms and started looking for the toy.
After a while, Lily found the toy and gave it back to Sarah. Sarah was very happy and said, "Thank you, Lily. You are so polite and kind!" Lily smiled and said, "I'm happy to help my friend." They continued playing and having fun together.
