Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her backyard with her toys. One day, she saw a green bell on the ground. She picked it up and rang it. Ding, dong, ding, dong! It made a beautiful sound. Lily decided to keep the bell and put it in her pocket.
Later that day, Lily's mommy asked her what she wanted for dinner. Lily had to decide what she wanted to eat. She thought for a moment and said, "I want macaroni and cheese, please!" So her mommy made her favorite dinner.
After dinner, Lily went back outside to play. She remembered the green bell in her pocket and decided to ring it again. Ding, dong, ding, dong! It still sounded beautiful. Lily was so happy she decided to keep the bell forever.
