Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved to play with stamps. She had lots of different stamps with strange and unusual pictures. One day, she asked her mom a question about one of the stamps. "What is this stamp about?". Her mom answered, "This is a stamp about a famous person". The little girl was so excited to learn about this unusual stamp and asked lots of questions.
The next day the little girl got a surprise. She found a mysterious box at her door with a stamp that she had never seen before! She was so happy and wanted to learn more. She asked her mom, "What is this stamp?‚Äù. Her mom answered, "This is a very special stamp. It is a magical stamp that can answer questions". 
The little girl was so excited! She couldn't believe it. She put the stamp on a piece of paper and asked, "Who's the best mom in the world?" Instantly, words started appearing on the paper, "Your mom is the best mom in the world." 
The little girl smiled. She was so delighted to have discovered this unusual stamp. From that day on, she never left the house without it.
