Once upon a time there was a young girl who was very naughty. She didn't like to obey her parents and always made very bad choices. One day her parents got very cross with her and decided to punish her. They said she had to stay in the shelter for a whole day without going out to play.
The young girl was sad, but she knew she had to stay in the shelter. She felt very sorry for being so naughty and decided that she would never do it again. She stayed in the shelter all day and thought carefully about her behaviour.
When it was time to come out, the young girl's parents saw that she had thought carefully about what she had done and they were happy. They gave her lots of love and told her never to be naughty again. From that day onwards, she was always a good girl and obeyed all the rules.
