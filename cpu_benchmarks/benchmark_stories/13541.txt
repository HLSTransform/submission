Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very sad because his mommy had to go to work and he had to stay home. He wanted to go to the park and play with his friends. 
Timmy went to check the mailbox and found a letter from his grandma. She sent him a toy car! Timmy was so happy and forgot about his sadness. He played with his new car for a while, but then he got bored. 
Timmy went to his mommy and complained that he was bored. His mommy said they could go to the park after she got home from work. Timmy was happy again and waited for his mommy to come home. When she did, they went to the park and had lots of fun. Timmy was no longer a poor, sad boy.
