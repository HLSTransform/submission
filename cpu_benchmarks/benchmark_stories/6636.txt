Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her yard. One day, she found a big pole lying on the ground. It was very tall and made of wood. Lily decided to use it as a flagpole for her pretend castle. 
But after a few days, Lily noticed that the pole was starting to rot. It was getting weaker and weaker. She knew she had to get a new pole. But her mom said they couldn't afford a new one because they were too expensive. 
Lily was sad but then she had an idea. She remembered her dad had some old wood in the garage. She asked him if she could use it and he said yes. So, she used the wood to make a new pole for her flag. It wasn't as tall as the old one, but it was still good enough for her pretend castle. And best of all, it was cheap!
