One day, a little girl was very thirsty. She wanted to drink something delicious. She looked through the kitchen and saw a strawberry. She picked it up and took a big bite. It was so sweet and yummy! She ate a few more strawberries. They were so little and tasty.
When she was done, the girl remembered she was thirsty. She saw a glass of juice and remembered how good it tasted. She took a sip and smiled. The juice quenched her thirst. She felt so happy!
The girl was so glad that she found the strawberries and the juice. She wanted to feel that way again and so, she made a plan. Everyday, she'd pick a few little strawberries and drink some delicious juice. That way, she'd always feel happy and satisfied!
