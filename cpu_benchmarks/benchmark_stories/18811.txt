Tom liked to play in the garden with his mom. He liked to see the flowers that had many colors and smells. He liked to touch the soft petals and the green leaves. He liked to hear the bees that buzzed and the birds that sang.
One day, he saw a new flower that he had never seen before. It was big and round and yellow. It had a hairy stem and a hairy face. Tom was curious and wanted to touch it. He reached out his hand and touched the hairy face.
But the flower did not like that. It closed its petals and made a loud noise. It was a sunflower and it was angry. It did not want to be touched by Tom. It wanted to look at the sun and bloom.
Tom was scared and ran away. He cried and ran to his mom. He told her what happened. His mom hugged him and said, "It's okay, Tom. The sunflower is not mean. It is just shy. It likes to be alone and watch the sun. It does not like to be touched by anyone. It is not a flower for playing. It is a flower for looking."
Tom nodded and said, "I'm sorry, sunflower. I did not know. You are very pretty and hairy. But I will not touch you again. I will look at you from far away." He smiled and wiped his tears. He went back to the garden and played with the other flowers. He learned to respect the sunflower and its space. He also learned a new word: bloom.
