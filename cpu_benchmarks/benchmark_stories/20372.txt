Lily and Ben went to the zoo with Mom and Dad. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and giraffes. Lily liked the penguins best. They were black and white and funny. Ben liked the elephants best. They were big and gray and strong.
They ate ice cream and popcorn and drank juice. They were very happy. But then, Lily saw a big sign that said "Lost and Found". She thought it was a place to find more animals. She ran to the sign and opened the door. But there were no animals inside. There were only coats and hats and bags.
Lily was scared. She did not know where she was. She did not see Mom and Dad or Ben. She started to cry. She wanted to go back to the penguins. She panicked.
Ben saw Lily run away. He followed her. He saw her go inside the Lost and Found. He went after her. He saw her crying. He hugged her. He said, "Don't cry, Lily. I'm here. We'll find Mom and Dad. They're looking for us. Come on, let's go outside."
He took her hand and led her out of the door. They saw a nice lady with a badge. She smiled at them. She said, "Are you lost, kids? I can help you. What are your names?" Ben told her their names. He said, "We're looking for Mom and Dad. They're at the zoo. We got lost."
The lady said, "Don't worry, Ben and Lily. I'll call your Mom and Dad on the phone. They'll come and get you. You're very brave. Do you want some water?" She gave them each a cup of water. They drank it. They felt better. They thanked the lady.
Soon, they heard Mom and Dad's voices. They ran to them. They hugged them. Mom and Dad were so happy to see them. They said, "We're sorry, Ben and Lily. We were so worried. We're glad you're safe. How did you get lost?"
Ben and Lily told them what happened. They said they were sorry, too. They said they learned a lesson. They said they would never run away again. They said they loved Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad said they loved them, too.
They all went back to the zoo. They saw more animals. They had more fun. But they stayed together. They did not get dizzy or panic again. They had a good day.
