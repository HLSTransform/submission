Sara liked to help her mom in the kitchen. She liked to wash the potatoes and put them in a big pot. She liked to watch the water boil and make bubbles. She liked to mash the potatoes with a big fork and add butter and salt.
One day, Sara wanted to help her mom make potato soup. She asked her mom if she could cut the potatoes with a knife. Her mom said no, the knife was sharp and dangerous. Sara had to use a dull peeler instead. Sara was not happy. She thought the peeler was slow and boring. She wanted to use the knife like her mom.
Sara waited until her mom was busy with something else. She took the knife from the drawer and tried to cut a potato. But the knife was too big and heavy for her. She slipped and dropped the knife on the floor. The knife hit the pot and made a loud noise. The pot broke and the water spilled everywhere. Sara was scared and wet. Her mom heard the noise and came running. She saw the mess and the knife and the broken pot. She was angry and worried. She picked up Sara and checked if she was hurt. She was not, but she was crying.
Her mom hugged her and said, "Sara, why did you do that? You could have hurt yourself or me. You know you are not allowed to use the knife. You have to listen to me and follow the rules. The knife is not a toy. It is a tool for grown-ups. You have to use the peeler for the potatoes. It is safe and easy. I know it is dull, but it is better than breaking the pot and making a mess."
Sara felt sorry and ashamed. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I wanted to help you. I wanted to use the knife like you. I didn't mean to break the pot and make a mess. I won't do it again. I will use the peeler for the potatoes. I love you, mom."
Her mom smiled and said, "I love you too, Sara. I'm glad you are okay. You can still help me in the kitchen, but you have to be careful and follow the rules. Now let's clean up this mess and make some new potato soup. How about that?"
Sara nodded and said, "Okay, mom. Thank you, mom. Can I add the butter and salt?"
Her mom said, "Of course, you can. That's your favorite part. Come on, let's go."
