One day, a big dog and a small cat were playing in the park. They were very good friends. They liked to run, jump, and play together. But sometimes, they did not agree on things.
"Let's play catch," said the big dog. "It's easy and fun!" The small cat did not like catch. It was not easy for her because she was small. She wanted to play hide and seek. The big dog and small cat started to argue. They both wanted to play their own game. They did not want to play the other's game. This made them both sad.
Then, they both paused. They looked at each other and thought about their friendship. The big dog said, "I'm sorry, small cat. We can play hide and seek if it makes you happy." The small cat smiled and said, "Thank you, big dog. But we can also play catch because it makes you happy too."
From that day on, the big dog and the small cat learned to take turns and play both games. They also learned that being kind and thinking about their friend's feelings was more important than always getting their own way. And in the end, they both had lots of fun and their friendship grew even stronger.
