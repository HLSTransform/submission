Once upon a time, there was a kind duck. The duck lived by a river. Every day, the duck would go for a swim in the river. One day, the duck met a fish. The fish said hello to the duck and the duck nodded back. They became friends and swam together every day. 
One day, the river became very fast and the fish could not swim well. The duck saw the fish struggling and knew he had to help. The duck used his beak to carry the fish to safety. The fish was very grateful and thanked the duck. The duck just nodded and they continued to be friends. 
From that day on, the duck and the fish always looked out for each other. They swam in the river together and had many adventures. They were the best of friends and nothing could ever break their bond. The end.
