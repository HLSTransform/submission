Once upon a time in a small town there lived a little boy named Tom. He was only three years old, but he was very clever and loved to make things. One day, he decided he wanted to create something special. 
Tom searched around and found some thin sticks and a few stones. He thought for a while and then he knew what he wanted to do. He started to piece the sticks and stones together very carefully to make an escape. 
When Tom was done, he looked around to see if anyone had noticed what he was doing. But no one was there. Tom was excited and wanted to test out his escape. He sat inside the escape and took a deep breath. 
Just then, a voice called out from behind him, “Wow, Tom! That’s an amazing escape you’ve made!” 
Tom jumped in surprise and spun around to see his mom smiling behind him. “Can I try it out?” she asked. Tom nodded eagerly and watched as his mom took a seat in his escape and closed the door behind her.
Tom smiled. He was so proud of the escape he had made, and he knew his mom was too.
