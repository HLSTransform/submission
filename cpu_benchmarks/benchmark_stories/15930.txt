Once upon a time, there was a brave boy. His mom and dad called him Joey. One day, Joey went for an adventure in the woods and found a special box. The box had a shiny button on it.
Joey was excited by what he found and wanted to thank the person who put the box in the woods. He asked the trees if they knew who put the box there and they said they didn't know.
Then, Joey noticed a small mouse and he asked the mouse, "Hey little mouse, who put the box here?" The mouse said, "I did." Joey was so happy, he thanked the mouse and asked him what was inside the box.
The mouse smiled and said, "There is something very useful inside. Press the button and you'll see." Joey was so happy, he quickly pressed the button. When he opened the lid of the box, he found a red hat. Joey thanked the mouse, put on the hat, and went on his way.
The End.
