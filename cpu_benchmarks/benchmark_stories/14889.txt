Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to have tea parties with her toys. One day, she asked her mommy to make her some tea. Her mommy cut some lemons and put them in the tea. Lily loved the taste!
After drinking her tea, Lily decided to spin around and around. She spun so fast that she got dizzy and fell down. Her mommy asked, "Are you okay, Lily?" Lily replied, "Yes, mommy. I just got dizzy from spinning too much!" 
Her mommy helped her up and gave her a cookie to make her feel better. From that day on, Lily always remembered to be careful when spinning around so she wouldn't get dizzy again.
