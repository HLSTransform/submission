Anna likes to play with her tea set. She has a white pot, two cups, and a big cake. She invites her teddy bear to have tea with her. She puts the cake on a plate and cuts it with a knife.
"Here you go, Teddy," she says. "Have some cake. It is yummy."
She pours some tea from the pot into the cups. She gives one cup to Teddy and holds the other one for herself. She blows on the tea to make it cool.
"Careful, Teddy," she says. "The tea is hot. Don't burn your tongue."
She sips her tea and smiles. She likes to have tea with Teddy. He is a good friend.
But then, she hears a noise. It is her baby brother, Tom. He crawls into the room and sees the tea set. He likes shiny things. He reaches for the white pot.
"Tom, no!" Anna shouts. "That is my tea pot. Don't touch it!"
But Tom does not listen. He grabs the pot and lifts it up. He tries to drink from it, but he does not know how. He spills the tea all over himself and the floor. He cries.
Anna is angry and sad. She runs to Tom and takes the pot from him. She sees that he has tea in his ear. She wipes it with a cloth.
"Tom, you are silly," she says. "You don't drink from the pot. You drink from the cup. And you don't pour tea in your ear. You pour tea in the cup."
She hugs Tom and kisses his cheek. She is not angry anymore. She is sorry that he is wet and cold.
"Come on, Tom," she says. "Let's go to Mommy. She will dry you and make you warm. And then, we can have tea together. You, me, and Teddy. OK?"
Tom nods and smiles. He likes Anna. She is a good sister. He holds her hand and follows her to Mommy. They leave the tea set behind. They will play with it later.
