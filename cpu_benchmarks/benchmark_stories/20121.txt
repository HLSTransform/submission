Lily and Max were friends who liked to play outside. They had a lot of toys, but their favorite was a big box of blocks. They could build anything they wanted with the blocks: houses, cars, castles, and more.
One day, they decided to make a garden with the blocks. They used green blocks for the grass, yellow blocks for the sun, and different colors for the flowers. They worked hard and had fun. They made a lot of flowers, but the most beautiful one was a white and yellow daisy. They put it in the middle of the garden and admired it.
"Look at our garden, Max! It is so pretty and organized!" Lily said.
"Yes, it is, Lily! I like the daisy the best. It is so bright and happy!" Max said.
They smiled and hugged each other. They were very proud of their garden.
But then, they heard a loud noise. It was thunder. They looked up and saw dark clouds in the sky. They felt a drop of water on their faces. It was rain.
"Oh no, Max! It is raining! What will happen to our garden?" Lily said.
"Don't worry, Lily! We can take our garden inside. We can put it in your room and keep it safe!" Max said.
They quickly picked up the blocks and put them back in the box. They carried the box to Lily's house. They ran inside and closed the door. They heard the rain pouring outside.
They went to Lily's room and put the box on the floor. They opened it and took out the blocks. They started to rebuild their garden on the carpet. They made sure to put the daisy in the middle again.
"There, Lily! Our garden is back! And it is still pretty and organized!" Max said.
"Thank you, Max! You are a good friend! And our garden is still happy, even in the rain!" Lily said.
They smiled and hugged each other again. They played with their garden until the rain stopped. They were very happy.
