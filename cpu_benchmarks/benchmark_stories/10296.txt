Tom and Mia are playing in the garden. They have two pistols that can spray water. They fill them with water from the tap and run around the grass.
"Got you!" Tom shouts as he sprays Mia on the back. Mia giggles and turns around. She sprays Tom on the face. Tom closes his eyes and laughs.
They chase each other and spray water everywhere. They are having fun. They are fast and wet.
But then they hear a voice. It is Mom. She is not happy.
"Tom! Mia! Stop that right now!" Mom says. "You are making a mess. And you are wasting water. Come inside and dry off."
Tom and Mia stop spraying. They look at Mom. They look at each other. They are sorry.
"OK, Mom," they say. They drop their pistols and go inside. They hug Mom and say sorry. Mom hugs them back and smiles.
She tells them to change their clothes and have a snack. She says they can play with their pistols another day. But only if they are careful and not wasteful.
Tom and Mia nod. They love their Mom. They love their pistols. They love playing in the garden. But they also know the rules. They learn from their mistakes. They are good kids.
