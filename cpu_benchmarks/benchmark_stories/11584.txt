Once upon a time, in a big field, there lived a nosy sheep named Sally. Sally loved to play with her friends. Her favorite game was hide and seek.
One sunny day, Sally and her friends were playing hide and seek. Sally counted to ten while her friends ran and hid. "Ready or not, here I come!" Sally shouted. She looked behind a big tree and found her friend, Tom the rabbit. "I see you, Tom!" Sally laughed.
Next, Sally saw a tail sticking out from behind a bush. She walked over and found her friend, Bella the squirrel. "Found you, Bella!" Sally said. Bella giggled and joined Sally and Tom. They all looked for their last friend, Max the puppy.
Max was good at hiding. They looked and looked but could not find him. Then, Sally heard a bark from a little cave. She peeked inside and saw Max. "We found you, Max!" Sally said with a big smile. Max wagged his tail and they all laughed. They were happy to play together on a sunny day.
