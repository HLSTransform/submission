Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a small box with a lock on it. Inside the box, she kept her favorite toy, a pretty string. Lucy loved to play with the string and make fun shapes with it.
One day, Lucy lost the key to the box. She felt nervous because she could not unlock the box and play with her string. Lucy looked everywhere for the key but could not find it. She was very sad and did not know what to do.
Lucy's mom saw her crying and asked what was wrong. Lucy told her mom about the lost key. Her mom helped her look for the key, and they found it under her bed. Lucy was so happy! She learned that when you are nervous, it is good to ask for help. With help, she could unlock the box and play with her string again.
