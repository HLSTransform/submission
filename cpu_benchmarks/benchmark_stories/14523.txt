Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Ella. Ella was walking by her neighbor's house when she noticed they were giving away presents. Ella decided to go closer to see what they were offering. 
When Ella arrived, she saw that they were giving away boxes wrapped in colorful paper. Ella was excited and wanted one of the presents. But it was starting to feel uncomfortable, with everyone watching her. 
So the neighbor, who was being very friendly, offered Ella one of the boxes. She was so happy she ran back to her house, thanking the kind neighbor. 
Once she was back, Ella eagerly opened the wrap to discover a shiny new toy inside. She was so excited and thanked her neighbor again for the amazing present. 
The End!
