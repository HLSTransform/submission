Once upon a time there was a boy called Tom. He was a very curious child. He liked to explore and find out what things were. One day, he picked up some stuff from the floor. His Mom saw this and said, "Tom, put the stuff away. We have to keep our house organized." 
Tom asked, "What does organized mean?" His Mom smiled and said, "It means everything has to be in its place - like putting all the books on the shelf and the toys in the cupboards." 
 
Tom nodded and put all the stuff away. He knew that it was important to keep things neat and tidy. 
The very next day, he decided to help out. He said to his Mom, "I'd like to raise the stuff, Mom!" His Mom hugged him and said, "That sounds like a great idea, Tom. Let's get organized and put all the stuff away together." 
Tom smiled. He was very proud that he could help out. Together, they organized all the things in the house and it looked so neat and tidy. 
From that day on, whenever Tom found something on the floor, he would say, "I will raise the stuff, Mom!" and he would help to keep the house organized. And that is the story of Tom and his organized house.
