Once upon a time, there was a young boy. He was running outside in the bright sunshine. The boy wanted to hurry home and find out what was inside a big vase. He wondered if it held a secret. 
When he got home, he ran upstairs to where the vase sat on a shelf. He tugged and pulled on it, but it wouldn't open. 
Suddenly, his mom came up behind him and said, "It needs to be unlocked before it can be opened!" She clicked a little lock open and the vase opened up.
Inside was something wonderful! The boy saw lots of colorful balloons, sparkly stars and a tasty treat. He laughed with delight and grabbed a balloon to take outside.
The little boy was so happy. In that moment, he knew he had been hurrying in the right direction.
