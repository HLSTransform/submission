"Come on, mama!" said Lily as she watched the little bird try to fly away. The little bird had a broken wing and could not fly.
Mama put her hands on her hips. "We have to help him, Lily," she said.
Lily and Mama grabbed a large blanket and carefully covered the bird. "We have to take him to the vet," said Mama.

The vet put a cast on the bird's wing and soon the bird was able to fly again with a clean wing.
"We did it, Mama!" said Lily with a smile as the little bird flew into the sky. "We rescued the bird!"
