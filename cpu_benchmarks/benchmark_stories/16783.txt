Tim and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big slide. They want to try it.
"Let's go on the slide!" Tim says.
"OK, but I'm scared. It's so high!" Mia says.
"Don't worry, I'll go first. Then you can follow me. It will be fun!" Tim says.
Tim climbs up the ladder. He sits on the slide. He pushes himself down. He goes very fast. He feels the wind in his hair. He laughs. He reaches the bottom. He is happy.
"Wow, that was awesome!" Tim says.
"Your turn, Mia!" Tim says.
Mia looks at the slide. She is still scared. But she wants to be brave. She wants to have fun. She wants to succeed. She climbs up the ladder. She sits on the slide. She closes her eyes. She pushes herself down. She goes very fast. She feels the wind in her face. She screams. She reaches the bottom. She is surprised.
"That was scary!" Mia says.
"But you did it! You succeeded!" Tim says.
"I did! I'm proud of myself!" Mia says.
They hug each other. They are happy. They decide to go on the slide again. And again. And again. They have a lot of fun. They love the slide. It is their favorite thing in the park.
