Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack. He was three years old and loved candy. One day he saw a big box of candy. It seemed very strong and full of sweet treats. 
Jack was so excited! He asked his mom if he could have some candy. "Sure, Jack," his mom said, "but remember to take only one piece."
Jack smiled and took a candy from the box. He looked at it and tried to figure out which one he wanted the most. It all seemed so yummy! 
He chose the biggest candy. "This one looks strongest," he said, grinning. He put it in his pocket and ran outside to play. He was so happy that day!
