Once upon a time there was a mommy and a little girl. The mommy had a task to do, but she was feeling weak. She did not know what to do.
The little girl wanted to help so she offered to help. The mommy was so happy and accepted her offer. 
The Mommy showed the girl how to do the task. It was hard at first, but with practice she got better. She was so proud that she had helped.
When the task was finished the Mommy thanked the little girl for her help. She gave her a big hug and a kiss for being so kind and brave. 
The little girl was so happy she had been able to help her Mommy. They both smiled and hugged each other and were so happy that the task was finished. 
The End.
