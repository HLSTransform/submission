Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named BunBun. BunBun loved to hop around and play with his friends in the forest. One day, he met a new friend named Kiki the kitten. Kiki had soft fur and BunBun loved to snuggle up with her.
One day, while they were playing, they found a mysterious box. Kiki said, "Let's open it and see what's inside!" BunBun was scared and said, "No, we shouldn't. It's unknown and we don't know what could be in there."
But Kiki was curious and opened the box. Suddenly, a mean old fox jumped out and tried to kick them! BunBun and Kiki quickly ran away and learned that sometimes it's better to be safe than curious. They promised to always be careful and stick together.
