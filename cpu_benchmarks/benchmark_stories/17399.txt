Anna and Ben love to play with their toy sail. They pretend it is a real sail that can take them to faraway places. They make noises like the wind and the waves and the birds.
One day, they decide to play with their sail in the park. They find a big pond with ducks and fish. They put their sail in the water and watch it float. They are very happy.
"Look, Ben, our sail is going fast!" Anna says.
"Yes, Anna, it is like a race!" Ben says.
But then, they see something enormous in the pond. It is a swan. The swan is white and has a long neck and a big beak. The swan sees the sail and thinks it is food. It swims towards the sail and opens its beak.
"Oh no, Ben, the swan is going to eat our sail!" Anna says.
"Quick, Anna, we have to save our sail!" Ben says.
They run to the edge of the pond and try to reach their sail. But the swan is faster. It grabs the sail with its beak and lifts it out of the water. It shakes its head and makes a loud noise.
"Hey, that's our sail, give it back!" Anna says.
"Please, Mr. Swan, don't hurt our sail!" Ben says.
But the swan does not listen. It flies away with the sail in its beak. Anna and Ben are very sad. They cry and hug each other.
They have lost their toy sail. They have learned a hard lesson. They should not play with their sail in the pond. They should play with their sail in the sandbox. The sandbox is safe and fun. The sandbox has no swans.
