Once upon a time, there was a big valley. Every day, a little girl name Emily came to the valley to swim. She loves to feel the water splash on her face and bobbing up and down in the waves.
Today was different because when Emily got to the valley, she was very hungry. Her tummy was growling for food. She thought about how delicious her mom's cooking was and how it would make her feel so much better.
Emily decided to take a break and look around. She saw a dry area and she could see some fruits lying around. She wandered over and saw that it was filled with ripe apples and tasty pears. Emily quickly picked the freshest apples she could find, and happily ate them. It was the best snack of the day.
Emily quickly went back to the water and took a deep dive. She swam with all her might and felt her energy coming back. She enjoyed playing in the waves and the warm sun shining down on her face. After a long swim, she climbed out of the water and dried off before heading home. Emily was so happy that she had found a delicious snack in the valley.
