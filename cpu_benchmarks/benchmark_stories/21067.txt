Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to dig and water the plants. Lily had a red plant that she loved very much. She gave it a name: Ruby.
One day, Ben saw Ruby and wanted to have it. He said to Lily, "Give me your plant. It is pretty and red. I want it."
Lily was angry. She said, "No, Ben. This is my plant. I found it and I take care of it. You have your own plants. Go away."
Ben did not listen. He tried to grab Ruby from Lily. Lily held on tight. They pulled and tugged. Ruby was hurt. Some of her leaves fell off.
Lily and Ben both started to cry. They heard their mom coming. She saw what happened. She was not happy. She said, "Lily and Ben, what are you doing? You are hurting the plant and each other. You need to share and be kind. Say sorry and hug."
Lily and Ben felt sorry. They said sorry and hugged. They surrendered Ruby to their mom. She said, "I will put Ruby in a pot and give her some water. She will be okay. You can both look at her and talk to her, but you cannot fight over her. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They said, "Yes, mom. We understand. We love Ruby and we love each other." They smiled and went back to play.
