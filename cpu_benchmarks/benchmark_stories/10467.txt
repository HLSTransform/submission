Jill's mum was drying her daughter's clothes when she noticed something strange. Jill was watching curiously. 
"What is it?" asked Jill.
"My daughter's clothes have painted designs on them," said her mum.
Jill was so curious. She wanted to know who painted the designs. "Who painted these?" She asked her mum. 
Her mum didn't answer. She smiled and said, "That's our secret". 
Jill was frustrated. She wanted to know so badly, but her mum seemed determined to keep it a secret. But Jill was not giving up. She was determined to find out the secret. 
Jill started asking everyone around but no one knew. She searched near and far and still couldn't get an answer. She was getting closer, but could she really find it?
