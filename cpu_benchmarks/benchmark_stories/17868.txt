There was a human and he was very hungry. He looked around and he saw a tree full of apples. He went over to the tree, looked up and smiled. He reached up to the branch and grabbed one of the apples. But when he tried to take a bite, he found the apple was very bitter. He looked around and saw a field of oranges. He walked over and grabbed one. This orange was much sweeter and he enjoyed his snack. He was happy and he thanked the tree for the orange.
