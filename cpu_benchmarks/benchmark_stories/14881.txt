Once upon a time, there was a cat. This cat was very curious and liked to explore. One day, the cat went into a room and knocked over a vase. The vase broke and made a loud sound.
The person who lived in the room was very angry. They saw the cat and said, "Bad cat! You broke my vase! I will punish you!" The cat was scared and ran away.
Later, the person went back into the room and saw that the vase was empty. They realized that the cat had not broken it after all. They felt bad for punishing the cat and went to find it to say sorry. The cat forgave them and they became friends. The end.
