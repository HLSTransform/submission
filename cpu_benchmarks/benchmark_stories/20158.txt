Sara and Tom were playing in the park. They had a toy gun that could shoot water. They liked to shoot each other and laugh.
"Tom, I will shoot you!" Sara said. She ran after him with the gun.
"No, Sara, don't shoot me!" Tom said. He ran away from her. He hid behind a tree.
Sara looked for Tom. She saw his feet under the tree. She smiled. She aimed the gun at his feet and shot.
"Ah, Sara, you got me!" Tom said. He came out from the tree. He was wet.
They heard a loud noise. They looked up. They saw an enormous plane in the sky. It was flying very low. It had a big star on it.
"Wow, look at that plane!" Sara said. She pointed at it.
"It's so big!" Tom said. He stared at it.
The plane flew over them. It made a loud sound. It dropped something from its belly. It looked like a big ball.
"What is that?" Sara asked. She was curious.
"I don't know," Tom said. He was scared.
The ball fell to the ground. It made a big boom. It was a bomb. It exploded. It made fire and smoke. It hurt many people and things.
Sara and Tom were very lucky. They were far from the bomb. They did not get hurt. But they were very sad. They saw the fire and smoke. They saw the people and things that were hurt.
They dropped the toy gun. They did not want to shoot anymore. They hugged each other. They cried.
