Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah who was three years old. She loved to spend time with her friends in the classroom.
One day, Sarah went to school early. The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon as Sarah stepped into her classroom. It was full of bright colors and filled with straight rows of little desks. Sarah thought it was so beautiful!
Sarah spent a lot of time in the classroom. She would draw pictures, practice her letters and even play with the other students. She was always happy and the classroom felt like home. 
After school, Sarah always looked forward to the next day. She knew it would be just as beautiful, and she couldn't wait to spend more time in her classroom.
