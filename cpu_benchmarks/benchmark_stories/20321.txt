Lily and Max were playing in the kitchen. They liked to pretend they were chefs and make yummy food. Lily found a big lemon in the cabinet and wanted to squeeze it for juice. She asked Max to help her.
"Max, can you squeeze this lemon for me?" Lily said, holding the lemon in her hand.
"Sure, Lily. I can squeeze it very hard," Max said, taking the lemon from her.
They put the lemon on the table and took turns to squeeze it. They made funny faces as the lemon juice squirted out and made their fingers sticky. They laughed and giggled as they squeezed the lemon until it was empty.
"Wow, we squeezed a lot of juice!" Lily said, looking at the bowl.
"Yes, we did. But it smells sour. Do you think it will taste good?" Max said, sniffing the juice.
"I don't know. Maybe we need some sugar to make it sweet," Lily said, looking around.
She saw a jar of sugar on the counter and reached for it. But it was too high for her. She tried to stand on her toes, but she still could not reach it.
"Max, can you get the sugar for me?" Lily said, pointing at the jar.
"OK, Lily. I can get it for you," Max said, climbing on a chair.
He grabbed the jar of sugar and brought it to the table. He opened it and poured some sugar into the bowl of juice. He stirred it with a spoon and tasted it.
"Mmm, this is much better. It is sweet and sour. Do you want to try it, Lily?" Max said, offering the spoon to Lily.
"Yes, please. Thank you, Max," Lily said, taking the spoon.
She tasted the juice and smiled. It was delicious. She liked the taste of lemon and sugar.
"This is the best juice ever. You are a charming chef, Max," Lily said, giving Max a hug.
"You are a charming chef, too, Lily. We make a great team," Max said, hugging her back.
They drank the juice and felt happy. They had fun playing in the kitchen and making their own food. They decided to squeeze more lemons and make more juice for their mom and dad. They hoped they would like it, too.
