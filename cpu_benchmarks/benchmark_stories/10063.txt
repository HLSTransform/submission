Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They saw a big cloud in the sky. It was white and fluffy.
"Look, a cloud!" Lily said. "It looks like a bunny."
"No, it looks like a car," Ben said. "Let's mix it and make something else."
They both blew hard at the cloud. They tried to mix it with their breath. The cloud moved and changed shape.
"Wow, now it looks like a cake!" Lily said. "I'm hungry. Can we eat it?"
Ben laughed. "No, silly. We can't eat a cloud. It's just water and air. But we can pretend."
They ran inside and got some plates and spoons. They came back to the garden and sat under the cloud. They pretended to scoop some cloud and put it on their plates. They pretended to eat it and make yummy noises.
"Mmm, this cloud is delicious!" Lily said. "It tastes like strawberries."
"Mmm, mine too!" Ben said. "It tastes like chocolate."
They ate and ate until they were full. They smiled and hugged each other. They had fun mixing and eating the cloud.
