Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved to rock. Every day she liked to rock in the rocking chair in her room. She was happy and smiling.
One day while she was rocking, someone knocked on her door. She opened it and was surprised to find her mom there with a present. The little girl was so excited, she couldn't believe it. She hugged her mom tight. 
When she opened the present there was something even bigger and better inside. She was surprised again and couldn't wait to find out what was inside. But when she opened it, she was very upset. It was just a silly rock! 
The little girl was very disappointed, but then she remembered how much fun she had rocking and decided the rock was perfect for playing with. Now she rocks with it every day and has lots of fun.
