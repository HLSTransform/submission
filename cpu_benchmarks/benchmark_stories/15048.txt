Once upon a time there was a litte girl named Lucy. She loved to play and have fun. One day she wanted to wear her jolly red shirt but it didn't fit. Lucy started to worry.
"Mommy, my shirt doesn't fit," she said.
"Don't worry," said her mom. "I'll take it to the tailor and have it fixed."
The mom quickly took the shirt to the tailor. Lucy was very excited and couldn't wait to try it on again. After a few days, her mom brought the shirt back to her.
Lucy tried it on and it fit perfectly! Now she could run and play with her jolly red shirt. She was no longer worried. The end.
