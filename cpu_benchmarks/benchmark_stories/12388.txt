Mum put on her new apron and smiled. She said, "I'm going to make us some yummy food!" 
Mum chopped some vegetables, then put them in a big pot on the stove. She added some spices and stirred. The room smelled delicious.
Then she opened the oven door. Inside was a big loaf of bread. It looked nice and golden. She took it out and put it on the counter. 
Suddenly, Tom remembered that the bread he left on the table was going to rot! He ran over to it and said, "Mum! I left this bread out and it's going to rot!"
Mum laughed and said, "Don't worry, Tom. We'll make some toast out of it! That'll stop it from rotting." 
Tom smiled. He liked toast for breakfast. And it was nice to see that, even when something bad happened, Mum always found a way to make it better.
