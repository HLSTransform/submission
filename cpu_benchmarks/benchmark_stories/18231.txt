One day, a little duck named Tim went on an adventurous walk. He loved to splash in the water and play with his friends. The sun was shining and the sky was blue. Tim was very happy.
Tim splashed in a big puddle and laughed. His friends came to play too. They all splashed and had fun. After a while, they were tired and wanted to take a nap.
Tim and his friends found a nice, soft spot under a tree. They took a cozy nap together. When they woke up, they felt refreshed and ready for more splashing fun.
