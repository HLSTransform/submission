Once upon a time, there was a little kitten named Fluffy. Fluffy was a tough kitten, always playing and running around with her friends. One day, Fluffy and her friends were playing with a ball, but the ball rolled away and into the street.
Fluffy's friend, Spot, said, "I'll get the ball!" and ran into the street. But a car was speeding down the road and didn't see Spot. Fluffy gasped and cried out, "Oh no! Spot!"
But just then, Fluffy's mommy came running over and scooped up Spot. "Don't worry, Fluffy," she said. "Spot is okay. But we need to be careful around cars. They can be very dangerous."
From that day on, Fluffy and her friends always looked both ways before crossing the street. And they never played with their ball near the road again.
