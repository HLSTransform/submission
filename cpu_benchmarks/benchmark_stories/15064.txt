Once there was a little girl who loved to bake cookies. She always liked to make them with her mom. One day, her mom asked her to help make a cookie special. 
The little girl was so excited. She mixed the ingredients and put them in the oven. After a few minutes, the little girl opened the oven and saw the delicious cookie. 
But then the little girl was sad. She realized that she should have added more ingredients, as it was not very tasty. 
The little girlâ€™s mom knew exactly what to do. She told her daughter to release the cookie onto the table and top it with something sweet and yummy. 
So the little girl took the cheap cookie and released it onto the table. Then, she put some sprinkles on the cookie. 
The little girl was so happy with how the cookie turned out. She and her mom enjoyed the sweet and yummy cookie together.
