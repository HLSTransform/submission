Once upon a time there was a big hole in the ground. A sleepy fox was inside the hole and he couldn't get out. He tried over and over, but his tired legs were too tired.
Then one day the fox looked up and saw a friendly cat. The cat said, "I know how to help you get out." The fox jumped up with joy!
The cat put her paw over the hole and she said, "Close your eyes and count to three." The fox did what she said and when he opened his eyes, the hole was closed.
The fox and the cat were so happy that they couldn't stop smiling. They were friends forever!
