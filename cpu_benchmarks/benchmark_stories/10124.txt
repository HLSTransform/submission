Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play hide and seek. One day, they play in the park with Mom and Dad. Lily and Ben run and hide behind trees and bushes. Mom and Dad look for them and call their names.
Lily sees a big hill. She thinks it is a good place to hide. She runs up the hill and lies down on the grass. She feels the sun on her skin. She hears the birds sing. She smiles and waits for Mom and Dad to find her.
Ben sees a big slide. He thinks it is a good place to surprise Mom and Dad. He climbs up the ladder and sits on the slide. He sees Mom and Dad walk by. He waits for the right moment. He slides down fast and shouts "Surprise!" He laughs and hopes to scare them.
Mom and Dad hear Ben's voice. They turn around and see him on the slide. They are surprised and happy. They clap and cheer for him. They say "Wow, Ben, you are so high on the slide! You are brave and clever!"
Lily hears Mom and Dad's voices. She wonders what is going on. She gets up and looks down the hill. She sees Ben on the slide and Mom and Dad near him. She feels left out and sad. She says "Hey, what about me? I am hiding too!"
Mom and Dad hear Lily's voice. They look up the hill and see her on the grass. They are surprised and happy. They wave and smile at her. They say "Wow, Lily, you are so high on the hill! You are smart and sneaky!"
Lily and Ben see each other. They wave and smile too. They are proud and happy. They run to Mom and Dad and hug them. They say "We love you, Mom and Dad! We love to play hide and seek! We love to surprise you!" Mom and Dad say "We love you, Lily and Ben! You are both amazing! You both surprise us!" They all laugh and hug. They have fun in the park.
