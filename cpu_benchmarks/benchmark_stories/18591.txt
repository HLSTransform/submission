Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily was playing with her toys when her mom called her for lunch. Lily was so excited to eat her favorite sandwich, but she accidentally spilled some juice on the cushion. 
Lily's mom saw what happened and said, "Lily, accidents happen. Let's turn the cushion over so we can't see the stain." 
Lily helped her mom turn the cushion over and they continued to enjoy their lunch. After they finished, Lily's mom asked her, "Lily, what did you learn from spilling juice on the cushion?" 
Lily thought for a moment and replied, "I learned that accidents happen, but we can always turn things around and make them better." 
Lily's mom smiled and hugged her, proud of her wise words. And from that day on, Lily always remembered that even when things seemed distant or difficult, she could always turn them around and make them better.
