Once there was a farmer who had a big, yellow cornfield. Every morning the sun rose and shone brightly, making the corn glisten. But one day, the sky was very gloomy. All of the sudden, the farmer saw smoke coming from the cornfield. He hurried to see what was happening and noticed that the corn was burning! The fire spread quickly, so the farmer tried everything he could to put it out. He threw buckets of water on the corn, but it didn’t work. The fire just kept getting bigger and bigger. Soon, the whole field was burnt! The farmer was very sad as he looked around at all the corn that had been burnt. Luckily, the fire hadn’t spread to the other fields, so the farmer was able to start over.
