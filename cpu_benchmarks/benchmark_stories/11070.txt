Tom and Lily like to print pictures with their crayons. They have a big book with many pages of animals and plants. They choose the ones they want to print and put a paper on top of them. Then they rub the crayons on the paper and see the shapes come out.
One day, they find a page with wild animals. They see a lion, a tiger, a zebra and a giraffe. They think they are very interesting and want to print them all. They take four papers and start to print.
"Look, Lily, I have a lion!" Tom says. He shows his paper with a yellow and brown animal with a big mane.
"Wow, Tom, it is very nice!" Lily says. She shows her paper with a black and orange animal with stripes. "I have a tiger!"
They print the zebra and the giraffe too. They are happy with their pictures. They want to show them to their mom and dad.
They run to the kitchen where their mom and dad are. They hold their papers and say, "Look, look, we have wild animals!"
Their mom and dad smile and hug them. They look at their pictures and say, "They are very interesting and beautiful! You did a great job!"
Tom and Lily feel proud and happy. They like to print pictures with their crayons. They wonder what other animals and plants they can find in their big book.
