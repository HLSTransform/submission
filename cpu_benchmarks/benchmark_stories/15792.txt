Uncle was so ancient. He was much older than mom and dad. He walked slowly and talked softly. His hair was white like the snow.
One day, Uncle came over and visited. He asked how everyone was doing. Mom smiled and said everyone was great.
"Do you want a kiss?," asked Uncle. Mom nodded and gave him a big kiss on the cheek. Then Uncle said, "That's what I like."
Next, Uncle gave mom a hug. After that, it was time for Uncle to go.
But before he left, Uncle gave me a big kiss. It was the sweetest kiss I ever had! He said, "I'll come back again soon." I was sad, but I was happy he had given me a kiss.
