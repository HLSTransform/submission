Once upon a time there was a mommy and a baby. The mommy wanted to buy a new table, so she took the baby to the store. They saw many tables there, but the mommy said that she wanted a very special one. 
So they continued walking around until they saw a famous table. It was round and had four legs. The mommy was very happy and the baby was too. They loved the table so much that they decided to buy it right away. 
The mommy and the baby brought the table back home and put it in the middle of the room. Everyone who visited their house said it was the most special table ever. The mommy and the baby were so proud because their table was famous!
