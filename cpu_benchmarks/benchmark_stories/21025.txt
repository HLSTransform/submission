Once upon a time, there were two friends, Sarah and Tim. They both enjoyed playing in the park, enjoying the sunshine and playing hide-and-seek. One day, Sarah and Tim found a tall tower in the park. They both looked at it and were amazed. 
Tim then said "Let's climb the tower!"
But Sarah said, "That looks too busy, I better study instead." 
So while Tim had fun playing around the tower, Sarah stayed near it and studied hard. As she studied, Tim still noticed that Sarah was having fun too. 
The moral of the story is that being busy is good. It's important to find time to do both: have fun and learn new things.
