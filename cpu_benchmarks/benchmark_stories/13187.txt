Once upon a time there was an amazing scale. Every day, it would part the clouds in the sky. It was so strong that it pulled the clouds up high. 
One day, a little 3 year old girl decided to climb up the scale. She was so excited! She slowly began to climb higher and higher. The clouds moved around her as she climbed. 
At the top of the scale, the girl saw something amazing. She saw a beautiful rainbow that filled the sky. She was in awe of its beauty.
The 3 year old couldn't believe it. She was part of the sky! Even though she was scared, she knew it was an amazing experience. She smiled and thanked the scale for its help. 
The girl loved her adventure and hoped to do it again one day. The scale helped the girl experience something amazing and opened a whole new world for her.
