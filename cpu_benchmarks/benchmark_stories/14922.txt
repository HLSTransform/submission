One day, Jack and Jill were out for a drive in their car. They drove through a long, dark tunnel.
"Wow, this tunnel is so dark," said Jack. 
He could not see the end.
"This looks like a tube," said Jill.
"Yes, it does! It's like a silly underground rollercoaster," Jack replied. 
They both laughed and enjoyed the ride.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise.
"What was that?" asked Jack, scared. 
"I think it was just a silly train passing by," Jill said. 
After a few more minutes, they finally made it out of the tunnel and back into the light.
"Look, we made it!" Jack said, relieved.
"That was a silly tube," said Jill, still laughing. 
Jack and Jill drove home, smiling and excited about their drive.
