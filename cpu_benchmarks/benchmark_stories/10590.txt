Jimmy looked out of the window and saw a brilliant rainbow. He had never seen one so beautiful and he wanted to get closer to it. So he ran outside, but when he arrived, the rainbow had disappeared!
He was very disappointed, but then he heard a voice. It said "Don't worry, Jimmy. I have an idea!" He looked down and saw a little fairy.
"Follow me!" said the fairy and he flew away. They flew to a park and the fairy said: "Look at this shampoo!" It was a magical shampoo that made the most brilliant rainbows.
Jimmy took the shampoo and flew back home. With a few drops in the sky, he watched as a beautiful rainbow appeared. Jimmy smiled and waved to the fairy. "Thank you," he said.
