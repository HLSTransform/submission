Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his tools. He had a hammer, a screwdriver, and a saw. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. 
"Wow, Timmy! Your tools are lovely!" said Billy. 
"Thank you, Billy. Do you want to play with them?" asked Timmy. 
"I don't know if I dare," said Billy. 
"It's okay, Billy. I'll show you how to use them safely," said Timmy. 
So, Timmy showed Billy how to use the hammer, the screwdriver, and the saw. They had so much fun building a fort together. When it was time for Billy to go home, he said, "Thank you for teaching me how to use your tools, Timmy. I had so much fun!" 
"You're welcome, Billy. Anytime you want to play with my tools, just let me know," said Timmy. 
And they lived happily ever after, playing with their lovely tools.
