Lily liked to mark on the wall with her crayons. She made red and blue and green marks that looked like flowers and stars and animals. She did not like to comb her hair, because it hurt when the comb pulled on the knots. She hid her comb under her bed, so her mom would not find it.
One day, Lily's mom came into her room and saw the marks on the wall. She was very angry and said, "Lily, who did this? You know you are not allowed to mark on the wall. You have to clean it up right now." Lily felt scared and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I just wanted to make something pretty. Please don't be mad at me."
Her mom sighed and said, "Lily, I love you, but you have to follow the rules. And you also have to comb your hair, because it is very messy and tangled. Where is your comb?" Lily did not want to tell her mom where her comb was, because she thought her mom would take it away. She said, "I don't know, mom. Maybe I lost it."
Her mom looked under her bed and found the comb. She said, "Lily, I found your comb. You hid it under your bed, didn't you? That was not very nice. You have to use your comb every day, or your hair will get worse. Come here, I will help you comb your hair." Lily did not want to go to her mom, because she knew it would hurt. She said, "No, mom. I don't want to comb my hair. I like it this way. It makes me look mighty, like a lion."
Her mom smiled and said, "Lily, you are mighty, but you are also beautiful. And you can be both. You can have pretty hair and still be strong and brave. But you have to take care of your hair, or it will get dirty and sick. Trust me, it will not hurt so much if you comb it gently and slowly. Here, let me show you." She took the comb and started to comb Lily's hair. At first, Lily cried and squirmed, but then she felt the comb slide through her hair more easily. She saw her hair shine and bounce in the mirror. She said, "Mom, you are right. My hair is pretty and mighty. Thank you for helping me." Her mom hugged her and said, "You are welcome, Lily. I'm proud of you. Now, let's go and clean the wall together, okay?" Lily nodded and said, "Okay, mom. I'm sorry for marking on the wall. I will not do it again." They went to the wall and wiped the marks with a cloth. They made the wall clean and white again. They were happy and said, "We did it!" They hugged each other and laughed.
