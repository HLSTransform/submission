Once, there was a girl named Jackie. She loved animals - she dreamed of them all the time and wished she could go on a safari. One day her wish became a reality - her dad had decided they would go on a safari!
Jackie was so excited she couldn't wait. But then, she realized something - she didn't have the proper clothes to wear. She needed something that fit just right and was suitable for the safari. She searched every closet and drawer but couldn't find the perfect outfit.
Jackie was about to give up hope when suddenly something amazing happened. Her best friend, Samantha, presented her with a safari outfit! It fit perfectly and Jackie was overjoyed.
Jackie and Samantha soon were on their way to the safari with Jackie wearing her new outfit. Jackie looked around in awe and realized that her dream had come true - she was actuallly on a safari!
