Once there was a little girl named Maggie. She loved to play with her new bicycle in the park. One day when Maggie was riding her bicycle she saw a big dog. The dog was very bossy. He barked very loudly and commanded Maggie to get off her bicycle. Maggie was scared and quickly went home.
That night Maggie had a nightmare. She dreamed that the dog followed her to her house and was bossily barking in her room. Maggie awoke screaming and ran to her mum's room.
Maggie's mum said, "It's okay baby, it's just a dream. Everything is alright. Now, let's go back to sleep ok?"
Maggie nodded her head and hugged her mum. She felt safe and snuggled down into her bed until she fell back asleep. Maggie never had that nightmare again.
