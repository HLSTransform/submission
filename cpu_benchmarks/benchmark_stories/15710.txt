Once upon a time, there was a girl named Rachel. Rachel was only three years old but she was very brave.
One day, Rachel heard loud noises outside her house. She opened the door and saw a lot of people kneeling on the ground in front of a big jail. Rachel was worried and scared, so she asked the people what was wrong.
The people told Rachel they were scared because they didn't want to go to jail. They said it was a deep dark place with no light and they didn't want to go there. They kneeled together and prayed that they would not have to go.
Rachel did not want them to go to jail. She shouted, "Don't worry! I will help you! Don't worry - we will find a way out!"
The people were so happy and cheered for Rachel. They thanked her for her courage and kindness. In the end, Rachel and the people found a way out and they were all free.
