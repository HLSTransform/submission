Once upon a time, there was a boy who loved to play with his bucket. He would fill it with sand and water and make big castles. One day, his friend came to play with him. The boy said, "Do you want to play with my bucket?" His friend said, "Yes, please."
They played together for a while, but then the boy had to leave. He said, "I have to go home now. Can I have my bucket back?" His friend said, "No, it's mine now. I like it more than you do." The boy felt sad, but he didn't know what to do.
The next day, the boy saw his friend with his modest bucket. He asked, "Can I have it back now?" His friend said, "No, I'm keeping it forever." The boy felt even sadder. He missed his bucket and his friend.
A few days later, the boy saw his friend with a new bucket. He asked, "What happened to my bucket?" His friend said, "I threw it away. It was old and boring." The boy felt heartbroken. He didn't want to be friends with someone who would take his things and throw them away. He left and never played with his friend again.
