Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to cook with her mom in the kitchen. One day, they were making cookies and Lily accidentally dropped the key to the pantry on the floor. She couldn't find it anywhere!
Lily's mom asked her, "Did you see where the key went?" Lily shook her head no. "It's okay," said her mom. "I have a spare key."
But when they opened the pantry, they found that all the food had spoiled because the refrigerator had broken. "Oh no!" said Lily's mom. "We have to throw everything away and go to the store to buy fresh food."
Lily was sad that they couldn't eat the cookies they had just made, but she was happy to go to the store with her mom and help pick out new ingredients. They went home and cooked a delicious dinner together, and Lily knew to always be careful with the key from then on. The end.
