Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy went to a big store with his mommy. They walked around and saw many things. Timmy saw a toy that he liked and he asked his mommy if he could have it. His mommy said "no" and Timmy was sad. 
Then, Timmy saw a sign that said "toys on sale". He showed it to his mommy and she smiled. They went to the toy section and found the toy that Timmy wanted. It was on sale and his mommy thought it was a good price. 
After they paid for the toy, they walked to the exit. Timmy was happy because he got a new toy and his mommy was happy because it was a good deal. They went home and played with the toy together. The end.
