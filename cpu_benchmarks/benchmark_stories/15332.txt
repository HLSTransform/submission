One day, a big cat was walking in the garden. He wanted to play. He looked around and saw something on the roof. He wanted to explore so he started to crawl up the roof. As he got to the top he saw a big bird. The bird was so surprised to see the cat. The cat was very excited, he wanted to say hello but the bird flew away. The cat felt sad and decided to crawl back down and continue playing in the garden.
