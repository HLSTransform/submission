Anna likes to play with her blue ball. She throws it high in the air and catches it. She bounces it on the ground and kicks it. She rolls it to her dog, Spot, and he chases it.
One day, Anna sees a light in the sky. It is very bright and shiny. She thinks it is a star, but it is not night. She points to the light and asks her mom, "What is that?"
Her mom looks up and smiles. She says, "That is the sun, Anna. It is a big ball of fire that gives us light and warmth. It is very far away, but we can see it every day."
Anna nods. She understands. She says, "The sun is like my blue ball, but bigger and hotter. Can I play with the sun?"
Her mom laughs and shakes her head. She says, "No, Anna, you cannot play with the sun. It is too hot and too high. You can only look at it, but not for too long. It can hurt your eyes. You can play with your blue ball, though. It is just right for you."
Anna nods again. She is happy. She hugs her mom and says, "Thank you, mom. I love you and I love my blue ball. And I like the sun, too. It is pretty and makes me warm."
She runs to Spot and picks up her blue ball. She throws it high in the air and catches it. She bounces it on the ground and kicks it. She rolls it to Spot and he chases it. She plays with her blue ball until the sun goes down and the stars come out. Then she goes inside with her mom and Spot and gets ready for bed. She dreams of the sun and the stars and her blue ball. She is happy.
