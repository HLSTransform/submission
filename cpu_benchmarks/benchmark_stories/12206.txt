Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Tom. Tom was 3 years old, full of energy and loved to play all day long. One day, Tom was playing in his backyard when he noticed a small green frog hopping around. Tom was excited, and he ran up to the frog and asked, “Can I play with you?”
The frog smiled and he said, “Sure, let's play tag!” Tom nodded excitedly and they began to play. Tom chased the frog all around the backyard, but the frog was very fast and Tom could not catch him. After a few minutes, Tom began to get tired and he said, “I can't catch you anymore!”
But the frog said, “Don't give up! I know you can do it. Just be persistent!” Tom thought about the frog's words, and he ran even faster. Suddenly, he felt a hop on his toe and he realized that the frog had jumped onto his foot! Tom cheered and said, “I did it! I caught you!”
The frog smiled and said, “That's because you were so persistent! Great job!” Tom was happy, and he thanked the frog for teaching him an important lesson. From then on, Tom was always persistent and never gave up when he played games!
