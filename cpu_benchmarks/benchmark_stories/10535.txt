It was a warm summer day and Jack was playing outside. He was having a lot fun, playing in his sandbox and balancing rocks. Suddenly, he saw an old newspaper floating by in the wind. He decided he would balance it on a stick.
Jack was getting ready to pick up the newspaper when he saw a cat. It was a very big cat. It meowed at Jack. Jack started to pet the cat and they became friends.
Jack then picked up the newspaper and it was very messy. As he was looking at it, the cat started to play. Jack tried to stop the cat, but the cat was too strong. The newspaper went flying in the air and got all crumpled. 
Jack was very sad. He felt like it was his fault for not keeping a better balance of the newspaper. He slowly picked up the bits and pieces, but it was no use. The newspaper was too far gone. He turned around sadly and went back to his sandbox, with no newspaper and a very messy mess.
