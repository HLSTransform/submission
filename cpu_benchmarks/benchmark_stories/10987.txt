One day, a little girl named Lily went to her friend Tim's house. Lily wanted to borrow Tim's long jump rope. Tim said, "No, I don't want to share my long jump rope today." Lily was sad.
Lily went back home and told her mom about Tim not sharing his long jump rope. Her mom said, "Maybe Tim is having a bad day. Let's try again tomorrow." Lily agreed and felt better.
The next day, Lily went to Tim's house again. This time, Tim said, "Yes, you can borrow my long jump rope." Lily and Tim played with the long jump rope and had lots of fun. They were happy friends again.
