Once there was a little girl who loved to clap. Everywhere she went, her hands were clapping.
One day, she found something special. It was a little mint! She put it in her pocket and kept clapping.
The next day, something bad happened. The little girl saw that her mint had melted! She was so sad.
But then she had a great idea. She clapped her hands and the mint stayed solid again! She was so happy.
The little girl clapped her hands every day to keep her mint solid. And so, her mint stayed with her, forever.
