Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to read magazines. She would sit in her cozy chair and flip through the pages, looking at all the pictures and reading the words. One day, she saw a picture of a busy bee and wondered what it would be like to fly like one.
The next day, Lily went outside to play and saw a bee buzzing around the flowers. She watched it for a while and then went back inside to her magazine. As she turned the pages, she saw an article about a girl who learned how to fly. Lily wondered if she could learn too.
For the rest of the week, Lily practiced flapping her arms like wings and jumping off the couch. She even made a little bee costume out of paper. Finally, on Saturday, she went outside and jumped off the porch. To her surprise, she felt like she was flying! She soared through the air like a busy bee and knew she had accomplished her dream.
