Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint and make pretty pictures. One day, she saw a patch on her wall that was not pretty. She wanted to paint over it to make it pretty like her pictures. 
Lily asked her mommy for help, but her mommy was busy and said, "Not now, Lily. Maybe later." Lily was sad, but she still wanted to paint the patch. She got her paint and brushes ready and started to paint the patch. 
But, the paint was not dry yet and Lily accidentally touched it. The paint got on her pretty dress and she cried. Her mommy came and said, "I told you to wait, Lily. Now your dress is ruined." 
The moral of the story is to always listen to your mommy and wait until you are ready to do something.
