Ben and his mom went to the store. Ben was so excited! When he saw the muffins, he smiled. His mom told him he could pick one. He looked around at all of the colors and shapes. He liked the muffin that was gray the best. He picked it up and said "Mommy, I want this one!" His mom said "OK, let's take it home."
On the way back, Ben held the muffin very carefully in his hands. When he got home he started to eat it. It was so delicious! He was so excited. He kept on eating until it was gone. He licked his fingers and smiled.
When his mom saw him she said "I'm so happy you enjoyed your muffin!" Ben smiled and said "It was so yummy!" His mom smiled right back at him.
