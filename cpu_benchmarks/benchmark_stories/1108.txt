A nosy pink mouse lived near a kitchen. She loved to watch the humans cook. One day she decided that it was time for her to try cooking something.
The mouse went to the cupboards and grabbed some flour. She put it in a big bowl and mixed it together with a spoon. Then she added some water to make it sticky.
Next she cut some butter into tiny pieces and put it in the bowl. She mixed it all together and added some sugar to make it sweet. Once it was all mixed, the mouse put it in a pan and waited for it to cook.
While it was cooking, the mouse smelled something delicious. She knew it was done when it turned a golden brown color. She was so excited about her first creation! She carried it carefully to the table and tried it. It was delicious - the perfect treat for a nosy pink mouse!
