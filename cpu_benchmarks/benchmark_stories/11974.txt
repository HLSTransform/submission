Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside in the sunshine, but she didn't like when it rained. One day, Lily was playing with her toy car when she saw something special in the sky. "Look, Mommy! A rainbow!" she shouted. 
Her mommy smiled and said, "Yes, Lily. Rainbows happen when the sun shines after the rain." 
Lily was so excited to see the rainbow that she wanted to catch it. "I want to touch the rainbow, Mommy!" she said. 
Her mommy laughed and said, "You can't touch a rainbow, silly. It's just a pretty sight to see." 
But Lily was determined, so she ran around the yard and tried to catch the rainbow. She felt foolish when she realized she couldn't catch it, but she still loved looking at it in the sky. From that day on, whenever it rained and the sun came out, Lily would always look for the rainbow.
