Once upon a time, there were two boys named Tom and Matthew. Tom liked to stay up late and play, while Matthew liked to take naps whenever he could. Everyone, including their mom and dad, thought that Tom was really healthy, because he was always full of energy.
One day, Tom learned that Matthew was often taking naps in the middle of the day and was concerned that Matthew was getting too lazy. So, he decided to give him a friendly challenge - they would race to see who was faster!
Tom ran as fast as he could, while Matthew took his nap. When the race was finished, Tom proudly declared himself the winner, but he came to find out that the only reason he won was because Matthew was completely rested, energized and healthy thanks to his naps! 
The moral of this story is to understand the importance of taking care of our bodies. Getting enough rest and naps is one of the most important parts of staying healthy and having enough energy to do all of the things you enjoy. So if someone is telling you to hurry, just remember that sometimes a tie is much better than a win!
