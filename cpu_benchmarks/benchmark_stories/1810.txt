Once upon a time, there was a deaf boy called Tom. Tom liked to go for walks. One day, Tom asked his Mommy if he could go for a visit. His Mommy said “Yes, you can go for a visit. But make sure you’re home before dinner.” So Tom put on his shoes to go for a walk.
On his walk, Tom met a deaf girl called Sue. Sue said to Tom, “Hi! What are you doing?” Tom smiled and said, “I’m going for a visit. Would you like to come too?” Sue nodded, so Tom and Sue went for a walk together. 
They went to a park and looked at the birds. They watched the squirrels and played on the swings. Tom and Sue laughed and had a lot of fun together. 
Finally, it was time for Tom to go home. He said goodbye to Sue and thanked her for coming with him on his visit. Then Tom waved goodbye, and went for a walk back home.
