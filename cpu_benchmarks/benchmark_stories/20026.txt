Lila and Ben were playing with paper. They liked to cut and fold and glue it. They made hats and boats and flowers. Lila had a big idea. She said, "Let's make a paper spinner!"
Ben asked, "What is a paper spinner?"
Lila said, "It is a paper that spins when you blow on it. It is fun and pretty. I will show you how to make it."
Lila took a square paper and cut it from the corners to the middle, but not all the way. She folded every other point to the center and glued them. She made a hole in the middle and put a straw through it. She gave it to Ben and said, "Here is your paper spinner. Now blow on it and see what happens."
Ben blew on the paper spinner and it spun fast and bright. He liked it very much. He said, "Wow, this is a charming paper spinner. Thank you, Lila. You are very clever."
Lila smiled and said, "You are welcome, Ben. Let's make more paper spinners. We can use different colors and shapes. We can spin them together and make a rainbow."
They made more paper spinners and spun them in the air. They laughed and clapped and had a lot of fun. They liked playing with paper.
