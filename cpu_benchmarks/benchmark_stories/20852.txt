It was a sunny day and McQueen was getting ready to go to his class. He was so excited; he hadn't seen his friends in a long time. His family had been driving for a long time in their car.
When they got to school, McQueen went to his first class. He had a lot of fun playing with his friends, but then the teacher told them it was time to clean up. Everyone got to work, but when McQueen started to clean up he knocked over a chair.
The teacher was very mad, but McQueen said, "I'm sorry, please forgive me!"
The teacher smiled, and said, "I'm glad that you asked, McQueen. Yes, I forgive you. Now lets all get back to cleaning."
The class was so relieved that the teacher forgave McQueen, and everyone finished cleaning in no time. The teacher took the class outside to play, and McQueen and his friends had a high time!
