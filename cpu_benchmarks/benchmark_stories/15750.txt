Once upon a time in a far-off land, there lived a brave boy named George. He waved goodbye to his mum and dad, and set off on an amazing adventure. 
He travelled to the snowy woods and there he saw a reindeer. Its big eyes peered at George, and it looked so gentle. George said "hello" with a smile and was very happy.
But then it started to snow and the snow was cold and dry. George saw the reindeer's coat shivering and he felt sorry. He saw a tree and he ran to it. He found some strong sticks and he built a shelter.
The reindeer looked relieved and George was too. But as they walked out of the woods, a wolf jumped out from behind some bushes. It was noisy and had its teeth bared. It wanted to strike the reindeer!
George held out his stick and yelled "no!" The wolf backed away in fear. George wanted to protect the reindeer, so he stood bravely and spoke. "Go away now and don't come back. This reindeer belongs to me and I won't let anyone hurt it." 
The wolf scurried away and the reindeer was safe. George and the reindeer hugged and he said "We did it!" George's amazing adventure had ended and he was very proud.
