Mrs. Lee had two children, Tom and Jane. Tom was three years old and Jane was five. One day, Mrs. Lee took them to the store. She asked Tom what he wanted. He said he wanted the colorful toy. It was in the shape of a car. Mrs. Lee smiled and paid for the toy. 
Tom took the toy home and was so excited. But when he tried to play with it, he was uncomfortable. The toy was too big. Jane told him to color it. So Tom colored the car with bright colors - yellow, red, blue, and green. 
He was happy with his toy, and it felt much more comfortable. Tom and Jane played with the toy the whole afternoon, until it was time to go home. Tom thanked his mom for paying for his toy. They all had a wonderful day.
