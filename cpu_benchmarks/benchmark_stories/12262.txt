Once upon a time, there was a wise cat named Tom. Tom liked to take long naps in the sunshine. But one day the sun shone brighter, and the heat increased. Tom decided to take a bath in the pond.
But Tom was too clever for the pond. He thought of a better solution. He went to the kitchen and asked his friend, the mouse, “Have you seen the shampoo?”
The mouse replied, “Yes, I saw it in the cupboard.”
Tom grabbed the shampoo and went back to the pond. He quickly found a big leaf and filled it with shampoo. He rubbed the leaf between his paws and lathered himself up with the shampoo.
Tom enjoyed his bath and felt so much better. The wise cat knew he was saved from the heat. He never again wanted to increase his temperature in the scorching sun.
