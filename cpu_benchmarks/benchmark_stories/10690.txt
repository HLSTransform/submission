Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved animals and had a pink stuffed bunny that she carried everywhere with her. One day, Lily went to the park and saw a baby duckling. 
"Hello little duckling," said Lily. "What's your name?"
"I don't have a name yet," said the duckling. "I'm still growing."
Lily was very excited. She wanted to take care of the duckling and watch it grow. She asked her mom if she could keep the duckling as a pet.
"No, sweetie," said her mom. "Ducklings are animals that belong in the wild. They need to grow up with their families."
Lily was sad, but she understood. She said goodbye to the duckling and promised to come back and visit. As she walked away, she hugged her pink bunny and thought about how much she loved all animals, big and small.
