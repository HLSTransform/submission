Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jane. Jane was pushing a big round case up the hill. She was very tired and her arms were getting sore.
Suddenly, the case started rolling down the hill and Jane followed after it.
"Oh no! That's my case!," Jane shouted. But it didn't matter since the case kept rolling farther and farther away.
Then, a nice man came running up to Jane. He carefully stopped the case and then looked at her with a smile.
"Are you alright?" he asked.
"Yes, I'm ok," answered Jane, feeling a bit embarrassed.
The man gently picked up the case and handed it to Jane.
"Here you go. Sorry the case got away," he said.
"Thanks," said Jane. "I'm sorry it caused trouble."
The man smiled again, and Jane smiled back. She was very grateful that he had helped her out.
Together, they rolled the case up the hill as Jane finished her adventure. The end.
