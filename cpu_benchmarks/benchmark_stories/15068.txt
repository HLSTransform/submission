Tommy was a little kid. He was always excited and making lots of noise. He was playing in the park when he heard a loud voice. He looked around and saw a lady standing nearby. She saw Tommy and smiled at him. 
"I'm offering a free ice-cream, kiddo!" she said loudly. 
Tommy looked at her in amazement. He could hardly believe it. He eagerly accepted the offer and ran to get his ice-cream from the lady. When he returned, he thanked her and bit into the ice-cream with a big smile on his face. 
The lady was happy to see the joy in Tommy's face. She waved him goodbye and went on her way. Tommy went back to playing, with a big smile on his face and a delicious ice-cream in his hands.
