Once there was a little bunny who was upset because her mother was away. She was alone and had no one to comfort her except for a lump of coal in her pocket.
The little bunny sniffled, feeling very sad and alone. She held onto the coal, trying to take comfort in its warmth.
Every time the bunny felt upset, she would touch the coal and feel better. One day, she decided to take the coal and go on an adventure.
As she hopped through the forest, she found a cave where she stopped for a rest. To her surprise, the coal began to glow and she felt more comforted than ever.
The little bunny smiled, realizing that the coal was a special friend who was always there to comfort her no matter how upset she felt. From then on, she never felt alone as long as she had the coal in her pocket.
