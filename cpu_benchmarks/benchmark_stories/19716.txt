Max was out for a visit with his mom and dad. Max liked to visit different places, like the park and the beach.
Max and his family decided to visit the post office. Max liked the post office because it was always so neat and tidy. Inside the post office Max saw all the letters and packages ready to be sent out. But there was something very special hidden in the back of the post office.
Max saw a beautiful book filled with pictures and words. The post office worker handed the book to Max and he opened it. Max smiled when he saw all the colorful pictures. He knew that he just discovered a very special book. Max thanked the post office worker and brought the book home. 
When he arrived home, Max showed his mom and dad the book. They were so proud of Max and all the new things he discovered while they were out visiting.
