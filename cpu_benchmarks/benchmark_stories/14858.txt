Once upon a time, there was a big fountain in a park. It was very pretty and made a lot of noise. One day, a little girl came to the park to play. She saw the big fountain and wanted to set her toy boat in it. But her mom said no and told her to be careful.
The little girl was sad, but she listened to her mom. However, a naughty boy came and set his toy boat in the fountain. The water was too strong and the boat went away. The boy cried and his mom was angry. The little girl felt sorry for him, but she knew it was not a good idea to play with the fountain.
