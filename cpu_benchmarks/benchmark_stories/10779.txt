One day, a little girl named Sue went to the park with her mom. They saw a beautiful bird in a tree. Sue liked to observe the bird. The bird had a red body and a blue tail. Sue was very happy to see the bird.
Sue's mom told her to listen with her ear. Sue put her hand on her ear and listened. The bird sang a pretty song. Sue and her mom danced to the song. They laughed and had a fun time.
Soon, it was time to go home. Sue waved goodbye to the beautiful bird. She knew she would come back to the park again. Sue wanted to observe the bird and hear its song with her ear. She could not wait for the next visit.
