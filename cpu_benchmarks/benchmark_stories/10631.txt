Once upon a time there was a gifted stack of little blocks. The stack was made up of different shapes and colors, and the little blocks could do amazing things. 
One day, a curious 3 year old crept over to the stack, and decided to poke it gently. But to her surprise, the stack started to move! It quivered and shifted, growing before her eyes.
The little girl was too scared to move, and watched in amazement as the stack rearranged itself into a beautiful tower. When the tower was complete, the little girl clapped her hands in delight, and then carefully hugged the stack. 
The gifted stack was so happy to have made the little girl happy, it rewarded her with a special gift - a bright and shiny ball of twine. 
The little girl thanked her new friend for the wonderful gift and took the twine off to play, leaving the stack of blocks peacefully in the room.
