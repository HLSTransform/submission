Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat cheese, but he was afraid to go into the kitchen. One day, Timmy's friend Sammy the squirrel came to visit. 
Sammy asked, "Why are you scared to go into the kitchen?" 
Timmy replied, "I am scared of the oven. It's too hot and delicate for me." 
Sammy said, "Don't be afraid, I dare you to come with me and we can get some cheese together." 
Timmy was scared, but he didn't want to look like a scaredy-cat in front of his friend. So, he followed Sammy into the kitchen. They found a big piece of cheese on the counter, but it was too high for them to reach. 
Timmy said, "I wish we could get that cheese." 
Sammy replied, "Don't worry, I have an idea." Sammy climbed up the oven and jumped onto the counter. He grabbed the cheese and threw it down to Timmy. 
Timmy was so happy and thanked Sammy for being so brave. From that day on, Timmy was no longer scared of the kitchen and he and Sammy had many more adventures together.
