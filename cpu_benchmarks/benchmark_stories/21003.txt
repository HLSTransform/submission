One day, a boy named Jack went for a jog. He ran as fast as he could, and felt the warm sun on his back. 
When he arrived at the park, he saw a strange pitch. It was covered in green grass and had a big fence around the edge. It looked very expensive.
Jack stood and watched the pitch. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise, and he looked up. Someone was playing with a ball, hitting it against the fence.
Jack jumped over the fence and started to play too. He ran around and chased the ball. He laughed and smiled as he jogged around the pitch. He had so much fun. When he got tired, he went home with a big smile on his face.
