Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lori. She loved to play, especially with her best friend Lucy. One day, Lori and Lucy went to their tutors house. He was very generous and kind and always made them feel welcome.
When they arrived, the tutor gave them a big hug. Lori and Lucy were so happy that they hugged eachother. The huge made them laugh so hard. The laughter was so loud it filled the room!
The tutor said, ''You two are so fun. Let's play a game!'' 
They had a great time playing with their tutor and ended their day with a final hug. Lori and Lucy were so thankful to have such a generous tutor and always looked forward to their visits together.
