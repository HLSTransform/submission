Mia and Sam were twins who liked to play in the garden. They had a big peach tree that gave them sweet and juicy peaches in the summer. But today, the sky was gloomy and the wind was cold. They could not go outside and have fun.
"I'm bored," Mia said, leaning on the window and looking at the peach tree. "I wish we could pick some peaches and eat them."
"Me too," Sam said, leaning on the other window and making faces. "But Mom said we have to stay inside until the rain stops."
They heard a knock on the door. It was their friend Leo, who lived next door. He had a big smile and a basket in his hand.
"Hi, Mia and Sam," Leo said. "I have a surprise for you. Do you want to see?"
"Yes, please," Mia and Sam said, running to the door.
Leo opened the basket and showed them what was inside. It was full of peaches!
"Wow, Leo, where did you get these?" Mia asked, picking up a peach and smelling it.
"My grandpa has a peach farm. He gave me some to share with you. He said peaches are good for gloomy days. They make you happy and healthy," Leo said, handing them each a peach.
"Thank you, Leo. You are very kind," Sam said, biting into his peach and smiling.
The three friends sat on the floor and ate their peaches. They talked and laughed and forgot about the gloomy sky. They felt warm and cozy and happy. They decided that peaches were their favorite fruit.
