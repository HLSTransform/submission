Sara and Ben like to play dress up. They have many costumes in a big box. One day, they find a new costume. It is a skeleton costume. It is black and white and has bones on it.
Sara wants to try it on. She puts it over her clothes and zips it up. She looks in the mirror and laughs. She looks scary and funny. She says, "Boo! I am a skeleton!"
Ben wants to try it on too. He takes it from Sara and puts it on. He zips it up and runs around the room. He says, "Boo! I am a skeleton too!"
They play skeleton for a while. They pretend to scare each other and make silly noises. They have fun.
Then, they hear a sound. It is mom. She is calling them for snack time. They run to the kitchen. They see mom has made lemonade and cookies for them. They are happy.
They take off the skeleton costume and put it back in the box. They wash their hands and sit at the table. They drink the lemonade and eat the cookies. The lemonade is sour. They make faces and say, "Ew! Sour!"
Mom smiles and says, "That's what you get for being skeletons. Sour lemonade!"
Sara and Ben laugh. They say, "We are not skeletons. We are kids!"
They hug mom and thank her for the snack. They are not scared of the skeleton costume. They think it is fun. They want to play dress up again.
