Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Teddy. Teddy was very restless and could not fall asleep. He went outside to look for something to help him sleep. As he was walking, he saw a leaf on the ground. He picked it up and hugged it tightly. The leaf was soft and made him feel better. He went back to his bed and fell asleep with the leaf still in his arms. From that day on, Teddy hugged a leaf every night and slept peacefully.
