Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, while playing with his favorite toy car, it suddenly vanished! Timmy looked all around his room but couldn't find it anywhere. He felt sad and confused.
Just then, his mom came in and asked what was wrong. Timmy told her about his missing toy car. His mom looked around and found it under the bed. Timmy was so happy that his toy car wasn't gone forever!
Timmy's mom noticed that he was holding his arm and asked if it hurt. Timmy nodded and said it felt sore. His mom gave him a hug and a kiss and said she would make it feel better.
Timmy's dad came home from work and they all sat down for dinner. Timmy's grandpa joined them too. Timmy's grandpa was deaf, which meant he couldn't hear very well. They all had a great time together and Timmy forgot all about his missing toy car and sore arm.
