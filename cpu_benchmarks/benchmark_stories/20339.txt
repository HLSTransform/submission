Lily liked to observe things. She liked to look at the sky, the trees, the birds, and the bugs. She liked to ask questions and learn new things. She had many opinions about what she saw.
One day, she went to the park with her mom and dad. She saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She observed how other kids went up the stairs and slid down. It looked easy and fun. She told her mom and dad her opinion. She said, "I want to slide too!"
Her mom and dad smiled and said, "Okay, Lily, you can slide. But be careful and hold on tight." They helped her climb the stairs and sit on the slide. Lily felt excited and nervous. She observed how fast the slide was and how high she was. She said, "Wow, this is so cool!"
She let go of the slide and zoomed down. She felt the wind in her hair and the sun on her face. She laughed and screamed. She observed how happy she was and how proud her mom and dad were. She said, "That was easy and fun! I did it!"
She ran to her mom and dad and hugged them. They hugged her back and said, "Good job, Lily! You are very brave and smart. We are proud of you." Lily felt warm and loved. She observed how nice her mom and dad were and how much they loved her. She said, "I love you too, mom and dad. You are the best!"
