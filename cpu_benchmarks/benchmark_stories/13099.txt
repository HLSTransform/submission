One day, Timmy went to the park with his mom and dad. He saw something that made him smile - a train! He was so excited and he said to his mom and dad, "Look, a train!" His mom and dad smiled and told him that the train was normal.
Then Timmy ran over to the train. He couldn't believe it - it was very big! He wanted to get on the train and explore, but his mom and dad told him, "No, Timmy, it's not safe. You can't get on the train." 
Timmy was sad. He really wanted to get on the train, but he knew what his mom and dad said was right. He said, "Ok", and he started to walk away from the train.
But then, his mom and dad said, "Wait, here's a surprise for you Timmy!" They handed him a ticket to ride the train - it was a special treat! Timmy was so excited and he said, "Thank you!" 
The train ride was so much fun. Every time it went around the track, Timmy cheered. He laughed and smiled, and the other passengers were happy to see him having so much fun.
When the train ride was over, Timmy and his family got off the train and went home. He was so glad he got to ride the train and it felt so normal.
