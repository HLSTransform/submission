Once upon a time, there was a penguin. He had a big task to do, but he was feeling very nervous. He had to pass something very important to another penguin.
The nervous penguin walked slowly and carefully. He wanted to make sure he did not trip or drop the item. He was almost at the other penguin when suddenly he heard a loud noise. He was so scared that he dropped the thing and it fell all the way down to the bottom of a deep hole!
The nervous penguin was so sad and he felt like he had failed his task. He sat down and started to cry, but then he had an idea. He waddled over to the edge of the hole and stretched his neck as far as he could. He was able to reach the thing, and he carefully passed it up to the other penguin.
The other penguin was so pleased. He thanked the nervous penguin and they both hugged. Everything was alright in the end.
