Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved ice-cream. He would eat it every day if he could. One day, Timmy went to the park to play. He saw an ice-cream truck and ran to catch it. When he got there, he saw an ugly monster driving the truck. Timmy was scared and ran away. But then he remembered the ice-cream and went back to catch it. The monster gave him a big, delicious ice-cream cone and Timmy was happy. The end.
