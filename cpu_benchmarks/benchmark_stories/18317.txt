Timmy and his friends were so excited to see the balloon. They watched as it floated through the sky. Suddenly, the balloon started to sway back and forth. It looked like the person controlling the balloon was being clumsy. Timmy and his friends were worried that the balloon might crash! 
Luckily, the person controlling the balloon was able to fix their mistake and the balloon continued on its way. Timmy and his friends were so happy to see the balloon and they couldn't wait to tell their parents about the exciting event they saw in the sky.
