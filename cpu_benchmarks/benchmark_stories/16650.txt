Once upon a time, there was a youth named Timmy. He loved to play outside with his friends. One day, they went to the park to play. Timmy saw a bird in the sky and pointed to it. His friend, Johnny, said, "Wow, you have a hard finger!"
As they played, they saw a big dog coming towards them. Timmy was scared and ran away. But his friend Johnny said, "Don't worry, I know this dog. He's friendly!" And sure enough, the dog came over and licked their faces. Timmy was happy and grateful to have a friend like Johnny who knew what to do. From then on, Timmy learned to never be afraid and always trust his friends.
