Sara liked to draw with her pencil. She drew cats and dogs and flowers and stars. She had many colors of pencils in her box. She liked to share her pencils with her friends.
One day, she went to the park with her mom and her brother. She brought her box of pencils and some paper. She saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She asked her mom, "Can I go on the slide, please?"
Her mom said, "Yes, you can, but be careful. And don't forget your pencils and paper. They might get lost or dirty."
Sara nodded and ran to the slide. She climbed up the ladder and looked down. The slide was very high and long. She felt scared. She wanted to go back down, but there were other kids behind her. They said, "Hurry up, Sara. It's our turn."
Sara closed her eyes and slid down. She screamed as she went faster and faster. She landed on the sand and felt dizzy. She opened her eyes and saw her brother. He was holding her box of pencils and paper. He said, "Are you okay, Sara? That was a scary slide. You were very brave."
Sara smiled and hugged her brother. She said, "Thank you, brother. You are very kind. Can I have my pencils and paper, please?"
Her brother said, "Sure, here you go. Do you want to draw with me?"
Sara said, "Yes, I do. Let's draw the slide and how we felt. Maybe next time, I won't be so scared."
They sat on a bench and drew with their pencils. They had fun and forgot about the scary slide. Their mom came and praised their drawings. She said, "You are very good at drawing, Sara and brother. I'm proud of you both."
