Once upon a time, there was a pen. The pen was quiet and it liked to be polished. Every day, a little girl would take the pen and give it a nice polish. Even though the pen was quiet, it was happy and shiny.
The girl was so proud of her pen. She looked at it and smiled. She showed the pen to everyone she met. The pen shone brightly in the sun.
The little girl loved her quiet pen so much. She held it tightly in her hand and gave it extra special polish. Her heart was filled with gladness.
Suddenly, one day the little girl heard a strange sound. It was coming from her quiet pen! She put her ear close to the pen and listened carefully. What she heard was amazing - the pen was singing!
The little girl was so excited and the pen kept singing its happy song. From then on, the little girl never forgot to give her pen a special polish!
