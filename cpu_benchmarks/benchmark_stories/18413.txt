Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited because tomorrow was her exam day. She had been studying very hard for a long time and felt ready. But when she woke up in the morning, she didn't feel well. She had a fever and her head hurt. Her mom took her to the doctor who said she couldn't take the exam that day. Lily was sad and started to cry.
Her mom said, "Don't worry, Lily. You can take the exam another day when you feel better." Lily felt a little better when her mom said that. She went back home and slept all day. The next day, she felt much better and told her mom she was ready to take the exam. Her mom was happy to hear that and took her to the exam room. Lily took the exam and did very well. She was so happy she said, "I did it!"
