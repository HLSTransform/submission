Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. She saw her friend, Timmy, playing with a toy car. Lily asked, "Can I borrow your toy car, Timmy?"
Timmy said, "Sure, you can borrow it for a little while." So, Lily played with the toy car for a bit. Suddenly, she felt dizzy and couldn't see very well. She looked around and saw a mist in the air. 
Lily called out to Timmy, "Timmy, can you see the mist too? It's making me dizzy." Timmy looked around and said, "Yes, I see it too. Let's go home before it gets worse." 
So, Lily and Timmy went home and returned the toy car. Lily's mom asked her why she looked dizzy. Lily said, "I saw a mist in the park and it made me dizzy." Her mom smiled and said, "It's good that you came home. Mist can make you feel dizzy sometimes."
