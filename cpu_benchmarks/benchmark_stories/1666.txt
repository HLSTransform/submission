Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a smart dog named Max. Max was very clever and knew many tricks. One day, Lily and Max went for a walk in the park. They saw a big, dark cloud in the sky. Lily said, "Look, Max! The sky is dark." Max barked and wagged his tail. Suddenly, it started to rain. Lily and Max ran under a tree to stay dry. They waited until the rain stopped and then went back home. From that day on, Lily always remembered to bring an umbrella when she went for a walk with Max.
