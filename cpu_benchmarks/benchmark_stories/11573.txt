Once upon a time, there was a big wild forest. In the forest, there was a small house. In the house, there was a boy named Tim and his mom. Tim loved to play with his toy machine. One day, Tim's mom told him not to go too far into the wild forest.
Tim was playing near the forest with his toy machine. He saw a big tree and wanted to climb it. He put his toy machine down and started to climb. When he was up high, he saw a big bird. The big bird said, "Hi Tim! I see your toy machine. It looks fun. Can I play with it?" Tim said, "Yes, but be careful. My mom told me not to go too far into the wild forest."
The big bird took the toy machine and flew away. Tim was sad. He climbed down the tree and ran to his mom. He told her what happened. His mom said, "I told you not to go too far into the wild forest. Now, we must find the big bird and get your toy machine back."
Tim and his mom went into the wild forest. They saw the big bird and Tim pointed at it. The big bird saw them and said, "I'm sorry, Tim. I should have listened to you. Here is your toy machine." Tim was happy to have his toy machine back. He learned to listen to his mom and not go too far into the wild forest.
The moral of the story is to always listen to your parents and be careful when playing near wild places.
