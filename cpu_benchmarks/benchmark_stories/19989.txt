Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a big bucket and a small shovel. They want to make a sand castle.
They find a good spot near the slide. They start to dig and fill the bucket with sand. They are happy and excited.
But then, a big boy comes. He is mean and rude. He says the sand is his. He tries to take the bucket from Tom and Mia. He pushes them and makes them fall.
Tom and Mia are sad and angry. They do not want to give the bucket to the big boy. They think he is crazy and bad. They shout and cry for help.
A lady hears them. She is the big boy's mom. She comes and sees what is happening. She scolds the big boy and makes him say sorry to Tom and Mia. She gives them back the bucket and the shovel. She tells the big boy to share and be nice.
Tom and Mia are glad and thankful. They hug the lady and smile. They go back to their spot and finish their sand castle. They are proud and happy. They invite the big boy to play with them. He says yes and joins them. They become friends and have fun.
