Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a neighbor named Timmy. Timmy was always doing naughty things like throwing rocks at birds and breaking windows with his ball. One day, Lily decided to play a game of hide and seek with Timmy. 
While Timmy was counting, Lily found a good hiding spot. She waited and waited until Timmy finally found her. When he did, he revealed that he had a surprise for her. It was a beautiful flower he had picked from his garden. 
Lily was so happy and surprised that Timmy could be so nice. From that day on, they became good friends and Timmy stopped doing naughty things. They played together every day and had lots of fun.
