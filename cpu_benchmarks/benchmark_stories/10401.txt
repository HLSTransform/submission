Once upon a time, there was an ant that was very weak. It was struggling to carry a leaf back to its nest. Suddenly it heard a voice. 
"Do not worry, little ant," said the voice. The ant looked up to see an eagle nearby. 
"I can help you," said the eagle.
The eagle delicately picked up the ant and the leaf and flew high into the sky. 
"Now I will drop you very gently," said the eagle. 
The ant was afraid but the eagle repeated, "Don't worry, you will be safe". 
The ant closed its eyes and the eagle carefully dropped it onto the ground. 
The ant was very relieved to be back on the ground with the leaf. 
"Thank you very much," said the ant.
"You're welcome, little one!" said the eagle as it flew away. 
The ant repeated the eagle's words and vowed to always remember how kind it had been.
