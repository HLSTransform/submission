Once upon a time there was a king who lived in a big castle. Everywhere he went, people always bowed and said how great he was.
But the king was not happy. He was sad and frustrated. He thought and thought, but he couldn't figure out how to make himself feel better.
One day, a little bird flew up to the king's window and said, "King! I have an idea! What if you invite your friends over and have an exciting play-day together?"
The king thought it was a great idea. So he invited his friends over to the castle and they had a great time playing together. They all laughed and smiled.
The king was so happy that he hugged the little bird. "Thank you!" he said.
From then on, the king always invited his friends over for a play-day and he never felt frustrated again.
