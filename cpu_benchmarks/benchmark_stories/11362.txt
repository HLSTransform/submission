Once upon a time, there were two best friends. Their names were Maisy and Muriel. One day they were walking in the forest and they saw something rare. It was a special figure, and it fit perfectly in Maisy's hand.
Maisy said: "This is so special. I want to keep it!"
Muriel agreed. "It's so rare, I want it too!"
Maisy thought for a moment and then said: "Let's share it. We can both have it and play with it together".
Muriel smiled, and they decided to take the figure with them. They both had lots of fun together playing with the special figure. They kept it safe, and it was a reminder of their special friendship.
