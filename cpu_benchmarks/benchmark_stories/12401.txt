Once there was a lonely girl named Jane. She wanted to play, but she didn't have anyone to play with. So she decided to have an adventure. 
She started by exploring her garden. She saw many funny shapes and colors. One of the funniest shapes she noticed was a round, yellow flower. She decided to take it and make it her own. 
Then she saw a butterfly flying nearby. She asked it, "Would you like to play with me?" 
The butterfly said, "Yes, I would love to!" 
They started playing a game. Jane took the flower and made funny shapes with it. They laughed and laughed until they were both exhausted. 
At the end of their adventure, Jane and the butterfly said goodbye and waved to each other. Jane was so happy to have found a new friend.
