Once upon a time there was a little girl called Anna. She was three years old and liked to play and explore the world. One day, Anna was in her living room searching for something to do. Suddenly, she saw two huge boxes on the floor - one full of toys and the other full of cartoon movies. 
Anna was very excited and asked her mum, "Can I choose one?" Her mum smiled and said, "Of course! But remember, make sure you are making the right choice". She then asked Anna what she thought would be a good decision. 
Anna considered it carefully. She thought the cartoon movies were more fun, but the toys were lovely too. Then, she said to her mum, "I think I will choose the toys." 
Her mum smiled and said, "That's a great choice! Making good decisions is very important and will help you along life's journey."
Anna nodded and hugged her mum. She was so happy with her choice. From then on, Anna learned to always make good decisions, and she realised that the most rewarding choices in life are usually the ones made with a lot of thought and love.
