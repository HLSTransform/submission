One day, a little bunny named Tim went for a hop. He hopped and hopped in the sun. While hopping, he saw a lady. The lady was wearing a big, silly hat. The hat had many colors and a big red bow.
Tim hopped to the lady and said, "Hello, lady! I like your silly hat!" The lady smiled and said, "Thank you, little bunny! I like your hop!"
Together, they hopped and laughed. They played in the sun all day. The lady with the silly hat and little bunny Tim were very happy.
