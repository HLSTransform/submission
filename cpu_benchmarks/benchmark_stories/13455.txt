Once upon a time, a little girl named Emily lived in a small town. One day, Emily's mom took her to the farm to feed the animals. Emily loved feeding the cows and chickens. She gave them corn and hay.
Suddenly, a big tornado came and blew everything away. Emily and her mom were scared. They ran to the barn and hid. It was dark and loud. Emily was crying.
After a while, the tornado stopped. Emily and her mom went outside and saw that everything was gone. The barn was gone, the animals were gone, and even the trees were gone. Emily's mom hugged her and said, "Don't worry, we'll rebuild everything, and it won't be bitter anymore."
Emily smiled and said, "Can we feed the animals again?" Her mom smiled back and said, "Yes, we will feed the animals again, and we will make sure they are safe from the tornado."
