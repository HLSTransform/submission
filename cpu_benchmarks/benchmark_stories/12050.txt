Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go outside and play with her toys. One day, she went to the park with her mom. They sat on a bench and Lily saw a bird in the sky. She gazed at the bird and it flew away.
Lily's mom gave her a piece of paper and a crayon. Lily drew a picture of the bird she saw. She made a mark on the paper with the crayon and showed it to her mom. Her mom said it was a very good picture.
Lily felt happy and proud. She thought her picture was modest but her mom told her it was amazing. From that day on, Lily loved to draw pictures of the things she saw when she gazed at the sky. The end.
