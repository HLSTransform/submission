Once upon a time, there was a little frog. The frog lived in a big pond with lots of other frogs. One day, the little frog went to the pond to swim and play. But when he got there, he saw a big bird in the sky. The little frog was frightened and didn't know what to do. 
Suddenly, the bird swooped down and tried to catch the little frog. But the little frog was quick and jumped out of the way. The bird flew away, and the little frog was safe. 
The little frog was so happy that he wanted to tell all his friends. He decided to print a message on a big leaf and leave it by the pond. The message said, "Watch out for the big bird! Stay safe, my friends!" All the other frogs saw the message and were grateful to the little frog for warning them. From that day on, they all kept a lookout for the big bird and stayed safe.
