Once there was a march. It was a funny march because all the people in it had funny hats on. They set up their march early in the morning so they could make lots of noise. All the people were happy and they were singing and shouting. 
They marched all the way to the park. When they got there the park was full of other people. Everyone was enjoying the march and smiling. The funny hats on the people made them laugh and smile.
At the end of the march, everyone clapped and cheered. It was such a fun march! Everyone was so happy that they decided to set up the march again. Every few weeks they would dress up in their funny hats and march around the park. 
So they did, and it became a regular thing. Every time they marched, more and more people joined in to have fun. It was a great time for everyone.

The end!
