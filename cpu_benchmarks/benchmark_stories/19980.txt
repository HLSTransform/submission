Lily and Ben are twins. They are three years old. They like to play with their toys and their dog, Spot. Today is a special day. It is their birthday. They are very happy.
Mom and Dad make a cake for them. It is a big cake with green frosting and candles. They put the cake on the table and sing a song. Lily and Ben blow out the candles and make a wish. They wish for more toys and more fun.
Mom and Dad give them presents. They open them and see what is inside. Lily gets a doll and a dress. Ben gets a truck and a hat. They hug Mom and Dad and say thank you. They also get a card from Grandma and Grandpa. It has money in it. They can buy more toys with it.
They play with their new toys and share with Spot. They have a lot of fun. Then they hear a knock on the door. It is their friends from next door. They come to celebrate with them. They bring a gift for them. It is a big box. They open it and see what is inside. It is coal. Black and dirty coal.
Lily and Ben are confused. Why do they get coal? They are not naughty. They are nice. They look at their friends. Their friends are laughing. They say it is a joke. They have another gift for them. It is a game and a book. They say they are sorry for the joke. They say they like them and want to play with them.
Lily and Ben are not angry. They are happy. They say it is okay. They say they like them too and want to play with them. They put the coal away and take out the game and the book. They play with their friends and Spot. They have a lot of fun. They eat cake and drink juice. They celebrate their birthday. They are very happy.
