Once upon a time there was a wide valley with lots of trees in it. In the centre of the valley was a friendly river that sparkled in the sun.
One day, a fluffy rabbit hopped down to the river and found a bright, red prune. He picked up the prune and reminded himself to come back for it later.
The next day, the rabbit hopped back to the river and was pleasantly reminded of the prune. He quickly picked it up and hopped away to eat it.
The rabbit kept going back to the river each day and would always remind himself to pick up the prune. He became friends with the river, and they both enjoyed the sunshine each day. 
The end.
