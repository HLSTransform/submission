Once upon a time there was a cheerful fish, swimming in the sea. The fish noticed a drop of oil in the water. It swam over to take a closer look. 
"That looks nice!" said the fish. 
Just then a dolphin appeared out of the depths. "What a beautiful oil you've found," said the dolphin. 
The fish smiled. "Would you like some?" it asked. 
The dolphin was so pleased. "Yes, please!" it said. 
The fish scooped up some of the oil and gently swam it over to the dolphin. "Here you go!" it said. 
The dolphin thanked the fish and twirled around in the oil until it was nice and shiny. 
The fish was so happy to see the dolphin looking and feeling so nice. After that day the fish and the dolphin became the best of friends and would often swim together through the sea, making each other cheerful.
