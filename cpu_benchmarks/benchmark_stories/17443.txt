Lily and Tom went to the beach with Mom and Dad. They liked to play in the sand and splash in the water. They saw many things at the beach: shells, crabs, birds, and boats.
"Look, Mom, a big boat!" Tom said, pointing at the sea. "Can we go on it?"
Mom shook her head. "No, Tom, that boat is not for us. It is for other people. We can admire it from here."
Lily and Tom nodded. They admired the big boat. It was white and shiny and had many windows. They wondered what was inside.
A man came out of the boat. He wore a hat and a suit. He looked at Lily and Tom and frowned.
"Hey, you kids, get away from my boat!" he shouted. "You are making it dirty with your sand and water. Go play somewhere else. This is my beach!"
Lily and Tom were scared and sad. They did not make the boat dirty. They did not know the man. He was very rude.
"Who are you?" Mom asked. "Why are you yelling at my children? This is a public beach. Everyone can enjoy it."
The man snorted. "I don't care. I own this boat and this part of the beach. I paid a lot of money for it. You are trespassing. Go away or I will call the police."
Mom and Dad were angry and shocked. They did not believe the man. They did not want to leave. They wanted to stay and have fun.
But the man did not listen. He took out his phone and called the police. He said that Lily and Tom and Mom and Dad were bothering him and his boat. He said that they were bad people.
Soon, the police came. They talked to the man and to Mom and Dad. They looked at the boat and the beach. They said that the man was lying. He did not own the boat or the beach. He was renting them. He had no right to chase away Lily and Tom and Mom and Dad. He had to apologize and share.
But the man did not apologize. He did not share. He was stubborn and mean. He said that he did not care what the police said. He said that he would sue them and make them pay.
The police were tired and annoyed. They said that the man had to leave. They said that he had broken the law. They said that he had to go to jail.
The man was scared and angry. He did not want to go to jail. He tried to run away. But the police caught him. They put him in their car and drove away.
Lily and Tom and Mom and Dad watched the man go. They felt sorry for him. He had a big boat and a lot of money. But he had no friends and no fun. He was lonely and unhappy.
They decided to forget about the man and his boat. They went back to the sand and the water. They played and laughed and enjoyed the beach. They were happy and grateful. They had each other and the sun and the sea. They had everything they needed.
