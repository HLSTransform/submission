Lily liked to play with her purple ball. She would throw it, catch it, and roll it on the grass. One day, she saw a boy with a red ball in the park. He was playing by himself, too.
"Hi, I am Lily. Do you want to play with me?" she asked the boy.
"Hi, I am Sam. Sure, I like to play," he said.
They took turns throwing and catching their balls. They had fun and laughed a lot. They became friends.
"Can I see your ball?" Lily asked Sam.
"OK, here you go. Can I see yours?" Sam asked Lily.
They looked at each other's balls. They were different colors, but they were both round and bouncy.
"Your ball is nice. I like red," Lily said.
"Your ball is nice, too. I like purple," Sam said.
They smiled and hugged. They decided to play together every day.
Lily's mom came to pick her up. She saw Lily and Sam playing happily.
"Who is your new friend, Lily?" she asked.
"This is Sam. He has a red ball. We like to play," Lily said.
"That's wonderful, Lily. I am glad you met Sam. Can I take a photo of you two?" she asked.
"OK, mom. Say cheese, Sam!" Lily said.
They posed for the photo. They looked at the photo and saw their happy faces and their colorful balls.
"Look, mom. We are different, but we are the same. We both like to play and have fun," Lily said.
"Yes, Lily. You are right. You are different, but you are the same. You are both kind and friendly. That's what matters most," mom said.
Lily and Sam learned a lesson. They learned that they can be friends with anyone, no matter what they look like or what they have. They learned to respect and appreciate each other's differences. They learned to share and care. They learned to be happy.
