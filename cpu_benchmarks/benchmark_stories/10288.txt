Once upon a time, there was a kind lady named Mrs. Smith. She wore a big apron and liked to bake yummy treats. One day, she went to her garden to pick some fresh vegetables. She was very humble and always shared her crops with her neighbors. 
As she was picking some carrots, she noticed a little bunny hopping around. The bunny was so cute and Mrs. Smith wanted to pet it. But the bunny was scared and ran away. Mrs. Smith didn't want to scare the bunny, so she left it alone and went back to her kitchen to bake some carrot cake. 
Later that day, Mrs. Smith brought the cake to her neighbor's house. The neighbor was so happy and said it was the best cake she had ever tasted. Mrs. Smith felt proud and happy that she could make someone else smile. From that day on, Mrs. Smith always made sure to pick extra vegetables for her neighbors and share her delicious treats.
