Ben and Lily were playing with blocks in the living room. They liked to build towers and houses and bridges with the blocks. But they did not like to share the blocks. They each wanted to have the most and the best blocks.
One day, they found a big box of new blocks in the corner. They ran to the box and opened it. Inside, there were many colorful and shiny blocks. They were incredible! They had different shapes and sizes and patterns. Ben and Lily wanted to touch them all.
But they did not want to share them. They both reached for the same block at the same time. They pulled and tugged and shouted. "Mine!" "No, mine!" They did not yield. They did not let go.
The block was too slippery and too heavy. It slipped from their hands and fell on the floor. It broke into many pieces. Ben and Lily gasped. They felt sad and sorry. They had broken the incredible block.
They looked at each other. They felt bad. They said, "I'm sorry." They hugged. They decided to share the blocks. They picked up the pieces and put them back in the box. They took out some other blocks and started to build together. They had fun. They were happy. They learned to yield.
