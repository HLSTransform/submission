Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play together, but sometimes they have fights. One day, they have a big fight over a toy truck. Sara wants to have the truck, but Ben says it is his. They yell and pull the truck. Mom hears them and comes to see what is wrong.
"Stop fighting, Sara and Ben!" Mom says. "You have to share your toys. Why are you so loud?"
Sara and Ben stop yelling, but they are still angry. They do not want to share the truck. They sit on the floor and look away from each other. Mom sighs and says, "You need to have some quiet time. Go to your rooms and think about how to be nice to each other."
Sara and Ben go to their rooms. They do not talk to each other. They sit on their beds and have quiet time. They think about the fight. They think about the truck. They think about Mom. They think about each other.
After a while, Sara feels sorry. She thinks Ben is a good brother. She thinks she was not fair to him. She wants to say sorry. She gets up and goes to Ben's room. She knocks on the door and says, "Ben, can I come in?"
Ben hears Sara and feels sorry too. He thinks Sara is a good sister. He thinks he was not kind to her. He wants to say sorry. He opens the door and says, "Sara, come in."
Sara and Ben hug and say sorry. They decide to share the truck. They go back to the living room and play together. Mom sees them and smiles. She thinks they are thoughtful twins. She thinks they have learned a lesson. She thinks they have a happy ending.
