Once there was a loyal fish who swam in the sea. One day, the fish went looking for something to eat. It stirred the water with its fin, searching for something good. Suddenly, the fish found something! It was a big and tasty insect. The fish quickly snapped it up and ate it. The happy fish continued to stir the water until it found something else to eat. After a while, it was full and swam off back to the ocean. It was a loyal fish and was happy in the end.
