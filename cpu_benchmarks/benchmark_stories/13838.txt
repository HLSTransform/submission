Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a cute dog. The dog is brown and fluffy. It has a red collar.
"Can we pet the dog?" Lily asks Ben.
"I don't know. Maybe we should ask the owner first," Ben says.
They look around and see a lady sitting on a bench. She is reading a book. She has a smile on her face.
"Excuse me, miss. Can we pet your dog?" Lily says.
The lady looks up and sees the children. She nods and says, "Sure, you can. His name is Max. He is very friendly. But please mind his tail. He likes to wag it a lot."
Lily and Ben thank the lady and go to Max. They stroke his fur and scratch his ears. Max wags his tail and licks their faces. He makes happy noises.
Lily and Ben laugh and hug Max. They feel warm and happy in their hearts. They think Max is the cutest dog ever. They are glad they asked the lady. They are good and polite children.
