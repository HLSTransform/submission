Max was out walking with his dad one day. He was feeling very sleepy and he couldn't help but yawn. His dad said, "Max, why don't we grab a snack before we go home?" Max said, "Okay!"
So they went to the store and Max chose a regular snack. He found a pack of raisins and his dad got him a drink. He was so excited when they left the store.
Back at home, Max enjoyed his snack and drank his drink. He said goodbye to his dad and went to bed. He was so happy and soon fell asleep. 
Every night, his dad gave him a regular snack and Max always said thank you before going to bed. He knew that it was his dad's way of showing his love for him.
