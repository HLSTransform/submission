Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came to visit him.
"Hey Timmy, do you want to go kayaking with me?" asked Billy.
Timmy thought for a moment and said, "Yes! I want to choose the blue kayak."
Billy smiled and said, "That's a great choice! The blue kayak is very fast."
So, Timmy and Billy went kayaking on the river. They saw many fish and birds along the way. Timmy felt very happy and rich because he had such a good friend like Billy.
