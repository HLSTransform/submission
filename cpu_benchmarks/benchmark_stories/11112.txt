Once upon a time, there was a penguin named Pippa. Pippa lived in a cold place with ice and snow. One day, she saw something unknown far away. Pippa wanted to find out what it was.
Pippa asked her friend, a big bear named Benny, "What is that unknown thing far away?" Benny did not know the answer. He said, "I don't know, Pippa. Be careful if you go there."
Pippa walked and walked to find the unknown thing. She got very tired, but she did not stop. When Pippa got there, she found a big hole in the ice. She was too close and fell in. Pippa could not get out of the hole. She called for help, but no one was there to answer. Pippa was sad and scared in the hole, and she wished she had listened to Benny.
