One day, a small boy named Tim went on a safari with his mom and dad. They saw many animals like big elephants, tall giraffes, and fast lions. Tim was very happy to see all the animals.
But then, it started to rain. The rain was very heavy, and the animals went to hide under the trees. Tim was sad because he could not see the animals anymore. His mom and dad tried to make him feel better, but Tim still felt sad.
After a while, the rain stopped, and the sun came out. The animals came back out to play, and Tim was happy again. His mom and dad took many pictures of the animals, and they all had a great time on their safari adventure.
