Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to pretend they were astronauts and fly to the moon. They had a big cardboard box that they used as a rocket. They painted it with bright colors and stuck stars and planets on it.
"Ready for blast off?" Ben asked Lily. He was the pilot and she was the co-pilot.
"Ready!" Lily said. She put on her helmet and pressed some buttons. "Five, four, three, two, one, go!"
They made loud noises as they lifted off the ground. They imagined they were zooming through the sky and seeing all kinds of wonders. They laughed and cheered as they reached the moon.
"Wow, look at that!" Lily said, pointing to a big crater. "Let's go explore!"
They got out of the rocket and jumped around. They felt very light and happy. They picked up some rocks and threw them in the air. They saw a flag and a footprint. They wondered who had been there before.
Suddenly, they heard a loud voice. It was Lily's mom. She was calling them from the park gate.
"Lily, Ben, time to go home! It's getting cold and dark!"
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They were upset. They didn't want to leave their rocket and their moon adventure. They wanted to stay and play some more.
"Can we have five more minutes, please?" Lily asked.
"No, you can't. It's too late. Come on, hurry up!" Lily's mom said.
Lily and Ben sighed. They got back into their rocket and pretended to land. They got out of the box and dragged it to the gate. They were sad and angry.
They passed by a fountain on the way. They saw some water spraying out of it. They had an idea.
"Let's freeze the fountain!" Ben whispered to Lily.
"How?" Lily asked.
"Watch this!" Ben said. He took a deep breath and blew as hard as he could at the fountain. He made a freezing sound.
Lily did the same. They both blew and blew until they ran out of air. They looked at the fountain. It was still spraying water.
They frowned. It didn't work. They felt silly.
They heard Lily's mom laughing. She had seen them trying to freeze the fountain.
"What are you doing, you silly geese?" she asked.
"We were trying to freeze the fountain, like astronauts!" Lily said.
"Astronauts don't freeze fountains, they explore space!" Lily's mom said.
"Well, we did that too!" Ben said.
"Really? Tell me all about it!" Lily's mom said.
Lily and Ben smiled. They forgot their upset feelings. They told Lily's mom all about their rocket and their moon adventure. They showed her their rocks and their flag. They made her laugh with their noises and their jumps.
Lily's mom hugged them and praised them for their imagination and creativity. She told them they were very clever and brave astronauts. She said they could play with their rocket again tomorrow, if they wanted.
Lily and Ben felt happy again. They thanked Lily's mom and said goodbye. They went home with their parents, holding their rocket and their rocks. They looked at the sky and saw the moon shining. They waved at it and smiled. They had a lot of fun today. They couldn't wait for tomorrow.
