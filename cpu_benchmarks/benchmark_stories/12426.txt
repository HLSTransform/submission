Once upon a time, a clever dad had to plan a meeting. Everyone was busy, so he asked his three-year-old boy to help. He wanted his son to learn how to do things right. 
The boy was so happy to help his dad, but he was a little bit confused. He wanted to know what the meeting was about. The father said the meeting was very important and he needed people to bring the right things and arrive on time.
The boy didn’t want to let his dad down, so he hurried and gathered all the things dad asked him to. But when he tried to tell his dad that he had finished his job, dad wasn’t listening. He was too busy preparing for the meeting.
The boy was frustrated, so he decided to leave. He wanted to show his dad that he was mad. But before he left, he thought of a clever idea. He took one of the things he had found and put it in the wrong place, so that everyone at the meeting would notice it.
Sure enough, when the people showed up to the meeting, the errant item was noticed and soon dad was the one asking questions, not ignoring his son. Dad learned that it was all just a misunderstanding.
The moral of the story is: no matter how busy we are, we should always listen to those who love us. Even if we don’t understand their words
