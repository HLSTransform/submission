Sammy was embarrassed because he couldn't play baseball like his friends. Every day they ran around together and threw the ball to each other. But Sammy just couldn't get it right.
One day, Sammy asked his Dad to help him learn. His Dad was happy to help and soon they were practicing throwing the baseball. They did this every day until Sammy was good at it. He was so happy!
He went back to the park and showed his friends that he had learned how to play baseball. Everyone was so proud of him and they all had a great time. Sammy smiled and felt good knowing he had learned something new.
