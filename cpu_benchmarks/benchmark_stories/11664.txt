Once upon a time there was a brave little girl. Her name was Ann and she loved adventure. One day Ann went into a dark forest. She woke up a sleeping dragon. It was enormous and very dangerous. Ann tried to run away but the dragon blocked her way.
Ann had an idea. She took out a bow and some arrows. She shot an arrow at the dragon and the dragon did not expect it. Ann yelled loudly "Go away dragon!" The dragon was surprised and flew away. 
Ann was very happy. She said to herself "What a dangerous adventure, but now I am safe."
