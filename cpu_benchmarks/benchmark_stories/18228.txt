Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a big black balloon. It was a very special balloon. It could fly high up in the sky.
One sunny day, a little girl named Lily found the black balloon. She wanted to see it fly. So, she took it outside to release it. She let go of the balloon and it went up, up, up into the sky.
As the black balloon flew higher, it started to release some gas. The gas made the balloon go even higher. Lily laughed and clapped her hands as she watched it fly away. She knew the black balloon was happy to be free.
