Once there was a strong man who loved to catch animals. He was always looking for animals to catch, but one day he caught something special.
The man was so surprised when he saw it, for it was a skeleton! It was not an ordinary skeleton - it was an ancient skeleton from long ago.
The man was so excited that he quickly put the skeleton in his pocket, and decided to take it home. When he arrived home he showed the skeleton to his little 3 year old daughter.
The girl was so amazed that she immediately wanted to catch her own skeleton. The man was happy to help his daughter and so he took her to the forest.
They searched and searched, but they couldn't find any skeletons in the forest. But then, they heard a noise coming from a tree and when they looked closer, they discovered a small, strong skeleton!
The girl was so happy and she quickly grabbed the skeleton and put it in her pocket. Now she had her own skeleton, and she loves it very much!
