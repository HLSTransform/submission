Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside in the garden. One day, she saw a huge butterfly flying around. Lily wanted to touch it, but her mom said, "Be careful, Lily. Butterflies are delicate."
Later that day, Lily felt an itch on her arm. She scratched and scratched, but it wouldn't go away. Her mom said, "Lily, you must be careful what you touch. Some things can make you itch."
Lily learned that day that even though something might look pretty or interesting, it's important to be careful and not touch it if it could hurt you. She promised to always listen to her mom's advice and be safe.
