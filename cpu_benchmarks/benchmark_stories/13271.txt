Tommy was playing outside his house on the porch. He noticed a big hill and decided to lie down in it. He was so comfortable that he fell asleep. 
When Tommy woke up, he looked around and saw his mom. She was on the porch looking for him. He couldn't believe he had been gone for so long.
Tommy got up and ran to his mom. He said sorry for making her worry. His mom said it was alright and smiled. 
Tommy hugged his mom and knew he would never lie in the hill that far away from the porch again.
