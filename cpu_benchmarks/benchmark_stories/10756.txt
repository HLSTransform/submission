Once upon a time, there was a mechanic named Tom. Tom loved to jump. He would jump all day long. He liked to jump more than fixing cars. Tom had a friend named Sam. Sam was also a mechanic. Sam liked to jump too.
One sunny day, Tom and Sam had a jumping game. They wanted to see who could jump the highest. They were very competitive. They jumped and jumped, laughing and having fun. Tom jumped high, but Sam jumped even higher.
In the end, Sam won the jumping game. Tom was a little sad, but he knew it was just a game. They both had fun and were still best friends. They went back to fixing cars, but they always remembered their fun jumping game.
