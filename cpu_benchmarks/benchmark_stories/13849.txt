Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He liked to run and play all day. One day, Tim saw a big orange ball in his yard. He wanted to play with the ball, so he picked it up and started to run.
Tim ran all the way to the park with the orange ball. He was having so much fun. But then, a big dog came and wanted to play too. The dog liked the orange ball and wanted to take it away from Tim.
Tim tried to run away with the ball, but the dog was too fast. The dog took the orange ball and ran away. Tim was very sad and cried all the way home. He never saw his orange ball again.
