Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her magnet toys. One day, she was playing with her magnets when her mom came in and said, "Lily, it's time to clean up your toys and yield the room to your brother."
Lily didn't want to stop playing with her magnets, but she knew she had to listen to her mom. As she was cleaning up, she noticed that the sky outside was gloomy and gray. She said to her mom, "Mommy, why is the sky so gloomy today?"
Her mom replied, "It's because it's going to rain soon. But don't worry, we can still have fun inside." And with that, Lily finished cleaning up and yielded the room to her brother. They played together and had a great time, even though it was a gloomy day outside.
