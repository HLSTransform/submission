Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved playing outside in the rain. One day, Lily's mommy told her not to go outside because it was raining too much. But Lily didn't listen and went outside to play anyway.
Lily was having so much fun splashing in the puddles, but then she started to feel cold and wet. She realized that her clothes were soaked through and she needed to change into dry ones. 
As Lily was walking back to her house, she saw a big, interesting tree. She decided to climb it and see what she could find. But as she was climbing, she slipped and fell down. She hurt herself badly and had to go to the hospital.
Lily's mommy was very upset with her for not listening and going outside in the rain. Lily learned her lesson and promised to always listen to her mommy from now on.
