Once there was a little girl in a big, green field. She had a big, brown hut to live in. It was so large, she could run around inside it!
One day, the little girl went out to the field with a bucket and a spoon. She filled her bucket with dirt and then carried it back to her hut.
She took the dirt and spooned it carefully into all of the little cracks in the hut walls. She kept spooning the dirt until the hut walls were full.
When the little girl was all done, her hut was nice and strong and brown. She smiled, happy that her brown hut was now safe and strong.
