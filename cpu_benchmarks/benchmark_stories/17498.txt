Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a big box in the garage. The box has many stickers on it. The stickers say "Do not open".
Tom is curious. He wants to see what is in the box. He says to Lily, "Let's open the box. Maybe there is something fun inside."
Lily is scared. She remembers what her mom said. Her mom said, "Never open a box that says 'Do not open'. It could be dangerous or bad." She says to Tom, "No, Tom. We should not open the box. Mom said no. We could get in trouble."
Tom does not listen. He says, "I don't care. I want to open the box. It is just a box. Nothing bad will happen." He pulls the tape and removes the lid. He looks inside the box.
Lily gasps. She sees what is in the box. It is a big cake. The cake has candles and frosting. The frosting says, "Happy Birthday, Tom". Tom is surprised. He says, "Wow, a cake. For me?"
Lily smiles. She says, "Yes, Tom. It is your birthday today. Mom and dad made the cake for you. They wanted to surprise you. They are famous for making cakes. They are very good at it."
Tom feels happy. He says, "Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend. And thank you, mom and dad. You are the best. I love you." He hugs Lily and his parents. They sing happy birthday to him. They cut the cake and eat it. It is very yummy.
The result is that Tom has a great birthday. He learns a lesson. He learns that he should listen to his mom and dad. He learns that he should not open boxes that say "Do not open". He learns that sometimes, surprises are good. He is a happy boy.
