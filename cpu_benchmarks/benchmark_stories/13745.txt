Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play at the park. They loved to slide on the big slide, but they always fought over who would go first. Tom was older and bigger, and he had more muscle than Sam. He thought he was the boss of everything. Sam was younger and smaller, and he was often scared of Tom. He thought Tom was mean and spoiled.
One day, they went to the park with their mom. They ran to the big slide, but Tom pushed Sam aside and said, "I go first, you go last. You are too slow and weak. I am fast and strong." Sam felt sad and angry, but he did not say anything. He waited for his turn, but Tom did not let him. He slid down again and again, and laughed at Sam. "You are a baby, you can't slide. You are too scared and silly. I am brave and smart."
Sam had enough. He decided to stand up to Tom. He ran to the top of the slide, and grabbed Tom's leg. He tried to pull him off, but Tom kicked him hard. Sam fell down and hit his head on the ground. He cried out loud, and blood came out of his head. He felt a lot of pain, and he was very scared.
Their mom heard Sam's cry, and ran to him. She saw his head, and she was very worried. She called for help, and a man came with a car. He said he was a doctor, and he would take Sam to the hospital. He put Sam on a bed, and gave him a mask. He said, "Don't worry, you will be okay. You just need some stitches and some rest."
Tom watched everything, and he felt very bad. He realized he had hurt his brother, and he was sorry. He wanted to say sorry, but he did not know how. He felt ashamed and lonely. He wished he had been nicer to Sam, and he wished they could slide together. He learned a hard lesson, but it was too late. He had spoiled their fun, and their day.
