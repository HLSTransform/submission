Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her house with her toys. One day, she saw her mom moving a big brown couch. Lily wanted to help her mom, so she tried to move a small chair all by herself. But she slipped and fell on the floor. 
Her mom heard the noise and came to see if she was okay. Lily was a little bit hurt, but she was more worried about the chair. She was afraid that it was broken. Luckily, the chair was okay, and Lily's mom helped her put it back where it belonged. 
From that day on, Lily knew that she needed to be careful when moving furniture. She didn't want to slip and fall again. She also learned that it's important to ask for help when things are too heavy or too hard to move by herself.
