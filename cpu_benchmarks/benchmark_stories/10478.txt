There was a little boy named Joe. One day, Joe wanted to ride his bicycle. He jumped on his bicycle, but he didn't know how to make it go. He pushed and peddled, but nothing happened. Joe felt embarrassed.
Then, something mysterious happened. Joe looked down and saw that his bicycle's tires were flat. He ran over to get his dad to help.
Joe's dad filled the tires up with air and then said, "Now you can ride your bicycle!" Joe jumped on again, and this time he was able to pedal his bicycle to his friend's house. He was so happy and no longer embarrassed. He had solved the mysterious problem!
