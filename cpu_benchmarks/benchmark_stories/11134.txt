Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was an ugly frog. The frog was sad because he had no friends. He loved to play, but no one wanted to play with him because of how he looked.
One day, the ugly frog saw a pretty butterfly. The butterfly was lost and needed help. The frog knew the forest very well, so he decided to help the butterfly. He showed her the way to her home. The butterfly was happy and thanked the frog for his help.
As they spent more time together, the butterfly saw how kind and helpful the ugly frog was. She began to love the frog for who he was, not how he looked. Soon, they became best friends. The other animals in the forest saw this and learned that looks are not everything. They all became friends with the ugly frog, and they all played together happily in the big forest.
