Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her toy animals. One day, she was playing with her toy gorilla when she saw a real gorilla on TV. "Wow, that gorilla is big!" she said to her mom. 
Later that day, Lily and her family went to the zoo. As they walked past the gorilla exhibit, Lily saw the same gorilla she saw on TV. "Look, Mommy! It's the big gorilla!" she said excitedly. 
But as they watched the gorilla, Lily noticed something was wrong. The gorilla looked miserable and sad. "Why is he so sad, Mommy?" she asked. 
Her mom explained that the gorilla was lonely because he didn't have any other gorillas to play with. That's when Lily had an idea. She went back to her toy box and found her toy gorilla. "Maybe this will help," she said. 
They brought the toy gorilla to the zoo and placed it in the gorilla exhibit. The real gorilla saw the toy and picked it up, hugging it close. Lily smiled and said, "They match!" and the gorilla looked less miserable. From that day on, the gorilla had a friend to play with and Lily knew she had made a difference.
