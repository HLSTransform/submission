Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play and have fun. One day, they visit their grandma and grandpa. Grandma and grandpa live in a big house with a lot of things. They have a luxury sofa, a luxury bed, and a luxury car. Sara and Ben think the luxury things are very nice, but they also like to be silly.
They jump on the luxury sofa and make funny noises. They pretend the luxury bed is a boat and they sail to an island. They sneak into the luxury car and honk the horn. Grandma and grandpa laugh and shake their heads. They love Sara and Ben very much, even when they are silly.
But then, Sara and Ben see something else. It is a luxury cake. It is big and round and has cream and cherries on top. It looks very yummy. Sara and Ben want to taste it. They climb on a chair and reach for the cake. But they are too silly. They slip and fall and the cake falls too. It lands on their heads and makes a big mess.
Grandma and grandpa hear the noise and come to see. They see Sara and Ben and the cake. They are shocked and angry. They scold Sara and Ben for being naughty and wasting the luxury cake. Sara and Ben feel sorry and sad. They say they are sorry and they hug grandma and grandpa. Grandma and grandpa are still mad, but they also love Sara and Ben very much. They forgive them and give them a kiss. They say they can have some cookies instead of the luxury cake. Sara and Ben say thank you and smile. They are happy again. They learn to be careful and not too silly with the luxury things. They still have fun and enjoy their visit.
