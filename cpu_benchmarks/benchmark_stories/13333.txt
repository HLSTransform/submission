One day, a little girl named Sally went to visit her old friend, Mr. Bear. Mr. Bear lived in a small home in the woods. Sally liked to play with Mr. Bear because he was always very nice to her.
While they were playing, Sally accidentally spilled her juice on Mr. Bear's favorite chair. "Oh no! I'm sorry, Mr. Bear," she said. Mr. Bear felt embarrass, but he smiled and said, "That's okay, Sally. We all make mistakes."
Sally and Mr. Bear cleaned up the mess together. After that, they went outside to play in the sun. They were happy to be friends and have fun together. At the end of the day, Sally went back to her home, excited to visit Mr. Bear again soon.
