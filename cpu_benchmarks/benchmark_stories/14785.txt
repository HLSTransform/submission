Sara and Ben are playing with paper. They like to fold the paper and make shapes. Sara folds a paper into a hat. Ben folds a paper into a plane. They show each other their shapes and say, "Wow!"
Then, Sara sees her mom's phone on the table. She wants to play with it. She picks it up and tries to fold it like paper. But the phone does not fold. It makes a loud crack sound. Sara is scared. She drops the phone and it breaks.
Sara starts to cry. She thinks her mom will be angry. Ben sees Sara crying and feels sorry for her. He says, "Don't cry, Sara. It was an accident. Maybe we can fix it."
He picks up the phone and tries to put the pieces together. But the phone does not work. He says, "I'm sorry, Sara. I can't fix it. Maybe we can tell your mom the truth. She is kind and she loves you. She will understand."
Sara nods and wipes her tears. She says, "Thank you, Ben. You are a good friend. Let's go find my mom and tell her what happened."
They hold hands and walk to the living room. They see Sara's mom reading a book. They say, "Mom, we have something to tell you. We broke your phone. We are sorry."
Sara's mom looks at them and sees the broken phone. She is sad, but she is not angry. She says, "Thank you for telling me the truth. I know you did not mean to break it. You were curious and wanted to play. But you have to be careful with things that are not toys. They can be dangerous or expensive. Do you understand?"
Sara and Ben nod and say, "Yes, mom. We understand. We are sorry."
Sara's mom hugs them and says, "It's okay. I forgive you. You are still my sweet children. And I'm proud of you for being honest and kind. Now, let's go have some cookies and milk. And maybe we can make some more paper shapes together."
