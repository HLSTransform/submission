Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big map on a wall. The map shows many places and colors.
"Look, Tom, this is where we are," Sue says. She points to a spot on the map. "And this is where the sun goes down. It is called west."
"Wow, west is far away," Tom says. He looks at the map. "I wonder what is there. Maybe there are animals and trees and mountains."
"Maybe we can find out," Sue says. She has an idea. "Let's pretend we are explorers. We can go west and see what we can find."
"OK, let's go," Tom says. He is excited. He and Sue take their backpacks and hats and start to walk. They follow the map and the sun.
They walk for a long time. They see many things. They see cars and buses and shops and people. They see flowers and birds and dogs and cats. They see a river and a bridge and a boat. They have fun.
But they do not find west. West is still far away. They start to feel tired and hungry.
"Tom, I think we should go back," Sue says. She looks at the map. "We are lost. We do not know where we are."
"Me too," Tom says. He looks at the sun. "It is getting dark. We need to find our way home."
They are scared. They do not know what to do. They look around. They see a big sign. The sign says: "Park".
"Look, Sue, the park!" Tom says. He is happy. He knows the park. "We are not lost. We are lucky. We can find our way home from here."
"Yes, Tom, we are lucky," Sue says. She is happy too. She knows the park. "We can find our way home from here."
They run to the park. They see their parents. Their parents are looking for them. They are worried.
"Tom! Sue! Where have you been?" their parents say. They hug them. They are relieved.
"We went west," Tom and Sue say. They show them the map. "We were explorers. We saw many things. But we got lost. Then we found the park. We are lucky."
Their parents smile. They are proud. They are glad.
"You are lucky," their parents say. "But you are also brave. And curious. And smart. You learned a lot today. But next time, please tell us where you are going. And do not go too far. West is a big place. Maybe we can go there together someday."
Tom and Sue nod. They agree. They are sorry. They are happy.
They go home. They have dinner. They tell their parents more stories. They have a lot of questions. They want to know more about west.
They go to bed. They dream of west. They are lucky.
