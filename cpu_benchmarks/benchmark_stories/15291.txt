Once there was a boy named Jim. He was three years old and he really loved to play outside. Jim was always very healthy! One day he decided to go on a little adventure. He went deep into the forest and he noticed a big root. So he got down on his hands and knees and he shook the root. Suddenly, a magic rabbit came out of the root! Jim was very surprised and excited. The rabbit said "Hello Jim!" and told him that he had been living in the root. Jim was so happy and he asked the rabbit if he wanted to come outside and play. The rabbit said yes with a big smile! Jim and the rabbit ran around in the woods together, having a great time. They even got some healthy carrots and shared them together. Jim and the rabbit were best friends and love to play together whenever Jim visits the forest!
