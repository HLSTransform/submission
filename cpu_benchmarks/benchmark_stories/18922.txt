Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a box of matches. They do not know what matches are for.
"Look, they are like little sticks," Tom says. He picks one up and shows it to Lily.
"Maybe they are for drawing," Lily says. She takes another one and tries to make a mark on the floor.
They try to draw with the matches, but nothing happens. They are not happy.
"Let's discuss what else we can do with them," Tom says. He thinks hard.
"Maybe they are for building," Lily says. She has an idea. She puts some matches together to make a house.
"That's a good idea," Tom says. He helps her make more houses. They are happy.
They make a village of match houses. They pretend to be regular people who live there. They have fun.
But then, Tom sees something shiny on the match box. He is curious. He opens the box and sees a red thing.
"What is this?" he asks Lily.
"I don't know," Lily says. She comes closer to see.
Tom rubs the match on the red thing. He hears a sound. He sees a spark. He sees a flame. He is scared.
"Help!" he shouts. He drops the match. It falls on the match houses. They catch fire. They burn.
Tom and Lily run away. They see smoke. They smell something bad. They cry.
"Mommy! Daddy!" they call. They need help. They are sorry. They learned a lesson. They will never play with matches again.
