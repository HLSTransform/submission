Once upon a time, there was a normal tree. This tree had many pears on it. One day, a little boy named Tim saw the tree. Tim liked pears a lot. He wanted to eat one.
Tim tried to get a pear from the tree, but they were too high. He was sad. Then, Tim had a big idea. He went to get a long stick. He thought the stick could help him save a pear from the tree.
Tim came back with the stick. He used it to reach the pears. The stick worked! Tim was so happy. He saved a pear from the tree and ate it. It was the best pear he ever had.
