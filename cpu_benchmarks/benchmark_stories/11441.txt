Once upon a time, there were two children. They liked to play in the garden.
One day, the children's mom put on an apron and said to them, "I'm going to make some delicious food. You two can play in the garden while I'm cooking."
The children played and pretended they were pirates, looking for treasures. Time passed quickly and they forgot about the food.
Suddenly, the mom called them into the kitchen, "Kids, it's time to rest! Dinner is ready." 
The kids went into the kitchen, smiling. They sat down at the table and the mom put a plate of food in front of them. 
"Food is an important part of life," she said. "We need to eat healthy food so that our bodies can stay strong." 
The children munched on their food and thanked their mom. 
"Let's always remember how important it is to rest, eat well and take care of our bodies," she said. 
The kids nodded, happy to have such a wise and caring mom.
