Mark had a filthy room. He owned lots of things, but he never tidied them. He didn't have time, because he was always out playing.
One day, he came back and his mom was standing in the doorway. She was angry because the room was so filthy. She said something had to change.
So, Mark grabbed a cloth and wiped everything down. He started tidying up and his mom watched. When he was done, the room looked much better.
When Mark was finished, his mom had a surprise. She had bought him a special marker which he could use to write in his room. The marker was bright blue. Mark was so excited!
He scribbled all over the walls and all around the room. His mom smiled and said he could decorate his room however he wanted. From then on, his room was always neat and tidy!
