Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a big field of wheat. The wheat was tall and fine, swaying in the gentle breeze. The farmer worked hard every day to take care of his wheat.
One day, a sneaky fox came by and saw the farmer's wheat. The fox wanted to steal some of the wheat to eat. But the farmer had a plan. He set up a scarecrow in the middle of the field to scare away any animals who might want to steal his wheat.
The fox tried to sneak past the scarecrow and steal some wheat, but the scarecrow scared him away. The farmer was happy that his plan worked and his wheat was safe. From then on, the farmer made sure to always set up a scarecrow to protect his wheat.
