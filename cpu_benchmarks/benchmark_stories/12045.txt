Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the park with his friends. One day, they found a stick on the ground and started to play with it. But then, Timmy saw something shiny in the bushes. He went to check it out and found a weapon! 
Timmy knew that weapons were very dangerous and he didn't want anyone to get hurt. So, he decided to burn it so nobody could use it again. He asked his friends to help him and they all gathered some sticks and made a fire. Timmy threw the weapon in the fire and watched it burn until it was gone. 
Afterwards, Timmy felt very proud of himself for doing the right thing. His friends thought he was very brave and they all went home happy. But then, Timmy saw a disgusting bug crawling on his shirt and he screamed! His mom came to help him and they both laughed about it. The end.
