Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat jelly, it was his favorite food. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a jar of jelly to eat. Timmy was so happy that he ate it all at once.
After a while, Timmy's tummy started to hurt. He began to panic because he didn't know what was happening. His mom saw him and asked him what was wrong. Timmy told his mom about his tummy ache.
His mom explained to him that eating too much jelly can be harmful and that he should only eat a little bit at a time. Timmy learned his lesson and promised to only eat a little bit of jelly at a time. From that day on, Timmy was careful about how much jelly he ate and never felt sick again.
