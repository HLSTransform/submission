Once upon a time there was a silly little boy. He loved to go outside and poke logs. Every day he would go out and find the biggest log he could find. He would sit down and then poke the log with his finger. He enjoyed it so much!
One day, he found a big log and he started to poke it. Suddenly, a big bear appeared from behind the log and growled! The little boy was so scared that he ran away from the bear as fast as he could. But the bear didn't chase after him. He just watched as the little boy ran away.
The boy was relieved but he never went back to that log again. He still enjoyed poking logs but he was now much more careful to look and see if any bears were around!
