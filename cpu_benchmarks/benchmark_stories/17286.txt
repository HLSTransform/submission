Once upon a time, there was a big tank. The tank was very fragile, which means it could break easily. One day, the tank started to move. It moved slowly at first, but then it went faster and faster. The tank was very happy to be moving. 
As the tank moved, it saw many things. It saw trees and flowers and birds. It saw people and cars and houses. The tank was happy to see all of these things. 
But then, the tank hit a big rock. The tank was so fragile that it broke into many pieces. The tank was sad that it could not move anymore. But the people who saw the tank helped to put it back together. And soon, the tank was moving again, happy to see all the things around it.
