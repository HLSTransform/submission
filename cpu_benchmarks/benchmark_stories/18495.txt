Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play outside. One day, they see a big blue bird in the sky. The bird can fly very high and fast.
"Wow, look at the bird!" Tom says. "It is so blue and pretty. I wish I could fly like that."
"Me too," Mia says. "Maybe we can fly if we try hard. Let's pretend we are birds and flap our arms."
Tom and Mia flap their arms and run around the yard. They make bird noises and laugh. They have fun.
But soon, they get tired and hungry. They look at the sun. It is noon. That means it is time for lunch.
"Let's go inside and eat," Tom says. "Maybe we can fly again later."
"OK," Mia says. "But I still want to be a blue bird. They are my favorite."
They go inside and tell their moms about the bird. Their moms smile and give them sandwiches and juice. Tom and Mia eat and drink. They are happy. They still dream of flying.
