Once upon a time there was a girl called Sarah. She was always quiet, but was full of magic. She had exciting adventures that involved daring moments. 
One day, Sarah went on a very special quest. She wanted to find the secret of the magic. She was told that it was hidden far away on top of a mountain, and so she decided to try and find it. 
She began her trek through the forest, and soon she found herself at the foot of a tall mountain. She had to climb and climb and climb to reach the top. 
At last, she made it to the very top of the mountain and saw the secret of the magic - a beautiful, sparkling light. It was so bright and glowed like a star. 
Sarah was scared and didn't know what to do. But she was brave and decided to dare herself to reach out and touch the light. When she touched it, the light shone all around her and filled her with magic, and from then on all her adventures were filled with magical moments.
