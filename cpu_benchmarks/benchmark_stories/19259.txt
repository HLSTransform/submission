Once upon a time there was a hairy pear. It was a very special pear because it had so much hair!
One day a little girl came along and wanted to touch the pear. She reached out her hand and touched it. The pear was very soft and fuzzy.
The little girl was very happy and started to laugh. She ran around in circles with the pear and had lots of fun.
But then something funny happened. When she touched the pear, the hairs started to move! They danced around like little fairy tales.
The little girl was delighted. She couldn't believe it! She had found a very special pear. She ran home to tell her mom about her special hairy pear. 
From then on, the little girl always remembered her special pear.
