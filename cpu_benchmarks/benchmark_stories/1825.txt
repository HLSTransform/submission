Bob wanted a new boot but he was spoiled. His parents said that he could have anything he wanted as long as he put on his best dress. 
So Bob went to his room and put on his special dress. It was red with polka dots and it sparkled in the light. He twirled around so everyone could see how lovely it looked. 
Bob then went downstairs and asked his parents for his new boot. His mom and dad smiled and said it was fine. They walked him to the store and showed him all the different kinds of boots. 
Bob found his favorite one right away. It was yellow and had stars on it. He put it on his foot and it fit perfectly. Bob was so excited that he instantly started to skip home.
His mom and dad were so happy to see him so excited. They were glad that they were able to give him something he really wanted. He was so spoiled! From then on, Bob would always wear his special dress and his new yellow boot.
