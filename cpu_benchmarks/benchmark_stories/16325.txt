Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to swim in the pool with her family. One day, Lily's mom brought her a fragile toy to play with in the water. Lily was very happy and played with it carefully.
After a while, Lily's little brother wanted to play with the toy too. Lily thought it was a good idea to share, so she requested her mom to bring another toy for her brother to play with. Her mom was happy with Lily's request and brought another toy for her brother.
Lily and her brother had so much fun playing with their toys in the pool. They splashed and laughed together. When it was time to go home, Lily was sad to say goodbye to the pool, but she was happy to have had such a fun day with her family. The end.
