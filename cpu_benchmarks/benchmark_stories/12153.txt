Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to explore the world around her. One day, Sue decided to climb the nearby mountain. As she was walking through the forest, she came across a ruler. It was a boring ruler, but Sue was excited to measure things with it.
Sue climbed up the mountain and reached the top. She started to measure the mountain with her ruler, but suddenly she started to feel very tired. Sue decided to take a nap. While she was sleeping, a fox came and took her ruler away.
When Sue woke up, she noticed her ruler was gone. She was very sad - she wanted to measure the mountain. Sue started to search for her ruler. After a few minutes, she saw the fox running away with her ruler.
Sue started chasing the fox. She followed him through the forest and to the other side of the mountain. Finally she caught the fox and retrieved her ruler.
Sue was very happy to have her ruler back. She quickly started measuring the mountain again. After a few minutes, Sue finished measuring the mountain. She was glad she had her ruler back - with it, she was able to explore more than ever before!
