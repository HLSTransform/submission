Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside and explore the deep woods behind his house. One day, he found a shiny pistol on the ground. "Wow, this is so cool!" he said to himself. 
But then, a bad man came and tried to steal the pistol from Timmy. "Give me that pistol, kid!" he said. Timmy was scared and didn't know what to do. He didn't want to give the pistol away, but he didn't want to get hurt either. 
In the end, the bad man took the pistol from Timmy and ran away. Timmy felt sad and scared. His mommy hugged him and said, "Remember, Timmy, it's never okay to steal or take things that don't belong to you. It's important to always be safe and tell a grown-up if someone tries to take something from you." Timmy learned his lesson and promised to be more careful in the future.
