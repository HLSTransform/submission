Lily and Max were playing in the attic. They liked to find old things and make up stories about them. They saw a big box with a label that said "Halloween". They wanted to see what was inside.
"Let's unpack the box!" Lily said. "Maybe there are costumes and candy!"
"OK!" Max agreed. They opened the box and saw many scary things. There were masks, spiders, bats, and pumpkins. They also saw a skull. It was white and hard and had no eyes or nose.
"Wow, look at this!" Max said. He picked up the skull and held it in his hands. "This is a real skull! Maybe it belonged to a pirate or a monster!"
Lily was curious. She touched the skull and felt its teeth. "It's cold and smooth," she said. "Do you think it can talk?"
Max had an idea. He put the skull on his head and pretended to be a ghost. He made a spooky voice and said, "Boo! I am the skull of the attic! I will haunt you if you don't leave me alone!"
Lily screamed and laughed. She thought Max was funny. She grabbed a mask and put it on her face. She made a silly voice and said, "No, I am the mask of the Halloween! I will tickle you if you don't play with me!"
They chased each other around the attic, wearing the skull and the mask. They had a lot of fun. But they also made a big mess. They threw the spiders, the bats, and the pumpkins everywhere. They did not notice that their mom was coming up the stairs.
"Kids, what are you doing?" their mom asked. She saw the messy attic and the skull and the mask. She was not happy. "You have to clean up this mess right now! And where did you get that skull? That's not a toy, that's a real skull!"
Lily and Max stopped playing. They felt sorry. They did not know the skull was real. They thought it was just a fake thing for Halloween. They took off the skull and the mask and put them back in the box. They said sorry to their mom and helped her clean up the attic. They learned their lesson. They decided to play with something else next time.
