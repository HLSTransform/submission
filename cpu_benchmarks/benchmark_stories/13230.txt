Once there was a little boy who wanted to do something fun. He went out into the backyard and gathered all the rocks he could find. Next, he found a small pipe that fit perfectly in his hand.
It was just the right size for blowing bubbles. He packed the pipe with water, then he went and gathered some soap from the kitchen. The little boy mixed the soap and water together in the pipe and blew a big bubble.
The bubble was so big and pretty! He tried and tried, gathering more and more soap and water for the pipe and making bubbles. When he was done, the backyard was full of little bubbles. The little boy had so much fun making bubbles with his little pipe!
