Anna and Ben were hungry. They wanted to eat beef for lunch. They asked their mom to cook beef for them.
"Mom, can we have beef, please?" they requested.
"Sorry, kids, we don't have any beef left. How about some chicken and rice?" their mom said.
Anna and Ben did not like chicken and rice. They liked beef better. They were sad and angry.
"No, we want beef! We want beef!" they shouted.
Their mom was tired and busy. She did not like their shouting. She tried to calm them down.
"Kids, stop shouting. You can't always have what you want. Chicken and rice is good for you. Maybe we can have beef another day," she said.
But Anna and Ben did not listen. They kept shouting and crying. They made a lot of noise.
Their mom had an idea. She remembered that there was a deep freezer in the basement. Maybe there was some beef in there. She went to check.
She opened the freezer and saw a big package of beef. She was happy. She took it out and went back to the kitchen.
"Look, kids, I found some beef! I can cook it for you. Are you happy now?" she said.
Anna and Ben stopped shouting and crying. They saw the beef and smiled. They were happy.
"Yes, we are happy! Thank you, mom!" they said.
Their mom smiled too. She was glad that they were happy. She hoped that they would learn to be more grateful and patient. She put the beef in a pot and started to cook it.
But she did not notice that the beef was very old and frozen. It had a bad smell and a strange color. It was not good to eat. She had forgotten to check the date on the package. She had made a big mistake.
