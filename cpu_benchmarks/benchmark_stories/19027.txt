Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat blueberries because they were so tasty. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a big bowl of blueberries to eat. Lily was so happy and she ate them all up.
But after a while, Lily started to feel sick. Her tummy hurt and she didn't feel good. She was scared and didn't know what to do. Then, her mommy came and told her to trust her. She said everything would be okay.
Lily trusted her mommy and soon she felt better. Her mommy gave her a hug and said, "I told you everything would be okay. You just ate too many blueberries. Next time, let's eat them a little at a time." And Lily smiled and felt happy again.
