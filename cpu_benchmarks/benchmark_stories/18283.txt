Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her backyard with her toys. One day, she saw an unusual bird with bright feathers. It was so pretty! The bird blinked at her and Lily blinked back. 
Lily wanted to win the bird's friendship, so she offered it some bread. The bird ate the bread and hopped closer to Lily. They became friends and played together every day. 
One day, Lily's parents took her on a trip to the beach. She brought her new bird friend with her. They played in the sand and splashed in the water. When it was time to go home, Lily was sad. But the bird promised to visit her in her backyard again soon. And Lily knew that she had already won the best prize - a new friend.
