Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max had a very hairy coat and loved to play in the park. One day, Max saw a big flood coming towards his house. He was scared and didn't know what to do. 
Suddenly, Max remembered something his mom had told him before. She said, "If you ever feel scared, just try to match your fears with something happy." So, Max thought about all the fun times he had playing in the park and how much he loved his family. 
Max realized that even though the flood was scary, he could match it with happy thoughts and not be afraid. He ran to his family and they all stayed safe together. From that day on, Max learned that even in scary situations, he could find happiness and not be afraid.
