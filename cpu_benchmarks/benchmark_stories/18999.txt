Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, her mommy asked her to get a bowl from the cabinet. Lily was very enthusiastic about helping and quickly found the bowl.
As they were making cookies, Lily's mommy asked her to pour the flour into the bowl. Lily was surprised when the flour made a big cloud and covered her face. She giggled and helped her mommy clean up the mess.
After they finished making the cookies, Lily's mommy gave her a big hug and said, "Thank you for being such a great helper, Lily!" Lily felt very proud and happy. She couldn't wait to surprise her daddy with the delicious cookies they made together.
