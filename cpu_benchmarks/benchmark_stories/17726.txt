One day there was a woman. She was very polite, and she had a design. She wanted to make something special for her house. So she drew a picture and she put it on the wall.
The woman was very excited about her design. She showed it to her friends. They all said it was very funny and pretty.
Then one day she took her design to her neighbor's house. He looked at it and smiled. He asked her if he could have the design in his own house too. She said yes and he thanked her, because she was very polite.
The woman was happy. She was proud that her design was good enough to have in two houses. She was even happier when the neighbors asked her to make more designs. They said they wanted more pictures.
So the woman kept designing until she had enough pictures to fill many houses. Everyone was happy to see what she had done. She was very proud of her work.
