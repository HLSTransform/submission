Anna likes to play with her drum. She bangs it with her hands and makes a rhythm. She likes to hear the loud and soft sounds. She likes to make her own songs.
One day, it is very hot outside. Anna wants to play with her drum, but she feels too hot. She sees a big puddle of water near the tree. She thinks it looks cool and fun. She runs to the puddle and jumps in. She splashes and laughs. She feels better.
She sees her drum near the puddle. She has an idea. She picks up her drum and puts it in the water. She thinks it will make a different sound. She bangs it with her hands, but it does not make a rhythm. It makes a wet and soft sound. She does not like it. She takes out her drum and looks at it. It is wet and soggy. She feels sad.
She runs to her mom and shows her the drum. She says, "Mom, my drum is wet. It does not make a rhythm. Can you fix it?" Mom looks at the drum and hugs Anna. She says, "Don't worry, Anna. We can dry your drum. Let's put it in the sun. The sun is hot and it will make your drum dry. Then it will make a rhythm again." Anna nods and smiles. She says, "Thank you, Mom. I love you." Mom says, "I love you too, Anna. Let's go and dry your drum." They go to the sun and put the drum on the grass. They wait and hope.
