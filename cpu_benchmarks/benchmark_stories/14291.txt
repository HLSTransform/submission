Once upon a time there was a turkey who cared about his family. He decided to take them on an adventure, so he led them to the mountain. As they travelled, the turkey felt a bit scared. But he kept going, for he cared for his family. 
At the mountain, they found a beautiful meadow filled with flowers. The turkey was so happy and he wanted to show his family the great view. But suddenly they heard some noise, it sounded like thunder! The turkey was scared and quickly gathered his family and started running away. 
After they ran for a while, they suddenly stopped: they had reached a warm and cozy cave. The turkey felt safe now, he had thought ahead and found shelter for his family. 
The turkey was so proud of himself. He had been scared, but he didn't give up and had taken care of his family. They all stayed in the cave, warm and safe. It was perfect!
