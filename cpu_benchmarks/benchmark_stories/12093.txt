Once upon a time, there was a big apple tree. It had many apples on it. One day, a little girl came to the tree and asked for an apple. The apple tree was happy to give her an apple.
The little girl took a bite of the apple and it split in two. She was surprised! She had never seen an apple split like that before.
The apple tree told the little girl about its history. It was very old and had been there for a long time. It was famous for giving the best apples in the whole town. The little girl was very happy to hear the story and thanked the apple tree for the delicious apple.
