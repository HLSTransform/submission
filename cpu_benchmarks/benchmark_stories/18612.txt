Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play outside in the wild fields. One day, Benny saw a pretty flower called a poppy. He wanted to pick it, but it was too high for him to reach. Benny tried to jump, but he couldn't get it. Suddenly, Benny heard a loud noise and saw a big scary bird. Benny was scared and wanted to escape. He ran as fast as he could and finally found a safe place to hide. Benny was happy to be safe and decided to never pick a poppy again.
