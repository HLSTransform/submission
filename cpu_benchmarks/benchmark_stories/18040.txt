Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, she found a big bowl in the kitchen. It was so big that she could fit inside it! She thought it was so funny to sit in the bowl and pretend she was a giant.
Lily's mom came in and saw her sitting in the bowl. She thought it was funny too, so she decided to play along. They took turns sitting in the bowl and pretending to be different things, like a boat or a hat. They had so much fun together!
After a while, Lily's dad came home from work. He saw them playing with the bowl and thought it looked like a lot of fun. So, he joined in too! They all laughed and played together until it was time for dinner. Lily went to bed that night feeling happy and loved, knowing that even a simple bowl could bring so much joy and fun.
