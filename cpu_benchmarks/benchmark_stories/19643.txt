Mommy and her daughter were looking for something fun to do. Mommy opened the closet and said, "Let's play a game!" Her daughter smiled with excitement and ran over to the closet. There were lots of organized boxes and her daughter couldn't wait to pick out a game. Mommy helped her take out one of the boxes and they opened it together. Inside were pieces that mommy and her daughter put together to make a special game. Mommy and her daughter played the game for a few hours and both had a lot of fun. They were so happy that mommy found such an organized game.
