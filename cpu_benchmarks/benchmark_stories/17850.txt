Once there was a boy named Tim who was three years old. He was in a new class and was feeling a bit scared.
One day, Tim asked his teacher if he could play with the other children. The teacher said yes and asked Tim to be kind and accept everybody. Tim said he would, and tried his best.
He soon made new friends in the class. Together, they learned how to do new useful things. They drew pictures and coloured. They talked about animals and plants. And they even had fun playing games.
Tim was very happy in his new class. He enjoyed spending time with his new friends. He was so glad that he had accepted everybody and that he had made new friends.
