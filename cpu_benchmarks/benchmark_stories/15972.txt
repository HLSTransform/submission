Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her magnet. It was a shiny thing that could stick to metal things like her fridge. 
One day, Lily's friend came over to play. They both wanted to play with the magnet, but there was only one. Lily thought for a moment and then said, "Let's share the magnet!" 
Her friend was happy to share and they took turns playing with the magnet. But then, Lily's friend accidentally dropped the magnet on the ground. It was very hot because it had been in the sun. 
Lily quickly picked up the magnet and said, "Be careful! It's hot!" They both decided to take a break from playing with the magnet and went outside to play in the cool shade instead.
