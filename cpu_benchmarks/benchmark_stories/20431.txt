Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear her pink vest when she went outside to play. One day, Lily's mom told her that she had to stay inside because it was raining outside. Lily was sad because she wanted to play with her friends.
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Lily's friend, Tommy, was standing outside with a big smile on his face. "Hi Lily, do you want to come over to my house and play?" he asked. Lily was so happy that she forgot about the rain and put on her vest.
When they got to Tommy's house, they decided to play with his toy cars. But one of the cars was spoiled and wouldn't move. Tommy tried to fix it, but he couldn't. "Let's play something else," said Lily. "I know, let's rock back and forth on the rocking chair!" They had so much fun that they forgot about the rain and played until it stopped. From that day on, Lily and Tommy were the best of friends.
