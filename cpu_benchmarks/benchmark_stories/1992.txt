Once upon a time, there was a small pumpkin. He was very loud and wished to act like all the other pumpkins. One day, he tried to climb the pumpkin patch, but he was always too big, too round and too heavy.
The pumpkin felt so sad that everyone laughed at him, so he started to act differently. He wanted to do something special and make himself proud.
Suddenly, the little pumpkin had an idea! He opened his mouth and screamed as loud as he could. Everyone was very surprised to see a pumpkin making so much noise! And soon, everyone began to laugh once more.
The little pumpkin felt happy he had found a way to act like the others. He realized he should never be ashamed of being different and instead embrace it! This is the lesson the little pumpkin has taught us: it's good to be loud and proud of our differences.
