Ben and Mia are twins. They like to play at the beach. They make sand castles and look for shells. They splash in the water and laugh.
One day, they see a big boat on the water. It has a sail and a flag. They wonder what is on the boat. They ask their mom.
"Mom, what is on the boat?" Ben asks.
"Maybe some people or some animals or some things," mom says. "We don't know. The boat is far away."
"Can we go to the boat, mom?" Mia asks.
"No, we can't," mom says. "The boat is not on the shore. The shore is where the sand and the water meet. The boat is in the deep water. The deep water is not safe for us."
Ben and Mia are sad. They want to see the boat. They look at the boat for a long time. They imagine what is on the boat.
Soon, the sun goes down. The sky turns pink and purple. The boat looks smaller and smaller. Ben and Mia are sleepy. They yawn and rub their eyes.
"Come on, kids," mom says. "It's time to go home. We had a fun day at the beach. Maybe we will see the boat again another day."
Ben and Mia nod. They hold mom's hand. They walk to the car. They say goodbye to the boat. They fall asleep on the way home. They dream of the boat and the shore.
