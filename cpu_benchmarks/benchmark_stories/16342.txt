Once upon a time, there was a loyal bird named Blue. Blue loved to fly high in the sky. Every day, Blue would fly and play with his friends.
One day, Blue saw a shiny thing on the floor. He flew down to see what it was. It was a pretty ring. Blue wanted to find out who the ring belonged to, so he could give it back.
Blue asked all his friends if they lost a ring. Finally, he found the owner, a little girl named Lily. Lily was so happy to get her ring back. She thanked Blue for being so kind and loyal.
Blue felt very proud for doing the right thing. He learned that helping others is important. From that day on, Blue always tried to help his friends and be a good bird.
And so, Blue and Lily became best friends. They played together every day. The moral of the story is to always be kind, loyal, and help others.
