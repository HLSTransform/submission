Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a special tool. It was a toy shovel. He liked to play with his shovel in the sand. One day, Tim saw a big ice cube. It was very cold.
Tim wanted to make the ice cube go away. He used his toy shovel as a tool to hit the ice cube. It did not work. Tim had an idea. He remembered that the sun can melt things. He put the ice cube under the sun.
Tim waited and watched from a distant spot. As the sun shone on the ice cube, it started to melt. Tim was happy. He knew the sun would help. The ice cube became smaller and smaller until it was all gone. Tim went back to play with his toy shovel in the sand.
