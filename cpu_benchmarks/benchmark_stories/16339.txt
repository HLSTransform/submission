Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, her mommy said, "Lily, we are going to arrive at the store soon. We need to buy some food for dinner." Lily was happy to go to the store with her mommy.
When they arrived at the store, they saw a lot of people. But something was different. There was silence in the store. Lily asked her mommy, "Mommy, why is it quiet here?" Her mommy replied, "The power went out, so the music stopped playing." 
Lily saw a toy that she really wanted, but it was expensive. She asked her mommy if they could buy it. Her mommy said, "I'm sorry, Lily. It's too expensive for us to buy right now." Lily was sad, but she knew that her mommy was right. They bought the food they needed and went back home. 
When they arrived home, they cooked dinner together and had a fun time. Lily forgot about the toy and was happy to spend time with her mommy.
