Timmy was having lots of fun playing with his toy train. He made it chug and zoom all around his bedroom. Suddenly he heard the sound of a real train outside. He was so excited!
Timmy grabbed his toy train and ran out of the house. He followed the sound of the train and ended up at his uncle's farm. There, he saw a beautiful, real train chugging along the tracks.
Timmy watched the train for a long time and almost forgot to eat. But his tummy grumbled and he knew it was time for lunch. Timmy's uncle gave him some food from a nearby diner and he ate it with a big smile.
After lunch, Timmy felt a bit dizzy. He still wanted to ride the train, so his uncle helped him board it. He sat in the passenger car and watched the train speed away until his eyes became so sleepy that he fell asleep. When he woke up, his uncle told him the train ride was over. Timmy was sad, but he had a big smile on his face as he remembered his exciting adventure.
