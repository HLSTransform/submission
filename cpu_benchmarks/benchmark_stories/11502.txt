Once upon a time, there was a clever little boy named Tim. He loved to play with his rubber ball. One day, Tim saw a big crab on the beach. The crab had big claws and was walking funny.
Tim went to the crab and said, "Hello, Mr. Crab! Do you want to play with my rubber ball?" The crab looked at Tim and said, "Yes, I would like to play, but I might pinch the ball with my claws."
Tim thought for a moment and then said, "Don't worry, Mr. Crab. We can play without you pinching the ball. You can use your legs to kick the ball instead."
So, Tim and the crab played together. They kicked the rubber ball back and forth on the beach. They both had a lot of fun. Tim was happy that he made a new friend, and the crab was happy that he didn't pinch the ball.
