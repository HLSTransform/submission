Ben and Lily were playing on the beach. They liked to dig in the sand and find shells. Ben found a big shell that was shiny and had many colors. He was very happy and showed it to Lily.
"Look, Lily, look at my shell! It is so pretty!" Ben said.
But Lily did not look. She was busy digging for her own shell. She wanted to find a bigger and prettier shell than Ben. She ignored Ben and his shell.
Ben felt upset. He wanted Lily to see his shell and say something nice. He tried to get her attention again.
"Lily, Lily, please look at my shell! It is so special!" Ben said.
But Lily still did not look. She dug deeper and deeper in the sand. She ignored Ben and his shell.
Ben felt very upset. He did not want to play with Lily anymore. He took his shell and walked away. He found a spot where he could sit and look at his shell by himself.
Lily finally found a shell. It was small and dull and had a crack. She was not happy with her shell. She looked around for Ben. She wanted to show him her shell and see his shell. But Ben was gone. She could not see him anywhere.
Lily felt upset. She did not want to be alone. She wanted to play with Ben and his shell. She realized that she had been mean to Ben and his shell. She wished she had not ignored him.
She got up and ran to find Ben. She hoped he would forgive her and share his shell with her. She hoped they could still be friends.
