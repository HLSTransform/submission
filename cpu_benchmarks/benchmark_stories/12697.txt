Mama was kind and she wanted to make dinner for her family. She thought of a special design to make the dinner special. She took out her pots and pans and gathered the ingredients she needed. She chopped the vegetables and put them in the pot. She stirred the ingredients together and added salt and pepper to taste. She let the dinner cook until it was ready. 
When the dinner was ready, Mama called her family to the table. Everyone was so happy to see the dinner Mama designed. Every bite was delicious and everyone thanked Mama for her kindness. Mama smiled and was so happy to see her family thankful for the dinner she designed.
