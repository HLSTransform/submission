Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read her favorite novel about a princess who lived in a castle. But Lily didn't always eat healthy food. She loved to eat candy and cake all the time.
One day, Lily's mom noticed that Lily wasn't feeling well. Her tummy hurt and she didn't have any energy to play. Her mom knew that Lily needed to eat healthy food to feel better. So, she made Lily a yummy salad with lots of veggies.
After eating the healthy salad, Lily felt much better. She could play and run around again. Her mom told her that eating healthy food is important to stay strong and healthy. Lily learned her lesson and promised to eat more healthy food. She hugged her mom and they rocked back and forth in a warm embrace.
