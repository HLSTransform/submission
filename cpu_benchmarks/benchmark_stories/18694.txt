Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars. He would make them zoom around the room and pretend they were racing.
One day, Timmy's mommy asked him, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" Timmy replied, "I want to go to university and be a race car driver."
His mommy was very serious and said, "That's a great dream, Timmy. You can do anything you want if you work hard and study."
Timmy smiled and continued to zoom his cars around the room, dreaming of the day he would go to university and become a race car driver.
