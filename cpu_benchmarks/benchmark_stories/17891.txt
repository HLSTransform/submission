Once upon a time, there was an ant who lived in a tree. The ant was very grumpy. He didn't like anyone or anything. Every day, he would stay in the tree sulking.
One day, something really exciting happened. The ant heard a noise and looked down. He saw a 3 year old child standing below the tree. In their hands was a stage and microphone. The child was ready to perform.
The grumpy ant stayed hidden in the tree and watched. He saw the child sing their favourite songs, tell stories, clap, and dance. The ant was so entertained that he forgot about being grumpy for a moment.
The performance was so exciting that the ant made his own performance. He climbed down the tree, waved his antennas and did a little dance. It was unexpected, but the child thought it was funny.
The ant was no longer grumpy. He smiled and waved goodbye as the child went on their way. The ant went back to the tree, feeling happy and entertained.
