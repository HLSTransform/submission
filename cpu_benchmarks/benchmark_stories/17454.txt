Tim and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a large bush with red flowers. They wanted to smell the flowers.
"Look, Lily, pretty flowers!" Tim said.
"Yes, Tim, let's go and see!" Lily said.
They ran to the bush and bent down to smell the flowers. But they did not see the bees that lived in the bush. The bees did not like Tim and Lily. They thought they were trying to take their flowers. The bees came out of the bush and buzzed around Tim and Lily.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tim and Lily cried. "The bees are hurting us!"
They ran away from the bush and to their mom. Their mom saw their faces and arms. They had red spots where the bees had stung them.
"Oh, no, my poor babies!" their mom said. "You are suffering from bee stings. Come, let me put some cream on them. It will make you feel better."
She took them to a bench and put some cream on their spots. She hugged them and kissed them.
"Next time, be careful of the bees," she said. "They don't like it when you go near their bush. They are protecting their home and their food."
Tim and Lily nodded. They learned their lesson. They said sorry to the bees and to the flowers. They decided to play somewhere else. They still liked the park, but they did not go near the large bush again.
