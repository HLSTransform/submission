Once upon a time, there was a bald man who loved to play with his toys. He had a big collection of toy soldiers and tanks, and he would often make them fight in a pretend war. One day, he invited his friend over to play with his toys.
His friend was very excited to see the toys, but he accidentally knocked over a shelf and some of the soldiers fell off. The bald man got angry and told his friend to leave. Later that day, the bald man realized that one of his favorite soldiers was missing.
He searched everywhere, but he couldn't find it. Then he remembered the shelf falling over earlier and realized that his friend must have accidentally removed the soldier. The bald man felt bad for getting angry and went to apologize to his friend. They searched together and finally found the missing soldier. From then on, the bald man and his friend played with the toys together and never had a war again.
