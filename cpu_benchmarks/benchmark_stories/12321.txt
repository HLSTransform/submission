Jimmy was very excited as he opened the door of the cabin. He could finally go inside and explore. He felt ready to see what exciting things he could find!
The cabin was dark and dusty, and Jimmy was a little scared. He wanted to find someone to help him. 
Just when Jimmy was about to cry, he heard a voice coming from deep inside the cabin. 
The voice spoke. "Don't be scared, Jimmy. I'm here to help." 
Jimmy was so relieved and excited at the same time. He asked the voice, "What do I do now?"
The voice replied, "Let's go lock the door. That way, we can explore the cabin together!"
Jimmy gave a big smile and agreed. He ran to the door and helped the voice lock it.
Jimmy looked around the cabin and noticed all the interesting things he could explore. He felt ready to find out more!
