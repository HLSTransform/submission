Once upon a time there was a boy. His name was Jake. Jake was in his backyard playing on the swing. As he was swinging high and higher, he closed his eyes and said "zoom". He opened them back up and kept zooming high. He felt his stomach twirling and he got very dizzy.
When Jake stopped swinging he was feeling very funny in his stomach. It was churning and swirling like a rollercoaster. Jake felt so dizzy that he had to spin in circles. He spun round and round until he finally got his balance back.
When Jake had gotten his balance back he noticed something strange. It was a bright orange butterfly. It was fluttering around him, almost as if it was playing. It flew close to him and then away. Then, suddenly, it zoomed right off! Jake laughed and kept watching it fly off until he could no longer see it.
When Jake got back inside he mentioned the butterfly to his mom and dad. They thought it was so much fun that they took him outside again to look for more butterflies. Though they didn't find any, they had lots of fun searching.
So that's the story of Jake and the butterfly. He still feels a little dizzy from the swing, but his stomach is not twirling anymore. Jake will never forget the fun he had zoom his way around his backyard.
