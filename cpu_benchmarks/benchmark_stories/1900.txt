Once upon a time there was a kind and patient village. In this village lived a girl named Eva.
One day, Eva went to the village store. She asked the shopkeeper for a new toy. He said no. Eva waved her fist and refused, but the shopkeeper was not angry. He was patient.
Next, Eva took a walk around the village. She passed the village pond, the village field and finally the village church. She asked the church Doorkeeper if she could go inside. He said no. Eva crossed her arms and refused, but the Doorkeeper was not angry. He was patient.
Finally, Eva went home. She asked her mum if she could stay up past bedtime. Her mum said no. Eva stamped her foot and refused, but her mum was still kind and patient.
In the end, the village was proud of Eva. They were happy she was so brave, but they were also proud of her for being so patient.
