Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to play with her toy spray bottle. Every day, she would fill it with water and spray her plants in the garden. Mia was a very good helper.
One sunny day, Mia's mom made cookies. She made regular cookies and special cookies. Mia liked the regular cookies best. They were round and sweet, just like the ones she always ate. Mia wanted to share her cookies with her friends.
Mia took her spray bottle and her regular cookies to the park. She found her friends playing near the swings. They were very happy to see Mia and her cookies. She sprayed her friends with the water from her spray bottle, and they all laughed. Then, they sat down and ate the cookies together. It was a fun day for Mia and her friends.
