Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to run and play outside with her friends. One day, Lily's friend won a big trophy for being the fastest runner. Lily was happy for her friend, but she also felt a little jealous.
When Lily got home, she told her mom about her friend's trophy. Her mom said, "It's okay to feel jealous, but it's important to be happy for our friends too." Lily thought about what her mom said and decided to go over to her friend's house to congratulate her.
When she got there, she saw that her friend was frightened because the trophy was dirty and she didn't know how to clean it. Lily remembered that her mom had a special cloth to polish things. She ran home and got the cloth and helped her friend polish the trophy until it was shiny and new again.
Her friend was so happy and thanked Lily for helping her. Lily realized that being kind and helpful to others is more important than winning a trophy. From that day on, Lily always tried to help her friends whenever they needed it.
