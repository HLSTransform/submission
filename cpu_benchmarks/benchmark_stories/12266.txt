Once upon a time, there was a mummy and her little girl. Every day, mummy would take the little girl to the park. One day, the mummy took out a tomato. She said: "Let's surprise Daddy when we get home with this sweet tomato". The little girl was so happy. 
When they got home, Daddy was so surprised to see the sweet tomato. He hugged the little girl and hugged mummy too. The mummy said: "This sweet tomato shows us that it's nice to surprise people". 
The little girl smiled and hugged Daddy again. She felt happy that mummy and she had brought a surprise for Daddy. 
The little girl learned a lesson - it is nice to surprise people, because it makes them happy. It can make us happy too.
