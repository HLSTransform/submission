Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat jam on his toast every morning. He would spread the jam all over his toast until it was covered in a thick layer of sweet, sticky jam.
One day, Timmy's mom went to the store to buy more jam, but she accidentally bought a jar of dull, flavorless jam. Timmy didn't like the new jam and he regretted eating it on his toast every morning.
Timmy started to feel sad and didn't want to eat breakfast anymore. He missed his delicious jam and wished his mom had bought the right kind. But one day, Timmy decided to try the dull jam again. He took a big bite and suddenly felt sick. The dull jam had gone bad and Timmy got very sick. He regretted ever trying the dull jam and wished he had just waited for his mom to buy the right kind.
