Twin squirrels, Lilly and Sammy, were playing in the forest. Lilly hopped up to a log and said, "Let's have a silly race around this log!" Sammy laughed and the two of them started to race around the log. 
All of a sudden they heard a loud noise. A bear was walking towards them! It growled, "Stop! Don't move!" Lilly and Sammy stopped racing.
The bear said, "I want to play too! How about a game of tag?" Lilly and Sammy smiled and nodded. The bear said, "You two hop around the log, and I'll try to catch you. Ready, set, go!"
Lilly and Sammy hopped around the log as fast as they could, and the bear chased after them. The bear was faster than Lilly and Sammy, but they kept hopping and hopping, until they were too far away to be caught. Thoroughly out of breath, Lilly and Sammy panted and watched as the bear slowly walked away.
The moral of the story is that it's important to stay alert and listen to your surroundings, even when you're having fun. If Lilly and Sammy hadn't been playing close attention, they wouldn't have heard the bear coming and wouldn't have been able to get away!
