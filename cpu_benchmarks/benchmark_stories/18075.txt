Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat rice. His mommy would always make him rice for dinner. One day, Timmy went to the park to play. He saw a deep hole in the ground and thought it looked cool. 
Timmy wanted to jump in the hole, but his mommy told him it was too dangerous. She said they would study about holes like that in school. Timmy didn't want to wait for school, he wanted to explore the hole now. 
Later that night, Timmy had a dream about the deep hole. In his dream, he saw a big bag of rice at the bottom of the hole. The next day, Timmy went back to the park with his mommy. He remembered his dream and thought maybe there really was rice in the hole. 
His mommy helped him make a long stick to reach the bottom of the hole. When they finally got to the bottom, they found something even better than rice. It was a treasure chest full of gold coins! Timmy was so happy he listened to his mommy and didn't jump into the deep hole.
