Once upon a time, there was a brave little flower. It lived by the big ocean. The brave flower loved to watch the water go up and down.
One day, the sun was very hot. The brave flower wanted to bloom. It tried very hard, but it was too hot. The flower felt sad.
Then, a kind bird saw the flower. The bird flew to the ocean and got some water. The bird gave the water to the flower. The flower drank the water and started to bloom. The brave flower was very happy, and so was the kind bird. They became good friends by the big ocean.
