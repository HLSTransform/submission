Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She'd heard about a dangerous clown. She wanted to see the clown, so she asked her mom if she could part.
Her mom said yes, and so the little girl parted. She walked and walked until eventually, she saw the dangerous clown. He had an orange nose and a big red smile. He was juggling funny balls and wearing funny shoes.
The little girl laughed and smiled. She asked the clown to juggle for her. The clown was happy to part and juggled the balls high into the air.
The little girl liked the clown very much. Even though he was dangerous, she knew she was safe with him. She gave the clown a big hug and thanked him for taking part in her adventure.
