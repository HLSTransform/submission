Ben and Lily were playing in the living room. They liked to build forts with pillows and blankets. They also liked to pretend they were spies and look for clues.
"Look, Ben, I found a cord!" Lily said, holding a long, thin, black cord. "Where does it go?"
"I don't know. Let's follow it and see!" Ben said, curious. He took one end of the cord and Lily took the other. They started to crawl under the sofa, the table, and the chairs.
The cord was very long and it led them to a dark corner. There was a big box with buttons and lights. It looked unknown and scary.
"What is this, Ben?" Lily asked, feeling nervous.
"I don't know, Lily. Maybe it's a robot or a monster!" Ben said, feeling brave.
They heard a loud noise from the box. It was a voice that said, "Hello, children. I am your new friend. Do you want to play with me?"
Ben and Lily screamed and dropped the cord. They ran back to their fort and hid under the blankets. They did not want to play with the unknown voice. They wanted to play with each other.
