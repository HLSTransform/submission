Lily loved her doll very much. She named her doll Anna and played with her every day. Anna had a large pink dress and long yellow hair. Lily liked to brush Anna's hair and sing to her.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and dad. She brought Anna with her and put her on a bench. Lily saw a swing and ran to it. She asked her dad to push her. She felt happy and laughed.
"Look, Anna, I'm flying!" she shouted to her doll.
But when Lily got off the swing, she saw that Anna was gone. She felt sad and scared. She looked around and saw a boy holding Anna. He was walking away with his mom.
"Hey, that's my doll!" Lily cried. She ran after the boy and tried to get Anna back.
"No, it's mine!" the boy said. He held Anna tight and pulled her hair.
"Stop it, you're hurting her!" Lily said. She felt angry and cried louder.
"Lily, what's wrong?" her mom asked. She came to Lily and saw the boy and the doll.
"Mom, he took my doll!" Lily said. She pointed at the boy.
"Is that true?" her mom asked the boy's mom.
The boy's mom looked surprised and embarrassed. She asked the boy where he got the doll.
"I found it on the bench," the boy said. He lied.
"No, you didn't. You took it from me. I remember," Lily said. She told her mom and the boy's mom what happened.
The boy's mom scolded the boy and made him give the doll back to Lily. She said sorry to Lily and her mom.
Lily hugged Anna and checked her hair and dress. She was glad to have her doll back.
"Thank you, mom," Lily said.
"You're welcome, sweetie. I'm proud of you for remembering and telling the truth," her mom said.
She kissed Lily and Anna and took them to the car. Lily smiled and waved goodbye to the park. She hoped the boy would learn to be nice and not take things that were not his. She was happy to go home with her mom, dad, and Anna.
