Sara loved to play dress-up with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Lily. Lily had long hair and a pretty face. Sara liked to brush her hair and make her wear different clothes.
One day, Sara found a big box in her closet. It had many clothes for Lily. Sara was very happy. She opened the box and saw many colors and fabrics. She saw silk, cotton, lace, and velvet. She touched them and felt how soft they were.
She decided to try them on Lily. She took out a pink silk dress and put it on Lily. It was shiny and smooth, but it was too big for Lily. It fell off her shoulders and dragged on the floor. Sara said, "No, this is not good. You need a smaller dress, Lily."
She took out a blue cotton dress and put it on Lily. It was cozy and warm, but it was too plain for Lily. It had no buttons or ribbons or flowers. Sara said, "No, this is not pretty. You need a fancier dress, Lily."
She took out a white lace dress and put it on Lily. It was delicate and elegant, but it was too scratchy for Lily. It made her skin itch and hurt. Sara said, "No, this is not comfortable. You need a softer dress, Lily."
She looked in the box and saw one more dress. It was a red velvet dress. It was bright and beautiful, and it was just the right size for Lily. It was soft and smooth, and it made Lily feel cozy and happy. Sara said, "Yes, this is perfect. You look lovely, Lily. I choose this dress for you."
She hugged Lily and smiled. She was glad she found the best dress for her doll. She said, "Let's go show Mommy how pretty you are, Lily. She will love your velvet dress."
