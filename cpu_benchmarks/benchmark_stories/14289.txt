Once upon a time there was a witch who wanted to paint. But she didn't have any paint. So she went out looking for some.
She wandered and walked, until suddenly she saw some ready paint in a bush. She was so excited that she thanked the bush for the paint.
The witch took the paint and went to her house. She got all ready to paint. She spread the paint on the wall. 
The paint made beautiful shapes and colours. Suddenly the witch was not alone. A small girl was watching her. 
The girl asked who the witch was and why she was painting. The witch laughed and said she was painting a surprise for the girl.
The little girl was excited and couldn't wait to see her surprise. Then the witch finished painting and showed the little girl - it was a beautiful rainbow! 
The little girl smiled and thanked the witch. She liked the surprise very much and said they should paint again soon. The witch smiled, happy to see the little girl so happy.
