Peggy and her mom were at the park. Peggy was so excited to be there! She saw a tall slide and began to run toward it.
"Woah, wait a minute," her mom said. "Let's relax a bit first."
"Ok," Peggy said. She sat down on the grass and took a deep breath. Her stomach felt calm and relaxed.
"Look at that impressive tree over there!" her mom said, pointing.
Peggy looked up at the tree. It was big, and full of leaves. It was really impressive.
"Can we climb it?" Peggy asked, jumping up and down.
"Maybe later," her mom said with a laugh. She patted Peggy on the head and said, "Let's relax for now. We have lots of time to climb the tree later."
"Ok," Peggy said. She sat down next to her mom and watched the clouds float by. Relaxing felt really good.
