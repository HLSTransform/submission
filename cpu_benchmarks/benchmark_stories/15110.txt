Once upon a time there was a wood. It was big and strong. Inside the wood, there was a little girl. Her name was Jane and she was very independent.
One day, Jane had an idea. She wanted to explore the wood. She gathered some snacks and set off. She ran around, looking at the trees and picking flowers. 
Eventually, she found a clearing. All around the clearing were four big trees. Jane decided to make a secret den. She started to gather wood and build four walls.
After a few hours of hard work, the den was finished. Jane even put a sign on the door. It said "Jane's Den" in big letters. 
Jane spent lots of happy days in her den. She brought snacks and played games until the sun went low in the sky. Eventually, the day would end. But Jane was always ready for the next day.
