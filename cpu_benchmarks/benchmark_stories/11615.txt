The young girl was excited for the day. She put on her shoes, grabbed her diary and jumped out the door. As she stepped into the yard, she felt a light rain, and the grass was wet. She noticed a long stretch of green grass and began to run. As she ran, she started to feel something - a feeling of energy and excitement.
The wet grass tickled her feet and made her laugh. She ran and ran until she could barely breathe, and then she stopped to catch her breath. Suddenly, she felt something else - a sense of anticipation and something special. She leaned forward and looked into the distance.
The young girl saw a rainbow appear. She was overjoyed! She knew that the rainbow would stay for a while and she wanted to remember this moment forever so she opened her diary and wrote down her thoughts and feelings. She knew that no matter how much time passed, she would always remember the special moment when she stretched her legs and saw the rainbow in the sky.
