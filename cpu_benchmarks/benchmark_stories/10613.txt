Once upon a time there was a little rabbit. He lived in a big, green field and he was very happy. But one day, snow started to fall. The rabbit was scared and he started to tremble.
He went to find his best friend, the bear. He knew that the bear was brave and he would know what to do. When the rabbit found the bear, he said, "Bear, it's snowing! I am scared! What should I do?"
The bear thought for a moment, then he said, "Rabbit, don't be scared. Snow can be smelly at times, but it's good. Let's go play in the snow!" 
So the two friends went to play in the snow and the rabbit was no longer scared. They had lots of fun and the rabbit learned that sometimes things that seem scary can be fun and exciting. 
Moral of the story: Don't be scared of things that seem scary - they can end up being fun and exciting!
