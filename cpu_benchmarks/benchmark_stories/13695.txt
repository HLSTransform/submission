Once upon a time, there was a bird. The bird liked to fly high in the sky and soar over the trees. One day, the bird saw a dish on the ground. The bird thought it was a tasty treat and tried to eat it. But the dish was too big for the bird's beak. 
The bird felt sorry for trying to eat the dish. It flew away and found some berries to eat instead. The bird learned that not everything it sees is good to eat. From then on, the bird only looked at things from afar and continued to soar in the sky. The end.
