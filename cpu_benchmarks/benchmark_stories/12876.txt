Ben and his dad were walking along a path together. Ben was very excited, as he had never seen a gate before. "What is that, Daddy?" Ben asked. 
"It's a gate", Daddy replied.  
They went closer, and Ben ran his hand over the gate. The gate felt rough and Ben made a funny face.
"It's not soft like the grass", Ben said. 
Daddy agreed and explained that the gate was made out of steel. He told Ben that the gate was there to keep things safe from strangers who might try to come in. 
Ben kept looking at the gate. Daddy continued to explain what a gate is and why it's important. 
Suddenly, Ben noticed that the gate was opening slowly. He asked his dad what was happening. 
Daddy replied, "The gate is opening because someone pushed the button to increase the opening." 
Ben was amazed! He took a few steps back and watched, clapping his hands excitedly. The gate opened wider and wider until it was completely open. 
Ben and Daddy smiled at each other. Ben had learned a lot about gates today.
