Once upon a time there was a little girl. Her name was Jenny. She wanted to have a special place for her friends to gather and play.
Jenny and her friends decided to build an igloo. They worked together to make a big, round, snow igloo. When they were done, they stepped inside. It was cozy and peaceful.
Jenny's friends were all very happy with their igloo. After they had been playing and exploring, they got all dirty and cold. So Jenny said it was time to wash up.
They all went outside and ran to the nearby lake. They splashed around and washed their hands and faces in the cold water. Jenny's friends were so excited that they even made a little game out of it.
They stayed in the lake until all of them were clean. When they were done, they ran back to their igloo, laughing and feeling refreshed. 
That night, everyone shared stories and snacks in the cozy and peaceful igloo. Jenny and her friends had so much fun that they all decided to get together like that every week.
