Once upon a time, there was an otter who enjoyed living near the river. He liked to play in the river with his friends.
One day, the otter noticed that a big boat was coming down the river. It was very loud and made lots of noise. Afraid that his friends had gone away, he looked all around the river for them. But he couldn't find them.
The otter was sad and he wanted to find his friends. He started to hope that his friends were okay and that he would find them. 
So, he hopped from rock to rock, until he finally found them. They were happily playing together! 
The otter was so happy to have found his friends and to know that they were safe. He smelled them, rubbed his nose on each one, and hugged them. 
The otter was so glad that he had the chance to see them again. Together they all enjoyed playing, splashing, and laughing in the river. They never got too loud because they wanted to keep their secret spot safe.
