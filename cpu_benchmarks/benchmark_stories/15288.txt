Once upon a time there was a small beetle who lived in a cozy home. He was very comfortable. Every day the beetle would leave his house to explore the world outside.
One day while he was exploring, a big storm started. The beetle was scared because he didn't know how to get home. Just then, he spotted a friendly caterpillar. The caterpillar saw the beetle was scared and quickly offered to protect him and take him home.
The caterpillar carefully guided the beetle back to his cozy home and kept it safe from the storm. The beetle was very grateful to the caterpillar for protecting him and offering him a place to be comfortable.
The caterpillar smiled and said, "You're welcome, little beetle. Friends protect each other!"
