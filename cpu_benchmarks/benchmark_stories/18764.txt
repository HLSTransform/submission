Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play near the lake. They saw a fisherman with a big net and a boat. He was catching many fish and putting them in a bucket.
"Can we see the fish?" Lily asked the fisherman.
"Sure, but be careful. They are rough and slippery," the fisherman said. He showed them the fish. They had shiny scales and sharp teeth. Lily and Ben touched them gently.
"Wow, they are so pretty!" Ben said.
The fisherman smiled. "They are, but they are also food. I sell them at the market."
Lily and Ben nodded. They understood. They thanked the fisherman and waved goodbye.
They walked along the lake and saw many flowers. They were yellow, pink, and purple. They smelled sweet and looked soft.
"Look, the flowers are blooming!" Lily said.
"They are so pretty!" Ben said.
They picked some flowers and made a crown for Lily and a necklace for Ben. They put them on and danced around.
They were happy and had fun. They liked the lake and the fisherman and the flowers. They went home and showed their mom and dad their gifts. They hugged them and said they loved them.
