Once upon a time, there was a little animal named Bunny. Bunny was very lonely because he didn't have any friends to play with. One day, Bunny saw a beautiful butterfly and he wanted to play with it. Bunny tried to catch the butterfly, but he couldn't. Bunny thought if he could throw something at the butterfly, he could catch it.
So, Bunny found a rock and threw it at the butterfly. But the rock missed and hit a bird instead. The bird was hurt and Bunny felt very sad. Bunny realized that it wasn't right to throw things at animals, even if he wanted to play with them. Bunny learned that animals should be treated with kindness and respect.
From that day on, Bunny made friends with the bird and they played together every day. Bunny was no longer lonely and he was happy that he learned an important lesson about being kind to animals.
