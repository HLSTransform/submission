Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big cable hanging from a tree. It looks like a snake, but it is not. It is harmless.
"Let's catch the cable!" Lily says. "It will be fun!"
Ben nods. He likes to catch things. They run to the tree and grab the cable. They pull and swing on it. They laugh and shout.
But then, the cable breaks. It makes a loud noise. Lily and Ben fall to the ground. They are scared and hurt.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lily cries. "My knee is bleeding!"
"Me too!" Ben says. "My elbow is sore!"
They look at the cable. It is not harmless. It is bad. It has wires and sparks inside. It is dangerous.
"Help, help!" Lily and Ben call. "We need help!"
A man hears them. He is a worker. He is fixing the cable. He runs to them. He sees the broken cable and the children.
"Oh no!" he says. "What have you done? This cable is very important. It gives power to the lights and the machines. You should not touch it. It can hurt you."
He picks up Lily and Ben. He takes them to his truck. He gives them bandages and water. He calls their parents. He is sorry and angry.
Lily and Ben are sorry and ashamed. They did not know. They just wanted to play. They learned a lesson. They will never catch a cable again.
