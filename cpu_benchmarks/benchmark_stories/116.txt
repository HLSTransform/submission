Once upon a time, there was a poor neighbor who had a big cat. The cat was very fat and heavy, so the neighbor wanted to weigh it. She took the cat to the store where they had a big scale. She put the cat on the scale and saw that it weighed 20 pounds! 
The neighbor was very surprised because the cat was so heavy. She decided to put the cat on a diet so it could lose weight. She gave the cat less food and more exercise, like playing with toys. 
After a few weeks, the cat lost some weight and the neighbor was very happy. She weighed the cat again and saw that it now weighed 15 pounds. The cat was much healthier and happier, and the neighbor was proud of herself for helping her furry friend.
