Lila and Ben like to play with blocks. They make towers and houses and cars with the blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes.
One day, they decide to make a club with the blocks. They find a big box and put some blocks inside. They add more and more blocks until the box is full. Then they put a sign on the box that says "Lila and Ben's Club". They are very happy with their club.
But then, Tom comes and sees the club. He wants to join the club, but Lila and Ben say no. They say the club is only for them. Tom gets angry and tries to take the box away. He pulls and pulls, but the box is too heavy. He cannot move it.
"Let me in the club!" Tom says.
"No, you can't!" Lila and Ben say.
They start to argue and shout. They do not have fun anymore.
Then, Mom comes and sees the mess. She is not happy. She tells them to stop fighting and share the blocks. She says they can all play together and make a bigger club. She helps them move the box to a bigger space and gives them more blocks. She shows them how to make a door and a window and a roof for the club.
Lila and Ben and Tom listen to Mom. They say sorry to each other and start to build the club. They use the blocks to make walls and furniture and decorations. They have fun and play nicely. They invite Mom to join the club. They are very happy with their club.
