Once upon a time there was a big dragon. It had a huge head and fire would come out of its mouth. The dragon lived high up in a mountain and it always looked very angry.
One day, a brave knight rode up to the mountain and stood in front of the dragon. He was ready to fight the dragon, but he did not have to. The dragon said "it is time for me to release the fire inside me".
The knight was surprised. He wanted to know how the dragon was going to do that. The dragon said "Just wait a little bit." So the brave knight waited.
And then, a huge burst of light surrounded the dragon. It was like its head opened up, and all the fire inside was released out into the world. The dragon smiled and it looked very happy.
The brave knight was amazed. He said "you look so different". The dragon said "Yes, now I am free". Then the knight and the dragon became good friends.
