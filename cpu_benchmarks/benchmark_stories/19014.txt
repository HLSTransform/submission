Once upon a time, there was a farmer named John. John had a big farm where he grew many things. One day, John decided to grow some corn. He dug holes in the ground and put the corn seeds inside. After a few days, the corn started to grow. It was so tall and green! 
One day, John saw something unusual. One of the corn plants had a red ear of corn! John had never seen a red ear of corn before. He was so surprised and happy. He picked the red ear of corn and showed it to his family. They were amazed too. 
From that day on, John always tried to grow red corn. He loved the way it looked and how it made him feel. He knew that growing corn was hard work, but it was worth it when he saw the beautiful red corn growing in his fields.
