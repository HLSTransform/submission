One day, a squirrel and a mouse were looking for food in the forest. The squirrel saw a big tree with many acorns. He ran to the tree and started to work. He picked up the acorns and put them in his mouth. He was very happy.
The mouse saw the squirrel and said, "Hello, friend. Can I have some acorns too? I am very hungry."
The squirrel looked at the mouse and said, "No, you cannot. These are my acorns. I work hard to get them. You are too small and slow. You cannot work like me. Go away, stupid mouse."
The mouse felt sad and angry. He said, "You are not a good friend. You are greedy and mean. You do not share your food. You are a stupid squirrel."
The squirrel did not care. He kept working and eating the acorns. He did not see the fox that was hiding behind a bush. The fox saw the squirrel and the acorns. He licked his lips and said, "Mmm, what a tasty snack. A fat squirrel and some crunchy acorns. I will work to catch them."
The fox jumped out of the bush and ran to the tree. The squirrel saw the fox and was scared. He dropped the acorns and tried to run away. But the fox was faster and caught the squirrel. He bit the squirrel and said, "Thank you for your work, stupid squirrel. You made my lunch easy."
The mouse saw the fox and the squirrel. He felt sorry for the squirrel, but he also felt glad. He said, "Maybe now you will learn to share your food and be a good friend. Goodbye, stupid squirrel."
The mouse picked up some of the acorns that the squirrel had dropped. He ate them and felt full and happy. He said, "These are good acorns. I did not work to get them, but I am not greedy or mean. I will share them with my friends. I am a smart mouse."
