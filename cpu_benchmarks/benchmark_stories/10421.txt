Once upon a time, there were two young brothers. They were playing in a swamp near their house. The older brother accidentally stepped on the younger brother’s foot. The younger brother started crying and the older brother felt so sorry. He said “I’m sorry, can you forgive me?” 
The younger brother stopped crying. He hugged his brother and said, “I forgive you.” 
Then the older brother said, “Swamp or not, I will always take care of you.” 
The younger brother smiled and said, “Me too,” and the two brothers hugged and ran off to play in the swamp.
The two brothers had learned an important lesson. It was to always forgive one another and never be too young to care for each other.
