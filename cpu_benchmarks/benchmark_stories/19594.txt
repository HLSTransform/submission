Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jojo. Jojo had a brother named Ben. Ben liked to tease Jojo.
One day, Jojo and Ben were in the bathroom. Ben saw the toilet and thought it was very funny. Ben started to tease Jojo and said that she had to sit on the toilet. Jojo didn't want to, so she started to cry.
But then Jojo's mom heard the noise. She came in and saw what was happening. She said to Ben that he was not being nice. She said he must be flexible and not tease Jojo.
Ben apologized to Jojo and they hugged. Jojo was happy again. She thanked her mom and they all went to do something else.
The end.
