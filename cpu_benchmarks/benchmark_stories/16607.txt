Lily and Ben like to play football in the park. They have a big ball that is red and white. They kick the ball to each other and run after it. Sometimes they fall down, but they laugh and get up.
One day, they see a big dog in the park. The dog is black and brown and has sharp teeth. The dog sees the ball and runs to it. Lily and Ben are scared. They want their ball back, but the dog is faster and stronger.
"Hey, that's our ball!" Ben shouts at the dog. He tries to grab the ball, but the dog bites his hand. Ben screams and lets go of the ball. He looks at his hand and sees blood. It hurts a lot.
Lily runs to Ben and hugs him. She cries and says, "Ben, are you okay? We need to find mom and dad. They can help you."
But mom and dad are not in the park. They are at work. Lily and Ben are alone. They don't know what to do. They look at the dog, who is still playing with the ball. The dog growls and barks at them. He doesn't want to share the ball.
Lily and Ben are sad and scared. They lost their ball and their fun. Ben's hand is hurt and bleeding. They wish they never saw the dog. They wish they stayed home.
