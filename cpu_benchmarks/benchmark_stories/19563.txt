Once upon a time there was a daddy, a mummy and a baby. They were a family. They went for a walk together. On their walk, they noticed a pipe in the ground. The baby was so glad! It clapped its hands. Daddy said the pipe was a special one that helped the water run to their house. Mummy showed the baby how the pipe worked. Then she said that it was time for their walk to end. The baby was sad, but it had learned something new. It was very glad. They all went home and had a great time together.
