Jacky saw the jar on the counter. They were thin and shiny. He asked his Mom, "What's in the jar?"
His Mom said, "It's honey! Do you want to see how it melts?"
Jacky nodded his head. His Mom found a spoon and put it into the jar. She slowly lowered the spoon into the honey, then pulled it out. The honey slowly dripped off the spoon and melted back into the jar.
Jacky was so excited to see how the honey melted. He watched as the honey went from being thick in the jar, to slowly dripping off the spoon like a little river.
Jacky asked his Mom, "Can I do that?"
His Mom said, "Yes, you can try too."
Jacky grabbed a spoon and carefully dipped it into the honey. He pulled it out and watched as the honey danced off the spoon and melted back into the jar. He smiled with glee as he watched the honey transform from thick and sticky in the jar to a thin liquid as it melted onto the spoon.
