Once upon a time, there were two friends called Sam and Max. Sam was very excited for a party.
"I can't wait for the party tonight!" Sam exclaimed.
But Max was worried. 
"I don't have a band. What if everyone else wears one?".
Sam had an idea. 
"Let's make our own!" they said together.
So they set out to make their own band. They gathered some sticks and string and soon they had made a wide band.
Max tried it on. "I love it!"
Soon, they arrived at the party. Max felt so happy to have gained a band.
"You look great!" said Sam.
Max beamed with pride. "Thanks!"
