Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a fancy comb that she liked to use to brush her hair. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. While playing, she lost her fancy comb.
Lily was very sad because she loved her fancy comb. She asked her friends if they had seen it, but they hadn't. Suddenly, she saw a little boy holding her fancy comb. She ran to him and said, "That's my fancy comb! Can I have it back, please?"
The little boy smiled and gave Lily her fancy comb back. Lily was so happy to have her comb again. She said, "Thank you so much! I'm glad to have my fancy comb back." Her friends were happy too and they all continued to play together.
