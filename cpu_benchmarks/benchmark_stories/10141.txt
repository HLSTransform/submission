Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy car that she loved to zoom around the room. One day, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her toys, but Lily didn't want to stop playing with her car. 
Mom got frustrated because Lily wasn't listening. She told Lily that if she didn't clean up, she would have to be punished. Lily didn't want to be punished, so she quickly picked up her other toys. 
After she was done, Lily felt proud of herself for listening to her mom. She decided to zoom her car around the room as a reward for being a good listener.
