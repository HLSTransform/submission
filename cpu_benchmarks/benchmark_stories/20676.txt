On Tuesday, something special appeared. It was big and had a lot of windows. Mama said it was a bus. The bus was very busy. Mama loaded everyone in and sat down. She said they were all going on an adventure. They drove and drove until they stopped in a big park. Everyone climbed down and ran around. Everyone had so much fun playing and talking. In no time, it was time to go back on the bus. Mama said they would remember the busy Tuesday forever.
