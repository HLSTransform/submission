Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a loyal dog named Spot. Spot loved to play fetch and always carried his favorite bag with him.
One day, Timmy and Spot went for a walk in the woods. They saw a squirrel up in a tree. Timmy said, "I want to shoot that squirrel." Spot barked and wagged his tail, but Timmy didn't listen.
Later that day, they came across a group of hunters. Timmy saw that they had guns and bags too. The hunters asked if they had seen any squirrels. Timmy said no, but Spot started barking and pointing at the tree with the squirrel. The hunters followed Spot's lead and were able to shoot the squirrel. They were very grateful to Spot for his help and gave him a big bone. Timmy learned that it's better to be loyal to your friends than to shoot them.
