Once upon a time, there was a boy. His name was Jack. He liked to play with his toys.
One day his mommy said, "Let us get a tank Jack!"
Jack was so excited! He wanted to have a tank and said, "Yes!"
They went to the store and Jack found the perfect tank. He wanted it so badly. His mommy said, "We will get it if you are obedient."
Jack was very obedient. He said, "Okay Mommy." So his mommy said, "Let's get it."
Jack had the best tank ever! He played with it every day. He was very proud of his tank. He was a very obedient boy and that made his mommy proud.
