Billy was walking in the park. His mom said, "Don't go far, Billy." He nodded and waved good bye.
Billy poked his toes in the grass. It felt soft and warm. Then, he looked up. The sky was very blue and sunny. He skipped around and felt excited. He wanted to explore.
Suddenly, he heard a noise. He looked around and saw a little animal. Its ears were long and shiny. "What is this?" He thought to himself.
Billy reached out to touch it. The animal made a loud yelp. It was hot! He jumped back, startled. 
The animal started to move away. Billy said, "Wait!" He chased after it. He felt restless with excitement.
Billy followed the animal until it stopped by a little pond. He poked the water with his finger. Some lily pads floated up. 
The animal nudged Billy's leg. It was a friendly gesture. Billy smiled and said, "I'm glad I found you!" 
Billy and the animal stayed and played together all day. He was sure to tell his mom all about it when he went home.
