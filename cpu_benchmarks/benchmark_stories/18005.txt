Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the garden with her friends. One day, while playing, they saw a hedge that was torn. 
Lily's friend asked, "Who tore the hedge?" 
Lily saw a deaf squirrel nearby and said, "Maybe the deaf squirrel did it by accident." 
Her friend replied, "But it's still not good to tear things." 
Lily realized her mistake and said, "You're right. We should always be careful and not tear things." 
From that day on, Lily and her friends always made sure to be careful and not tear anything. They learned that it's important to take care of the things around us.
