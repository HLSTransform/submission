Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and toys all day long. One day, her mom gave her a letter to give to her dad. Lily put the letter in her pocket and went to play.
Later that day, Lily's dad came home and asked if she had given him the letter. Lily couldn't find the letter in her pocket and started to cry. She went to her room and sat on her bed, feeling very sad.
Lily's mom came in and asked her what was wrong. Lily told her that she lost the letter and she regretted not giving it to her dad. Her mom told her not to worry and that they could write another letter. Lily felt better and promised to be more serious about important things in the future.
