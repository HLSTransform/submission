Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big truck with a picture of ice-cream on it. The truck makes a loud sound. Lily and Tom run to the truck.
"Hello, little ones. Do you want some ice-cream?" the man in the truck asks.
"Yes, please!" Lily and Tom say.
The man gives them each a cone with a scoop of ice-cream. Lily chooses chocolate and Tom chooses vanilla. They say thank you and walk away.
The ice-cream is icy and sweet. Lily and Tom lick their cones and smile. They sit on a bench and enjoy their treat.
"Tom, this is the best ice-cream ever. I wish I could own it all," Lily says.
"Me too, Lily. But we can't own it all. We have to share with others," Tom says.
"Why?" Lily asks.
"Because sharing is nice. And ice-cream is nicer when you have a friend to eat it with," Tom says.
Lily thinks for a moment. Then she nods.
"You are right, Tom. Sharing is nice. And you are my best friend. Here, you can have a bite of my chocolate ice-cream," Lily says.
"Thank you, Lily. You can have a bite of my vanilla ice-cream," Tom says.
They swap their cones and take a bite. They laugh and hug.
Lily and Tom are happy. They love ice-cream. And they love each other.
