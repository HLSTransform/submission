Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted to do something special. So he gathered his friends to discuss what to do.
The friends talked and thought until they all decided to build a big castle. They discussed how to organize the steps to build it.
First, they would get some big blocks. Then they would use the blocks to build the walls. Next, they would find some chairs to put inside the castle. Finally, they would find a flag and put it on top of the castle.
The friends were very excited. Each day they would take a step closer to finishing the castle. They worked hard and the castle was soon finished! 
The friends were so happy with the organized steps they had taken. Finally, they could play with the castle and they celebrated.
