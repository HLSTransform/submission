Lily liked to climb. She climbed on the sofa, on the bed, on the chair. She climbed on the slide, on the swing, on the ladder. She climbed everywhere she could.
One night, she looked out of the window and saw the stars. They were bright and shiny and pretty. She wanted to climb to the stars and touch them. She wondered if they were soft or hard, warm or cold, smooth or spiky.
She asked her mom, "Can I climb to the stars?" Her mom smiled and said, "No, sweetie, the stars are very far away. You can't climb to them, but you can make a wish on them."
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I wish for a yummy snack." Her mom laughed and said, "That's a good wish. Come on, let's go to the kitchen and see what we have."
They went to the kitchen and found some cookies and milk. Lily was happy and said, "Thank you, mom. This is a yummy snack. And thank you, stars, for making my wish come true." She ate her cookies and drank her milk and gave her mom a big hug. Then she went to bed and dreamed of climbing to the stars.
