Tom and Lily were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big pie on a window. It smelled nice. It had red and yellow fruit on it.
"Let's eat the pie," Tom said. "It looks yummy."
"But that is not our pie," Lily said. "It is someone else's pie. We cannot take it. That is stealing."
Tom did not listen. He ran to the window and grabbed the pie. He ran back to Lily. "Come on, let's go," he said.
But then they heard a loud voice. It was the lady who made the pie. She saw Tom and Lily with her pie. She was angry. She shouted at them. "Hey, you two! Give me back my pie! You are stealing!"
Tom and Lily were scared. They dropped the pie and ran away. The pie fell on the ground and broke. It was a mess. The lady was sad. She had worked hard to make the pie. She wanted to share it with her family.
Tom and Lily felt bad. They knew they had done something wrong. They said sorry to each other. They decided to never steal again. They learned that stealing is not nice.
