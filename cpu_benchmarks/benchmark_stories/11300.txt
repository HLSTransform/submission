Once there was a little girl named Suzy. She was only three and very impatient. Everywhere she went she was always in such a hurry. Her mama was often telling her to slow down and behave.
One day Suzy and her family went to the factory. Mama warned Suzy to be careful and not run. Suzy tried to take it slow - but she was so eager to explore the factory.
At the factory, Suzy saw lots of things but didn't understand them all. She saw workers unloading things from big trucks, and pushed buttons on a big machine. Suzy asked her mama what was going on. Mama explained that the factory made lots of things and the workers were busy making sure everything was done. Then she said, “We must hurry and go - it’s getting late.” But Suzy was still curious and she said, “Mama, can I stay here longer? Please!”
Mama said, “No. We need to go now. You must be patient and behave.” With that, Suzy and her family left the factory. Suzy was disappointed, but she did as she was told and behaved.
