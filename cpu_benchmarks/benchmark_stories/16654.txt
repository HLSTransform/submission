Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One night, as she walked outside, she saw a big bird with big eyes. It was an owl! Lily thought it was so cool to observe the owl. 
But then, the owl flew down and picked up a slimy, disgusting worm. Lily didn't like that. She thought the worm was yucky. 
The owl looked at Lily and hooted. Lily waved goodbye and ran back inside to tell her mommy about the owl she observed. Even though the worm was disgusting, Lily thought the owl was still pretty neat.
