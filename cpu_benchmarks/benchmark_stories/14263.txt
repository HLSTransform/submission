Once upon a time there was a small bear. The bear was very happy, but he was also very curious. He wanted to try something new that day.
He found some smoke and decided to spin around in it. He spun and he spun and he spun until he got dizzy. He laughed and laughed but then he started to cough. 
The smoke was very long and soon he couldn't see the sun. He spun around even more, but the smoke just wouldn't go away. He waved his paw around, but nothing worked.
"Help!" he cried, but no one came. The small bear was all alone and soon the smoke got thicker and thicker. He started to spin faster and faster, but the smoke just stayed there.
The small bear was scared and sad. He kept spinning and spinning until he was too tired to spin anymore. But the smoke never went away.
The small bear was never seen again. He was lost in the long smoke forever.
