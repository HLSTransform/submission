Tim and his dad love to fix things. They have a big van with many tools and parts. They help people who have broken cars or bikes or machines.
One day, they get a call from Mrs. Lee. She says her oven is not working. She needs to bake a cake for her son's birthday. Tim and his dad say they will come right away.
They drive to Mrs. Lee's house in their van. They see her oven in the kitchen. It is cold and dark. Tim's dad opens the oven and looks inside. He says there is a problem with the wire. He takes out his tools and starts to fix it.
Tim wants to help too. He asks his dad what he can do. His dad says he can hold the flashlight and hand him the tools. Tim feels great. He likes to work with his dad. He holds the flashlight and gives his dad the tools he needs.
Soon, the oven is fixed. It is warm and bright. Mrs. Lee is very happy. She thanks Tim and his dad. She says they are great. She gives them a piece of cake. It is yummy. Tim and his dad smile. They say goodbye and get back in their van. They drive away, looking for the next thing to fix.
