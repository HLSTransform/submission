Once upon a time there was a mommy and a daddy. They wanted to go on a big trip, but they had to find a way to keep their food cold. So they went to the store, and bought a big cooler. 
When they got home, they put all their yummy food inside the cooler. It was nice and cool and they were ready to go on their trip! 
But they soon realised they needed to take an extra step to prevent their food from going bad. So Daddy put a thick heavy blanket over the cooler. 
This kept their food nice and cold and made sure it didn't get too hot from the sun. But it also made their blanket very filthy.
Mommy and Daddy decided that it was ok for the blanket to be a bit dirty, because it was doing a very important job - it was helping to prevent their food from getting ruined. 
The end.
