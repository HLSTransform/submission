Mum and Dad were getting ready for work. Dad put on his smart shirt and grabbed his keys. Mum put on her shoes and grabbed her bag. They both went downstairs.
In the kitchen, Dad filled the coffee pot with hot water. He then poured the coffee into it. Mum switched on the machine and it started to make a noisy noise!
Dad pored the hot, strong coffee into two cups. The smell of coffee was filling the kitchen. Then they both put some milk and sugar into their coffee.
Mum and Dad smiled at each other as they both enjoyed their coffee. They said goodbye and left for work.
