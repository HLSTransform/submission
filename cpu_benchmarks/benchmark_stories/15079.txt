Mama and baby bear were out on a search. Mama bear was carrying a large basket in her hands. Suddenly, she saw the most yummy honey in the beehive. She could not believe her eyes; the honey was so delicious!
Mama bear was filled with excitement. She looked at baby bear, who was still standing beside her, and exclaimed, "Look, baby bear! Weâ€™ve found the most yummy honey! We will have a feast tonight, I promise!"
Baby bear smiled and danced around. His little tummy was already rumbling with anticipation.
Mama bear carefully collected the honey with her basket and started for home. As soon as she got home, she got to work, preparing a sweet treat for them with the yummy honey.
They both sat down to enjoy their treat. Then, with satisfaction, Mama bear said, "We have been supplied with the most yummy honey ever!" 
Baby bear smiled, content and happy.
