Lily and Ben are young friends who like to play outside. One day, they see a big pile of snow in the park. They run to the snow and start to make a snowman.
"Look, Ben, I found a hat for our snowman!" Lily says. She puts a red hat on the snowman's head.
"Good, Lily! And I found a carrot for his nose!" Ben says. He sticks a orange carrot in the snowman's face.
They give the snowman two black stones for eyes and a smile. They are very happy with their snowman. He looks funny and friendly.
But then, the sun comes out and shines on the snow. The snow starts to melt and drip. The snowman gets smaller and smaller.
"Oh no, our snowman is turning into water!" Lily cries.
"Don't be sad, Lily. We can make another snowman when it snows again." Ben says.
They hug each other and say goodbye to their snowman. They hope he will come back soon. They go home and drink hot chocolate. They are still friends.
