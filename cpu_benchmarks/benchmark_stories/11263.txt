Once there was a boy named John. John was three years old. He lived in a house with his family. 
One day, John wanted to buy some chocolate. He asked his mom for money to pay for the chocolate. She gave him some money from her wallet and said, "Be careful with your money and try to pay with exact change."
John ran off to the store with his money. He found the chocolate he was looking for, but he was not sure how much to pay for it. The man at the counter looked at John sadly. He said in a harsh voice, "You should know how much money to pay. You must give me the right amount or you cannot buy the chocolate."
John was very scared. He had to pay the right amount or he could not get the chocolate. But he knew he had enough money. He counted the coins carefully in his hand and then gave them to the man. The man smiled and gave John the chocolate. 
John was happy and thanked the man before running home with his chocolate in his hands.
