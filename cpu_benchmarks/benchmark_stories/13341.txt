Once upon a time, there was a big bear. He had a big case that he carried with him everywhere he went. One day, the bear met a little rabbit. The rabbit asked the bear what was in the big case. The bear didn't know how to answer, so he just shrugged his shoulders. 
The rabbit was curious and asked the bear if he could see what was inside the big case. The bear thought for a moment and then opened the case. Inside, there was a big surprise! It was a bunch of colorful balloons! The rabbit was so excited and asked the bear if he could have one. 
The bear was happy to share and gave the rabbit a big red balloon. The rabbit was so happy that he started to jump up and down. The bear smiled and shrugged his shoulders again, happy to have made a new friend. From that day on, the bear and the rabbit went on many big adventures together with the big case full of balloons.
