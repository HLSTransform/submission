Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went on a walk with her mom. They walked and walked until they found a treasure chest! Lily was so excited and asked her mom if they could open it. 
Her mom said, "Let's see if we can find the key first." They searched and searched until they finally found the key. When they opened the chest, they found a beautiful necklace inside. Lily was so happy and put it on right away. 
But then, Lily started to feel cold. She told her mom, "I'm cold, can we go home now?" Her mom said, "Yes, let's go home." And that's how their adventure ended.
