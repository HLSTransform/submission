Once upon a time, there was a big, friendly dog named Max. Max liked to play with his ball, eat treats, and take long naps in the sun. One day, Max went to a party with his family. At the party, there were many people, yummy foods, and fun games.
Max saw a little girl eating a tasty snack. She had a napkin to keep her hands clean. Max wanted to help her and remember what his mom had taught him. So, he took the napkin with his mouth and gave it to the girl. The girl smiled and said, "Thank you, Max!"
After the party, Max felt tired and happy. He went home with his family and took a big nap. Max had a dream about the party and the little girl with the napkin. He knew he did a good job and felt proud. Max couldn't wait for the next time he could help someone and be a good dog.
