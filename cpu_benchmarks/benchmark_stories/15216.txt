Once upon a time, there was a tidy little bear named Ben. Ben loved honey more than anything. One day, Ben found a big jar of honey in his home. He was very happy.
Ben wanted to guess who left the honey for him. He thought, maybe it was his mom or dad. Ben decided to look for clues. He saw footprints on the floor. They were not his mom's or dad's footprints.
Ben followed the footprints and found his friend, Bee. Bee was holding a jar of honey too. Ben was so happy to find out that Bee had left the honey for him. They both laughed and enjoyed their honey together. From that day on, Ben and Bee were the best of friends.
