Lily and Ben were playing in the living room. They saw a big box with shiny paper and a red bow. It was a present for Mommy's birthday.
"Let's see what's inside!" Ben said. He grabbed the scissors from the table and cut the paper.
"No, Ben, stop!" Lily shouted. "That's not nice! Mommy will be sad!"
But Ben did not listen. He opened the box and saw a soft sweater. He put it on and laughed.
"Look, Lily, I'm Mommy!" he said.
Lily felt bad. She knew Ben did a bad thing. She wanted to fix it. She took the scissors and tried to tape the paper back. But the paper was torn and the tape was sticky. She could not make it look good.
Suddenly, they heard the door open. Mommy was home!
"Hi, kids, I'm back!" Mommy said. She saw the box and the paper on the floor. She saw Ben wearing the sweater. She saw Lily holding the scissors. She looked angry and sad.
"What did you do?" Mommy asked.
Lily and Ben felt cold. They knew they were in trouble. They wished they did not touch the present. They regretted being naughty.
"We're sorry, Mommy," they said. "We love you."
Mommy sighed. She hugged them and said, "I love you too, but you have to learn to respect other people's things. This was a gift from Daddy. He wanted to surprise me. Now the surprise is ruined."
Lily and Ben felt sorry. They said they would never do it again. They helped Mommy clean up the mess. They hoped Daddy would not be too mad. They learned a lesson. They knew that scissors were not for playing.
