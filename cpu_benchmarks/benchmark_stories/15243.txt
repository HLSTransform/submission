Jack had a light blue shoe. Every day, he liked to kick it. He kicked it high into the air, and he kicked it far away. He kicked it so hard that it flew across the room. Whenever he kicked it, it made him laugh.
Sometimes, Jack's mom would let him play outside. He would go outside, and he would kick his shoe in the grass. He kicked it so hard that it would go rolling down the street. He thought it was great fun.
One day, Jack went to the beach. He ran and ran, and then, he kicked his shoe into the ocean. His shoe went so far away that he couldn't see it in the waves. He was sad that he couldn't play with his shoe anymore. 
But then his mom said, "you can get a new shoe. I bet it'll be even better than your old one!" So Jack went to the store and found a light green shoe. He put it on, and then, he kicked it around. He was very happy with his new shoe!
