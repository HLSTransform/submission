Joe looked out the window and saw it was a regular day. He saw his mom pick up a baby from the daycare. She was an infant and looked so small. Joe wanted to go outside and see the infant too.
So Joe ran outside and saw the little infant in his mom's arms. He looked around, but he didn't see anyone else. He wanted to play with the infant, so he asked his mom if he could hold her. His mom said yes and carefully handed her over to him.
Joe held the infant close and smiled. He looked into her eyes and smiled some more. He loved her and wanted to stay with her forever. His mom hugged him and told him to take care of the infant. Joe promised he would and kissed the infant good-bye.
