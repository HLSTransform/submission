Lila and Ben are playing in the garden. They see a big bulb in the ground. It is brown and rough.
"What is this?" Lila asks.
Ben shrugs. He does not know.
"Maybe it is a treasure," Lila says. She tries to pull it out.
The bulb does not move. It is stuck.
"Let me help you," Ben says. He grabs the bulb too.
They pull and pull. The bulb comes out. It is not a treasure. It is a flower.
The flower is yellow and smooth. It has many petals. It smells nice.
"Wow, it is a flower!" Lila says.
"It is a daffodil," a voice says.
They look up. It is Mom. She is smiling.
"How do you know?" Ben asks.
Mom answers, "I planted it last year. It is a spring flower. It grows from a bulb."
Lila and Ben are happy. They give Mom the flower.
"Thank you, Mom," they say.
"You are welcome, my loves," Mom says. She hugs them.
