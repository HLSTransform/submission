Lily and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, it is rainy and windy. Lily and Sam have umbrellas. They open their umbrellas and run in the park.
The wind is strong. It blows Lily's umbrella away. Lily is sad. She cries. Sam sees Lily's umbrella in a big tree. He wants to help Lily. He is brave. He climbs the tree and gets the umbrella.
Lily is happy. She hugs Sam. She says, "Thank you, Sam. You are my hero. You win the best friend prize." Sam smiles. He says, "You are welcome, Lily. You are my best friend too. Let's go home and have some hot chocolate." They hold their umbrellas and walk home. They are happy.
