Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to organize her toys. She would put her dolls in one box, her cars in another, and her blocks in a big bag. Mia's mommy would always say, "Good job, Mia! You're so good at organizing!"
One day, Mia decided to build a temple with her blocks. She put one block on top of another and made a tall tower. Then, she added more blocks to make it look like a temple. Mia was very proud of her temple. She showed it to her mommy and said, "Look, mommy! I made a temple with my blocks!"
Mommy smiled and said, "Wow, Mia! That's a beautiful temple! Let's celebrate with a yummy treat!" So, Mia and her mommy went to the kitchen and made yummy cookies. They ate the cookies together and talked about the fun they had organizing and building the temple.
The end.
