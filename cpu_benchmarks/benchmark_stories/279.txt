Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her backyard. One day, she saw a big spider on the step of her porch. The spider looked dangerous and it scared her. 
Lily ran inside to tell her mom about the scary spider. Her mom came outside and saw the spider too. She told Lily to stay away from it and not to touch it. 
Later that day, Lily's dad came home and saw the spider. He knew it was a dangerous kind of spider and he needed to get rid of it. He carefully picked it up and took it far away from the house. 
From that day on, Lily always checked the steps before she went outside to play. She didn't want to get scared by any more dangerous spiders.
