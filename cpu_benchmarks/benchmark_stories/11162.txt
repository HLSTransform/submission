Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she saw a big red ball and wanted to play with it. She ran towards it and tried to grab it, but it was too heavy for her.
Suddenly, she heard a sound. It was a bell ringing. She looked around and saw a man opening a door. She ran towards him and asked, "Can I play with the ball?" The man smiled and said, "Sure, you can grab it and play with it as much as you want."
Lily was so happy. She grabbed the ball and started playing with it. She ran and jumped and had so much fun. When it was time to go home, she thanked the man and said, "I love playing with the ball and hearing the bell ring. It makes me so happy." The man smiled and said, "I'm glad you had fun. Come back and play anytime." And Lily walked home with a big smile on her face.
