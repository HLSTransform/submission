Once upon a time, there was a girl named Judy. She was playing in the park. She had a swing and she was so happy. She was swinging so high and it felt so good. She laughed and smiled as she felt the wind on her face.
When she got tired of swinging, she decided to take a rest. She sat on the edge of the swing and looked around. She saw the other kids playing and she decided to join in. Soon, she was having lots of fun.
At the end of the day, she decided to swing one more time. She pushed off with her feet and went as high as she could. She felt like she was flying and when she was at the tip of the swing, she felt like she was on top of the world. She kept swinging and having a good time until it was time to go home.
