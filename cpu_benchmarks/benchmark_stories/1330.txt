Once upon a time, there was a brave lion. He was the king of the jungle and the bravest of all the animals. Every day he would go for a walk, but he was always careful not to go too far from his home.
One day, he heard voices coming from deep in the jungle. He couldn't understand what they were saying, but he was curious to find out. So he cautiously moved towards the voices.
When he got closer, he saw two little children playing. They were laughing and having a lot of fun. The lion wanted to play too, but he was afraid of being too serious.
The children saw the lion and started to giggle. They weren't scared at all; they were only excited! After a few moments, they decided to allow the lion to join in the fun.
The lion gratefully joined them and played with the children until sunset. He was so happy and loved the experience. From that day on, the lion and the children were the best of friends. They had so much fun together!
