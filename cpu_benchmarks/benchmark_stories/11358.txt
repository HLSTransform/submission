Mandy was playing outside when she saw a caterpillar. She was very excited, but she thought it looked a bit filthy. Mandy wanted to pick it up and she asked her Dad if it would be okay. 
Dad said, "no, Mandy, that caterpillar might be dangerous!" Mandy was confused because it looked like a harmless bug. She asked, "Why, Dad?" 
Dad said, "It might shoot something!" 
Mandy's eyes got very wide and she said, "It can shoot something? What will it shoot?" 
Dad said, "It might shoot something yucky like dirt or mud at you. You don't want to be filthy, do you?" 
Mandy shook her head no and said, "No, I don't want to be filthy. I won't pick up the caterpillar." She backed away slowly and started playing somewhere else.
