Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play with his friends in the forest. One day, Benny and his friends found a rope. They all wanted to play with the rope, but they couldn't decide who should have it. 
Benny had an idea. He said, "Let's separate the rope into pieces so we can all have a piece to play with." His friends thought it was a great idea, and they all took a piece of the rope. 
As they played with their pieces of rope, they realized that they were all different sizes. Some were long, some were short, and some were in between. Benny's piece was the shortest, but he didn't mind. He thought all the pieces were adorable in their own way. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to share and be fair, even if it means separating things into smaller pieces. And it's okay if things aren't exactly the same - they can still be adorable in their own unique way.
