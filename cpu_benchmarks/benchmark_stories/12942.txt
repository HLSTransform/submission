Once upon a time there were two friends, Judy and Sam. They were having a fun day and decided to go to the park. When they arrived, they saw that the park was filled with people.
"What an event!" exclaimed Judy.
Sam nodded. "Let's go explore!"
They walked around and saw lots of normal things like swings and slides. They even got to feed the ducks in the pond.
After a while, Judy said "We should try something new. Let's go to the tree house!"
So they ran to the tree house, climbed up the ladder, and jumped around. They pretended they were pirates and imagined they were sailing the seven seas.
Suddenly they heard a voice saying, "I'm glad you two are having fun". It was their mom, who had come to check on them.
Judy smiled. "This was a really fun event!"
Sam agreed. "Let's come back to the park some time!"
The two friends laughed and hugged. Then they held hands and walked home together on a normal summer day.
