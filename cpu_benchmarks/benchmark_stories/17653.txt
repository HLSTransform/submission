There was a swamp near the town. The town people were worried about it and wondered how they could manage it. 
Then, one day, an impressive thing happened - a frog showed up! Everyone in town was amazed. 
The frog said, "I can manage this swamp for you!" So the town people let him try. 
The frog hopped around the swamp and worked with the other animals. Slowly but surely, the swamp became less swampy. All the animals helped the frog, and soon the swamp was managed!
The town people were so happy and thanked the frog for being so impressive. The frog smiled and said, "I managed the swamp with the help of all the other animals - that's what being a team is all about!" 
The town people agreed, and everyone lived happily ever after!
