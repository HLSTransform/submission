Once upon a time, there was a boy named Gary. He lived on a farm and he was very troubled. Everywhere he went he saw the same sad things, which made him very sad. 
One day, Gary decided it was time to take a step. He gathered his courage and took the first step down the path. He was so scared, but he was determined to keep going. Little by little, he took each step until he found his way to a big field. He was standing in front of a big match!
Gary was so surprised! He had never seen a match that big before! He carefully stepped closer and closer, until he was standing right in front of the match. He watched the match inside and noticed that it wasn't burning. Suddenly, Gary had an idea! He quickly ran back home and gathered some twigs and sticks. He brought them back to the match, placed them around it and lit it up.
When the match was lit, Gary stepped back and watched as the field around him started to light up with warmth. Gary smiled big and the troubles of his world melted away. He knew that he could face the world, no matter what problems he might have.
