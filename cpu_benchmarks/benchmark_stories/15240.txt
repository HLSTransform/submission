Once upon a time there was a boy named Teddy who loved ships. He went to the beach every day to watch the ships go by.
One day, Teddy saw an enormous ship on the horizon. He was so excited! He raced to the edge of the waves, but the ship sailed away before he got there.
Teddy was sad, but he never gave up hope. He kept going back to the beach every day, watching and waiting.
At last, one day he was rewarded. He saw the enormous ship again and this time it came closer. He waved his tiny arms and shouted joyfully, and the giants on the ship waved back and smiled. Teddy felt like the ship had seen him and cared.
Teddy went back to the beach every day for a long time, but he never saw the enormous ship again. But he never forgot the feeling of being seen, and cared for, by such a beautiful and mysterious thing.
