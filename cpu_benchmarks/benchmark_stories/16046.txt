Once upon a time, there was a fierce giraffe. Its name was Dave. Dave always complained about the sparse leaves that hung from the trees. He couldn’t complain to the other animals because he was too shy, so he stayed in his own little corner of the Savannah.
One day, Dave spotted something bright and colourful. It was a beautiful wrap! Dave ran over and wrapped himself up in it. He felt like a new animal! He ran across the Savannah, feeling fierce and strong.
The other animals stopped and looked at Dave in amazement. Dave stopped and said: “No more complaining about the leaves! Now I'm wearing the wrap!”
The animals cheered and clapped. From that day on, Dave was always seen in his bright wrap, feeling fierce and proud!
