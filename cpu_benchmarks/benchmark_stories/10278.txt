Once upon a time, there was a turtle named Timmy who liked to walk very slow. One day, Timmy met a rabbit named Rosie who liked to run very fast. Rosie laughed at Timmy and said, "You are so slow!" This made Timmy feel sad.
Timmy wanted to show Rosie that he had power too, so he said, "Let's have a race!" Rosie agreed, thinking she would win easily. But as they started running, Rosie realized she was going too fast and needed to hurry. Timmy kept going slow and steady, but he was getting closer and closer to the finish line.
In the end, Timmy won the race! Rosie was surprised and said, "I didn't know you could go so fast!" Timmy smiled and said, "I may be slow, but I have power too." From that day on, Rosie and Timmy became good friends and they learned that it's not always about hurrying, but about doing your best.
