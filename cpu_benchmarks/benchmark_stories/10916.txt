Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was very hungry, so he went to the fridge to find something to eat. He looked inside, but all he saw was ordinary food like apples and cheese. 
Suddenly, his friend Billy came over to play. Timmy was happy to see him and wanted to invite him to stay for dinner. He asked his mom to make more food and she said yes. 
Timmy and Billy played together while they waited for dinner to be ready. When it was time to eat, they went back to the fridge and saw that there was now lots of yummy food to choose from. They ate until they were full and then went back to playing. 
From that day on, Timmy always remembered to invite his friends over for dinner so they could share the food in the fridge and have fun together.
