Once upon a time, there was a fierce fish. He swam all day long and loved to explore the deep water. One day, he was swimming when he saw something shiny. It was a big bell with lots of colors! The fish was so excited, he swam up to the bell to get a closer look.
Suddenly, he heard a voice calling out. "Hello Fish! What are you doing here?" He looked around, but he could not see anyone. He asked, "Who said that?"
Then he saw a friendly dolphin swimming nearby. She said, "It's me! I thought I heard something so I came to take a look. What have you found?"
The fish smiled and said, "I found a bell! It looks so pretty and it's so shiny!" The dolphin asked if he wanted to play a game with it and he said yes, so they played together. The fierce fish had so much fun swimming around with the bell and the dolphin. When it was time to go home, the fish thanked the dolphin and said goodbye. The fish kept the bell for himself and it reminded him of his fun times with the dolphin.
