Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to eat soup with her spoon. One day, Lily's mom made some soup for her and gave her a big spoon to eat with. Lily was so happy and started eating her soup.
Suddenly, Lily's little brother came and stood next to her. He wanted some soup too. But Lily didn't want to share her soup or her spoon with him. She said, "No, this is my soup and my spoon!"
Her little brother started crying and ran to their mom. He told her how Lily was being terrible and not sharing her soup and spoon. Lily's mom was very angry and scolded her. Lily felt very sad and sorry.
In the end, Lily realized that sharing is important and apologized to her little brother. But it was too late, her little brother had already fallen ill from hunger. Lily felt terrible and wished she had shared her soup and spoon with him.
