Lily was very happy. It was her birthday. She saw a big gift on the table. She wanted to open it. She ran to the table and tried to lift the gift. But it was too heavy for her. She could not lift it.
She asked her mom for help. "Mom, can you help me lift the gift? It is too heavy for me."
Mom smiled and came to the table. She lifted the gift and put it on the floor. She said, "This gift is from your dad and me. We hope you like it."
Lily thanked her mom and hugged her. She was very curious. She tore the paper and opened the box. She saw a beautiful doll inside. The doll had long hair and a pretty dress. She also had a hat and a bag. Lily loved the doll. She said, "Wow, this is the best gift ever! Thank you, mom and dad!"
Mom and dad hugged Lily and kissed her. They said, "You are welcome, Lily. We love you very much. Happy birthday!"
Lily played with her doll all day. She gave her a name and a story. She lifted her high and made her fly. She put her hat and bag on her. She pretended they were going on a trip. She had a lot of fun with her gift. She was very happy.
