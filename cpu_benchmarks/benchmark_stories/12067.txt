Once upon a time, there was a big fish named Fin. Fin lived in a big ocean with lots of other fish. One day, Fin heard that a new fish was coming to the ocean. Fin was excited to welcome the new fish to their home.
The new fish was a clownfish named Nemo. Nemo was small, but he was very brave. Fin showed Nemo around the large reef where they lived. Nemo was amazed by all the colorful fish and plants.
Fin and Nemo became good friends and swam together every day. Fin was happy to have a new friend in the ocean. They both loved to explore the large reef and discover new things. From that day on, Fin and Nemo were the best of friends.
