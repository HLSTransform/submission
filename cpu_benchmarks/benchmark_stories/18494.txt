Sam liked to play with his cars in the living room. He made them zoom and crash and honk. He did not like to stop playing when it was time for bed. He always said, "No, no, no!"
One night, his mom came and said, "Sam, it's time for your bath. Put away your cars and come with me." Sam did not listen. He said, "No, no, no!" He hid behind the couch with his cars.
His mom was not happy. She said, "Sam, if you don't come out, I will increase the bubbles in your bath. You know you don't like too many bubbles. They make your eyes sting and your nose tickle." Sam did not believe her. He said, "No, no, no!" He stayed behind the couch with his cars.
His mom went to the bathroom and turned on the water. She poured a lot of bubble soap in the tub. She made the water very bubbly. She said, "Sam, your bath is ready. Come and see." Sam was curious. He peeked out from behind the couch. He saw his mom holding his bathrobe. He liked his bathrobe. It was soft and warm and blue.
He decided to come out and see his bath. He left his cars behind the couch and followed his mom. He saw the tub full of bubbles. He did not like it. He said, "No, no, no!" He tried to run away, but his mom caught him. She said, "Sam, you have to take your bath. It's good for you. It will make you clean and cozy. Don't be difficult." She lifted him up and put him in the tub.
Sam felt the bubbles on his skin. He did not like it. He said, "No, no, no!" He splashed and kicked and cried. He made the bubbles fly everywhere. He made a big mess. He got bubbles in his eyes and his nose. He said, "Ow, ow, ow!"
His mom said, "Sam, I told you so. You should have listened to me. Now you have to wash your eyes and your nose. And you have to clean up the mess. It's your fault." She gave him a towel and a sponge. She said, "Sam, you have to learn. Next time, do what I say. Or I will increase the bubbles even more." She smiled and winked. She put his bathrobe on him. She said, "Sam, I love you. But you have to be good." She hugged him and kissed him.
Sam felt his mom's love. He liked it. He said, "Sorry, sorry, sorry!" He hugged her and kissed her. He said, "I love you too. But I don't like bubbles." He smiled and winked. He said, "Next time, can I play with my cars in the tub?"
