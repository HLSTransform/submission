Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and go to the park. One day, Lily wanted to order some ice cream from the truck. She asked her mom if she could have some and her mom said yes!
Lily ran over to the ice cream truck and looked at all the different flavors. She decided to order a vanilla cone with sprinkles on top. The man in the truck gave her the ice cream and she was so happy.
As she walked away from the truck, she noticed a chain on the ground. It was a pretty chain with shiny beads on it. Lily picked it up and put it on her wrist. It was a modest accessory, but she loved it. She wore it every day after that and it reminded her of the day she got her ice cream. The end.
