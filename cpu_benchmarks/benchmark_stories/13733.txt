One day, a little girl named Lily went to the farm with her mommy. Lily saw a big horse in the field. The horse was eating some grass. Lily wanted to pet the horse but she was scared. 
Suddenly, the horse came closer and said, "Hi, my name is Bossy. Do you want to taste this yummy carrot?" Lily was surprised that the horse could talk! She took the carrot and tasted it. It was so delicious! 
Lily and Bossy became friends and played together all day. When it was time to go home, Lily said, "Bye-bye, Bossy. I had so much fun with you today." Bossy replied, "Bye-bye, Lily. Come back and visit me soon!"
