Tom and Mia were playing in the park. They saw a big tree with many leaves. They wanted to see what was in the tree.
"Look, Mia, there is a nest!" Tom said. He pointed to a brown thing on a branch. "Maybe there are birds inside."
"Can we see them?" Mia asked. She was curious and excited.
Tom nodded. He climbed the tree. He was good at climbing. He got closer to the nest. He reached his hand to touch it.
"Be careful, Tom!" Mia said. She was anxious. She stayed on the ground. She did not like climbing.
Tom felt something soft and warm in the nest. He heard a chirp. He looked inside. He saw four baby birds. They had yellow feathers and big eyes. They looked at Tom.
"Hello, little birds!" Tom said. He smiled. He was happy.
But then he heard a loud squawk. He looked up. He saw a big bird flying to the tree. It was the mother bird. She was angry. She saw Tom near her nest.
"Go away, go away!" the mother bird said. She flapped her wings. She pecked at Tom's head.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tom said. He was scared. He let go of the nest. He fell down from the tree.
"Tom, are you okay?" Mia said. She ran to him. She hugged him.
"I'm okay, Mia," Tom said. He rubbed his head. He had a bump. "But the mother bird was very mad. She did not want me to touch her nest."
"I'm sorry, Tom," Mia said. She felt sorry for him. "But you should not touch other animals' homes. They do not like it."
"I know, Mia," Tom said. He learned his lesson. "I will not do it again. I will just look at them from far away."
They walked away from the tree. They saw the mother bird and the baby birds in the nest. They looked happy and safe.
"Bye, bye, birds!" Tom and Mia said. They waved to them. They went to play somewhere else.
