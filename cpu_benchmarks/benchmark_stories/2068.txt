Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a blue butterfly and wanted to catch it. She ran after it, but she didn't watch where she was going and fell down. 
Lily started to cry because she hurt herself. Her mom came outside and asked, "What happened, sweetie?" Lily said, "I fell down and it hurts, please make it better." 
Her mom picked her up and said, "Let's go inside and make sure you're safe." They went inside and put a bandaid on Lily's knee. Her mom said, "Next time, be careful when you run so you don't get hurt." 
Lily felt better and went back outside to play. She saw the blue butterfly again and remembered what her mom said. She walked slowly and carefully towards it and finally caught it in her hands. She was so happy and said, "Thank you, butterfly, for being my friend."
