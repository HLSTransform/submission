Sam was so miserable. He had no one to play with because he did not have any friends. He was all alone. As he was walking around, he looked for something that would make him feel better. 
Suddenly, he saw a big hole at the side of a big hill. He thought it was exciting and started to climb up the hill so he could see what was inside the hole. He stumbled a few times, but he kept going until he reached the top. 
Sam peered down into the hole, but it was too dark to see anything. Then he had an idea. He decided to throw his baseball into the hole. He held the ball tight and let it go. He smiled with delight as the ball suddenly disappeared. 
"What was that?" Sam said. 
He could not wait to find out what he had thrown into the hole. He figured he would have to wait until morning and see if the hole had something special to show him.
