Once upon a time, there was a farm full of animals. Each day, the animals on the farm would have to perform various tasks. Some were fun tasks, some were hard.
One day, the farmer had a problem. He needed something to help the animals do their jobs faster and more easily. He started to look for something but he found nothing.
Then he had an idea. He went to the store to buy a big machine! He knew it was expensive, but it was exactly what the farm needed.
That night, the big machine arrived at the farm. All of the animals crowded around to see it. They were so excited to use the new machine!
The next day, the farm was buzzing with activity as the animals used the new machine to help them perform their tasks. The animals never had it so good! Now they could work faster and have fun too!
