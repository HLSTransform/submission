Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy who lived together with their little boy. The mommy and daddy loved each other very much.
One day, mommy and daddy had a fight. They were both very mad. The little boy wanted to help them. He didn't want them to fight anymore.
So he went to his mommy and daddy and gave them each a big hug. He told them everything was going to be alright. Slowly, the mommy and daddy began to calm down.
The little boy then went over to the blanket that was on the floor. He folded it up carefully so it made a big, comfy bed. Then he said, "let's have a nap and not fight anymore!"
The mommy and daddy were so happy. They cuddled up together in the big, comfy bed and fell fast asleep. From then on, they always stayed calm with each other.
