Once upon a time there was a girl named Olivia. She was very fancy. She had a book with lots of pretty pictures in it. She wanted to read it.
But Olivia couldn't read it. She was too little. So she asked her mom to help her. Her mom said, "Yes! I can help you read it."
So Olivia and her mom found a cozy spot. Olivia sat on her mom's lap and opened the book. They read it together. Olivia liked it very much.
At the end of the story, there was an olive. Olivia was so excited. She'd never seen an olive before. She asked her mom what it was. Her mom said it was a special kind of fruit. It was very fancy. 
Olivia wanted to taste it. So her mom gave her a little bit of the olive. Olivia tasted it and it was delicious! From then on, Olivia would always ask her mom to read the book with the special olive in it. It made her very happy.
