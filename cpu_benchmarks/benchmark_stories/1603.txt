Lily was a little girl who liked to wear dresses. She had many dresses of different colors and patterns. She liked to wear them when she played with her dolls or her friends.
One day, she wanted to wear her pink dress with flowers. She looked for it in her closet, but she could not find it. She asked her mom, "Mom, where is my pink dress?"
Her mom said, "I'm sorry, Lily, but your pink dress is dirty. You spilled juice on it yesterday. I have to wash it."
Lily was sad. She did not want to wear another dress. She said, "But I love my pink dress. It is my favorite. I want to wear it now."
Her mom said, "I know, Lily, but you have to wait until it is clean. Why don't you wear your blue dress with stars? It is also very pretty."
Lily did not like her blue dress. She thought it was too dark and boring. She said, "No, I don't like my blue dress. It is not pretty. It is dark and ugly."
Her mom said, "Lily, that is not nice. Your blue dress is not ugly. It is dark, but it has bright stars on it. It is like the night sky. And you know what? You have a star on your tooth."
Lily was surprised. She touched her tooth with her tongue. She felt a little bump. She said, "A star on my tooth? What do you mean?"
Her mom said, "Yes, a star on your tooth. You have a loose tooth, Lily. It is wiggling. Soon, it will fall out. And then, you will get a new tooth. And a visit from the tooth fairy."
Lily was excited. She ran to the mirror and looked at her tooth. She saw that it was a little bit lower than the other teeth. She wiggled it with her finger. She said, "Wow, I have a loose tooth. It is like a star. It is shiny and special."
Her mom said, "Yes, it is. And you know what? The tooth fairy likes stars. She likes to collect them from children who lose their teeth. She gives them a coin or a gift in exchange. But she only comes at night, when it is dark."
Lily thought about it. She said, "So, if I wear my blue dress with stars, the tooth fairy will like it? She will think I am a star too?"
Her mom said, "Maybe. She might. She likes children who are brave and kind and happy. And who take good care of their teeth. Do you want to try?"
Lily nodded. She said, "Yes, I want to try. I want to meet the tooth fairy. I want to give her my star tooth. And I want to see what she gives me. Maybe another dress?"
Her mom smiled. She said, "Maybe. You never know. But first, you have to wear your blue dress. And brush your teeth. And go to bed. And sleep. Can you do that?"
Lily said, "Yes, I can. I will wear my blue dress. And brush my teeth. And go to bed. And sleep. And dream of stars. And the tooth fairy."
She hugged her mom. She said, "Thank you, mom. You are the best. I love you."
Her mom said, "I love you too, Lily. You are my star."
