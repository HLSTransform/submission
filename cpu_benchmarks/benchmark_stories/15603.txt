Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big hill with flowers and grass. They wanted to climb it and see what was on the other side.
They ran up the hill, holding hands. They were happy and excited. But then, Ben stumbled on a rock and fell down. He hurt his knee and cried. Lily stopped and ran back to him. She saw blood on his knee and felt scared.
"Ben, are you okay?" she asked. She hugged him and tried to make him feel better.
Ben sniffed and nodded. He looked at his knee and saw a fly on it. He shooed it away and said, "Go away, fly. You are not nice. You want to eat my blood."
Lily saw the fly too and said, "Yes, go away, fly. You are not our friend. You are mean and dirty."
The fly buzzed and flew away. It did not like to be shooed. It looked for another place to land. It saw a flower with nectar and flew to it. It was hungry and thirsty.
The flower was happy to see the fly. It said, "Hello, fly. You are welcome here. You can drink my nectar and help me make seeds. You are my friend. You are nice and helpful."
The fly was surprised and happy. It said, "Thank you, flower. You are very kind. You have sweet nectar and beautiful petals. You are my friend. You are pretty and grateful."
The fly and the flower became friends. They talked and shared. They helped each other and smiled.
Ben and Lily saw the fly and the flower. They saw that they were friends. They felt sorry for shooing the fly. They realized that the fly was not mean and dirty. It was just different and hungry.
They said, "Sorry, fly. We were wrong. You are not bad. You are good. You have a friend. We are happy for you."
The fly and the flower said, "Thank you, Ben and Lily. You are not bad either. You are good. You have each other. We are happy for you too."
Ben and Lily smiled and hugged. They felt better. They said, "We are sorry for our knee. We are happy for our friend. We are grateful for our park."
They climbed the hill again and saw what was on the other side. They saw more flowers and flies and friends. They played and laughed and learned. They had a good day.
