John wanted to learn how to be a good husband. He was very excited and decided to ask his chubby wife what he should do. She smiled and said that the most important thing was to always be kind. 
John listened to her advice but he still wasn't sure what to do. He was afraid that if he got it wrong, his wife might leave him. He tried his best to be kind but the next day, things started to go wrong. 
John had an argument with his wife and things only got worse. It seemed like John had forgotten what his wife told him the day before. He tried to apologize but his wife was too angry. She packed her bags and left, taking all her things with her. 
John had forgotten the most important thing - to be kind. This moral lesson shows that no matter how hard we try to be the perfect husband, if kindness is not present in our actions, relationships can quickly fall apart.
