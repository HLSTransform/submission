Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sophie. Sophie was very curious and she loved to explore the world. One day, Sophie decided to explore the forest. She entered the forest and was surprised to see a lot of fruit. She was so excited that she decided to pick some of the fruit.
As she was picking the fruit, a thin old man appeared. He said to Sophie, "You can pick the fruits, but only some of them. Remember to be gentle and only take what you need." Sophie smiled and said, "Thank you, Sir!".
The man then gave Sophie a basket and asked her to fill it with the fruit. Sophie felt so excited! She picked lots of different fruit and filled up the basket. The man said to her, "Sophie, you are a very kind and gentle girl, thank you for taking only what you need!"
Sophie thanked the man and entered the forest again, this time with a full basket of fruit. She looked up at the sky and smiled, feeling content and happy.
