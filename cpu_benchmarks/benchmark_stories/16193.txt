Once upon a time, there was a raven. He was an unusual bird, but that is what made him special.
One day, the raven wanted to try something new. So he decided to write. He had never written before and he was a bit scared. He was worried he would not be able to do it.
Just when he was about to give up, a little girl spoke to him. She said, "I can help you write. If you give me some paper, I'm sure we can do it together."
The raven was surprised and excited. He gave the little girl some paper. Together they had lots of fun writing stories.
The raven was so happy and amazed at what they had created. He thanked the little girl and flew away. From that day on, he allowed himself to explore his unusual writing talent.
