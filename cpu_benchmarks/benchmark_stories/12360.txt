Once upon a time there was a bright man. He lived in a big house on top of a hill. Every day he would go for a walk around the hill and meet all the animals. 
One day he noticed something special about one of the rabbits he met. It had a really long ear, longer than any of the other rabbits' ears. He decided to measure the ear to see how long it really was. So he got his measuring tape out of his pocket and measured the rabbit's ears. To his surprise, the ear was much longer than he expected it to be!
The bright man was so excited about this discovery. He realized he could use this ear to do something special. So every day he visited the rabbit, always measuring its ear.
Finally, after weeks of measuring, he had enough. The bright man took the rabbit's long ear and made a special lamp out of it. It shone so bright, the whole hill was lit up! Everyone was so amazed that they all started to call him "The Man with the Bright Ear Lamp". 
The bright man was delighted with his new lamp and everyone thought it was incredible. From that moment on, he was known as the man with the bright ear lamp.
