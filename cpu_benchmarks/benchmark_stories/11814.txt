Once upon a time there was a fat duck. She was walking in the park when she came across a big, yellow bucket lying in the grass. She said to herself, “I wonder what is inside of the bucket!” So she waddled up to the bucket and stuck her head inside. She was surprised when she saw a huge pile of cookies and milk! The fat duck squealed with delight and started to gobble them up. 
The fat duck had almost finished eating when she heard a voice that said, “Hey! Those cookies were mine!” 
Startled, the duck turned around and saw a small mouse peeking out from behind a tree. The mouse smiled and said, “I was saving those cookies for later. You can have the rest of them.” 
The fat duck thanked the mouse and started to eat the rest of the cookies. But soon the duck realized that the mouse had disappeared! She looked all around, but the mouse was nowhere to be found. 
She smiled, looking at the empty bucket. “That mouse was really nice," she said. Then, the fat duck waddled away with a full belly.
