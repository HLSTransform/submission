John was out in his garden when he saw something move. He saw a pepper crawling and waving its arms. He was a little scared, but bravely reached out to pick the pepper up. He held the pepper in his hands and looked at it closely. It smiled and waved to him. John waved back, feeling happy and grateful for the friendship he had made.
A few days later, John decided to take the pepper out for a walk. He was feeling confident, so he walked out into the big, wide world. As he waved goodbye to his house, he felt a fearful feeling inside.
When John returned home, he was surprised to find his house empty and the pepper gone. Fearful, he asked the neighbours if they had seen the pepper. But no one had. John realized that the pepper was much more than his friend -- it had been a warning. 
John sadly returned to his house, all alone. He had lost the pepper and now felt like he had lost a part of himself too. He would never forget the lesson the pepper had taught him.
