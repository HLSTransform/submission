Jack and Tina were married, but they were both very shy. They were so shy they wouldn't even talk to each other. Every day Tina would wash the dishes to try to make Jack happy. But Jack still stayed very quiet.
One day Tina decided to ask Jack why he was so quiet. "Jack, why don't you ever talk to me?" she said.
Jack didn't answer. He just kept washing the dishes.
Tina was so angry she started to cry. "Why don't you love me!?" she shouted.
But still, Jack said nothing. Tina ran away from the house, crying.
Jack and Tina never talked again. They both stayed very lonely and shy, never being able to say anything to each other.
