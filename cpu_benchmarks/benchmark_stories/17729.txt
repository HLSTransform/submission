Once upon a time there was a spider. He was small and black and liked to explore his world. One day he found an animal that was much bigger than him - it was a lion! The lion roared and the spider was scared. The spider hid under a bush and watched the lion carefully. Suddenly, the lion noticed the spider and tried to strike it with his paw. The spider was scared and scurried out of sight.
However, the lion did not give up. He searched and searched, until he eventually noticed the spider again. But this time, something had changed. The lion's face was different. Instead of being angry, it had a look of compassion. The lion gently reached out and lifted the spider. Then, he placed it upon a flower. The spider was surprised but happy.
The lion let out a roar and said, "Never forget - be compassionate in life, even to the smallest creatures." The spider couldn't believe his luck. He thanked the lion, before slowly making his way back home. The spider was now filled with new hope and knew that he could always find compassion in life.
