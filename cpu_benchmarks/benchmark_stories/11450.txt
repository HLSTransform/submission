Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was three years old and very curious. One day she wanted to explore the woods near her house.
"I want to go to the woods!" she said to her mom.
"Oh no, it can be dangerous," her mom disagreed.
The little girl was very disappointed. She walked to a nearby hill and sat down. She looked into the woods and wondered what she would find there.
Suddenly she heard a harsh voice.
"You shouldn't be here," the voice said.
The little girl was scared. She stood up and said, "I'm not doing any harm."
The voice disagreed. "It's too dangerous for someone so young," it said.
The little girl was sad but she knew the voice was right. She turned around and went home. But she still wondered what secrets the woods held.
