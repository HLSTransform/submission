Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Snowy. Snowy was a white bunny who loved to play outside in the grass. One day, Snowy's mom told her that a big storm was coming and she needed to find a safe place to hide. Snowy didn't want to leave her favorite spot in the grass, but she knew she had to be safe.
Snowy looked around and saw a big tree with a hole in it. She ran over to the tree and hopped inside the hole. It was a tight squeeze, but Snowy felt safe inside the tree. As the storm came, the wind started to spread the leaves and branches around. Snowy was scared, but she knew she was safe inside the tree.
After the storm passed, Snowy hopped out of the tree and saw that everything was covered in mud. She didn't like the mud, but she saw a puddle of water nearby. Snowy hopped over to the puddle and used her paws to spread the water around. She loved playing in the water and forgot all about the scary storm.
