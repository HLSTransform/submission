Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a little yellow bird. The bird had a friend, a big brown bear. They liked to play together in the sunny forest.
One day, the bird's nest fell from the tree. The bird was very sad. The big brown bear wanted to restore the nest for his friend, the yellow bird.
The bear picked up the nest and put it back in the tree. The yellow bird was so happy! They continued to play and have fun in the sunny forest. And they stayed best friends forever.
