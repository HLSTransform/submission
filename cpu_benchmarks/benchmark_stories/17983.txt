Once upon a time, there was a clever crane. The crane lived by a big lake. The crane liked to help his friends.
One day, the sun was about to rise. The crane saw a small fish stuck in the mud. The fish was sad and scared. The clever crane wanted to help the fish.
The crane used his long neck to reach the fish. He picked up the fish gently and put it back in the lake. The fish was happy and swam away. The sun began to rise, and all the animals cheered for the clever crane.
