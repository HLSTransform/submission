Once upon a time, there was a man who loved to pour things. He liked to pour milk in his cereal, and he liked to pour juice in his cup. 
One day, the man decided to make a special cake. He got out the flour, butter, and eggs to make it. He stirred the ingredients together to make a batter.
He poured the batter into a pan and put it into the oven. When he took it out, it was a delicious cake!
To decorate it, he melted some chocolate and poured it onto the cake in an organized way. Then he sprinkled some pain on top. When he was finished, he had a beautiful cake! Everyone was so pleased.
The man was proud of his work, and he enjoyed eating his special cake.
