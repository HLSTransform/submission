Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Tim. He lived with his family during summer, where it was hot and sunny. Tim loved playing outside with his friends, but he often found it hard because his friends could be very bossy.
One day, Tim and his friends decided to have a race. All of his friends took off running, and Tim was about to start running when one of his friends told him he was too slow. Tim felt sad and he wanted to cry.
Tim's mum saw what had happened and she felt sad too. She cuddled Tim, and they talked about how it wasn't nice when people were bossy and made them suffer.
Mum gave Tim a hug and told him it was ok to be slow. She said that everyone is different and can learn and grow at their own pace. From then on, Tim felt better and he knew that it was ok to take his time.
