George was feeling sleepy. He had been playing outside with his friends all day and now he wanted to take a nap. He went up to his mom and demanded some coffee. His mom looked at him with a worried expression, "George, you are too young for coffee."
George didn't want to hear this. He began to cry and yelled, "I want coffee!" His mom felt fearful but did not want to give in to his demands. She tried to talk to him calmly, "George, I'm sorry, I cannot give you coffee. It is bad for you."
But George was not listening. He stamped his feet and yelled again, "I want coffee!" His mom sighed, feeling frustrated. After a few more arguments and tears, she finally gave in. She made him a cup of coffee and sat with him while he drank it.
When he finished, George smiled. His mom told him, "George, this is the last time I make you coffee. Next time you make the demand, I will say no." George nodded, understanding her words. He hugged his mom and went off to bed, feeling like a grown-up.
