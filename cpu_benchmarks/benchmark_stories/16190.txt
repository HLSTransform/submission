The light was shining on a book. It had been laying on the table for a long time. David, a 3 year old boy, was curious about it. 
'What is this?' He asked his dad.
'It's a book', said his dad.
David started to turn the pages. He found lots of colourful pictures and strange words. He was amazed and started to giggle.
'It's a book about things that change', his dad said. 
David didn't quite understand what his dad meant. He just kept looking at all the pictures. Then suddenly, with a wave of his hand, everything in the book changed to something new. David was amazed and couldn't believe what his eyes were seeing. 
His dad smiled. 'Things can always change, but it's important to remember that change can also be a good thing.' 
David nodded and kept turning the pages. Even though he was only 3 years old, he understood that change could bring something new and different.
