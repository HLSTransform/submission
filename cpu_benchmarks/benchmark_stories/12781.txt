It was almost bed time so Mommy said it was time to settle down. "I am going to put my ashtray away," said Mommy. Sam was curious. "What do you do with an ashtray?" he asked.
Mommy smiled. "It is an object I use when I want to smoke," she said. Sam scrunched up his nose. "What is smoke?"
Mommy explained. "Smoke is when I light something on fire and the air is filled with little wisps of something."
Sam was alert. He had never seen such a thing. He wanted to watch. So Mommy lit the ashtray and soon the room was filled with little wisps of smoke.
"Wow!" Sam said, watching in awe. Mommy put the ashtray back away and hugged Sam. "It is time for bed now," she said. Sam yawned and settled into his bed. He fell asleep quickly, dreaming of ashtrays and smoke.
