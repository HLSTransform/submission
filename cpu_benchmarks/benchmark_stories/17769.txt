Once upon a time, there was a pig named Jim. Jim was a very calm pig and loved to explore the world around him. 
One day, he decided to wander into a nearby forest to find some tasty treats. As he slowly made his way through the tall grass, he felt something on his back. Jim quickly spun around and saw a small, yellow caterpillar. 
The caterpillar was pinching Jim's back! Jim squealed in surprise and ran away. He ran and ran until he was back in the safety of his barn. As Jim settled back in, he knew he would never forget the pinch from the caterpillar.
The end.
