Once upon a time, there was a small house. Inside the house lived a family of three. One day, the family members heard a knock on the door. When they opened it, a lovely lady entered. The family was so happy and excited.
"Welcome to our small home!", said the mom.
The lady smiled and said, "It is such an honor to be here. I am here to celebrate with you all. Today, your family is getting married."
Everyone was thrilled. They hugged and danced around the room. Then the parents put on their wedding clothes and they all went outside. It was a glorious day. They had a small ceremony and said their special vows. Finally, they kissed and a lovely marriage had started. 
The family was so happy and thankful for the special lady who had entered their home and brought them this amazing gift. From that day forward, the family was full of love. 
The End.
