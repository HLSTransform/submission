Once upon a time there was a girl. She was very bored so she decided to do something fun. She went to the market with her mom. At the market, there were lots of stands. Each stand sold something different.
The girl looked around at all the stands. There were stands with food, stands with toys, stands with clothes and more. She was so excited to see all the fun things. She got some yummy food and some cool toys.
But one stand was very boring. It sold nothing. It just stood there. The girl wondered why it was there. But then she noticed a sign. It said the stand was there to sell something special.
The girl was so excited. She asked her mom to buy whatever the stand was selling. They gave the stand their money and the girl got something special! It was a surprise, so she did not know what it was until she opened it. It was a cute stuffed animal! She was so happy.
