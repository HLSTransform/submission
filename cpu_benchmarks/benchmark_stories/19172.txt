Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She liked to design things. One day, she found a big box of bones. It was a skeleton!
Lily wanted to make the skeleton look nice. She was very organized. She put the head bone on top and the foot bones on the bottom. The skeleton started to look like a person.
When Lily was done, the skeleton looked great. She showed her friends, and they all liked it too. They played with the skeleton and had lots of fun. And they all learned how to design things, just like Lily.
