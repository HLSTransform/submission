Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three years old, and loved to study! She often pulled out her books and notes to learn more about the world around her.
One day, as she was studying, she noticed a lot of waste on the ground. It was everywhere, and it was very filthy! Lucy started to pick up the waste and put it in the bin.
She worked very hard, and soon the ground was clean again. She felt happy and proud, knowing that she had helped keep the environment clean.
Every day, Lucy would spend time studying and also work to keep the environment clean. She showed everyone that even a three-year-old can make a difference!
