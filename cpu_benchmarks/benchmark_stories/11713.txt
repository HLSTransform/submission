Once there was a naughty boy. His mommy told him not to do certain things. She warned him that if he wasn't good, bad things would happen. But the naughty boy didn't listen. He kept doing naughty things.
One day, the naughty boy got too naughty. His mommy had had enough. She said, "You must stop now, or something bad will happen!" But the naughty boy kept going.
So finally, his mommy made him stop with her magic. She pointed her finger at his body and it froze. His naughty body stopped. The naughty boy couldn't move, and he couldn't do naughty things anymore.
But his mommy had a plan. She promised that if he promised to be good, his body would start again. And sure enough, when he promised to be good, his body started moving again. After that, the naughty boy was more careful to follow his mommy's instructions.
