Once upon a time, there was an adventurous parrot. It lived in a big, tall tree. Every day, the parrot chewed on the yummy leaves.
One day, the parrot wanted to explore. So, it spread its wings and flew away. It flew higher and higher, until it could see the whole forest.
The parrot stopped to chew on some fresh, green leaves. Then, it continued its journey. It flew higher and higher, until it was out of sight!
The parrot had a wonderful time flying around. When it was time to go home again, the parrot flew back to its tree. It chewed on a few more leaves and then settled down to rest.
The parrot had an amazing time being adventurous. It was so happy that it squeaked with joy!
