Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Alice who was three-years-old. One day, she was playing in her garden and she spotted something dirty. She saw a number of tiny creatures and they were filthy!
Alice bent down and kneeled on the grass. She asked the creatures "What are you doing here?"
The creatures replied: "We are cleaning the garden. We have to make sure it is nice and clean for you to play in!"
Alice was delighted. She smiled and said "That is wonderful." 
Alice kneeled down and helped the creatures. She carefully picked up each dirty thing and put it in a big bin. She made sure that her garden was nice and clean again.
Once the garden was clean, the creatures thanked Alice for her help. Then, they ran away.
Alice was so happy that she had been able to help them. She learnt a valuable lesson and promised herself that she would always keep her garden clean.
