Once upon a time, a little boy named Timmy went outside to play in the rain. He splashed in puddles and got all wet. When he came back inside, his mom said, "Timmy, you're all wet! Let's dry you off."
Later that day, Timmy's mom asked him to help her find her important necklace. They looked and looked, but they couldn't find it anywhere. Timmy felt sad because he knew how much the necklace meant to his mom.
The next day, Timmy went back outside to play. He saw a spot where the dirt looked different and decided to dig. He dug and dug until he found something buried in the ground. It was his mom's necklace! Timmy was so happy that he found it and ran inside to give it to his mom. She was so grateful and gave him a big hug. From that day on, Timmy knew that he could help his mom find important things by digging in the dirt.
