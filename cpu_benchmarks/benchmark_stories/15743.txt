Once upon a time there was a great raven. He was brave and strong and flew high in the sky. One day the raven was soaring through the sky when he saw a little girl standing alone in a big field. The girl was shivering because it was cold and she didn't have a jacket.
The raven zoomed down to where the girl was and said, "Hello! Why are you shivering?" 
The little girl looked up at the raven and said, "I'm cold and I don't have a jacket." 
The raven replied, "Don't worry, I can help. I'm a great flyer and I can take you home."
The little girl was so grateful. She hopped onto the raven's back and they flew off into the sky. The raven kept the little girl warm by flapping her wings and soon enough they arrived safely at her home.
The little girl smiled and said, "Thank you for your great help and for keeping me warm. You were so brave and strong!" 
The raven smiled, said goodbye and flew away into the sky.
