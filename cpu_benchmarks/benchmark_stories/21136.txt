One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. It was a cold day, so Tim wore a big wrap to keep warm. They saw a big slide and Tim wanted to play on it. His mom said, "Be careful, Tim!"
Tim climbed up the slide and sat at the top. He saw a little girl named Sue at the bottom. She was scared of the slide. Tim wanted to help her, so he called out, "Don't be scared, Sue! It's fun!"
Sue looked at Tim and decided to be brave. She went up the slide and sat next to Tim. They both slid down together. As they went down, Sue screamed with joy. At the bottom, they both laughed and hugged each other.
Tim's mom saw how happy they were and said, "Good job, Tim! You helped Sue face her fear!" Tim felt proud and they all went home, still wrapped in their warm wraps, after a fun day at the park.
