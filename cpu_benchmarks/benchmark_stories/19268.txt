Once upon a time, there was a girl called Sam. She was very brave, but when she saw something scary, she had to tremble.
One day, Sam saw a messy room. There was lots of stuff lying around, so she decided to explore. Everywhere she went, she heard a strange sound.
Sam soon realised it was coming from an old trunk. There were lots of treasures inside, so she decided to trade one of her own. She gave them her favourite toy and brought back a shiny bracelet.
But when Sam put it on, things got messy. The bracelet started to tremble and glowed brightly! Sam quickly took it off, but she was still very brave. She knew she had made a good trade and nothing bad had happened in the end.
