Once upon a time, there was a big safari. The safari had many animals like lions, zebras, and elephants. The animals were all friends and they played together. One night, the moon was full and it made the safari glow. The animals were happy and danced in the glowing light. 
Suddenly, they heard a noise. It was a small animal they had never seen before. The animal was harmless and didn't want to hurt anyone. The animals welcomed the new friend and they all played together. The small animal was happy to be a part of the safari and they all continued to dance in the glowing moonlight. 
From that night on, the small animal was a part of the safari and they all had fun together. They would always remember the night when they danced in the glowing light of the moon.
