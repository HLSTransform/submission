Once upon a time, there was a mommy who wanted to bake cookies. She got a huge sheet and put it in the oven. She mixed flour, sugar, and eggs in a bowl. She put the cookie dough on the sheet and baked it. The cookies smelled so good! 
But then, the mommy got a phone call. She talked on the phone for too long and forgot about the cookies. The oven got too hot and the cookies burned. The mommy was sad because she couldn't eat the cookies. She had to throw them away. The end.
