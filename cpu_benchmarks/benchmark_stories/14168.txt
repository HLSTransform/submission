Once upon a time, there was a girl named Molly. She was three years old. One day, Molly was playing outside in the garden when she discovered something in the dirt. It was a nail. Molly picked it up and put it in her pocket.
Molly decided to ask her mom what to do with the nail. Her mom told her that it was very useful and there were lots of things she could do with it. Molly and her mom went inside and starting looking around.
They found some wood and some other things in the garage. Molly and her mom put it together so Molly could make something. She nailed the pieces of wood together, and in the end she made a pretty picture frame.
Molly was so proud of her work. She thought the nail was really useful and it helped her make something special. Molly was so glad that she had discovered the nail. The end.
