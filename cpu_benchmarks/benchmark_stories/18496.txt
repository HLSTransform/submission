Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play outside. They have a big ball and a small bike. They take turns to kick the ball and ride the bike.
One day, they see a big dog in the park. The dog is brown and furry. It has a long tail and a wet nose. The dog runs to them and wags its tail. It wants to play too.
"Hi, doggy!" Tom says. "Do you want to play with us?"
The dog barks and licks Tom's face. Tom laughs and pets the dog. Lily is scared of the dog. She hides behind the bike.
"Tom, I don't like the dog," Lily says. "It is too big and loud. Can we play something else?"
Tom looks at Lily and sees that she is sad. He wants to make her happy. He thinks of a new game.
"OK, Lily, let's play itch," Tom says. "We can scratch the dog and make it happy. The dog will scratch us back and make us laugh. It will be fun!"
Lily thinks about it. She likes to laugh. She likes to make others happy. She decides to try the new game.
"OK, Tom, let's play itch," Lily says. "But you go first."
Tom nods and walks to the dog. He scratches the dog's ears and belly. The dog wags its tail and rolls over. It scratches Tom's back and legs. Tom giggles and tickles the dog. The dog barks and licks Tom's face.
Lily watches them and smiles. She sees that the dog is friendly and playful. She feels ready to join them. She walks to the dog and scratches its chin and paws. The dog wags its tail and rolls over. It scratches Lily's arms and neck. Lily squeals and hugs the dog. The dog barks and licks Lily's face.
Tom and Lily are happy. They have a new friend. They play itch with the dog until they are tired. Then they sit on the grass and cuddle the dog. The dog snuggles with them and closes its eyes. They are all happy.
