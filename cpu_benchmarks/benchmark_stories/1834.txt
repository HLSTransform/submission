Once there was an ordinary girl named Mary who wanted to get a golf ball. She asked her mom if she could go get it. Her mom said yes and Mary was very excited. 
So Mary ran outside and went to the golf course near her house. She looked all around trying to find a golf ball. Eventually, she found one and got it! 
She was so happy to have a golf ball, she went back home and put it on her shelf. Mary was always so excited to get things, but she knew that she should never go to the golf course without her mom again. 
The end.
