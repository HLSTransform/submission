Johnny was a very special boy. He had a rare brain. It made him very smart. He could do things that other boys and girls his age couldn't do.
One day Johnny was playing with his toys in the garden. He wanted to show his mum how smart he was. He started to do somersaults and jump. He had so much fun!
Mum was so proud of him. She said, "You have a rare brain, Johnny. You can do so many things!" 
Johnny was very happy. He felt special that he had a rare brain. He kept practicing and having fun. Whenever he had questions, he knew he could always ask mum.
