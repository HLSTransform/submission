Once upon a time, there was a very adventurous girl who loved to go on trips. She always packed all the things she needed, such as snacks and clothes, but she always made sure to bring a towel too.
One day, the girl was getting ready to go on her most exciting trip ever. She wanted to make sure she was extra prepared, so she packed two towels, just in case. 
When the girl arrived at her destination, it began to rain. She smiled to herself, knowing that she had come prepared. She took out her towel and soaked up some of the rain. 
The rest of the girl's trip was wonderful. She soaked up the sun and enjoyed the dry warm sand of the beach. She was so happy she had brought her towel, because it made her trip that much better.
