Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a rod that he loved to play with. It was the only available toy he had. He would play with it all day, every day. Tim's rod was very special to him.
One day, Tim met a new friend named Sam. Sam did not have any toys to play with. Tim wanted to be a good friend, so he decided to give Sam his special rod. Sam was very happy to have a new toy to play with.
But then, something bad happened. Sam was playing with the rod near a big river. He was not careful, and the rod fell into the water. Sam and Tim tried to get the rod back, but it floated away, never to be seen again. Tim was very sad because he lost his special rod, and Sam was sad because he could not give it back.
