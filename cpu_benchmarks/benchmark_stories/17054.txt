Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very adventurous. He liked to play outside and explore new places. One day, Tim saw a big tree with many branches. He thought it would be fun to climb it.
As Tim started to climb, he felt an itch on his arm. He tried to scratch it, but the itch grew stronger. Tim's friend, Sam, saw him and said, "Tim, what are you doing? You need to prepare before you climb a tree. You should wear long sleeves to protect your arms."
Tim listened to Sam and went home to change his clothes. He put on a long sleeve shirt and went back to the tree. This time, he didn't feel any itch. He climbed the tree safely and had lots of fun. Tim learned that it's important to prepare before doing something adventurous.
From that day on, Tim always prepared before going on an adventure. He told his friends about the lesson he learned, and they all became more careful too. The moral of the story is: always prepare before you do something, so you can have fun and stay safe.
