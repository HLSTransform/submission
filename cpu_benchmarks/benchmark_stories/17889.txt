Once there was a girl called Izzy. She was three years old and loved to learn new things. 
One day Izzy's mum asked her if she wanted to learn a new spell. Izzy was very excited! 
Mum helped Izzy to learn the spell by showing her how to pronounce the words. She repeated the spell over and over until Izzy could remember it. 
When Izzy could say the spell without any help from her mum she started to practice every day. It was so interesting!
Every time Izzy said the spell it got easier and easier. This made Izzy very proud of herself. 
With her Mum's help, Izzy was soon able to cast the spell! It was the best day ever.
