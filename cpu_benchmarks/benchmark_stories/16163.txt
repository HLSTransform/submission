Once upon a time there lived a little girl, Lily. She was three years old and loved to explore the world. One day, Lily went exploring in a cave close to her home. As she ventured deeper into the cave, things began to get darker and darker. She saw many dirty, filthy rocks lining the walls. Lily kept going until, suddenly, she couldn't breathe. The air was stuffy, and there was no more oxygen.
"What is this place?" Lily asked.
Just then, a small creature came out from one of the rocks. It was Hidey, a friendly cave dweller.
"I'm Hidey," said Hidey. "I live in this cave and I hide when I can't find oxygen."
Lily was amazed.
"That's so cool," she said.
Hidey smiled.
"Why don't you come and explore the cave with me," he said.
Lily laughed with joy and accepted Hidey's offer. Together, they traveled through the filthy cave, exploring all the dark corners and discovering new and interesting things. From that day on, Lily and Hidey were best friends.
