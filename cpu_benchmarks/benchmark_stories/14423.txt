Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a magic wand that made things appear and disappear. One day, Lily was playing with her wand and accidentally cut her finger. It hurt a lot and she cried.
Her mom came running and saw the cut. She told Lily to be careful because her skin was fragile and could get hurt easily. Lily learned that she needed to be more careful when playing with her wand.
From that day on, Lily was more careful and never cut herself again. She realized that even magic things can be dangerous if not used properly. The moral of the story is to always be careful and take care of yourself and others.
