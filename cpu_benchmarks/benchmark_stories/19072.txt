Once upon a time, there were two friends - a boy and a girl. They loved to play together and have fun. But one day, they started to quarrel over a toy. The boy wanted to play with it, but the girl didn't want to share.
As they were arguing, they heard a loud crack. They looked around and saw that the toy had broken into two pieces. They both felt sad and didn't know what to do.
But then the boy had an idea. He suggested that they could take turns playing with the toy. The girl thought that was a polite thing to do, so they agreed. From that day on, they played together happily and never quarreled again.
