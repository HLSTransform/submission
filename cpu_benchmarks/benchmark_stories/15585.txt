Tommy liked to look at small things with his microscope. He got it from his dad, who was a scientist. Tommy wanted to be a scientist too, and learn about bugs and plants and stars.
One day, he found a furry caterpillar in the garden. He put it in a jar and took it to his room. He wanted to see it with his microscope. He put the jar on his desk and turned on the microscope. He was very careful, because he knew the microscope was fragile.
But then, his dog Spot came into his room. Spot was a big, friendly dog, but he was also very curious. He saw the jar and the microscope and wanted to play with them. He jumped on the desk and knocked over the jar and the microscope. The jar broke and the caterpillar escaped. The microscope broke too, and made a loud noise.
Tommy heard the noise and ran to his room. He saw the mess and was very sad and angry. He shouted at Spot, "Bad dog! You broke my microscope and my caterpillar! Go away!"
Spot looked at Tommy with his big, brown eyes. He wagged his tail and licked Tommy's face. He did not understand why Tommy was mad at him. He just wanted to have fun.
Tommy pushed Spot away and cried. He loved his dog, but he also loved his microscope. He did not know what to do. He wished he could fix his microscope and find his caterpillar. He wished he could be a scientist.
