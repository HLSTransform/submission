Alice loved to explore the wild beach. She ran through the sand and discovered many fun things. Today, she found a big oyster. She had never seen one before and was so excited!
Alice tapped the oyster and talked to it. "Hello, oyster!" 
The oyster did not move.
Alice decided to open the oyster. She found a rock inside. It was so heavy she needed help to carry it.
Alice asked her parents for help. They said, "Let's cover the oyster with a rock. Then we can bring it home."
Alice said, "Ok!" and she found the perfect rock to cover the oyster.
When they got home, her parents took off the rock and revealed something lovely. Inside the oyster was the most beautiful pearl!
Alice screamed with glee, "Look what I found in the wild oyster!"
