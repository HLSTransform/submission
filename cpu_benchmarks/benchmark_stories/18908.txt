Anna liked winter very much. She liked to play in the snow with her dog, Max. She liked to make snowmen and snow angels. She liked to wear her red coat and her pink hat and her warm boots.
One day, Anna and Max went to the park. They saw a big tree with many lights and shiny things. Anna thought it was very pretty. She wanted to look closer. She ran to the tree and Max followed her.
On the tree, Anna saw a big bow. It was blue and sparkly. Anna liked blue and sparkly things. She reached for the bow, but it was too high. She jumped, but she could not touch it. She felt sad.
Then, she heard a voice. It was a boy. He was standing next to the tree. He had a charming smile and brown eyes. He said, "Hello, do you like the bow? I can help you get it. I made it for the tree."
Anna smiled back. She said, "Yes, I like the bow. It is very pretty. Thank you for helping me." The boy lifted Anna up and gave her the bow. Anna hugged the bow and said, "Thank you, you are very nice. What is your name?"
The boy said, "My name is Ben. What is yours?" Anna said, "My name is Anna. This is my dog, Max. He likes you too." Max wagged his tail and licked Ben's face. Ben laughed and said, "He is very cute. Do you want to play with me in the snow?"
Anna nodded. She said, "Yes, I want to play with you. You are my new friend." Ben said, "You are my new friend too. Come on, let's have fun." They ran to the snow and played with Max. They had a wonderful time. They did not want to leave.
The end.
