Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a big jeep in the park. It is red and shiny. They want to ride the jeep.
"Can we ride the jeep?" Tom says to Sue.
"Yes, let's ride the jeep!" Sue says to Tom.
They climb on the jeep. They push the buttons. The jeep makes noises. It moves fast. They are happy.
But the jeep is not theirs. It belongs to a man. He is angry. He sees Tom and Sue on his jeep. He runs to them. He shouts.
"Hey, get off my jeep! You are bad kids! You are stealing my jeep!" he says to Tom and Sue.
Tom and Sue are scared. They try to get off the jeep. But the jeep is too fast. It goes out of control. It hits a tree. The jeep breaks. Tom and Sue cry. They are hurt. They have cuts and bruises. The man is still angry. He calls the police. The police come. They take Tom and Sue away. They are in trouble.
The end.
