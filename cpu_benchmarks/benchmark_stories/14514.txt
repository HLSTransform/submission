Once upon a time there was a young prince who liked to be very careless. One day, he was walking in the woods and he found a magical gold ring. He decided to use it, without thinking of the consequences.
As soon as he put the ring on, the prince was surrounded by a glowing light. Suddenly, he was transformed into a dragon! He flew all around the kingdom, creating a huge stir.
The people of the kingdom were scared and confused. But then one wise wizard arrived and used his magic to return the prince to his human form.
The prince learnt his lesson that day and he vowed to never be careless again. He became a great ruler, respected and loved by all who knew him. The people of the kingdom were delighted and lived happily ever after.
