Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a tooth that hurt a lot. He did not like it. It made him feel sad.
One day, Tim's mom gave him a green leaf to rub on his tooth. She said it would help his tooth feel better. Tim took the green leaf and rubbed it on his tooth. The leaf was bitter, but Tim kept rubbing.
After a while, Tim's tooth started to feel better. The bitter leaf helped his tooth not hurt anymore. Tim was happy, and he gave his mom a big hug. They both smiled, and Tim's tooth did not hurt anymore.
