Once upon a time there was a tire. It was blue and round. It was very happy living in the grass. One day, it saw two people fighting over it. The tire wanted to be left alone and so it rolled away. It pushed itself faster and faster until it was out of sight. Soon enough, the tire was far away and safe. It was so tired after its long adventure that it decided to take a nap. And it stayed there, safe and happy until the end of time.
