Mira liked to help her mom in the kitchen. She liked to stir things in the pan and smell the yummy food. One day, her mom was making soup and asked Mira to watch the pan while she went to get some bread.
Mira was a thoughtful girl, so she did what her mom said. She stirred the soup and looked at the pan. She saw bubbles and steam and colors. She wondered what would happen if she put her spoon in the soup and lifted it up.
She tried it and saw some soup on her spoon. She thought it looked tasty, so she put it in her mouth. It was hot and spicy and made her cough. She dropped the spoon and ran to get some water.
When she came back, she saw that the pan was empty. The soup was gone. She looked around and saw a big mess on the floor and the wall. She also saw her cat licking his paws and looking happy.
Mira realized that her cat had jumped on the stove and knocked over the pan. The soup had spilled everywhere and the cat had eaten some. She felt scared and sorry. She had made a mistake and let the soup disappear.
She ran to find her mom and tell her what happened. She hoped her mom would not be angry. She hoped her mom would still love her. She hoped they could make some more soup.
