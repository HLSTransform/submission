Once upon a time there was a mum and a dad. They had a little boy who they loved very much. One day they wanted to make something special - so they suggested to the little boy that they bake a cake.
They opened the oven and put a special mixture in. It smelt so yummy! Then they put it in the oven.
The dad said, “We will wait for the cake to cook.” But he was wrong. When they opened the oven, the cake had gone all black and it was very hurt. The little boy was sad - but the mum and dad said not to worry. 
They tried again and this time the cake was perfect. It smelt so yummy! The little boy was so happy. He was so glad that he had a special cake - and it tasted delicious!
