One night, Daisy was asleep in her bed. Suddenly, the sky outside began to glow in a bright pink color. "Oh, that's so pretty!" Daisy said as she jumped out of her bed and looked out the window.
Her mom came over to her, and asked Daisy what she was doing. Daisy said happily, "Look mommy, the sky is so pink. It's so pretty."
Her mother smiled and said, "That is the sunset. It happens every night."
Daisy was so excited that she wanted to show everyone the pretty pink sky. She ran outside in her pajamas and called to her neighbors, "Hey, look! It's so pink out here!" Everyone smiled and said, "It sure is!"
But then Daisy felt embarrassed. She realized that she was still wearing her pajamas, and everyone had seen her. She quickly ran back into the house. Despite being embarrassed, Daisy felt happy that she saw the glowing pink sky that night.
