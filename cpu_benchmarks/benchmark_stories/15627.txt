Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play near the river. There was a big bridge over the river, but their moms and dads did not permit them to go on the bridge. They said it was too high and too dangerous.
One day, Lily and Tom saw a big red balloon stuck on the bridge. They wanted to get the balloon and play with it. They thought their moms and dads would not see them if they were quick.
They ran to the bridge and climbed on the railing. They reached for the balloon, but it was too far. They leaned over the edge, but they lost their balance. They screamed as they fell into the water.
A man who was fishing heard their screams and ran to help them. He jumped into the water and pulled them out. He was very angry and scared. He said, "You are very foolish children! You could have died! Why did you go on the bridge when your moms and dads did not permit you?"
Lily and Tom were wet and cold and sorry. They cried and said, "We are sorry, mister. We wanted the balloon. We did not think it was dangerous. Please do not tell our moms and dads."
The man shook his head and said, "You are lucky I was here. You should always listen to your moms and dads. They know what is best for you. Come on, I will take you home and give you some dry clothes. And no more bridge, okay?"
Lily and Tom nodded and said, "Okay, mister. Thank you for saving us. And no more bridge, we promise." They learned their lesson and never went on the bridge again.
