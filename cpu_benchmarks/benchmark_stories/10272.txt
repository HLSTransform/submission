Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat spaghetti with her family. One day, her mom made spaghetti for dinner, and it smelled so good that Lily's tummy rumbled loudly.
After dinner, Lily and her family decided to go for a walk in the park. They saw lots of pretty flowers and heard birds chirping loudly. Lily saw some berries on a bush and wanted to gather them. But her mom said they were not safe to eat.
Suddenly, Lily saw a bright, shiny thing on the ground. She picked it up and put it in her pocket. But it was actually a dangerous thing, and it hurt her. She had to go to the hospital and couldn't eat spaghetti for a long time. She learned to always listen to her mom and not pick up things she didn't know.
