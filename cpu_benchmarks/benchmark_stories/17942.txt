Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom had a toy named Spike. Spike was a small, friendly dinosaur. Tom loved to play with Spike every day.
One day, Tom and Spike went to the park to play. They saw a big tree with a hole in it. Tom thought it would be easy to put Spike in the hole. So, Tom put Spike in the tree hole and they played hide and seek.
After playing, Tom wanted to take Spike home. But, when he tried to get Spike out of the hole, it wasn't easy. Tom was sad. Then, his mommy came and helped him. With mommy's help, they got Spike out of the hole. Tom was happy again and hugged Spike. They went home and had a fun day together.
