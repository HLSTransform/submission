Once upon a time there were two friends called Sally and Jake. They lived near the beach and liked to go there to play.
One day, Sally wanted to have a picnic but she had no food. She asked Jake to go and buy some.
"Please get some tuna," Sally said.
So Jake went to the store and asked the shopkeeper for some tuna. The shopkeeper said he only had a competitive tuna which cost more.
Jake came back with the competitive tuna and they had a wonderful picnic on the beach. They shared the tuna and they had a great day.
At the end of the day, they said goodbye and thanked each other for the picnic.
"Thank you for the competitive tuna," Sally said. 
"You're welcome," Jake said.
