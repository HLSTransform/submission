Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Timmy who heard a special rhythm. He felt that he wanted to follow it, but he was scared. He had never heard something like it before, and it felt unknown. His mom saw him standing still, without moving. She asked him what was wrong and Timmy told her he wanted to follow the rhythm, but he was scared. His mom said, "Come on Timmy, you can do it. Dare to follow the unknown rhythm." Timmy took a deep breath and started to move and follow the rhythm, and soon enough he was dancing! He was so happy! He had dared to do something new, and it was so rewarding.
