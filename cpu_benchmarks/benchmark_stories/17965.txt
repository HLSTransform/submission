One day, a little boy named Tim wanted to pack his toys for a trip. He had a big toy box with many toys. He loved to play with his magnet and toy car. Tim felt happy when he played with his toys.
But one day, Tim felt miserable. His toy car was lost, and he could not find it anywhere. Tim looked under his bed, in the closet, and behind the door. He felt sad because he could not play with his toy car.
Then, Tim had an idea. He took his magnet and walked around the house. The magnet was strong and could find his toy car. Tim moved the magnet near the sofa, and suddenly, the magnet pulled the toy car out from under the sofa. Tim was so happy to find his toy car. He packed his magnet and toy car in his bag, and went on the trip with a big smile on his face.
