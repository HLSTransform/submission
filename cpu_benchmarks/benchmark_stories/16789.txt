Lily and Ben are pupils in the same class. They like to play together, but they do not like the same food. Lily likes spicy food, like curry and chili. Ben likes sweet food, like cake and candy.
One day, their teacher brings a big pot of soup for lunch. She says it is a special soup, with many different flavors. She tells the pupils to try some and share with their friends.
Lily takes a big spoon of soup and puts it in her mouth. She smiles and says, "Yum, this soup is spicy and good. I like it a lot." She gives some soup to Ben and says, "Here, try some. You will like it too."
Ben takes a small sip of soup and makes a face. He says, "Yuck, this soup is spicy and bad. I do not like it at all." He gives some soup to Lily and says, "Here, take it back. You can have it all."
Lily and Ben start to argue. They say, "My food is better than your food. Your food is gross and icky. You have no taste. You are not my friend."
Their teacher hears them and comes over. She says, "Stop, stop, stop. Why are you fighting? You are both pupils in the same class. You are both friends. You do not have to like the same food. You can like different food and still be kind and share. That is what makes the soup special. It has many different flavors, like you have many different likes. Can you unite and try to understand each other?"
Lily and Ben look at each other. They feel sorry for being mean. They say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry. You are right, teacher. We do not have to like the same food. We can like different food and still be friends. We can unite and try to understand each other."
They hug and make up. They decide to try some other food from the pot. They find some food that they both like, like noodles and cheese. They say, "This food is yummy and good. We both like it a lot."
They smile and eat together. They are happy and united. The end.
