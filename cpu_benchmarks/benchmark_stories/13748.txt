Lila and Tom were playing with a ball in the park. They liked to kick the ball to each other and see how far it could go. Sometimes they pretended the ball was magic and could do amazing things.
"Look, I can make the ball fly over the tree!" Lila said, kicking the ball hard.
"Wow, that's so cool!" Tom said, running after the ball. "Can I try?"
"Sure, here you go!" Lila said, passing the ball to Tom.
Tom kicked the ball with all his might, but he missed the tree and hit a man who was sitting on a bench. The man was angry and shouted at Tom.
"Hey, you ignorant kid, watch where you kick that ball! You could have hurt me!"
Tom was scared and sorry. He did not mean to hit the man. He ran back to Lila and hugged her.
"Lila, I'm sorry, I didn't see the man. He was very mean to me. He called me ignorant. What does that mean?"
Lila hugged Tom back and said, "It means he doesn't know you. He doesn't know you are a good and smart kid who likes to play with magic. He is the ignorant one, not you."
Tom felt better and smiled. He said, "Thank you, Lila. You are a good and smart friend. Can we play with the ball some more?"
Lila nodded and said, "Yes, let's play. But let's be careful not to hit anyone else. Maybe we can find a bigger space where we can kick the ball higher and farther."
They took the ball and ran to a bigger space. They kicked the ball and laughed and had fun. They forgot about the angry man and enjoyed their magic.
