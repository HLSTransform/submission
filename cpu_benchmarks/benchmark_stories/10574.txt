Once upon a time, there was an old bookshelf that stood inside a small room. The room had furry furniture, and it was cozy and warm.
One night, something strange happened. When the family who lived in the house opened the door of the small room, they saw something they didn't expect.
The family found that all of the books from the old bookshelf were scattered all over the room. They were confused and wondered how this could have happened. 
As they started to clean up the mess, the family heard a noise from the corner of the room. It was the family's pet cat who had knocked over the bookshelf, causing all the books to scatter. The family laughed as they realized what had happened and quickly put the books back onto the bookshelf. 
The family learned a lesson that day about how to be careful of their furry pet and to be sure to secure all of the things in the room, especially the old bookshelf.
