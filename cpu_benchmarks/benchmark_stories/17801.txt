Once upon a time there was a little boy who lived in a small village. His neighbor had a secret garden that was hidden deep in the forest. The little boy often wanted to explore it but he knew he wasn't allowed. When he asked his neighbor if he could go inside, the neighbor said no.
One day, the little boy decided to explore the garden anyway. He found a magical gate and went through it. The garden was full of fascinating plants, animals and surprises. The little boy loved it!
But soon the neighbor spotted him in the garden and asked him to leave. He said it was not meant for him and he didn't want them to mix. So the little boy reluctantly separated from the garden and went back home.
The little boy was sad but he remembered all the wonderful memories he had made in the secret garden. So he smiled and went back to play in his own garden.
