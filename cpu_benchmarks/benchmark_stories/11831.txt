Once upon a time, there lived a turtle named Trey. Trey was a very compassionate creature and loved to joke around with his friends. One day, Trey decided to take a special tray into the forest and share it with some of his animal friends.
When Trey arrived, he could see many of his friends gathered around the tray filled with yummy treats. As Trey slowly approached the tray, he could hear laughter from his animal friends. Trey began to laugh too and started to joke around with them!
Trey's friends were so happy to have him around. He was so kind and always had a joke for them. All the animals in the forest were very thankful for Trey's compassionate heart. They were glad that Trey shared his special tray with them, for it was made of love and laughter!
