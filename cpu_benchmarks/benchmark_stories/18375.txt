Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a mighty tree. The tree was very big and tall. It was a happy tree, and everyone loved it. One day, a little boy named Tim wanted to hang a swing on the tree. He asked his dad for help.
Tim and his dad worked together to hang the swing on the tree. They were very careful not to hurt the tree. When they finished, Tim loved to swing high in the air. The tree was happy too, because it could make Tim happy.
One day, Tim saw a lot of cars in traffic near the tree. The cars made a lot of noise and smoke. Tim did not like this. He told his friends to walk or ride bikes instead of using cars. Soon, the town was quiet and clean again. The mighty tree was happy, and Tim learned that we should care for nature and keep our town clean.
