Lily and Mom went to the market. Lily saw a big red balloon. She wanted it very much.
"Mom, can I have the balloon?" Lily asked.
"Not today, sweetie. We have to buy food and other things." Mom said.
"But I love the balloon! It is so pretty and shiny!" Lily said. She started to cry.
Mom tried to calm Lily down. She hugged her and said, "I know you love the balloon, but we can't buy everything we see. Maybe another day, okay?"
Lily did not listen. She insisted on having the balloon. She screamed and kicked. She made a lot of noise.
People at the market looked at Lily and Mom. They shook their heads. They thought Lily was crazy.
"Please, Lily, stop it. You are making a scene. You are being very rude." Mom said.
But Lily did not stop. She wanted the balloon more than anything.
Then, a nice man came over. He had a lot of balloons. He smiled and said, "Hello, little girl. Do you like balloons?"
Lily nodded. She stopped crying.
The man said, "I have a special balloon for you. It is not red, but it is very special. Do you want to see it?"
Lily nodded again. She was curious.
The man gave Lily a balloon. It was not red. It was green. And it had a face on it. It was a frog balloon.
Lily looked at the frog balloon. She laughed. She liked it very much.
"Thank you, mister!" Lily said.
"You're welcome, little girl. Enjoy your balloon." The man said.
Mom thanked the man too. She was relieved. She said, "Lily, you are very lucky. The man gave you a nice balloon. But you have to be more polite next time. You can't always insist on what you want. Do you understand?"
Lily nodded. She hugged Mom and said, "I'm sorry, Mom. I love you. And I love my frog balloon."
Mom smiled and said, "I love you too, Lily. And I'm glad you love your frog balloon. Now, let's go home."
They left the market. Lily held her frog balloon. She was happy. Mom held Lily's hand. She was happy too.
