Once upon a time, there was a thin duck. He was always very careful, because he was so small and thin. One day, he wanted to take a walk. He waddled off and soon was out of sight. He vanished! 
The duck's family searched high and low for the duck, but they couldn't find him. They looked all over, but he was gone. He had vanished! 
They kept looking, but didn't find him for days. They thought he might be lost forever. Then, one day, the duck found his way back home! His family was so happy and surprised to see him. He had not vanished after all! He was back safe and sound. The end.
