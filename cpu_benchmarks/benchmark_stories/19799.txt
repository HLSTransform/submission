Once upon a time there was a powerful man. He had a special treasure. He wanted to protect it very much. He built a strong box and put it inside. Every day he chose the best locks to keep it safe. 
One day, a dragon flew by and saw the treasure. He wanted it very much and looked for ways to get it. He tried to break the locks, but they held strong. He then tried to dig through the ground, but it was too strong. 
So the dragon went away and he never came back. The man kept protecting his treasure so that no one else would ever get it. To this day, it's still safe in the special box.
