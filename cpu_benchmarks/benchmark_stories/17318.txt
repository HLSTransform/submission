Once upon a time, there was a hippo named Harry. Harry was a big, gray hippo who loved to eat lots of plants and swim in the river. One day, Harry ate too much and felt sick. He regretted eating so much and wished he had been more careful.
Harry decided to go for a walk to feel better. As he walked, he saw his friend, a healthy giraffe named George. George asked Harry if he was feeling okay. Harry told George that he ate too much and regretted it. George told Harry that it was okay and that he should rest and drink some water.
Harry took George's advice and rested by the river. He drank lots of water and felt better. From then on, Harry made sure to eat healthy and not overeat, so he wouldn't have to regret it again.
