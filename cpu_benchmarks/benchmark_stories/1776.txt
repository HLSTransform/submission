One day, Jack was having a picnic with his family in the park. His mum and dad were happy, but Jack was sad. He had a sore tummy and was suffering.
"What's wrong, Jack?" his dad asked.
"I feel really sick," Jack replied.
So, his mum filled a cup with some medicine and passed it to Jack.
"Come on, Jack. Drink up," she said.
Jack was not happy to take the medicine but he knew it would make him feel better soon.
The park was very noisy, with kids playing and laughing. Soon, Jack forgot about his pain and started to join in the fun. He ran around with the other kids and even raced his dad!
The day ended with a happy, healthy Jack. He had no more suffering and he had made lots of new friends!
