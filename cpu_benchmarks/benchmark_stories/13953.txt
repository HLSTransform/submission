Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. One day, Timmy had to go to the toilet really bad. He told his mommy, "Mommy, I need to hurry to the toilet!" 
When Timmy got to the toilet, he saw something interesting on the wall. It was a picture of a funny monkey! Timmy laughed and showed his mommy the picture when he was done.
After Timmy finished, he washed his hands and ran back to his toys. He was happy that he didn't have an accident and that he got to see the interesting monkey picture.
