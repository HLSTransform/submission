Polly was an enthusiastic three year old with a flashlight. She was always looking for adventures and fun. One night, Polly grabbed her flashlight and snuck outside. She pointed the flashlight forward and started to shoot around the garden. She had so much fun and wondered what else she could discover. Suddenly, she heard a noise coming from behind the tree. With the flashlight pointing forward, she slowly made her way closer. She was so brave and excited. As she came closer, she saw a big butterfly! Polly was thrilled and jumped around like crazy. Then, she shone the flashlight onto the butterfly and it flew away. She giggled and enjoyed shooting around with her flashlight.
