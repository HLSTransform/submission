Once upon a time, there was a smooth rock. The rock lived in a big park with lots of sunshine. The rock loved to feel the warm sun on its smooth face.
One day, a little girl named Lily came to the park. She saw the smooth rock and went to sit on it. Lily liked how the rock felt when she touched it. She also liked to point at the birds in the sky.
Lily came to the park every day to sit on the smooth rock. They became good friends. They liked to watch the sunshine together and point at the pretty things they saw. And they lived happily ever after.
