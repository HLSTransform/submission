Once upon a time, a little boy named Tim found a broken toy in his room. He wanted to fix it, but he did not know how. So, Tim went to his dad for help.
His dad said, "We can pack this toy and take it to Grandpa. He can fix it." Tim was happy and they packed the broken toy. On the way to Grandpa's house, they saw a big cobweb. Tim was scared, but his dad said, "Don't worry, it's just a cobweb."
When they reached Grandpa's house, they showed him the broken toy. Grandpa tried to fix it, but he could not. Tim was very sad. His toy was still broken and could not be fixed. They went back home with the broken toy and Tim cried.
