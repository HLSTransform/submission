Once upon a time, there was a grumpy cat named Whiskers. Whiskers didn't like to play with the other animals in the park because they would tease him. One day, Whiskers saw a big building with a pointy roof. It was a church! Whiskers had never seen a church before.
Whiskers decided to go inside the church and see what it was like. Inside, he saw lots of people singing and praying. Whiskers liked the music and the pretty stained glass windows. He forgot all about being grumpy.
After the church service was over, some kids came up to Whiskers and started to tease him. But Whiskers didn't mind. He was happy he had found the church and felt peaceful inside. From that day on, Whiskers liked going to the church to listen to the music and see the pretty windows.
