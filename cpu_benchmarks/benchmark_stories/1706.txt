Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the fields near her house. One day, she found a big bag of corn lying on the ground. She picked it up and took it home.
Her mommy cooked the corn for dinner that night. It was very mild and tasty. Lily smiled as she ate it all up. After dinner, she went to bed feeling very happy.
The next day, Lily woke up and went outside to play again. She saw a scarecrow in the field and decided to go say hello. As she got closer, she saw that the scarecrow was wearing the same shirt as her daddy! She smiled and ran back to the house to tell her mommy.
Later that day, her daddy came home and they all went outside to see the scarecrow. Lily's daddy was surprised to see his shirt on the scarecrow. He smiled and laughed, realizing that he must have left it in the field when he was helping with the corn harvest. From then on, they always checked the scarecrow for any lost items before leaving the field.
