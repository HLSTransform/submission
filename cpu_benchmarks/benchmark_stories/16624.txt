Ben and Lily wanted to play outside, but it was raining. They put on their cheap raincoats and boots and ran to the park. They saw a big puddle and jumped in it. They splashed and laughed and made waves.
"Look, a duck!" Lily said, pointing to a bird in the water. "Let's feed it some bread."
They ran to the bench where they left their bag. They took out some bread and tore it into pieces. They threw the bread to the duck and watched it eat.
"Quack, quack, thank you!" the duck said.
"Wow, it can talk!" Ben said, surprised.
"No, silly, I said that!" Lily said, giggling.
They threw more bread to the duck and it quacked happily. But then they felt cold and wet. They shivered and hugged each other.
"Let's go home, I'm freezing!" Ben said.
"Me too, let's go!" Lily said.
They waved goodbye to the duck and ran back to their house. They took off their wet clothes and put on warm ones. They drank some hot chocolate and sat by the fire.
"That was fun, but I don't like being wet and cold," Ben said.
"Me neither, but I liked the duck. Maybe we can see it again when it's sunny," Lily said.
They smiled and cuddled with their mom. They felt cozy and happy.
