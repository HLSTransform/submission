Once upon a time there was a cow. She was very crazy and did lots of silly things. One day a man saw the cow and he thought he could teach her to do something better.
So the man said to the cow, “I can teach you something special.” The cow was very excited and she nodded her head. 
The man began to teach the cow some simple tricks. He first taught her to sit. The cow learned very quickly. Then he taught her to stand up. The cow got the hang of it quickly and was getting better and better. 
Finally, the man taught the cow to jump. It was the trickiest one and it took the cow the longest to learn. But soon enough, she was jumping like a crazy cow!
The man and the cow were so proud of themselves. They had both learned something new and it was so much fun.
