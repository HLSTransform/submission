Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy who wanted to go to the market. So, one day, they put on their shoes, got in the car and drove away.
When they got to the market, it was very gloomy. The mommy and daddy looked around and saw lots of people using money to buy things. They bought some food and bought some toys.
When they were done, they put their bags in the car and got back in. But on the way home, the car started to make a noise.
Daddy stopped the car and looked at it. He used some tools and fixed the car so they could get home again. When they got home, they were so glad because they knew they could get back to the market soon!
