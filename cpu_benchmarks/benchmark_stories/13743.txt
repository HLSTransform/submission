Anna and Ben were playing in the park with their mom. They saw a big pond with ducks and fish. Anna wanted to swim in the pond, but Ben was scared.
"Can we swim, mom?" Anna asked.
"No, dear, the pond is not for swimming. It is too dirty and cold. And there might be something enormous in the water that could hurt you," mom said.
"Like what?" Ben asked.
"Like a crocodile, or a shark, or a monster," mom said, trying to scare them.
Anna and Ben gasped. They did not want to meet a crocodile, or a shark, or a monster. They backed away from the pond and looked for something else to do.
They saw a slide, a swing, and a sandbox. They ran to the slide and took turns sliding down. They had fun and forgot about the pond.
But then they heard a loud splash. They turned around and saw something enormous in the water. It had a long tail, a big mouth, and sharp teeth. It was a crocodile!
"Mom, mom, look!" Anna shouted.
"Run, run, run!" mom yelled.
They ran as fast as they could to the car. They did not stop until they were safe inside. They locked the doors and looked out the window. The crocodile was still in the pond, looking for food.
"Mom, how did a crocodile get in the pond?" Ben asked.
"I don't know, dear. Maybe someone brought it here and left it. Or maybe it escaped from the zoo. Or maybe it was always here and we never noticed," mom said.
"Mom, you never mentioned a crocodile before," Anna said.
"I never knew, dear. I never knew," mom said.
