Sara was sad. She did not want Mom to leave. Mom had a big bag and a nice blouse. Mom said she had to go to work.
"Please stay, Mom. I want to play with you," Sara said.
Mom hugged Sara and kissed her. "I love you, Sara. I will be back soon. You can play with Dad and your toys. Dad will make you lunch and read you a story," Mom said.
Sara looked at Dad. Dad smiled and waved. He had a serious face. He said he had to do some work too, but he would play with Sara later.
"Okay, Mom. I love you too. Have a good day," Sara said. She tried to be brave.
Mom smiled and said goodbye. She left with her big bag and her nice blouse.
Sara watched Mom go. She felt a tear in her eye. She ran to Dad and hugged him. Dad hugged her back and wiped her tear.
"Don't worry, Sara. Mom will come back soon. She always does. Now, how about we play with your dolls? You can choose their clothes and names," Dad said.
Sara nodded and smiled. She liked her dolls. She had a lot of clothes for them. She had a blouse like Mom's. She decided to name her doll Mom. She and Dad played with the dolls until lunch time. Sara felt better. She knew Mom loved her and would come back. She loved Mom and Dad too. They were her family.
