Once upon a time, there was a hard rock. It was very big and lived in a forest full of pine trees. The hard rock had many friends, like the soft grass and the tall trees. They all played together and had fun in the forest.
One day, a strong wind came and blew the hard rock far away from its friends. The hard rock tried to go back, but it was too heavy to move. The hard rock felt sad and alone, and it missed its friends very much.
Then, a wise old bird saw the hard rock and knew it needed help. The bird told the hard rock to separate into smaller rocks, so it could move more easily. The hard rock did as the bird said, and it became many little rocks. With the help of the wind, the little rocks went back to their friends in the pine forest. They were all happy to be together again, and they played and had fun like before.
