Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a noisy dog named Max. Max barked all day and all night. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a mug filled with warm milk. Timmy drank the milk and put the mug down. Suddenly, the mug vanished! Timmy looked around, but he couldn't find it anywhere. He asked Max if he had seen the mug, but Max just barked loudly. Timmy was sad because he loved that mug. But then, the mug reappeared! It was on the shelf, right where Timmy had left it. Timmy was so happy and gave Max a big hug.
