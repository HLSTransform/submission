Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved to play the piano. Every day, she went to sit in front of the piano and made lovely music. One day, her mom said she had to shut the piano, because she was too noisy.
The girl was sad, but she did as she was told. She shut the piano and tried to find something else to do, but nothing seemed as useful as playing the piano.
The girl soon got very lonely not being able to make music. She tried to think of something else she could do, but nothing was as useful to her as playing the piano.
One day, the girl decided to disobey her parents and play the piano again. But this time, there was an awful noise coming from it. Suddenly the piano stopped working altogether.
The girl was very sad, because she could no longer play the piano and her mom was very cross. Now the girl had to find something else useful to do with her time.
