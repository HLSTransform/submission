Once upon a time, there was a little birdy named Tweet. Tweet was very shy and didn't like to talk to other birdies. One day, Tweet was flying when he saw a big, scary cat. Tweet was so scared that he didn't know what to do. But then, he remembered that his mommy told him to protect himself.
Tweet decided to fly away as fast as he could. He flew and flew until he found a tree with many other birdies. Tweet felt safe and happy with his new friends. They played and sang together all day long.
Tweet learned that it's important to protect yourself when you're scared. He also learned that having friends makes you feel less scared. Even though Tweet was shy, he made new friends and felt brave. The end.
