Once upon a time, there was a woman. She was very calm and kind. One day, she lost her favorite toy. She searched everywhere for it. She looked under the bed, in the closet, and even in the garden. But she couldn't find it. 
She was very sad, but she didn't give up. She kept searching and searching. Finally, she found her toy in the kitchen. She was so happy! She hugged her toy tightly and felt calm again. 
From that day on, she learned to never give up and to always keep searching for what she wants.
