One day, Tom saw something that made him very surprised. It was a knife! He had never seen one before and he was scared. He wanted his mum to help him, but she wasn't there.
Suddenly, an old man appeared. He had seen what Tom was looking at and he wanted to help. He asked Tom if he was okay and Tom felt a bit better.
The old man asked Tom to come closer. He said that he had something that might help. It was a rubber knife which looked like the one Tom had seen. It was yellow and it didn't look dangerous at all!
Tom felt a bit less helpless with the rubber knife in his hand. He showed it to his mum when she came back and told her about the kind old man who had appeared and helped him. 
Tom was so thankful that the old man had appeared when he needed help! He would never forget the day he saw the real knife and the old man who had made him feel less helpless.
