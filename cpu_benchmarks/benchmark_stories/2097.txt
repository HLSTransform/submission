Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mom went to a restaurant. The restaurant had a big menu with lots of yummy food on it. Lily looked at the menu and picked out some spaghetti for her dinner.
While they were waiting for their food, Lily played with her straw in her water glass. She accidentally knocked over the glass and the water soaked her mom's shirt. Her mom got a little bit angry and said "that was stupid, Lily". But then they both laughed and had a fun dinner together. The end.
