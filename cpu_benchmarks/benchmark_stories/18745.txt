Lily liked to travel with her mom and dad. They went to many places and saw many things. Lily liked to ride in the car, the bus, the train, and the plane. But her favorite thing was to ride in the elevator.
The elevator was a big box with buttons and doors. Lily liked to push the buttons and watch the doors open and close. She liked to feel the elevator go up and down. She liked to hear the ding when the elevator stopped.
One day, Lily and her mom and dad went to a big hotel. They had a big suitcase with their clothes and toys. They went to the elevator and Lily pushed the button. The doors opened and they went inside. Lily pushed another button with a big number on it.
The elevator started to go up. Lily felt happy and excited. She looked at the numbers on the wall. They changed as the elevator went higher and higher. She counted with her mom and dad. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
The elevator stopped and the doors opened. Lily saw a long hall with many doors. She followed her mom and dad to their room. They opened the door and went inside. Lily saw a big bed with a soft blanket and a soft pillow. She jumped on the bed and felt the softness. She smiled and hugged her mom and dad. She liked to travel and she liked the elevator. But she also liked to rest on the soft bed. She closed her eyes and dreamed of more adventures.
