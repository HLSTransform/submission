Once there was a model. The model was very light. It was made of wood and had three parts. Each part was very special. 
One day, the model had an argument and it became unhappy. The three parts started to separate. One of the parts tried to stay and help, but the other two parts had to go away. 
The one part stayed with the model but they were not happy. It was very lonely without the other two parts. 
One day, the two parts that had gone away returned. They had been lost, but now they were back. The model was overjoyed and all the parts were reunited. 
The model was so happy that its parts shone more brightly than ever. All the parts stayed together and were never separated again.
