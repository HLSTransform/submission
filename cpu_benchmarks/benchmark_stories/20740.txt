John was playing in the park. He ran to a swing and he was so happy. He wanted to try it out. He started to yell "swing! swing!" but he couldn't reach it. Suddenly he saw a helpful grown-up. She said "I'll help you". John was very thankful.
The grown-up lifted him onto the swing. John started to move back and forth while he yelled "weee!". The grown-up laughed and said he was very brave. John was having so much fun.
When John started to get tired, the helpful grown-up said it was time to get off. He thanked her and ran back to the playground. He was so excited to tell his mom all about his adventure.
