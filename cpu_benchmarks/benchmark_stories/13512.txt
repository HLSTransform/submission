Once upon a time, there was a big cow named Betsy. Betsy liked to eat lots of grass and hay. One day, Betsy's farmer came to show her to some visitors. The visitors liked Betsy's big brown eyes and her soft fur. They also noticed that Betsy was very impatient and wanted to eat some beef.
But the farmer said, "No, Betsy is not for eating. She is our friend and helps us make milk." Betsy was happy to hear that she was a friend and not going to be eaten. She mooed happily and went back to eating her grass. The visitors went away and Betsy was content to be with her farmer and her cow friends.
