Once upon a time there were two friends, Raffi and Susan. They liked to play in the garden together.
One day Raffi found a big bucket of water. He wanted to share it with his friend so he put it on the ground and said: "Let's scatter the water!"
So Raffi and Susan took turns to scoop up the water and scatter it around the garden. They laughed and splashed each other. The water felt cool on their toes.
When their bucket was empty, they looked around. They noticed that the flowers were looking a bit weak. So they decided to grab the bucket again, filled it up with water and scattered it around the garden.
The water made the flowers grow and become strong and healthy. Raffi and Susan were so excited that they hugged each other in joy.
They had a lot of fun playing together and helping the flowers.
