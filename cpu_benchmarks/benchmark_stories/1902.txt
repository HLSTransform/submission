Once upon a time, there was a brave explorer who had an eager heart to rescue the world. She packed her bag full of supplies and went to explore. She went on an adventure, taking big steps and smiling the whole way.
Suddenly, the brave explorer came to a big hill. From the top of the hill, she could see a wide world. It was so big that she couldn't believe her eyes!
She noticed something strange. In the middle of the world was a huge lake with a boat stuck inside. She saw somebody waving and shouting, "Help me! Please rescue me!"
The brave explorer was eager to help. She tied her bag to her back and slowly made her way down the hill. When she got to the lake, she jumped in and started to paddle the boat. Within minutes, the person inside was free!
The explorer was so happy she had been able to rescue the world. She waved goodbye to the person in the boat, smiled and took off to explore more!
