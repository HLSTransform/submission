Mia liked to walk by herself. She was a big girl and very independent. She did not need to hold her mom's hand or stay close to her dad. She wanted to explore and see new things.
One day, she saw a bridge over a stream. She wanted to cross the bridge and see what was on the other side. She ran towards the bridge, but she did not see the big rock on the ground. She stumbled and fell. She scraped her knee and started to cry.
Her mom and dad heard her cry and ran to help her. They picked her up and hugged her. They cleaned her knee and put a band-aid on it. They told her they were proud of her for being brave and curious, but they also reminded her to be careful and watch where she was going.
Mia felt better and said sorry for running away. She said she still wanted to cross the bridge, but she would hold her mom's hand this time. Her mom and dad smiled and agreed. They crossed the bridge together and saw some ducks and flowers on the other side. Mia was happy and learned a lesson. She realized that being independent was good, but being safe and loved was better.
