John and his dad went to a stadium together. John was eager to see the game.
As they sat down in the stadium, John saw many people around him enjoying different types of food. His dad handed him some food and said, “Try it and see if you like the taste.”
John took a bite and said, “It’s yummy, Dad!” His dad smiled and said, “I’m glad you liked it. We can get more if you’re still hungry.”
John was eager to keep trying new things. He tasted a hot dog and said, “This tastes great too, Dad!” His dad laughed and said, “I guess you’re quite the food taster, aren’t you?”
John beamed with pride. They continued to enjoy the games and snacks at the stadium.
