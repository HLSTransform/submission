Once upon a time there was a boy called George. He was only three years old, but very brave. One day George made a strange request. He asked his mom to take him outside in the dark of night.
George's mom was very worried about her brave son, but she agreed. When they stepped outside, George pointed to the ground. In the moonlight there was a weird shadow. It was long and slim, almost like a ghost. 
George gave another request, "Mom, can I touch the shadow?" His mom was very scared but said yes, although she was ready to grab her son if the shadow did anything strange.
But George was not scared. He reached down and touched the shadow. Nothing happened and it disappeared. George asked what had happened. His mom told him the shadow was gone because George was brave and it had gone away.
Since that night, every time George sees a weird shadow, he courageously reaches out to touch it and it always disappears.
