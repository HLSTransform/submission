One day, a group of eager aliens were ready to begin their mission, to clean up the planet. They all double checked their gear, zipped up their uniforms, and huddled together to get ready.
"Today's the day" one alien said.
The others nodded in agreement and eagerly followed the lead alien, ready to start the mission.
The aliens spread out and began to clean the planet. They flew from tree to tree and picked up the trash, then flew up into the sky to pick up the rubbish in the clouds.
The planet was looking much cleaner, and the aliens were very happy.
"We have done a great job!" the lead alien said. The others agreed with smiles, and they worked hard until the planet was sparkling clean. 
The aliens were exhausted, but they had accomplished their mission. "Good work everyone!" the lead alien said with a smile. 
The eager aliens flew off into the night, happily knowing they had done their job.
