Tom is a musician. He likes to play his guitar and sing songs. He has a gray hat and a gray coat. He goes to the park every day and plays his guitar for the people. Some people give him money and some people give him smiles.
One day, a man comes to the park. He has a big car and a big smile. He says to Tom, "Hello, musician. I like your songs. Do you want to sell me your guitar? I will give you a lot of money."
Tom thinks for a moment. He likes his guitar. It is his friend. He says to the man, "No, thank you. I do not want to sell my guitar. It is not for sale."
The man says, "But think of all the things you can buy with the money. You can buy a new hat, a new coat, a new guitar, anything you want."
Tom shakes his head. He says, "I do not need those things. I have everything I need. I have my guitar, my songs, and my friends in the park. They make me happy. Money does not make me happy."
The man frowns. He says, "You are a silly musician. You are missing a great opportunity. You will regret it." He gets in his car and drives away.
Tom does not care. He puts on his gray hat and his gray coat. He picks up his guitar and sings a song. He is happy. He is a musician.
