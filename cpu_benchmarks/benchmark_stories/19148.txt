One day, a boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. In the park, there was a stand. The stand had many toys. Some toys were big and some toys were small. Tim saw an expensive toy car. He wanted the car very much.
Tim said to his mom, "Mom, can I have the expensive toy car, please?" His mom smiled and joked, "That car is too big for your pocket!" Tim laughed at his mom's joke. But his mom said, "We can't buy the expensive toy car today."
Tim was sad, but he understood. He played with his old toy car at the park. He had fun with his mom. They went home and had a good day. Tim knew that even without the expensive toy car, they could still have fun and laugh together.
