Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. He was only three years old, and he loved to explore the world around him.
One day, Jack was walking in the woods. All of a sudden, he spied a big barrel up ahead. As he got closer, it began to shine in the sunlight.
Jack was so excited to explore the barrel that he tried to open the lid. He tried and tried, but it just wouldn't budge.
That's when a friendly old man saw Jack and came to help. "Let me try," he said, and with a few turns of his tool he opened it right up. 
Jack's face shone with delight! But when he looked inside, he saw a tiny kitten. She was so helpless and scared that she started to mew.
The old man said to the little boy, "Let's take her home and give her a good home and lots of love." 
And so they did. The bright barrel was filled with a tiny, helpless kitten and lots and lots of love.
