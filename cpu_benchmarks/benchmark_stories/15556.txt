Tom was a boy who liked to play with his whistle. He blew it loud and made funny sounds. He liked to whistle when he walked to the park, when he ate his lunch, and when he went to bed.
One day, he saw a new girl in the park. She had long hair and a red dress. She was playing with a ball. Tom wanted to be her friend, so he walked up to her and blew his whistle.
"Hi, I'm Tom. This is my whistle. Do you want to play with me?" he asked.
The girl looked at him and frowned. She did not like the loud noise. She covered her ears and said, "No, thank you. Your whistle is too noisy. It hurts my ears. Go away."
Tom felt sad and confused. He did not understand why the girl did not like his whistle. He thought it was fun and cool. He walked away and sat on a bench. He did not want to whistle anymore.
Then, he saw a boy with a bike. The boy had a helmet and a smile. He rode up to Tom and stopped. He said, "Hi, I'm Sam. I like your whistle. Can I try it?"
Tom looked at him and smiled. He was happy to meet someone who liked his whistle. He said, "Sure, you can try it. I'm Tom. Do you want to be my friend?"
Sam nodded and took the whistle. He blew it loud and made funny sounds. He said, "This is awesome. I love your whistle. Yes, I want to be your friend. Do you want to ride my bike?"
Tom nodded and gave him a high-five. He said, "Yes, I want to ride your bike. Let's go."
They swapped the whistle and the bike and rode around the park. They had fun and laughed. They introduced themselves to other kids and made more friends. They shared their toys and snacks. Tom gave Sam a sour candy and Sam made a funny face. They both giggled.
Tom was glad he met Sam. He learned that not everyone likes the same things, and that's okay. He learned that he can find friends who like what he likes, and that's great. He learned that he can introduce himself to new people, and that's brave. He learned that he can whistle and be happy, and that's wonderful.
