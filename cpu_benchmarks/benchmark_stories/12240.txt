One day, Billy was walking through the park. He was looking for something special. Suddenly, he found a little brown box. He was excited and he opened the box. Inside, he found a little jazz toy! He was so happy and he started playing with it.
Then, he saw an old man nearby. The man wore very wise clothes and looked wise too. Billy asked the man what the jazz toy was. The old man smiled.
The old man said, "That's a special toy! It plays jazz music and it will make you feel wise too!" Billy was happy to hear that and started playing the jazz toy with a big smile on his face. 
From then on, whenever Billy played with the jazz toy, he always thought back to the wise old man, who had helped him to find it.
