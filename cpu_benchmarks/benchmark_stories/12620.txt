Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved peanuts and would always ask her mom for some. One day, her mom went to the store to provide Lily with a big bag of peanuts. 
Lily was so happy and ate all of the peanuts in one sitting. But later that night, Lily heard a fierce noise coming from her closet. She was scared and didn't know what to do. 
But then she remembered that her mom had given her a toy sword to play with earlier that day. Lily grabbed the sword and bravely opened her closet door. 
To her surprise, she found a little mouse eating the leftover peanuts from her bag. The mouse looked up at Lily and they became friends. From that day on, Lily always shared her peanuts with her new mouse friend.
