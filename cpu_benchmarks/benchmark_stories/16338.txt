Once upon a time, there was a nice little girl named Lily. She loved to eat olives and would always ask her mom to buy them from the store. One day, Lily's mom promised to bring her olives home after work. But, her mom got delayed at work and couldn't come home on time.
Lily waited and waited for her mom to come home with olives, but she didn't. Lily got sad and started to cry. Her dad saw her crying and asked her what was wrong. Lily told him that she wanted olives but her mom got delayed and didn't bring them home.
Lily's dad knew how much she loved olives, so he went to the store and bought her a big jar of olives. Lily was so happy and hugged her dad tight. She learned that even when things get delayed, there is always a way to make things better.
