Lily loved lollipops. She liked to lick them and make them smaller and smaller. She liked the sweet taste and the bright colors. But she did not like to bathe. She hated the water and the soap and the shampoo. She cried and kicked when her mom tried to wash her.
One day, her mom had a clever idea. She bought a big lollipop for Lily and told her it was a special one. She said it was a magic lollipop that could make her happy and clean. She said Lily had to bathe first and then she could have the lollipop. Lily was curious and wanted the lollipop, but she was also troubled. She did not trust the water and the soap and the shampoo.
Her mom filled the tub with warm water and bubbles. She put some toys and a rubber duck in the water. She said it was a fun bath and Lily could play with the toys and the duck. She said she would be gentle and quick with the soap and the shampoo. She said she would not let the water go in Lily's eyes or nose. She said Lily could hold the lollipop in her hand while she bathed.
Lily was still troubled, but she also wanted the lollipop. She decided to try the bath. She took the lollipop and got in the tub. She played with the toys and the duck. She licked the lollipop and made it smaller and smaller. She let her mom wash her hair and body. She did not cry or kick. She found out the bath was not so bad. She felt happy and clean.
When she got out of the tub, she dried herself with a fluffy towel. She put on her pajamas and brushed her teeth. She finished the lollipop and threw away the stick. She hugged her mom and said thank you. She said she liked the magic lollipop and the fun bath. She said she would bathe again tomorrow. Her mom smiled and kissed her. She said she was proud of Lily and she loved her. She said good night and tucked her in bed. Lily fell asleep with a sweet dream.
