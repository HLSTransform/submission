Once upon a time there was a dependable gun. It was the best gun around and it was known to never stop working. Everyone admired this gun, but nobody ever got too close. This was because the gun had a secret.
One day, a man called Joe was very curious. He wanted to see the gun's secret, so he crept up close and listened carefully. Suddenly, he heard it. The gun was whispering. Joe could not believe it and he shuffled a bit closer to hear what it said. 
"I'm dependable, but I must always be used carefully" the gun whispered. Joe was very amazed, but he knew that it was time to leave. He waved goodbye to the gun and went on his way, but he always remembered the secret that the gun whispered that day.
