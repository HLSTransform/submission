Once upon a time, there was a big barrel. It was very noisy because it was full of toys. One day, a little boy wanted to play with the toys. He asked his mommy if he could open the barrel. She said yes and the boy started to open it. When he opened the barrel, all the toys fell out and made a big noise. The boy was very happy and started to play with all the toys.
