Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun making a big castle with blocks, cars, dolls and animals. They used glue to stick some parts together, so the castle would not fall down.
"Look, this is the king and the queen, and this is their baby princess," Lily said, showing Tom her dolls. "They live in the castle and they are very happy."
"That's nice, Lily," Tom said, nodding. "And this is the dragon, he is very big and strong. He protects the castle from bad guys. He can breathe fire and fly in the sky."
"Wow, Tom, your dragon is cool," Lily said, admiring his toy. "Can he be friends with the king and the queen?"
"Sure, he can," Tom said, smiling. "He is a good dragon, not a mean one. He likes the castle and the people in it."
They played for a while, making up stories and sounds for their toys. They were having a lot of fun, until they heard a loud noise from the kitchen.
"What was that?" Lily asked, scared.
"I don't know, let's go see," Tom said, curious.
They left their toys on the floor and ran to the kitchen. There they saw their big brother Sam, who had knocked over a jar of cookies and made a mess.
"Sam, what are you doing?" Lily asked, angry.
"I was hungry, and I wanted a cookie," Sam said, shrugging. "But the jar was too high, and I dropped it."
"You are so clumsy, Sam," Tom said, shaking his head. "You broke the jar and the cookies. Mom will be mad at you."
Sam looked at the broken jar and the crumbs on the floor. He felt bad and sorry. He didn't mean to make a mess. He wished he could fix it.
"Maybe we can help you, Sam," Lily said, kindly. "We have glue, we can glue the jar back together."
"Really? You would do that for me?" Sam asked, surprised.
"Sure, we would," Tom said, nodding. "You are our brother, and we love you. And glue is important, it can fix things."
They ran back to the living room and got the glue. They carefully glued the pieces of the jar together, and put the cookies back inside. They were very proud of their work.
"Thank you, Lily and Tom," Sam said, hugging them. "You are the best. You saved me from trouble."
"You're welcome, Sam," Lily and Tom said, smiling. "But next time, ask mom for a cookie, okay?"
"Okay, I will," Sam said, nodding. "And next time, can I play with you and your castle?"
"Okay, you can," Lily and Tom said, nodding. "But you have to be careful, and not break anything."
"Okay, I will," Sam said, nodding. "And I will protect the castle with you and your dragon."
They all laughed and hugged. They were happy and glad. They were a family, and they stuck together. Just like glue.
