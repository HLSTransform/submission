Tim and Sam are brothers. They like to play with their toys in their room. Tim likes to keep his toys organized. He puts them in boxes and labels them. Sam likes to make a mess. He throws his toys everywhere and does not care.
One day, Tim is very happy. He has a new vest. It is blue and has snaps. He can snap and unsnap it. He thinks it is fun. He puts on his vest and shows it to Sam.
"Look, Sam, I have a new vest. It has snaps. Do you want to try it?" Tim asks.
Sam looks at the vest. He does not like it. He thinks it is boring. He wants to play with his cars. He grabs one of Tim's cars and zooms it on the floor.
"No, I don't want to try it. I want to play with this car. It is fast and loud. Vroom, vroom!" Sam says.
Tim feels sad. He wants to share his vest with Sam. He thinks Sam is being mean. He tries to get his car back from Sam.
"Sam, that is my car. Give it back. You have your own cars. You can play with them," Tim says.
Sam does not listen. He keeps the car and runs away. He bumps into Tim's boxes and knocks them over. Tim's toys spill out and get mixed up. Tim is very angry. He snaps.
"Sam, you are very bad. You ruined my toys. You are not my brother. Go away!" Tim shouts.
Sam feels sorry. He sees that he made Tim mad. He does not want to fight with Tim. He wants to make up. He brings the car back to Tim and gives it to him.
"Tim, I am sorry. I was wrong. I should not have taken your car. I should not have made a mess. You are my brother. I love you," Sam says.
Tim looks at Sam. He sees that Sam is sorry. He does not want to stay mad at Sam. He loves him too. He hugs Sam and smiles.
"Sam, I am sorry too. I should not have yelled at you. I should have been nicer. You are my brother. I love you too," Tim says.
They hug and make up. They decide to play together. Tim lets Sam try his vest. Sam thinks it is fun. He snaps and unsnaps it. Tim plays with his cars. He zooms them on the floor. They share and laugh. They are happy.
