Once upon a time, there was a pilot called Roy. Roy was very brave and loved to fly. One day, he was on a mission to explore the wide world. His mission was to fly to the edge of the world and back.
Everything was going great until a storm came. It was so powerful that it forced Roy to crash land in the middle of the ocean. Roy was worried as he was surrounded by waves and had no land in sight.
But then he saw a big, wide boat in the far distance. Roy started paddling towards the boat, and soon found himself on its deck. The captain welcomed him and said he could stay as long as he wanted.
Roy enjoyed his time on the boat, learning about the ocean, the stars and its creatures. But after a more days, he realized that he still had to go back to complete his mission. So, with a heavy heart, Roy said goodbye to the captain and continued his journey with renewed determination.
At the end of his journey, Roy discovered that he had enjoyed his time with the captain and the boat more than he had enjoyed going around the world. He realized the important lesson of enjoying the journey more than the destination!
