Lily and Ben were very happy. They were going to drive with Mom and Dad to Grandma's house. Grandma always made yummy dessert for them. They liked cake and ice cream and cookies.
They got in the car and put on their seat belts. Mom drove and Dad sang songs with them. Lily and Ben laughed and clapped. They saw cows and horses and trees on the road. They were almost there.
But then, something bad happened. The car made a loud noise and stopped. Mom looked at Dad and said, "Oh no, we have a flat tire." Dad got out and looked at the tire. It was very flat and messy. He said, "We need to change it."
Lily and Ben were sad and scared. They did not like the loud noise and the flat tire. They wanted to go to Grandma's house and have dessert. They asked Mom, "Can we still go to Grandma's house? Can we still have dessert?"
Mom smiled and hugged them. She said, "Don't worry, we can still go to Grandma's house. We just need to wait a little bit. Dad will fix the tire. And Grandma will save some dessert for us. She loves us very much."
Lily and Ben felt better. They waited in the car and played with their toys. They saw a big truck come and help Dad. They waved at the truck driver. He was very nice and gave them stickers. Soon, the tire was fixed and the car was ready.
They got back in the car and drove to Grandma's house. Grandma was waiting for them. She was very happy to see them. She gave them big hugs and kisses. She said, "I'm so glad you're here. I have a surprise for you. I made your favorite dessert. Chocolate cake with rainbow sprinkles!"
Lily and Ben cheered and said, "Thank you, Grandma! We love you and we love chocolate cake!" They ate the cake and enjoyed it very much. It was very yummy and sweet. They did not mind that it was a little messy. They had a lot of fun with Grandma. They were very happy.
