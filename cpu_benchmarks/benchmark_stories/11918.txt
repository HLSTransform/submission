Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom in the garden. One day, while they were pulling out some radishes, Lily saw a worm. She picked it up and showed it to her mom. "Look, Mommy! Worm!" she said.
Her mom smiled and said, "Oh, that's a nice worm. Let's put it back in the soil so it can help us grow more radishes."
Lily carefully put the worm back in the soil and then started shaking the dirt off the radishes. "I'm helping, Mommy!" she said.
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, you are! You're very organized with your radishes. Good job, Lily!"
