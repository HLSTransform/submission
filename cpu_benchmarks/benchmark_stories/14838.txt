Tom and Lily were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to kick the ball to each other and run after it. They were having fun and felt peace in their hearts.
But then a big dog came out of nowhere and ran towards them. It barked loudly and showed its teeth. It wanted to take their ball. Tom and Lily were scared and panic. They did not know what to do.
"Help! Help!" they cried. "Go away, dog! Leave us alone!"
The dog did not listen. It jumped and grabbed the ball in its mouth. It ran away with it. Tom and Lily were sad and angry. They lost their ball. They wanted to get it back.
They ran after the dog, but it was too fast. They could not catch it. They saw it go into a house with a fence. They stopped at the fence and looked inside. They saw a man sitting on a chair. He was the dog's owner.
"Hey, mister!" Tom shouted. "Your dog took our ball! Give it back to us!"
The man looked up and saw Tom and Lily. He saw the ball in the dog's mouth. He was surprised and sorry. He did not know his dog was so naughty.
"I'm sorry, kids," he said. "I did not see him run out. He likes to play with balls, but he should not take yours. Come in, I'll give it back to you."
He opened the gate and let Tom and Lily in. He called the dog and took the ball from him. He gave it to Tom and Lily. He also gave them some cookies and juice. He was kind and friendly.
Tom and Lily thanked him and forgave him. They were happy to have their ball back. They also liked the cookies and juice. They made friends with the man and the dog. They felt peace in their hearts again. They learned that sometimes bad things happen, but they can be solved with kindness and forgiveness. They also learned to be careful with big dogs. They went back to the park and continued to play with their ball. They had fun and felt peace in their hearts. The end.
