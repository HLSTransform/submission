Lily was a little girl who liked to play with dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Anna, who had long yellow hair and a pretty blue dress. Lily took Anna everywhere, and talked to her like a friend.
One day, Lily's mom said they had to go to the store. Lily wanted to bring Anna, but mom said no. She said Anna might get lost or dirty at the store, and Lily had to leave her at home. Lily was very sad, but she did what mom said. She put Anna on her bed, and gave her a kiss.
At the store, Lily saw many things. She saw fruits and vegetables, and bread and cheese, and candy and cookies. She saw toys and books, and clothes and shoes. She saw a big knob on a door, and wanted to turn it. She asked mom what was behind the door, and mom said it was a storage room. She said Lily could not go there, because it was not for customers.
But Lily was curious. She waited until mom was busy looking at something else, and then she ran to the door. She reached for the knob, and turned it. The door opened, and Lily went inside. She saw many boxes and bags, and shelves and hooks. She saw a lot of things that looked interesting, and wanted to touch them.
But then, the door closed behind her. Lily heard a click, and tried to open the door. But it was locked. She could not get out. She banged on the door, and shouted for mom. But mom did not hear her. Lily was scared, and alone. She started to weep.
Mom looked for Lily, and could not find her. She asked the people at the store, and they did not know where she was. She was worried, and angry. She called Lily's name, and hoped she would answer.
Lily heard mom's voice, and stopped weeping. She shouted back, and told mom where she was. Mom heard her, and ran to the door. She tried to open it, but it was locked. She asked for help, and a man who worked at the store came. He had a key, and opened the door.
Mom saw Lily, and hugged her. She was happy, and relieved. She also scolded her, and told her not to run away again. Lily said she was sorry, and promised to be good. She also said she missed Anna, and wanted to go home.
Mom took Lily's hand, and they left the store. They got in the car, and drove home. Lily saw Anna on her bed, and ran to her. She hugged her, and told her what happened. She said she was glad to see her, and that she was her best friend. Anna smiled, and said she was glad too. She said Lily was very brave, and attractive. Lily smiled, and thanked her. They played together, and were happy.
