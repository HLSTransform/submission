Once upon a time, there were two friends named Ben and Jack. Ben was a big, strong bear and Jack was a tiny, quiet mouse. 
Ben and Jack were playing in the forest one day when they came across a closet. Ben wanted to explore what was inside, but Jack was scared.
Then, a huge, deaf monster showed up. It wanted to fight the friends! Ben and Jack held hands and were so brave. Together, they shouted, "You can't catch us!" 
The monster didn't understand because it was deaf, so it stomped away. Ben and Jack were so happy that they cheered. Ben opened the closet and they discovered lots of treasure! They couldn't believe their luck.
 Ben and Jack were best friends forever after that day. They loved playing together and they never had to fight again.
