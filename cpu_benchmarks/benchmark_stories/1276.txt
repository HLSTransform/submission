Suddenly, he saw something. It was a magical box! He opened it, and a puff of smoke came out. He stood there, breathing it in - and then he started to disappear! What a surprise!
John had gone on an exciting adventure. He found a magical box and it made him disappear! He still wasn't sure where he would end up, but one thing was certain - he would always remember his incredible journey to the hotel.
