Anna and Ben were playing with their toys in the garden. Anna had a big doll that looked like a queen. She wore a shiny crown and a long dress. Ben had a small car that made noises when he pushed it. He liked to drive it on the grass and the dirt.
"Can I play with your queen?" Ben asked Anna. "She is so pretty and I want to see her crown."
"No, she is mine!" Anna said. "You have your car and I have my queen. Go away!"
Ben felt sad and angry. He wanted to share with Anna, but she was not nice. He thought of a plan. He waited until Anna was not looking and grabbed her queen. He ran away with it and hid behind a tree.
"Hey, give me back my queen!" Anna shouted. She saw Ben and ran after him. She tried to catch him, but he was too fast.
They ran around the garden, shouting and fighting. They did not see their mom, who was watching them from the window. She was not happy with what they were doing. She decided to teach them a lesson.
She went outside and called them. "Anna, Ben, come here right now!" she said in a calm voice.
Anna and Ben stopped running and looked at their mom. They knew they were in trouble. They walked slowly to her, holding their toys.
"What are you doing?" mom asked. "Why are you not sharing your toys? Sharing is good. Sharing makes friends. Sharing makes you happy. Do you want to be happy?"
Anna and Ben nodded. They felt sorry for what they did. They did not want to make their mom sad.
"Then give each other a hug and say sorry," mom said. "And then you can share your toys. You can take turns playing with the queen and the car. How does that sound?"
Anna and Ben hugged each other and said sorry. They smiled and agreed to share their toys. They thanked their mom and went back to the garden. They played nicely with the queen and the car. They had fun and they were happy. They learned to share.
