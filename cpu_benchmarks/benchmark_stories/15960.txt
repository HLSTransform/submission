Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very glad because today was a special day. Her mommy told her they were going to a festival. Lily loved festivals because she could eat yummy food and play games.
As they walked to the festival, they saw a group of kids skipping rope. Lily wanted to join them, so she asked, "Can I skip too?" The kids said yes, and Lily skipped with them. She was so happy!
When they arrived at the festival, Lily and her mommy played games and ate cotton candy. Lily saw a clown and said, "Hi Mr. Clown!" The clown said, "Hello little girl, would you like a balloon?" Lily said yes, and the clown made her a balloon animal.
At the end of the day, Lily was tired but very happy. She told her mommy, "Today was the best day ever!" And her mommy said, "I'm glad you had fun, my sweet Lily."
