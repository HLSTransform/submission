Once upon a time, there was a big, hairy dog named Spot. Spot loved to run and play. One day, he saw a ship near the water. The ship was big and had many colors.
Spot wanted to see the ship up close. So, he ran to the ship and jumped on it. The ship started to move. Spot was happy and wagged his tail. He saw fish, birds, and other animals as the ship sailed.
After a while, the ship stopped. Spot decided it was time to go home. He jumped off the ship and swam back to the land. When he got home, he was tired. Spot ate his food, drank some water, and settled down for a nap. He dreamed of the big, colorful ship and all the fun he had that day.
