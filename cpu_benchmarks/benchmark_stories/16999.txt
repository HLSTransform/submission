Lily and Max are friends. They like to play with toys and sing songs. One day, they go to the park with their moms. They see a big display of colorful flowers. They run to the flowers and smell them.
"Wow, they are so pretty!" Lily says.
"Yes, and they smell good too!" Max says.
They hear a bird singing on a tree. The bird has a red chest and a black cap. It sings a gentle song that sounds like a whistle.
"Look, a bird!" Max points.
"Hello, bird!" Lily waves.
The bird stops singing and looks at them. It tilts its head and blinks.
"Can you sing a song for us, bird?" Lily asks.
The bird nods and sings again. It sings a different song that sounds like a trill.
"Wow, you are so smart, bird!" Max claps.
"Thank you, bird!" Lily smiles.
The bird bows and flies away. Lily and Max wave goodbye. They are happy. They hug their moms and go home. They sing the bird's songs on the way.
