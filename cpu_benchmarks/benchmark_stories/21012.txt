Once upon a time, there was a little bunny called Jake. Jake was very clumsy and loved to explore.
One day, Jake saw a big rock and wanted to explore it. He jumped up and tried to climb the rock, but he was too small and too clumsy. He slipped and fell on the ground.
Then, something amazing happened. Another bunny, bigger and stronger than Jake, appeared out of nowhere. This bunny supported Jake and helped him to climb the rock.
At the top of the rock, Jake looked at the wonderful view. He enjoyed the scenery and thanked his friend for the help and support.
From that day on, they became the best of friends. They often explored new rocks together and supported each other on their adventures.
