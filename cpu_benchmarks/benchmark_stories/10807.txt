Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily woke up early and saw the sun rise in the sky. She said, "Mommy, the sun is up! Can we go to the park today?"
Mommy said, "Yes, Lily. We can go to the park. But first, we have to get ready for an event."
Lily asked, "What's an event, mommy?"
Mommy explained, "An event is like a party. We are going to see our friends and have fun together. But don't worry, it's going to be easy and fun."
Lily smiled and said, "I can't wait for the event! But first, let's go to the park and play on the swings."
