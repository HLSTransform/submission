Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved Tuesdays because that was the day he got to pick out his favorite toy to bring to school. He had a lot of toys, but he always picked his red car. 
One Tuesday, the weather was mild and sunny. Timmy and his friends played with his red car during recess. But when it was time to go back to class, Timmy couldn't find his toy. He looked all over the playground, but it was nowhere to be found. 
Timmy was sad, but his teacher told him they would look for the car after school. When they went back outside, Timmy's friend spotted the red car in the grass. Timmy was so happy to have his favorite toy back. From then on, he made sure to always keep a close eye on it. The end.
