Once there was a princess who loved wearing her fancy suit. Every morning, she'd kiss her pet frog and spin around and around until she felt dizzy. Then, she'd look in the mirror and admire how pretty she looked in her suit. 
One day she decided to explore her kingdom. She wore her suit, kissed her pet frog goodbye, and skipped out of the castle. As she walked around, she saw lots of animals, flowers, and even some dragons!
She spun around in a circle until the world started to look dizzy. Then, she spotted a pond in the distance. She grabbed a rock and tossed it into the water. As she watched the ripples expand outwards, a fish jumped out of the water and kissed her hand!
The princess was so surprised that she forgot to be dizzy. She laughed and said goodbye to the fish, then skipped back to the castle in her suit, happy and content.
