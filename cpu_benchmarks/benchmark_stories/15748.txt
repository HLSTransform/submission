Tommy was walking down the street on a sunny day in town. He saw many people waving at him and smiling. Everyone in town was so friendly.
He waved back and said, "Hi!" then continued walking. Soon he saw an ice cream shop. It looked so exciting!
He went inside and asked for a cone. The shopkeeper smiled and said, "What flavour would you like?"
Tommy waved his hands and said, "Chocolate, please."
The shopkeeper smiled and gave Tommy a delicious chocolate ice cream cone. Tommy waved goodbye and thanked the shopkeeper before heading off on his way.
As Tommy walked back down the street, he could still feel the warmth of the friendly town. He waved to all the people he passed and they waved back.
 
He smiled to himself, knowing how lucky he was to live in such a wonderful town.
