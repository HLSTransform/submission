Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden with her mommy. They planted some seeds in the ground and waited for them to grow. One day, Lily saw a tiny plant sprout out of the soil. She was so happy to see it grow bigger and bigger every day.
As the plant grew, it started to produce some yummy fruits. They looked so delicious that Lily couldn't resist trying one. She took a bite and it tasted so sweet and juicy. She loved it so much that she ate the whole fruit in one go.
But something strange happened after she ate the fruit. Lily started to shrink! She became smaller and smaller until she was the size of a tiny bug. Her mommy couldn't find her anywhere until she looked closely at the plant. There was little Lily, sitting on a leaf, looking up at her mommy with a big smile on her face. From that day on, Lily always made sure to only take a small bite of the delicious fruit.
