Jimbo was excited, he was going to the library show today. He had his library card and his friend Lisa was helping him prepare.
They arrived at the library and the bell rang. Lisa and Jimbo put their things away and they went to their show. 
The show was full of exciting books, stories and activities. Lisa was very helpful as she taught Jimbo about all the different books available. 
Jimbo really enjoyed the show and went home with lots of reading materials for himself. He thanked Lisa for her help, and off they went, both looking forward to future visits to the library.
