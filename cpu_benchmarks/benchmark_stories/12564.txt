Lily was hungry. She wanted toast for breakfast. She saw the toast on the table. It was hot and brown and smelled good. She tried to reach the toast, but it was too far. She stood on her chair and stretched her arm, but she still could not reach the toast.
"Mommy, help me!" she cried. "I want toast!"
Mommy came into the kitchen. She saw Lily on the chair. She was angry.
"Lily, get down from there!" she said. "You could fall and hurt yourself. And you could burn yourself with the toast. That's not safe."
Lily did not want to get down. She wanted toast. She pouted and whined.
"But I'm hungry, Mommy. And I like toast. Please, Mommy, please."
Mommy sighed. She took Lily down from the chair and hugged her.
"I know you're hungry, sweetie. And I know you like toast. But you have to wait until I cut it for you. And you have to sit on your seat, not on the chair. OK?"
Lily nodded. She was sorry for making Mommy angry. She waited for Mommy to cut the toast. Mommy gave her a plate with two pieces of toast and some butter and jam. She also gave her a glass of milk.
"Here you go, Lily. Enjoy your toast. But be careful, it's still hot."
Lily smiled. She thanked Mommy and took a bite of her toast. It was crunchy and sweet and yummy. She drank some milk. It was cold and wet and smooth. She was happy. She liked toast. And she loved Mommy.
