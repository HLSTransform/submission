Once upon a time, there was a little orange shrimp. The shrimp lived in the sea with his family. They were all very happy.
One day, the little shrimp saw a big fish. The big fish looked hungry. The shrimp was scared. He swam to his mom and said, "Mom, I saw a big fish. Can you help me?"
His mom listened to his request. She said, "Don't worry, little shrimp. I will talk to the big fish." So, the mom swam to the big fish.
The mom said to the big fish, "Please don't eat my child. We are a happy family." The big fish listened and said, "Okay, I will not eat your child. I will find other food."
The little shrimp was very happy. He thanked his mom and gave her a big hug. They swam together, safe and sound.
