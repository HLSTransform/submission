Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the bright sunshine. One day, she fell down and hurt her knee. Her mommy took her to see a nice nurse at the hospital. The nurse put a bandage on her knee and warned her to be careful next time she played outside. Lily thanked the nurse and promised to be more careful. From that day on, Lily always looked out for any dangers when she played outside.
