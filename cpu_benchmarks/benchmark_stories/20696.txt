Once upon a time there was an orange tray. It was very exciting, because it was a magical tray. Whenever they said the word "freeze!" the tray would freeze as still as a rock.
One day, a little three year old child came to the tray. The child was so excited to see the magical tray. "Freeze!" the child shouted. Instantly, the tray stopped moving and became still. Then, the child climbed onto the tray and it became a fun orange slide.
The child had so much fun on the tray, sliding down it over and over again. The tray was smooth and icy, like a frozen river in the snow! Eventually, after many slides, the child said "unfreeze!" and the tray came back to life again.
From then on, the child and the magical orange tray were best friends. Whenever the child wanted to take a slide, all they had to do was shout "freeze!" and the orange tray would become still and ready for a good old slide.
