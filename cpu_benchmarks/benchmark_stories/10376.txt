Lily liked to play with her toy bear. She called him Bobo and gave him hugs and kisses. She took him everywhere with her, even to the park. One day, she saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She left Bobo on a bench and ran to the slide.
"Can I go on the slide, Mommy?" she asked.
"Sure, honey, but be careful," Mommy said.
Lily climbed up the ladder and slid down with a big smile. She liked the slide so much, she wanted to do it again. She ran back to the ladder, but then she saw something that made her stop. A boy was holding Bobo and walking away.
"Hey, that's my bear!" Lily shouted. She ran after the boy and tried to get Bobo back.
"No, it's mine now," the boy said. He was bigger and stronger than Lily and he pushed her away.
Lily felt sad and angry. She wanted her bear back. She ran to Mommy and told her what happened.
"Mommy, he took my bear! He said it's his now!" she cried.
Mommy hugged Lily and said, "Don't worry, sweetie, we'll get your bear back. Come on, let's go talk to him."
Mommy and Lily followed the boy to a swing. He was swinging Bobo and laughing.
"Excuse me, young man, can I have a word with you?" Mommy said.
The boy looked at Mommy and Lily and said, "What do you want?"
Mommy said, "That bear you have belongs to my daughter. She loves him very much and she's very upset. Can you please return him to her?"
The boy said, "No, I like this bear. He's different from my other toys. He has a red scarf and a blue hat. He's mine now."
Mommy said, "I understand that you like the bear, but he's not yours. He's Lily's. She got him as a gift from her grandma. He's very special to her. How would you feel if someone took your favorite toy?"
The boy thought for a moment. He remembered his toy truck that he always played with. He liked his truck very much and he would be sad if someone took it.
He looked at Lily and saw that she had tears in her eyes. He felt sorry for her. He said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know. Here, you can have your bear back."
He gave Bobo to Lily and said, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you cry."
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, that's very nice of you."
She hugged Bobo and said, "I missed you, Bobo. I'm glad you're back."
Mommy said, "Thank you, young man, for being kind and honest. You did the right thing."
The boy said, "You're welcome. I'm sorry for being mean."
Mommy said, "It's okay, we all make mistakes. Maybe you can play with Lily and Bobo sometime. They're very friendly."
The boy said, "Okay, maybe I can. What's your name?"
Lily said, "I'm Lily. What's yours?"
The boy said, "I'm Jake. Nice to meet you."
Lily said, "Nice to meet you too, Jake. Do you want to go on the slide with me?"
Jake said, "Sure, that sounds fun."
Lily and Jake ran to the slide and became friends. Mommy watched them and smiled. She was happy that Lily got her bear back and that she made a new friend. She was proud of both of them for being brave and kind. She thought, maybe different is not so bad after all.
