Once upon a time, there was a young duck who lived in a pond. Every day, she would refuse to leave the pond and go explore with the other ducks. She was too scared. She had a bright orange feather that she refused to give up too.
One day, she met another baby duck who was just her age. She was so excited to see the young duck and asked if it wanted to go explore with her. The young duck said yes!
Finally, the young duck was no longer scared to leave the pond. Together, they left the pond and explored the entire lake. Every time they passed by one of the other ducks, the young duck would proudly show off her orange feather.
The other ducks became jealous and started to tease the young duck, but she was no longer afraid. With her new orange feather and young friend, she refused to be scared anymore. She finally had the courage to explore the world around her.
