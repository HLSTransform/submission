Tim and Lily liked to play with their toys in the bathtub. They had a big blue whale that could squirt water from its mouth. They pretended the whale was their friend and they went on adventures with it.
One day, they saw a bottle of soap on the shelf. It had a picture of a fairy on it and said "magic bubbles". Tim and Lily wanted to try it. They poured some soap into the water and made lots of bubbles. They laughed and popped the bubbles with their fingers.
But then they noticed something strange. The whale was getting smaller and smaller. It was shrinking because of the magic bubbles. Tim and Lily were scared. They did not want to lose their whale friend.
"Whale, whale, are you okay?" Tim asked.
"Help me, help me, I'm too small!" the whale said in a tiny voice.
Tim and Lily quickly grabbed the whale and rinsed it with clean water. They hoped it would grow back to its normal size. They put it on a towel and waited.
After a few minutes, the whale started to get bigger and bigger. It was growing back because of the clean water. Tim and Lily were happy. They hugged the whale and said sorry.
"Whale, whale, are you okay now?" Lily asked.
"Yes, yes, I'm okay now. Thank you, thank you, you are good friends." the whale said in a big voice.
Tim and Lily were glad. They learned not to use the magic bubbles on their toys. They played with the whale in the bathtub again, but this time they used only water. They had fun and the whale was happy too.
