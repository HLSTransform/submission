Once upon a time, there was a little mouse who lived in a big forest. One day, he met a friendly rabbit who said, "Hello, little mouse! Do you want to become my friend?"
The little mouse was happy and said, "Yes, please! I want a friend." The rabbit and the mouse played together every day and had lots of fun.
But one day, the little mouse got lost in the forest and fell into a trap. He was scared and cried for help. The rabbit heard his friend's cries and came to rescue him.
"Don't worry, little mouse. I'll get you out of this scary trap," said the rabbit. And he did! The little mouse was so happy to have such a brave and kind friend. They continued to play together in the forest, always watching out for each other.
