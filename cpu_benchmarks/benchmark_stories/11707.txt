One day, there was an emergency. Mary and her mommy went outside and saw a bad car. Mary asked her mommy, "What is that?" Her mommy said, "That is an emergency car, sweetheart." Mary paused and watched the car go by.
Suddenly, the car stopped and two men came out. They had big bags and ran to the door quickly. Mary was scared, so her mommy said, "Don't worry, it's ok."
They stayed for a few minutes and then the car started again. Mary asked her mommy, "What were they doing?" Her mommy said, "They were helping someone who was not feeling well. It was very important."
Mary felt better and said, "Ok, let's go now." So they walked away from the bad car and went back home.
