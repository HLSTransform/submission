Once upon a time, there was a very rich man. He had a lot of money and many big houses. He promised to give all his money to his son when he grew up. The son was happy and played with his toys. 
One day, the son grew up and the father gave him all the money. The son was now wealthy too! He decided to lead a good life and help others. He built a big school for the children who didn't have one. The children were happy and thanked him. The son was happy too, because he kept his promise to help others.
