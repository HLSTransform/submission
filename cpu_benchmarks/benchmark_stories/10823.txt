Once upon a time, there was a fine lady who lived in a big house with a garden. She loved to take care of her flowers and plants every day. One day, she felt an urge to go on a trip to the beach. She packed her bags and left her house for a few days.
While she was away, a little bird flew into her garden and started playing with the flowers. The bird loved to sing and dance around the garden. When the lady came back from her trip, she saw the bird and smiled. She realized that sometimes it's good to take a break from your routine and let new things happen.
From that day on, the lady and the bird became friends. The bird would visit her garden every day and sing beautiful songs. The lady was happy to have a new friend and loved to watch the bird play in her garden. She knew that sometimes, the best things in life happen unexpectedly.
