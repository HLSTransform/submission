Once upon a time there was a boy who could fly. He had incredible wings and he flapped them so he could fly high in the sky. He flew over houses and trees and saw lots of exciting things.
One day he flew over a big lake and he saw a swan with a long neck. The swan was swimming faster and faster and the boy was fascinated. He followed the swan everywhere and watched it swim in circles. He tried to fly even faster so he could keep up with it.
He flew higher and higher until he saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky. He had never seen a rainbow before and it was incredible! He flew all around it but it stayed in the same place. Then he flew lower and lower to the ground and smiled. It was the best day ever and he couldn't wait to fly again!
