Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Rose. Rose was very special and loved to search for amazing things.
One day, Rose went to the park with her mom to search. She searched and searched, but couldn't find anything interesting. Then, she saw something shiny in a bush â€“ it was a smooth rose!
The rose was so smooth! Rose wondered how it got there. She carefully took it out of the bush, and it was even prettier in the light! She giggled with joy and showed it to her mom.
Rose decided to make the rose part of her special collection of special things. It was the best thing she found that day!
