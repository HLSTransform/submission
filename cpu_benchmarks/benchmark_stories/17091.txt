Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to look at the fluffy white clouds in the sky. One day, she went outside to play and saw a big, dark cloud. It made her frightened because she thought it might rain. 
Lily decided to go back inside her house to wait for the cloud to go away. But as she looked out the window, she missed playing outside with her friends. She wished the cloud would disappear so she could go back outside and have fun. 
After a little while, the cloud moved away and the sun came out. Lily was no longer frightened and she went outside to play with her friends. She was happy to be outside again and didn't miss the cloud at all. The end.
