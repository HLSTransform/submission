Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big melon growing on a vine. They wanted to eat it, but their mom said they had to wait until it was ripe.
"Let's take it anyway," Ben said. He was naughty and did not listen to mom. "We can hide it in our room and eat it later."
"No, Ben, that's wrong," Lily said. She was good and listened to mom. "We have to share it with everyone and be patient."
But Ben did not care. He picked the melon and ran to the house. Lily followed him, trying to stop him. They went to their room and closed the door.
"Ha ha, now we have the melon," Ben said. He put it on the bed and got a knife. He was about to cut it when he heard a loud pop. The melon disappeared! It was not a real melon, but a balloon that looked like a melon. Mom had put it there as a joke.
"Uh oh," Ben said. He felt silly and scared. He had been tricked and he had done something bad.
Lily laughed. She was not angry, but she was glad that Ben learned a lesson. She said, "See, Ben, you should not take things that are not yours. And you should not be greedy and selfish. You should be kind and honest. Then you will not have problems like this."
Ben nodded. He was sorry and ashamed. He said, "You are right, Lily. I was wrong and you were right. I will not do it again. I will listen to mom and share with everyone. And I will not fall for silly jokes like this."
They hugged and said they loved each other. Then they went to find mom and tell her what happened. Mom was happy that they told the truth and that they learned from their mistake. She gave them a real melon to eat and they enjoyed it together. They thanked mom and said they were sorry. Mom forgave them and said she was proud of them. They had a happy day.
The end.
