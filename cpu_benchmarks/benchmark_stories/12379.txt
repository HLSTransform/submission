One sunny morning, a fat monkey was walking down the street. He came to a mailbox and peered inside. Suddenly, the monkey spoke aloud. "Yum, it looks like something tasty in there," he said.
The monkey reached his long arms into the mailbox and grabbed something. Then he quickly ran away, chomping on something. Shortly after, the mailbox owner, Mr. Smith, came out. He saw that the monkey had taken his mail. 
Mr. Smith was very angry. He yelled at the monkey, "Give me back my mail!" The monkey refused and ran away. He ran faster and faster, holding onto the mail.  
But while running, the monkey suddenly stumbled and fell. He dropped the mail and screamed. The monkey had been bitten by a bee! He hopped off in pain, leaving behind the mail.
Mr. Smith was happy to have his mail back and thanked the bee. But the bee had done a bad thing. The monkey hadn't learned his lesson and he was sure going to be careful with mailboxes in future.
