Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. He had a favorite toy car that he loved to play with, but the switch on the car was broken. Timmy asked his mommy if he could fix the switch, but she said it was too harsh for him to do by himself.
One day, Timmy's mommy permitted him to go to the toy store to buy a new toy car. Timmy was so excited! He went to the toy store and found the perfect toy car with a working switch. He played with it all day and was so happy. Timmy learned that sometimes it's okay to ask for help, and that it's important to listen to grown-ups when they say something is too harsh for you to do on your own.
