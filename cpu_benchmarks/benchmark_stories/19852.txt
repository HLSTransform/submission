Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Teddy. Teddy loved to eat honey, it was his favourite tasty thing in the whole wide world. One day, he found a big loop of honey and started eating it all up. But he didn't notice that the loop was a trap set by a mean old fox.
Suddenly, the fox appeared and tried to catch Teddy. But Teddy was too fast for him and ran away. The fox warned Teddy that he would catch him next time. Teddy was scared and didn't know what to do.
Then, he remembered his friend, a wise owl who lived in the nearby tree. Teddy went to the owl and told him everything. The owl told Teddy to be careful and avoid the loop next time. Teddy was grateful for the warning and promised to be more careful in the future. From that day on, Teddy always looked out for traps and never got caught again.
