Once upon a time, there was a Mommy. Mommy loved to wash things. Every night she washed in the purple light of the setting sun.
One night, she was washing the dishes. She heard a little voice say, "Mommy?" It was a 3-year-old child who was standing next to her.
Mommy smiled. She said, "What would you like, sweet one?"
The little one grinned. "Can I help wash dishes too?"
Mommy laughed. "Of course you can!"
So Mommy and the 3-year-old washed the dishes together. They had so much fun in the purple night. It was a special memory they would both always remember.
