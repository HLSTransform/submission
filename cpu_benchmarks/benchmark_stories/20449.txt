John and his dad were in the park. John noticed an old man with a fat gun. He asked his dad what it was. His dad told him it was a gun and it was very dangerous. He said you can't touch it. Then John said to the old man, "Can you lend me your gun?" The old man was surprised and said no. He said it was dangerous and not a toy. John was very sad he couldn't lend the gun. He went back to his dad and said he wanted to take the gun. His dad said no. He said it wasn't safe. He said maybe he could lend him something else. So John and his dad lent the old man some marbles and John was happy. They all smiled and said goodbye.
