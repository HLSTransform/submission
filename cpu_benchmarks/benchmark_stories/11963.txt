Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit named Bun. Bun was very gentle and loved to play outside. One day, Bun saw a ball and wanted to bounce it. But the ball was too big for Bun to bounce. 
Suddenly, Bun saw another rabbit hopping towards him. It was his friend, Floppy! Floppy was also very gentle and loved to play. Bun showed Floppy the big ball and asked if they could bounce it together. 
Floppy agreed and they both tried to bounce the big ball. They jumped and jumped, but the ball wouldn't bounce. Then, Floppy had an idea. He suggested they find a smaller ball that they could bounce easily. 
Bun and Floppy searched and found a small, bouncy ball. They started to bounce it gently and had so much fun. From that day on, Bun and Floppy played together every day and always found something fun to bounce.
