John walked to his neighbor's house with a happy smile on his face. He was carrying some cheap toys he had bought from the store. When he knocked on his neighbor's door, his friend Sarah answered.
"Hello, Sarah," said John.
"Hi, John! What do you have in your bag?" asked Sarah.
"I bought cheap toys," said John. He then opened his bag and showed Sarah the toys.
Sarah was excited to see the toys. "Can I carry a toy too?" she asked John.
John was happy to share and he said, "Sure. Here you go, Sarah." He handed her a toy.
John and Sarah both carried the toys and skipped happily all the way back to John's house.
