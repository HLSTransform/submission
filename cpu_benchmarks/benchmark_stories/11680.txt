Once upon a time, there was a deep, dark ocean. Every morning when the sun rose, a symbol would show up on the surface of the sea. It was a beautiful symbol, glowing bright in the sunshine.
Everybody in the village wanted to know what the symbol meant, so they all went to the beach to take a closer look. But when they got there, they couldn't understand it.
Then one day, a brave little 3 year old girl stepped up to the symbol. She looked at it for a long time and then suddenly she understood.
The symbol meant that all of the people in the village should rise up and work together to make their home better and brighter. And, most importantly, the symbol meant that all of the people should look out for each other.
The little girl smiled and shared her understanding with the others. Everyone was so happy and excited about the meaning and the message of the symbol.
From that day forward, the people of the village always rose up to work together, look out for each other, and make their home more beautiful. Everyone was very happy and the symbol had become a part of the village.
