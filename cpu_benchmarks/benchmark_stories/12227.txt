Once upon a time, there was a happy family. Dad was always so enthusiastic. He loved to fix things around the house. Mom was always excited to make yummy food.
One day, Dad was fixing the fence in the backyard when Mom came outside with a cake. She asked Dad with a smile,“What are you doing?”
 Dad replied with enthusiasm, “I'm fixing the fence so the kids can climb it. Now help me.”
“I will,” said Mom. “But first let’s go inside for some food. I bet the kids will be excited when they see the cake!”
So the family went inside, where Dad shared a piece of cake with his wife. They ate the cake together, laughing and enjoying the moment.
The family was so happy and enthusiastic about the food and about fixing things together.
