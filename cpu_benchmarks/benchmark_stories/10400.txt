Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Anna who loved going on adventures and discovering new things. 
One day, Anna decided to go to the forest to look for animals. But it was very dark and scary! Anna was scared, until she remembered what her parents had told her - if you are ever scared, look at a happy image in your head. That image will make you feel better.
Anna closed her eyes and looked for her happy image. In her head, she saw a heavy horse standing beneath a yellow tree and she remembered how much she loved riding on it. Suddenly, she wasn't scared any more.
Anna opened her eyes and smiled. She was brave now, and she was ready to explore the forest. She marched through the trees and bushes, looking closely at every creature she saw. When things got a bit too scary, Anna would remind herself of her heavy horse image and feel brave and strong. 
Eventually, Anna made it to the other side of the forest and she couldn't stop smiling. She had conquered her fear with her happy image.
