Lily and Ben were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big sign. The sign had a zigzag on it. Lily and Ben did not know what the sign meant.
"What is that?" Lily asked.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a snake," Ben said.
"Let's go and see," Lily said.
But Ben was scared. He did not like snakes. He did not want to go near the sign.
"No, Lily, don't go. It is dangerous," Ben said.
But Lily was curious. She wanted to see the sign. She did not think it was dangerous. She thought it was different.
"It is not a snake, Ben. It is just a sign. Come on, it is fun," Lily said.
She ran to the sign. She touched the zigzag. It was smooth and hard. She smiled.
"See, Ben, it is not scary. It is cool," Lily said.
But Ben did not smile. He was angry. He did not like that Lily did not listen to him. He did not like that Lily liked the sign. He thought the sign was bad.
"Lily, you are silly. You are not my friend. You like the sign. I don't like the sign. I don't like you," Ben said.
He turned away. He walked to the swings. He did not want to play with Lily.
Lily was sad. She did not understand why Ben was angry. She did not mean to make him angry. She just wanted to see the sign. She liked the sign. But she liked Ben more.
She ran to Ben. She hugged him.
"Ben, I am sorry. I am not silly. I am your friend. I like you. I like the sign. But you don't have to like the sign. You can like something else. We can like different things. That is okay," Lily said.
Ben looked at Lily. He saw that she was sorry. He saw that she was his friend. He felt bad. He hugged her back.
"Lily, I am sorry too. I was mean. You are not silly. You are my friend. I like you. I don't like the sign. But you can like the sign. You are right. We can like different things. That is okay," Ben said.
They smiled. They were friends again. They played in the park. They had fun. They did not care about the sign. They cared about each other.
