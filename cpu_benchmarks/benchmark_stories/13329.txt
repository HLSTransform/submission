Once upon a time, there was a stubborn boy named Tim. He loved to play with dough. One day, he made a big dough ball. But his little sister, Sue, wanted to play with it too.
"No, it's mine!" Tim said. "You can't have it!" Sue was sad and started to cry. Tim didn't care. He just wanted to play with his dough.
Then, their mom came into the room. She saw the problem and had an idea. "Let's rock the dough!" she said. Tim and Sue looked at her, confused. "We can make two dough balls and you both can play."
Tim and Sue liked the idea. They rocked the dough and made two balls. Now, they both had a dough ball to play with. The stubborn boy and his sister were happy, and they played together all day long.
