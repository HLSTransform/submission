Tommy was excited. He was going to play hockey for the first time. Tommy grabbed his hockey stick and skated onto the rink. He was impressed with how fast he could skate and how well he could handle his stick. He saw some other kids already playing and he wanted to join them. 
Tommy spotted the puck right away and he when he tried to get it he realized it was on the other side of the rink. He couldnâ€™t skate that fast yet so he had to think of another way. He put his hockey stick down and used his hands to shoot the puck across the ice. 
All of the kids turned to watch in amazement. He had thrown the puck in one smooth shot and it zoomed across the ice. For only playing hockey for the first time, it was pretty impressive. 
Tommy loved playing hockey and smiled proudly. He was happy that he had found his new favorite sport.
