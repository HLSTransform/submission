Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to her friend's house for a meal. Her friend's mom was very polite and asked Lily what she wanted to eat. Lily said she wanted spaghetti and meatballs. 
While they were eating, Lily heard a strange noise. She asked her friend, "Do you hear that?" Her friend listened carefully and said, "I don't hear anything." But Lily kept listening and realized it was the sound of a cat meowing outside. 
Lily told her friend's mom about the cat and they went outside to find it. They found the cat and gave it some food. The cat was very happy and started purring. Lily felt happy too because she helped the cat. After that, they went back inside and finished their meal. It was a fun day for Lily!
