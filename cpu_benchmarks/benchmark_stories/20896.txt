Once there was a little boy who lived with his family. His family was very rich, and they had lots of nice things. But the little boy wasn't allowed to touch any of them.
There was one item in the house that the little boy was allowed to play with. It was a big wooden frame with lots of pretty colors in it. The family used the frame to hang pictures on the wall.
The little boy loved the frame. He would draw pictures and put them in the frame. He was careful to prevent it from getting broken.
Every day the little boy's family would tell him how special the frame was and how lucky he was to have it. The little boy's family loved him very much, and they wanted to prevent him from getting hurt.
The little boy was happy with his frame and his very rich family. He was happy to have something special his family let him use and that made him feel loved.
