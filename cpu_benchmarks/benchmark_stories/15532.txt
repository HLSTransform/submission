Once upon a time there was a wide underground. It had lots of mysterious tunnels. All the animals had to choose one of the tunnels.
The rat chose the longest one. It was very dark but he wanted an adventure.
The rabbit chose the one with lots of grass. She wanted a comfy place to sleep. 
The mouse chose the one with the most seeds. He wanted something yummy to eat. 
But nobody chose the wiggly tunnel. It was too scary. 
They all decided to have a break. They ate and laughed at their adventures. 
At the end, they all agreed that the widest tunnel was the best one. Nobody was ever scared when they were there.
