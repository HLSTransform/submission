Once upon a time, there was a big, heavy alligator. He lived near a small pond. He was very hungry and wanted to eat something.
One day, a little bunny came close to the pond. The alligator saw the bunny and thought, "I can eat the bunny!" The bunny saw the alligator and was scared. The alligator wanted to catch the bunny, but the bunny was too fast.
The bunny ran away from the alligator as fast as he could. The alligator tried to catch the bunny, but he was too heavy and slow. The bunny got away and the alligator was still hungry. The alligator learned that he needed to be faster to catch the bunny.
