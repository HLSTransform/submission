Lila and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big hill. They want to climb it.
Lila has flexible boots. They can bend and stretch. Ben has hard boots. They are stiff and tight. Lila says, "My boots are good for climbing. They can grip the ground. Your boots are not good. They will slip and slide."
Ben says, "No, my boots are good too. They are strong and tough. They will protect my feet. I trust my boots. Do you trust your boots?"
Lila says, "Yes, I trust my boots. Let's go climb the hill."
They start to climb the hill. Lila's boots help her move fast and easy. Ben's boots make him slow and hard. He falls down and hurts his knee. He cries.
Lila hears him and runs back. She says, "Are you okay, Ben? I'm sorry your boots hurt you. Do you want to try my boots? They are flexible and soft. They will make you feel better."
Ben says, "Thank you, Lila. You are a good friend. I will try your boots. Maybe they will help me climb the hill."
They swap boots and climb the hill again. Ben's boots fit Lila well. They are strong and tough. Lila's boots fit Ben well. They are bendy and stretchy. They both reach the top of the hill. They are happy.
They say, "We did it! We climbed the hill. We both have good boots. We both trust our boots. And we trust each other."
