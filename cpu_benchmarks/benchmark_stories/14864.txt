Once upon a time, there was a flower. The flower was very sad because it was in a dark room and nobody took care of it. The flower was so miserable that it started to sigh. It wanted to be outside in the sunshine.
One day, a little girl came into the room and saw the flower. She felt sorry for the flower and decided to take it home. She put the flower in a pot with some soil and watered it every day. The flower was so happy to be in the sunshine and to have someone take care of it.
But one day, the little girl accidentally knocked over the pot and the bulb of the flower broke. The flower was so sad and the little girl couldn't fix it. The flower sighed and sighed until it wilted away. The little girl was very sad too, but she knew the flower was in a better place now.
