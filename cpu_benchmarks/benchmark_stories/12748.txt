Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. She was a very happy girl. One day, Sue went to a big house with her mom. Inside the house was a rough man. He was called Uncle Jack.
Uncle Jack looked very happy. He said, "Today I'm going to marry a nice lady!" Sue was very excited. She watched as Uncle Jack and the lady said some special words. Then they hugged each other.
After the wedding, Uncle Jack and the nice lady moved into the big house. Now Sue visits the house sometimes. She loves to see them living happy together in their new home. 
The End
