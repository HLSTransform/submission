Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play in the forest. They had a big stick that they pretended was a spear. They threw it at trees and rocks and made loud noises.
One day, they saw a rabbit hiding in the bushes. Tom wanted to catch it with the spear, but Sam said no. He said the rabbit was scared and they should leave it alone. Tom did not listen. He threw the spear at the rabbit and hit it. The rabbit cried out and ran away.
Tom was happy and ran after the rabbit. He wanted to show it to his mom and dad. Sam was sad and angry. He followed Tom and shouted at him. He said Tom was mean and hurt the rabbit. He said he did not want to play with him anymore.
Tom did not care. He found the rabbit lying on the ground. It was bleeding and still. Tom felt sorry and scared. He did not know what to do. He picked up the rabbit and the spear and ran back to Sam.
He tried to give the rabbit to Sam and said he was sorry. He said he did not mean to hurt the rabbit. He said he wanted to be friends again. Sam looked at Tom and the rabbit. He saw that Tom was crying and felt sorry for him. He said he forgave him and hugged him.
They buried the rabbit under a tree and said a prayer. They promised to never hurt animals again. They learned that their actions have consequences and that they should be kind and gentle. They went home and told their mom and dad what happened. They said they were sorry and asked for a hug. Their mom and dad hugged them and said they loved them. They said they were proud of them for telling the truth and learning from their mistake. They said they hoped they would always be good and caring brothers.
