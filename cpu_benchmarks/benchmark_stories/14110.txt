Once upon a time, there was a naughty little boy named Tom. Tom did lots of fun things, but he also got into plenty of trouble. One day, he fancied playing in the rain and so he ran outside when it started to shower.
His mom saw him from the window and called out to him, "Tom! You naughty boy! Come inside now!"
Tom just ignored her and kept playing, so his mom opened the window and shouted, "Tom! If you don't come inside, I'm going to frown!"
Tom stopped playing and looked up. He was a bit scared, so he ran inside as fast as he could. His mom smiled and said, "Now Tom, don't be naughty and go play inside." Tom nodded, trying to hide a naughty smile. He was glad his mom hadn't had to frown.
