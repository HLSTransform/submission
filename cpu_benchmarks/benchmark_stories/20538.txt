Once upon a time, there was a very gloomy frog. He was so lonely, he just wanted to have a friend. So, one day, he decided to lie on his back in the sun. As he was basking in the glorious heat, a little girl, who was only three, came along. She saw the frog lying there, and said hello. The frog was so happy he jumped up and said hello back. 
The little girl was so delighted! She asked the frog if he would like to be her friend, and he said yes. From that day on, the frog and the little girl became the best of friends. Every morning the frog would jump out of his pond and give the little girl a big hug. 
The frog and the little girl even started having tea parties with mud pies! They had the best time together. Even on the gloomiest days, their friendship brought joy to their hearts. 
The frog and the little girl became inseparable. And their friendship never stopped blooming, from then until eternity.
