Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Bongo. Bongo loved to play with his friends in the forest. One day, he saw a funny looking razor on the ground. He picked it up and showed it to his friend, a little bunny named Benny.
Benny said, "What is that?"
Bongo said, "I don't know, but it looks funny."
Benny said, "Be careful, it looks sharp."
Bongo said, "I won't touch it. Let's go play."
As they were playing, Bongo saw a beautiful butterfly. He wanted to kiss it, but it flew away too fast. Benny said, "Don't worry, Bongo. Maybe you can kiss it next time."
Bongo smiled and said, "Thanks, Benny. You're a good friend."
And they continued to play in the forest, happy and carefree.
