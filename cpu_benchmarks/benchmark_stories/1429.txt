Once upon a time there was a mighty bear who believed in magic. Every night he would sit by the television and his mighty friends would come alive! 
He believed that he could make anything happen if he just wished hard enough. So he wished for all his toys to come to life, and they did! One night, a tiny toy car came out of the television and it began to drive away. 
The bear decided to follow it and so he went on a great adventure. He went to the far side of the world and he even flew on the back of a giant bird! Everywhere he went, he saw wonderful things and he made lots of new friends. 
Though his journey lasted for only one night, the bear was so happy he believed he could fly like the other animals. He had an amazing time and he never forgot the magic he felt that night.
