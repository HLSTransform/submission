Jimmy was so small and always worried. One day, he was walking to the gym with his mommy. He felt so scared, his heart was pounding. 
When they got to the gym, Jimmy looked around. Everything was so big and icy! His mommy put her arm around him and smiled.
Jimmy suddenly wasn't so worried anymore. They played games at the gym and jumped around. Jimmy even laughed and forgot how icy it was. 
When it was time to leave, Jimmy was happy. He said goodbye to the gym and told his mommy he wanted to come back again.
