Hannah was very busy. She had so much to do that day that she was running late. As soon as she got outside, she noticed something strange. The gate leading out of her house was open and there seemed to be somebody inside.
"Who's there?" she asked.
Suddenly, the door slid open, and a strange little boy smiled at her.
"Hi Hannah! I'm Ben, I just came to play! Do you wanna come too?" he said.
Hannah was surprised and a little suspicious, but she thought it would be fun. She said yes, and Ben and Hannah began to slide down the slide in the backyard.
But as they slid, Hannah heard a loud creaking sound coming from the gate. She stopped and saw that the gate had broken and was now swinging open. 
Hannah was scared and started to cry. She looked around and saw something she hadn't seen before; Ben had a sack of tools, and he had loosened the gate before they started to slide.
Hannah was so mad, she knew that Ben had done something bad and that she was in trouble. She rushed inside to tell her parents, and soon the police came to take Ben away.
Hannah had learned her lesson; be careful who you let into your backyard!
