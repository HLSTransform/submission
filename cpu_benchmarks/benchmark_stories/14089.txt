Once upon a time, there were two friends, Sam and Joe. Sam was always very excited when the night sky was clear, because then he could watch the comets pass by.
Sam said to Joe, "Let's go stargazing tonight! There will be a comet passing through the sky!"
Joe was ready to go, he was very excited.
Later, when it was dark outside, Sam and Joe went outside to look for comets.
Sam pointed and shouted "Look! There is a comet, up there in the sky!"
They watched the comet pass through the sky. It lit up the night for a moment and then passed away. 
"That was so cool!" Joe said. 
"Yeah," Sam smiled.  "Let's do it again tomorrow!" 
The friends went back to Joe's house, ready for more adventures the next day.
