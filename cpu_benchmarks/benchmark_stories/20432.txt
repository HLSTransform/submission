Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint pictures with her mom. They would use lots of colors like red, blue, and green. One day, Lily's mom had to go to university to learn more things. Lily was sad because she would miss her mom. 
While her mom was away, Lily painted a special picture just for her. It had a big heart in the middle and lots of flowers around it. When her mom came home, she was very happy to see the picture. She hugged Lily and said, "I am so proud of you!" 
Lily's older sister, Sarah, was a little jealous of the picture. She wanted to paint something just as nice. So, Lily helped her paint a picture of a rainbow. Sarah was very happy and said, "Thank you, Lily! You are the best sister ever!"
