Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play in the park. They know how to swing, slide and run. They have fun together.
One day, Tom sees a big dog in the park. He wants to pet the dog. He runs to the dog and says, "Hi, doggy! You are nice!" But the dog does not like Tom. The dog barks and bites Tom's ear. Tom cries out loud. He feels pain in his ear.
Lily hears Tom cry. She runs to him and sees his ear. His ear is red and has a mark. She says, "Oh, no! Tom, you are careless! You do not pet a dog you do not know. The dog can hurt you. You have to ask the owner first."
Tom says, "I am sorry, Lily. I did not know. I like dogs. I thought the dog would like me too." Lily says, "It is okay, Tom. I forgive you. But you have to be careful next time. Come, I will help you. We will find the owner and get some help for your ear."
Tom and Lily find the owner of the dog. The owner is sorry too. He says, "I am sorry, kids. My dog is not friendly. He does not like strangers. He is scared of them. I should have kept him on a leash. I hope your ear is not bad." He gives Tom a band-aid and some candy. He says, "Please do not be mad at my dog. He did not mean to hurt you. He is just a dog. He does not know better."
Tom and Lily say, "Thank you, sir. We are not mad at your dog. We understand. He is just a dog. But we will not pet him again. We will be more careful." They say goodbye to the owner and the dog. They go back to the park and play some more. They are still friends. They are happy.
