Once upon a time there was a boy named Billy. He was only three years old and loved to explore the world.
Billy heard about a magical light that he could only see if he believed. He was so excited and knew he had to find it. 
Every day, Billy set out to find the magical light. He looked high and low, but he couldn't find it. 
One day, Billy decided to close his eyes, take a deep breath, and believe. He put his hands to his face and imagined the light. 
Suddenly, he felt tingles all around his body and little lights sparkled all around him! He opened his eyes and saw the magical light! 
Billy kept the magical light close to him and explored the world with a smile on his face. He knew that if he believed, anything was possible!
