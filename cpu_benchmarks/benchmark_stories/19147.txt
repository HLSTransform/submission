Once upon a time, there was a helpful dog named Spot. Spot liked to go for walks in the park. One day, Spot found a chain on the ground.
Spot picked up the chain with his mouth and started to go back home. On the way, he saw a little boy who was sad. The little boy had lost his toy.
Spot wanted to help the little boy. He gave the chain to the boy, but the boy was still sad. The chain could not make the boy happy. Spot felt bad and walked away.
