Jimmy had a lunch at school. It was organized neatly with a sandwich, apple, and a cookie. Jimmy was excited to eat it. 
Suddenly, the school bell rang. Jimmy had to go to recess. He ran and forgot all about his lunch. 
When Jimmy returned from recess, he noticed his lunch was all melted. The sandwich and cookie were now soggy and the apple was warm. 
Jimmy was sad and glanced at the clock. He had five minutes to eat the lunch before the bell would ring again. Jimmy quickly ate as much as he could before the bell rang again. 
He cleaned up his lunch, put all the things back into his lunch box and ran off to class. He was relieved everything was all organized again.
