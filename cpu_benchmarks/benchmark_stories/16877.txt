Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a big bag of corn in her backyard. The corn was yellow and smelled yummy.
Lily decided to plant the corn in the ground. She watered it every day and watched it grow. But one day, she noticed that some of the corn had started to rot. It looked brown and mushy.
Lily was uncomfortable with the rotting corn, so she picked it all off the stalks and threw it away. She was happy to have a big pile of fresh corn to eat instead. The end.
