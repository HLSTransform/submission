Once upon a time, there was a big whale. This whale was different. It could talk and solve problems.
One day, the whale met a little fish. The fish was sad. It could not find its mom. The whale wanted to help the fish. They went on a fun trip to find the fish's mom.
The whale and the fish asked other sea animals if they had seen the fish's mom. They solved the problem together. At last, they found the fish's mom. The fish was very happy. The whale, the fish, and the fish's mom became good friends. They all lived happily ever after.
