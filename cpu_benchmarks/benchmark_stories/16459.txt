Anna and Ben love to play with their toy cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They like to make roads and bridges with their blocks and pretend to drive around. Sometimes they have races and see who is faster.
One day, they decide to play with their cars outside. They find a big hill and think it would be fun to roll their cars down. They take turns to choose a car and let it go. The cars zoom down the hill and make them laugh.
But then, something bad happens. Ben picks his favorite car, a red one with a shiny sticker. He lets it go, but it goes too fast. It hits a rock and flies off the hill. Ben and Anna run after it, but they cannot see where it lands. They look everywhere, but they cannot find it. Ben feels very sad and starts to cry. He loves his red car and does not want to lose it. Anna feels sorry for him and tries to help him look.
They search for a long time, but they have no luck. They start to worry that they will never find the car. They think maybe a bird took it or a dog buried it. They wonder if they should go home and tell their mom.
But then, something amazing happens. They hear a loud honk from behind a bush. They go to see what it is and they cannot believe their eyes. It is a real car, a big red one, just like Ben's toy car. And inside the car, there is a nice man with a smile. He says he saw their toy car flying in the air and caught it. He says he was looking for them to give it back. He hands Ben his car and says he is lucky to have such a cool toy. Ben is so happy he hugs his car and thanks the man. Anna is happy too and says the man is very kind. The man says he is glad to help and honks his horn again. He waves goodbye and drives away.
Ben and Anna are very excited. They think it is a miracle that they found their car and met a nice man with a real car. They run back to the hill and play with their cars some more. They are careful not to lose them again. They have a lot of fun and forget about their worry. They think it is the best day ever.
