Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved playing with bubbles. She blew them and watched them float away, but one day a strong wind blew and took her bubble wand away. She was sad and didn't know what to do.
Lily decided to go to the store to get a new bubble wand, but it was very cold outside. She put on her warm coat and walked to the store. When she got there, the store was closed. She was very sad again.
But then, Lily remembered that her neighbor had a bubble wand too. She went to her neighbor's house and asked to borrow it. The neighbor said yes, and Lily was very happy. She played with the bubbles and had fun.
Later, Lily returned the bubble wand to her neighbor and said thank you. She learned that even when things don't go as planned, there is always a way to make things better.
