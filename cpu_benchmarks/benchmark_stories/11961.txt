Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and go outside to see the trees and flowers. One day, she went to the park with her mom and saw a big truck delivering oil to the gas station. 
"Mommy, what is that truck doing?" asked Lily.
"That truck is bringing oil to the gas station so we can put gas in our car," said her mom.
Lily thought the truck was very big and dependable. She wanted to be dependable too, so she started helping her mom with chores at home. She would clean her room and help set the table for dinner. 
One day, Lily's friend came over to play and accidentally knocked over a vase. Lily's mom was upset, but Lily said, "It's okay, accidents happen. I'll help clean it up." 
Lily's mom was proud of her for being dependable and understanding. The moral of the story is that it's important to be dependable and help others, even when accidents happen.
