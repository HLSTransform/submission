Once upon a time there was a girl. The girl loved to climb. One day, she was going on an adventure and she saw a big bell. The bell was purple, and it was very pretty.
The girl was excited, so she decided to climb up to the bell. She grabbed it and started to pull herself up the bell. It was hard work, and the girl was very tired. But she kept going until she was at the top.
When she reached the top, she was surprised â€“ the bell was actually a door! And when she opened it there was a beautiful garden full of purple flowers. The girl was so happy that she had climbed to the top that she ran around the garden, smelling the flowers and feeling the sun on her face. 
That was the girl's best adventure ever. She will always remember the purple bell and the magical garden she found when she climbed to the top.
