Tom and Lily liked to play with their toys. They had many toys, but their favorite was the number machine. The number machine was a big box with buttons and lights. When they pressed the buttons, the number machine made sounds and showed numbers on the screen.
One day, Tom and Lily were playing with the number machine in their room. They took turns to press the buttons and say the numbers out loud.
"Two, four, six, eight!" Tom said, pressing the buttons.
"Ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen!" Lily said, pressing the buttons.
They were having fun, until they heard a knock on the door. It was their big brother, Sam. Sam was older and did not like to play with toys. He liked to read books and do puzzles.
"Hey, what are you doing with that ugly machine?" Sam said, walking into the room.
"It's not ugly, it's fun!" Tom said, holding the number machine.
"It's silly, it's boring!" Sam said, grabbing the number machine.
"Give it back, it's ours!" Lily said, pulling the number machine.
Sam was stronger and pulled harder. He took the number machine away from Tom and Lily and threw it on the floor. The number machine broke into pieces. The buttons and lights stopped working. The screen went black.
Tom and Lily cried. They loved their number machine. They were sad and angry.
"Look what you did, you meanie!" Tom said, pointing at Sam.
"You're a bad brother, you're a bully!" Lily said, stamping her foot.
Sam did not care. He laughed and walked away. He did not say sorry.
Tom and Lily hugged each other. They picked up the pieces of their number machine and put them in a box. They hoped they could fix it someday. They wished Sam would be nicer to them. They wished they had a new number machine.
