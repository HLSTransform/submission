Once upon a time there lived a hard hunter. He lived in the woods and hunted game every day. One day he decided to go on an adventure like he had never done before. He packed his bags and off he went, determined to find the end of the woods.
When he arrived at the edge of the woods he saw a big, open field. He was so excited to explore. He walked across the field and realized that he had been walking for a long time. He was beginning to get tired, but he kept going until he spotted the end of the field.
He shouted, "Yay, I've reached the end!" Suddenly, a voice called out from behind him. It was a small voice. When he turned around, he saw a little girl. She was only three years old.
"What's at the end?" she asked.
The hunter smiled. "I don't know," he said. "But that's all part of the adventure!" Then he said goodbye, and continued on his journey. 
The little girl watched him go until he disappeared around the corner. And that was the end of the hunter's big adventure.
