One day, Lily and Ben went to the park with their mom. They liked to play on the swings and the slide and the sandbox. They also liked to look for bugs and flowers and rocks.
Lily found a big black beetle under a leaf. She was very happy and picked it up. She wanted to show it to Ben and mom. She ran to them and said, "Look, look, I found a beetle!"
But Ben did not like beetles. He thought they were scary and icky. He said, "Ew, Lily, put that down! Beetles are gross! I don't want to see it!"
Lily felt sad and angry. She liked her beetle and wanted to keep it. She said, "No, Ben, beetles are not gross! They are cool and shiny and strong! You are mean!"
Mom saw that Lily and Ben were fighting. She said, "Stop, stop, both of you! Beetles are not gross or cool. They are just beetles. They are part of nature and we should respect them. But we should also be careful and not hurt them or ourselves. Lily, you can keep your beetle, but you have to put it in a jar with some air and food. Ben, you don't have to look at the beetle, but you have to be nice to Lily. She is your sister and she likes different things than you. Can you both say sorry and hug?"
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They both felt a little sorry and a little silly. They said, "Sorry, Lily. Sorry, Ben." They hugged and smiled. Mom smiled too. She said, "Good, good. Now let's go and have some snacks. It's a mild day and we can sit on the grass and enjoy the sun." Lily and Ben agreed. They followed mom to the picnic basket. Lily put her beetle in a jar and gave it some leaves and water. Ben gave her a cookie and said, "Maybe beetles are not so bad. Can I see it later?" Lily said, "Sure, Ben. Maybe you will like it too." They both laughed and ate their snacks. They were happy and forgot their fight. They had a fun day at the park.
