Jim was walking in the park when he saw an old man admiring a fancy trade. The old man said to Jim, "This is a special trade. Would you like to buy it?" Jim was so excited and he said, "Yes! Please!" The old man grabbed Jim's hand and said, "It will cost you 5 dollars."
Jim only had 3 dollars and he asked if he could pay the difference later. The old man shook his head and said, "No, I need the money now." Jim said he was sorry and asked if he could try the trade. The old man hesitated and reluctantly said, "Yes, you can try."
So Jim tried the trade, but it was too hard for him and he did not do a very good job. The old man said, "I'm sorry, but you can't keep the trade." Jim was sad and asked if he could at least admire it for a little longer. The old man said, "No, I need the money now."
Jim sadly gave the old man the 3 dollars and walked away. As Jim walked away, he couldn't help but admire the fancy trade he would never get to keep.
