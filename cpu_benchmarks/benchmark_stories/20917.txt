Bert enjoyed playing in the park with his dad every Saturday. As they arrived on this particular Saturday, they were both excited when they saw pink balloons in the sky. Bert thought they were the most beautiful things he had ever seen.
His dad said they were special: each balloon had a wish. He told Bert that if he could catch one, his wish would come true. Both Bert and his dad tried to catch them, but all the balloons flew away as if they were playing with him.
Bert was a little disappointed, but his dad told him it was ok: he had to be more thoughtful. He said it was important to take your time and really think about what your wish should be.
The next Saturday, Bert made sure he was ready and watched carefully for the balloons. Together, he and his dad tried again, and this time Bert was successful - he held one of the pink balloons tightly in his hands.
He made a wish, and the pink balloon stayed with him. His dad told him that his wish had come true: he had been thoughtful, and he was rewarded with his wish.
