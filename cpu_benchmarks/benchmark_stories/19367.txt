Once there was a girl who wanted to work. She was very excited, so she began to look for a job. 
She first thought of mowing the grass in her neighborhood, because there was lots of it. She thought it would be fun to use the mower.
However, when she began to work, she soon realized that it was much harder than she thought. The mower was very heavy for her and the grass made it even harder to use.
Finally, after much struggle, she was able to finish the job. But then she felt stupid for believing it would be easy.
The girl learned a lesson that day - sometimes it's better to think before taking on a job.
