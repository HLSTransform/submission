Once upon a time, there were two friends, Amy and Ben. They were walking in the woods when they saw something shiny. 
Amy said, “Let’s go see what it is!” 
Ben said, “No, it’s too dangerous.” 
But Amy was very curious and she wanted to go, so Ben said, “Okay, let’s go.”
When they got to the shiny thing, they realized it was a big piece of gold! They decided to take it, but all of a sudden a big monster appeared. 
The monster growled, “You need to give me the piece!”
Amy and Ben were scared, so they handed the piece of gold to the monster. The monster was very angry and he growled, “This is my piece and I’m going to make sure you never touch it again!”
The monster then ordered them to leave and never come back. Amy and Ben had to leave, but they were very sad that they couldn’t keep the piece of gold. 
They knew it was dangerous to try and take the gold, but they still wished they hadn’t listened to the monster’s orders.
