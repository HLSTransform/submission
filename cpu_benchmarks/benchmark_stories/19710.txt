One day two friends, Marcy and John, decided to go for a march. They put on their shoes and grabbed a picnic basket. Marcy was wearing a bright pink dress and John had a blue shirt.
They started walking and soon they heard some strange noises. It was a kangaroo! John was so excited, he had never seen a kangaroo before. Marcy and John took some food from their basket and the kangaroo nibbled on it gratefully.
Then the kangaroo started to move. It hopped around Marcy and John and then it stopped in front of them. Marcy and John thought it wanted to join the march. So they took the kangaroo's hand and they all marched together. They sang a happy song as they walked.
Eventually they came to Marcy and John's house. They said goodbye to their new friend, the kangaroo, and it hopped away. Marcy and John thanked it for joining them for their march and were very grateful for their new experience.
