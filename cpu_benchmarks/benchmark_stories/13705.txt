Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go on adventures with his parents. One day, they decided to go on a camping trip. Timmy was so excited that he couldn't sit still. 
"Mommy, can I pack my toys?" he asked.
"Of course, Timmy. Just make sure you don't forget anything important," his mom replied.
Timmy packed his favorite toys, some snacks, and a magazine to read. They drove for a long time until they reached a distant forest. They set up their tent and started a fire. As they sat around the fire, Timmy's dad told him stories about the animals that lived in the forest. 
Suddenly, they heard a strange noise. "What was that?" Timmy asked.
"I don't know, let's go check it out," his dad replied.
They walked through the forest until they found a lost puppy. Timmy was so happy that they found the puppy. They decided to take the puppy with them on their camping trip. Timmy packed a bowl and some food for the puppy. They all went back to the campsite and had a great time together.
