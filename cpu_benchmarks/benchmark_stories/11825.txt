Once upon a time, there was a girl who wanted to meet a fairy. Every night, she'd look up at the stars and wish for it to come true. One night, something magical happened!
The girl saw a sparkly light outside her window and when she opened it up, a fairy flew in. She was wearing a fancy dress and had a big smile on her face.
The girl was very excited and asked the fairy if she could join her on an adventure. The fairy said yes and they flew away to a secret place.
When they arrived, the fairy spread out a big sheet on the ground. Then they both sat down and shared stories and ate treats together.
The girl was so happy to have met a fairy and they became friends forever.
