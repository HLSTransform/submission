Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to watch the fish swim in her fish tank. One day, Lily's mom brought home some shrimp for dinner. Lily thought the shrimp looked funny and asked her mom what they were. "Those are shrimp," her mom replied. 
Lily's little brother, Max, came into the room and saw the shrimp. "Wow, those are popular!" he exclaimed. Lily didn't know what "popular" meant, so she asked Max. "It means a lot of people like them," he explained. 
Later that night, Lily and Max sat down for dinner. Lily tried the shrimp and decided she liked them too. "Mom, can we have shrimp again sometime?" she asked. "Of course, Lily," her mom replied. "We can have shrimp whenever you want."
