Once there was a little girl named Linda. She was 3 years old and loved to explore the world around her. One day she found a mysterious cable on the ground. She picked it up and rubbed it between her fingers. It was soft and colorful.
Linda was amazed. She took the cable home and showed it to her mom. Her mom was surprised too. She said Linda had found an original cable that was very special.
Linda kept the cable safe and played with it every day. She loved to rub the soft and colorful cable in her fingers. She even pretended it was a snake that was alive! She was so happy with her special cable. 
What a fun discovery!
