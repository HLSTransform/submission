Once upon a time there were two friends, Jack and Jill. They were walking along together in the park when they saw a goose. Jill said to Jack: "Let's spoil the goose!" They ran as fast as they could to the goose and started to stroke it. The goose felt happy and wagged its tail.
Suddenly, the goose stopped and said: "Why do you want to spoil me?" 
Jack looked at Jill and said: "Well, why not? We just wanted to be nice to you."
The goose smiled and replied: "That's very kind of you. But I'm a bit tired now and I need to rest. Come back tomorrow and I'll be rested."
Jack and Jill said goodbye to the goose and left. The next day, when they returned, the goose thanked them for understanding and said goodbye. From then on, Jack and Jill visited the goose every day and spoiled it with love and kindness.
