Jack liked to play in the field. Every day he would go out to look for something exciting and fun. One day he noticed a small, humble razor on the ground. He picked it up and decided to take it home.
Jack asked his mom why he found a razor in the field. She said, "That must have come from Tom. Tom lives nearby and he's really good at finding things. He'll come by later and show you some of his other discoveries."
Meanwhile, Jack was really excited to meet Tom and to see what else he had found. When Tom arrived, he brought with him a big bag of items. He showed Jack all the things inside. Jack was so amazed, he could hardly believe his eyes.
Once the show and tell was over, Tom thanked Jack for the razor and waved goodbye. As the sun began to set, Jack ran home with a smile on his face. He was sure happy to have made a new friend, and to have seen such incredible things.
