Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved going to the beach with his family. One day, Timmy and his family went to the beach. Timmy was very enthusiastic and ran towards the water. He played in the sand and built a sandcastle. 
After a while, Timmy got hungry and asked his mom for a snack. She gave him a sandwich to eat. Timmy ate his sandwich and then went back to playing in the sand. He had so much fun at the beach that day! When it was time to go home, Timmy was sad to leave the beach but he knew he would come back soon.
