Mary and her dad had a fun day playing at the beach. Mary was so excited that the beach had a big stack of rocks. She ran over to them and started to part them, one by one. The rocks were placed in neat rows. Dad watched her carefully and smiled.
Suddenly, Mary saw a fierce dog running across the beach. She screamed and hid behind her dad. The dog saw the stack of rocks and was tempted to play. Mary was scared, but she watched from behind Dad as the dog walked over and started to part the rocks.
Dad laughed at the sight of the dog. Mary smiled, too. The dog had such a fun time playing with the rocks. He part them around and even tried to make them into bigger stacks. Mary cheered the dog on and clapped happily.
After the dog had finished playing with the rocks, Mary and Dad walked away with big smiles on their faces. It had been a fun day at the beach.
