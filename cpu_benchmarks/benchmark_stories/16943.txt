Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and climb on the trees. They saw a big tree with many branches and leaves. They wanted to go up and see the sky.
"Let's climb the tree!" Tom said. He was brave and strong. He found a twig and used it to poke the branches. He made a way for him and Lily to go up.
"Wait for me!" Lily said. She was smart and careful. She followed Tom and held the twig. She liked to see the birds and the clouds.
They climbed higher and higher. They felt happy and proud. They reached the top of the tree. They looked around and saw the whole park. They saw the swings and the slides and the pond. They saw their mom and dad sitting on a bench. They waved at them and smiled.
"Hello, mom and dad!" Tom shouted. He wanted them to see how high he was. He was very loud.
"Hello, Tom and Lily!" Mom and dad shouted back. They were happy to see their children having fun. They were also a little worried.
"Be careful, kids!" Mom shouted. She knew the tree was big and old. She hoped the twig was strong enough.
"Don't worry, mom!" Lily shouted. She trusted Tom and the twig. She thought they were important.
But then, something bad happened. The twig broke. It snapped in half. Tom and Lily lost their balance. They fell from the tree. They screamed and cried.
Mom and dad ran to them. They hugged them and kissed them. They checked if they were hurt. They were not hurt, but they were scared and sad.
"I'm sorry, Lily!" Tom said. He felt guilty and ashamed. He broke the twig. He ruined their fun.
"It's okay, Tom!" Lily said. She forgave him and loved him. She knew it was an accident. She still had him.
Mom and dad took them home. They gave them cookies and milk. They told them stories and jokes. They made them feel better.
They learned a lesson. They learned to be more careful and listen to their mom and dad. They learned that the twig was not important. They learned that they were important. They learned that they loved each other.
