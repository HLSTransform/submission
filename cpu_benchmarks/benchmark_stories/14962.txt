Max and his mum were excited to go to Grandma's house. As they walked along, Max ran ahead. He stopped in front of a big, white door and looked up. "We're here!" Max shouted. 
Mum smiled and took out a key. She opened the door and they stepped into Grandma's house. "Grandma!" Max shouted. 
"Surprise!" Grandma laughed. She was standing in the hall with a big, delicious cake. "Happy Birthday, Max!"
Max wanted to grab the cake right away, but Grandma said to wait. She pointed to the big clock on the wall. "It's not your birthday yet, Max." she said. Max looked confused. He wanted the cake right away! 
Mum smiled. "Grandma's right, Max, we have to wait until it's your birthday. That's the rule, so we have to delay the cake". Max understood and he gave Grandma a hug. They all laughed, then waited for Max's birthday.
