The sun was up and it was a new day. Jack and Zoe were excited to explore the garden.
They started to look around when all of a sudden Jack yawned. "You're so tired," said Zoe. Jack shook his head. "No, I just found something really exciting!" 
He pointed to a chain. "It looks fun!" said Zoe. They started to mess around with it like a game. The chain couldn't get away because it was very strong, but they kept running and laughing.
Suddenly, a voice called out. "What do you two think you're doing?" Jack and Zoe stopped and looked up. It was Jack's mom. She was being bossy but she was also smiling. "This chain is not a toy. You need to be careful," she said.
Jack and Zoe nodded and apologized. Then they decided to find something else to do. They found their way around the garden, looking for more fun things to do. But they never forgot that chain!
