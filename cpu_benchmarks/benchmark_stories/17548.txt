Anna and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to find things on the ground and pretend they were toys. Anna found a twig that looked like a wand. She waved it in the air and said, "Abracadabra!"
"What are you doing?" Ben asked.
"I'm a fairy," Anna said. "I can do magic with my twig."
"Can I see?" Ben said. He reached for the twig, but Anna pulled it away.
"No, you can't," Anna said. "This is my twig. It's very expensive. Only fairies can have it."
Ben felt sad. He wanted to play with Anna, but she was being mean. He looked around and saw a shiny stone. He picked it up and said, "Look, Anna, I found a diamond. It's more expensive than your twig. I'm a king and you have to do what I say."
Anna looked at the stone and felt curious. She wanted to see if it was really a diamond. She said, "Can I see?"
"No, you can't," Ben said. "This is my diamond. It's very expensive. Only kings can have it."
Anna felt angry. She didn't like it when Ben was mean to her. She said, "Fine, I don't want to see your diamond. I don't want to play with you. You're not a king, you're a bully."
She turned around and walked away. She found a bench and sat on it. She hugged her twig and said, "You're my only friend, twig. You're the best."
Ben felt sorry. He didn't want to make Anna angry. He wanted to play with her. He said, "Anna, wait. I'm sorry. I was just joking. You can see my diamond. You can have it if you want. I don't need it. I just want to be your friend."
He ran after Anna and gave her the stone. Anna looked at it and smiled. She said, "Thank you, Ben. You're very nice. I'm sorry too. You can see my twig. You can have it if you want. I don't need it. I just want to be your friend."
They hugged and said, "We're sorry. We're friends."
They went back to playing in the park. They shared their twig and their stone. They pretended they were fairies and kings. They had fun. They were happy.
