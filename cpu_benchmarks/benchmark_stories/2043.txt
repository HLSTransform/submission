Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had a favorite toy, a teddy bear named Brownie. One day, Lily's friend Tommy came to visit her.
Tommy said, "Hi Lily, can I play with Brownie?"
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "Yes, you can share Brownie with me."
Tommy was happy and they started to play together. But after a while, it started to get dark outside.
Lily said, "Tommy, it's getting dark. I think it's time for you to go home."
Tommy replied, "Okay Lily, I'm ready to go home now. Thank you for sharing Brownie with me." 
Lily smiled and said, "You're welcome Tommy. See you soon!"
