Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Lily. She lived in a big jungle with many animals. One day, Lily saw a leopard who was hurt. She wanted to help the leopard, so she managed to get close to him and give him some food. 
The leopard was happy and grateful to Lily. They became friends and played together every day. But one day, the leopard got scared and attacked Lily. She was hurt badly and couldn't move. 
Lily cried out for help, but no one came. The leopard felt sorry, but it was too late. Lily's kindness had led her to a bad ending.
