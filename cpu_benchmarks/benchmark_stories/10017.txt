Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to travel with his family. One day, they went to the amusement park. Timmy saw a big circle ride and wanted to go on it. 
"Mommy, can we go on that ride?" Timmy asked.
"Yes, we can," Mommy said. "But it might make you feel uncomfortable."
Timmy didn't know what uncomfortable meant, so he asked his mom. "What does uncomfortable mean?"
"It means you might not feel very good," Mommy explained.
But Timmy wanted to go on the ride anyway. So, they got on the ride and it started to spin. Timmy felt a little uncomfortable, but he held on tight and enjoyed the ride. When it was over, Timmy said, "That was so much fun! Can we do it again?"
