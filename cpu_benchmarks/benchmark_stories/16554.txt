Lily loved to swim in the pool. She liked to splash and kick and blow bubbles. She had a pink swimsuit with a flower on it. She wore it every time she went to the pool with her mom.
One day, when Lily was swimming, she heard a loud noise in the sky. She looked up and saw a big helicopter. It was flying very fast and low. It had a red cross on it. Lily wondered what it was doing.
"Mom, look! A helicopter!" Lily shouted.
"Yes, honey, that's a helicopter. It's a special kind of airplane that can go up and down and sideways. It helps people who are sick or hurt," Mom explained.
"Why is it here, Mom?" Lily asked.
"I don't know, honey. Maybe it's going to the hospital. Let's watch it for a while," Mom said.
They watched the helicopter fly over the pool and then disappear behind the trees. Lily thought it was very cool and exciting. She wanted to see it again.
She swam to the edge of the pool and climbed out. She ran to the fence and looked for the helicopter. She saw it land on the roof of a big building. She saw some people get out of the helicopter and go inside the building.
"Mom, can we go see the helicopter?" Lily begged.
"Sorry, honey, we can't. That's a private place. Only the people who work there can go there. Besides, we have to go home soon. It's almost time for lunch," Mom said.
Lily was disappointed. She wanted to see the helicopter up close. She wanted to touch it and hear it and maybe even ride in it. She thought it would be fun.
She went back to the pool and swam some more. She pretended she was a helicopter. She made noises with her mouth and moved her arms like blades. She had fun, but she still wished she could see the real helicopter.
Maybe someday, she thought, maybe someday.
