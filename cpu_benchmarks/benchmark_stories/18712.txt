Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go for car rides with her mommy and daddy. One day, they went for a ride to the park. Lily was so excited to play on the swings and slide.
As they were driving home, Lily's mommy noticed that she had forgotten to buckle Lily's seatbelt. She quickly pulled over and buckled Lily in. But when they started driving again, Lily started to cry. She didn't want to be buckled in! She wanted to be free to move around.
Lily's mommy explained to her that it was important to wear her seatbelt to stay safe. Lily didn't understand at first, but then she saw a graceful bird flying in the sky. Her mommy told her that the bird always returns to its nest to stay safe. Lily realized that she needed to return to her seat and buckle up to stay safe too. From then on, she always wore her seatbelt and felt much happier and safer on car rides.
