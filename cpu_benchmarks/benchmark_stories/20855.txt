Tommy was a silly little boy. He liked to lay in the sun and play with his toys. One day, his mommy said it was time for a massage. So, he laid down and closed his eyes while his mommy gave him a massage. But the massage felt funny and strange. It made Tommy very scared. He tried to run away, but his mommy kept pushing him down. Soon, he was crying and screaming because the massage hurt so much. His mommy said it was ok, but Tommy knew it was not. He finished the massage with tears in his eyes and never wanted to lay down for a massage ever again.
