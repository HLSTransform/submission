Once upon a time, there was a girl named Melody. She was only three years old and loved to play. One day she decided to take a walk in the park with her mom.
"Mommy, look!" Melody shouted as she saw a purple flower. 
"Mmmm, that's a lovely colour," said her mom.
But as Melody got closer to the flower, her foot slipped and she lost her balance.
"Be careful, Melody!" said her mom.
Melody was worried she was going to fall, but then she put out her little foot and stepped back. She felt safe and was glad she hadn't lost her balance. 
Just then she noticed a purple butterfly on a nearby branch. She tried to take a step towards it, but her foot slipped again and she almost lost her balance. 
"Mommy, that butterfly is so pretty. Can I get it?" she asked.
Melody's mom smiled and gave her a hug. "No honey, we can't take it home with us, but we can look at it for a while."
Melody smiled and looked at the purple butterfly as it flew away. She was so glad she hadn't lost her balance and had a wonderful time in the park with her mom.
