Once upon a time, there was a little gray mouse named Timmy. He lived in a cozy hole in the wall of a big house. Timmy loved to play games with his friends, but he wasn't very good at them. He always lost and felt sad.
One day, Timmy's friend, a wise old owl, told him a story. The story was about a tortoise who won a race against a hare. The tortoise won because he didn't give up and kept going until the end.
Timmy thought about the story and decided to try again. He practiced every day and soon he became better at the games. One day, he finally won a game and felt so happy! Timmy learned that even if he didn't win every time, he should never give up and keep trying his best.
