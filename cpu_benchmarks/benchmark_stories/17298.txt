Once upon a time, there was a man. He was walking in the park when he saw a harmless butterfly. He wanted to touch it, but he accidentally tore its wing. The man felt sad because he didn't mean to harm the butterfly. He tried to fix the wing, but he couldn't. He realized that he should be more careful around small creatures. From that day on, the man made sure to be gentle and kind to all animals.
