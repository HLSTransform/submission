Lily was a curious girl who liked to explore new things. One day, she saw a big yellow fruit on the kitchen table. She had never seen it before and wanted to try it. She climbed on a chair and reached for the fruit.
"Stop, Lily!" her mom said. "That is a banana. You can't eat it like that. You have to peel it first."
"Why?" Lily asked.
"Because the skin is not good for you. It is hard and bitter. You have to take it off and eat the soft part inside. That is sweet and yummy. Here, let me show you." Her mom took the banana and peeled it for Lily. She broke off a piece and gave it to Lily.
Lily took a bite and smiled. She liked the banana. It was soft and sweet and made her feel happy. She thanked her mom and asked for more.
Her mom smiled and gave her another piece. She was glad she prevented Lily from eating the skin. She knew Lily was curious, but she also wanted her to be safe and healthy. She hugged Lily and said, "You are a good girl, Lily. I love you."
Lily hugged her mom back and said, "I love you too, mom. And I love bananas."
