Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toy sailboat in the pond near her house. One day, Lily's friend Billy came over to play. 
"Can I borrow your sailboat, Lily?" asked Billy.
"Sure, but be careful with it," replied Lily.
Billy took the sailboat and started playing with it. Suddenly, a big gust of wind blew the boat away. Billy tried to catch it, but it was too far. 
"Oh no, Lily's sailboat is gone!" cried Billy.
"Don't worry, we can find it together," said Lily. They searched and searched, but they couldn't find the sailboat anywhere. 
Just when they were about to give up, they saw something funny in the pond. It was Lily's sailboat, stuck in some weeds. They were so happy to find it, and they sailed it back to shore together.
