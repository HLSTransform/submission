Once upon a time, there were two friends named Max and Spike. Max was a very happy little boy and Spike was a small, miserable little hedgehog. They often played together, which made Spike feel a little bit better. 
One day, when they were playing, Max started to poke Spike with a stick. Spike felt really angry and uncomfortable but said nothing. He just curled himself up into a ball and stayed still. 
Max kept poking and poking at Spike until Spike started to cry. He knew he had to do something to stop Max from feeling so miserable. He started to wiggle around and use his spikes to protect himself from Max' poking. 
Max was very surprised that Spike was protecting himself and he quickly stopped. Then he asked Spike: "Why did you do that?" Spike said: "Because I don't want anyone to be miserable, Max". Then Max realized how wrong he had been. 
Max and Spike hugged each other and from that day, they never poked each other again. They were the best of friends.
