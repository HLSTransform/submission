Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a unique tree. This tree was very tall and had many branches. It was on a street where kids liked to play.
One day, a little boy named Tim wanted to climb the tree. He tried to climb it, but he was scared. His friend, Amy, said, "Don't worry, I will help you." They tried to climb the tree together, but it was still hard. They did not give up.
After trying many times, Tim and Amy finally climbed the tree. They were so happy and proud. They learned that when they work together, they can do anything. The kids on the street saw them and learned the same lesson. From that day on, they all played and helped each other.
