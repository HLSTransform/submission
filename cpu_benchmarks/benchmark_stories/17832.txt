Once there was a shy little girl who liked to play outside. She liked to chase butterflies and roll around in the grass. One day she found something very special. It was a big red building. It was so tall that it reached the sky. The little girl was so excited! She rolled around the building, touching its shiny walls. She was sure that it was the most beautiful building in the whole world. 
She kept playing around the building until it was time to go home. As she walked away, the little girl waved goodbye to her special building and promised to come back soon. She knew she would always keep it in her heart.
