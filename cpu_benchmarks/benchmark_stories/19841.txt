Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was a rubber chicken. The chicken was very flexible and Lily liked to bend it in different ways.
One day, Lily's mom asked her to help set the table for dinner. Lily was excited to help and carried the plates to the table. As she was putting the plates down, she accidentally dropped her rubber chicken on the ground.
"Oh no!" Lily exclaimed. "My chicken!"
"Don't worry, Lily," her mom said. "We can wash it off and it will be good as new."
Later that night, Lily was getting ready for bed when she noticed her chicken was missing. She looked all over her room but couldn't find it. Just as she was about to give up, her mom walked in holding the chicken.
"I found it in the laundry basket," her mom said with a smile. "You must have dropped it in there earlier."
Lily was happy to have her chicken back and gave it a big hug. From that day on, she made sure to keep her toys in a safe place so they wouldn't get lost or dropped again.
