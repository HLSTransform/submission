Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a new friend named Tom. Lily wanted to introduce Tom to her family. So, she invited him to her house.
When Tom came to Lily's house, Lily's mom had made some yummy food. She put the food on a big orange plate. Lily said to Tom, "This is my mom, and this is my dad." Tom said, "Hello, nice to meet you."
They all sat down to eat the food on the orange plate. Tom said, "This food is so good!" Lily's mom and dad were happy. Lily was happy too, because her new friend liked her family. They all had a fun day together.
