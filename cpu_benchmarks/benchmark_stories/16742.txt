Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play with trucks in the park. They have big trucks and small trucks. They make sounds like vroom and beep.
One day, they see a new truck in the park. It is red and shiny. It has a ladder and a hose. It is a fire truck. Tim and Sam run to the fire truck. They want to touch it and climb on it.
"Stop!" a voice says. It is a fireman. He is alert. He sees the boys. He does not want them to get hurt. "This is not a toy. This is a real truck. It is for fires. You cannot play with it."
Tim and Sam are sad. They like the fire truck. They want to see how it works. They do not understand why they cannot play with it.
The fireman is kind. He cares about the boys. He says, "I know you like the fire truck. But it is not safe for you. It has sharp things and hot things. It can hurt you. You can look at it, but you cannot touch it. Do you understand?"
Tim and Sam nod. They understand. They say, "Sorry, fireman. We did not know. We will not touch it. Can we ask you questions?"
The fireman smiles. He says, "Sure, you can ask me questions. I will tell you about the fire truck. But first, you have to go back to your trucks. They are waiting for you. They are your toys. You can play with them."
Tim and Sam go back to their trucks. They are happy. They still like the fire truck. But they also like their trucks. They thank the fireman. They ask him questions. They learn about the fire truck. They have fun.
