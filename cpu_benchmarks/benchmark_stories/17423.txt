Anna and Ben are playing catch with a ball. They are having fun and laughing. They throw the ball high and low, near and far. They are good at catching the ball.
But then, the ball goes too far. It flies over the fence and lands in the yard of Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee is an old man who does not like children. He is always grumpy and mean. He does not let anyone play in his yard.
Anna and Ben are scared. They want their ball back, but they do not want to talk to Mr. Lee. They look around and see a cloth hanging on the fence. It is a big and colorful cloth. It looks like a flag.
Anna has an idea. She says to Ben, "Let's use the cloth to get the ball. We can tie it to a stick and reach over the fence. Then we can hook the ball and pull it back. Mr. Lee will not see us."
Ben thinks it is a good idea. He says, "OK, let's do it. But we have to be quick and quiet." They find a stick and tie the cloth to it. They lift the stick and try to get the ball.
But they are not careful enough. The cloth makes a lot of noise as it flaps in the wind. Mr. Lee hears the noise and comes out of his house. He sees Anna and Ben with the cloth and the stick. He sees the ball in his yard. He is very angry.
He shouts, "Hey, you kids! What are you doing with my cloth? That is my flag! It is very special to me. And why are you stealing my ball? Get away from my fence!"
Anna and Ben are very sorry. They drop the stick and the cloth. They say, "We are sorry, Mr. Lee. We did not mean to take your cloth or your ball. We were just playing catch and the ball went over the fence. We wanted to get it back. We did not know the cloth was your flag. Please forgive us."
Mr. Lee is still angry, but he sees that Anna and Ben are honest. They are not lying or running away. He calms down a little. He says, "Well, you should have asked me first. You should not touch other people's things without permission. That is rude and wrong. But I see that you are sorry and honest. I will give you your ball back, but you have to promise me something."
Anna and Ben nod. They say, "What do you want us to promise, Mr. Lee?"
Mr. Lee says, "You have to promise me that you will respect my flag and my yard. You have to promise me that you will not play catch near my fence again. You have to promise me that you will be more careful and polite. Can you do that?"
Anna and Ben say, "Yes, we can do that, Mr. Lee. We promise. Thank you for giving us our ball back. And we are sorry for taking your flag. It is very beautiful."
Mr. Lee smiles a little. He says, "You are welcome. And thank you for being honest. Honesty is a good thing. Maybe you are not so bad after all. Maybe we can be friends. But remember your promise. And now, go and play somewhere else. And be safe."
Anna and Ben say, "OK, Mr. Lee. We will. And we are glad to be your friends. Goodbye." They take their ball and run away. They are happy to have their ball back, but they are also happy to have a new friend. They learned a lesson today. They learned to be honest and respectful. And they learned that sometimes, old and grumpy people can be nice and kind.
