Once upon a time there was a little girl who was enthusiastic. Everywhere she went she showed her excitement. She wanted to learn more and more each day.
One day she heard her parents talking about a wise old man who was said to have amazing wisdom. The little girl wanted to meet him, so she asked her parents if she could. They said yes, and the little girl set off happily.
When she arrived, the old man was busy, but the little girl was so enthusiastic that he stopped to talk to her. She asked him many questions and the old man answered them with his kind smiles and wise advice.
The little girl was so delighted that she took a moment to close her eyes and mind the conversation. She thought about all the wisdom she'd learnt, and smiled inside with joy. She had learned so much from the old man and couldn't wait to tell her parents all about it when she got home.
