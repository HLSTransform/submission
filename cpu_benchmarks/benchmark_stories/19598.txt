Once, there was a small girl who wore a yellow jacket. She loved to play in the park, but one day it started to rain. She quickly turned and ran home. When she got home, she hung her jacket up and changed into warm, dry clothes. She then went to have some lunch. After lunch, she invited her teddy bear to go with her to the park again. 
When they got to the park, the rain had stopped and the sun was shining. The small girl and her teddy bear started to play under the trees. She spun around and around until she felt dizzy and had to stop. As she turned around to face the sun, she saw a rainbow up in the sky. The colors were so beautiful that she wanted to see it up close.
She grabbed her small jacket, put it on and ran over to the rainbow. When she got to the rainbow she reached a hand out towards it. As she touched it, small sparkles flew out of the colors and made everything around her shine. The small girl laughed and shouted for joy and then ran back to the park, twirling around and around as she went.
