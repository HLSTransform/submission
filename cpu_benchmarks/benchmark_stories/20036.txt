Sara and Sam are twins. They like to do everything together. They play with their toys, they read their books, they sing their songs. But they do not like to eat the same food.
One day, Mom makes soup for lunch. Sara loves soup. She thinks it is yummy and warm. She eats her soup with a big spoon. Sam hates soup. He thinks it is yucky and wet. He does not want to eat his soup. He pushes his bowl away.
"Sara, why do you eat soup?" Sam asks. "It is bad. It makes me sick."
"Sara, why do you not eat soup?" Sara asks. "It is good. It makes me strong."
They look at each other. They do not understand. They are anxious. They want to be the same.
Mom sees them. She smiles. She knows they are twins, but they are also different. She has an idea. She brings two plates. On each plate, there is a sandwich. One sandwich has cheese. The other sandwich has jam.
"Look, twins," Mom says. "I have something for you. You can choose what you want to eat. You do not have to eat the same food. You can eat what you like."
Sara and Sam are happy. They like to have a choice. They look at the plates. Sara picks the cheese sandwich. She likes cheese. Sam picks the jam sandwich. He likes jam. They eat their sandwiches with a big bite.
"Sara, why do you eat cheese?" Sam asks. "It is salty. It makes me thirsty."
"Sam, why do you eat jam?" Sara asks. "It is sweet. It makes me sticky."
They look at each other. They laugh. They understand. They are not anxious. They are still the same.
