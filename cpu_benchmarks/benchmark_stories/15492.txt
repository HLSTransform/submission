Once there was a boy named John. He wanted to make some money so he could buy an ice cream. He went to the store and saw a big bowl of cherries. He knew he could sell them. 
He looked around and saw a high hill nearby. Thinking it was the perfect spot, he quickly ran to get his cherries and dragged the big bowl up the hill. He put the bowl down, took a deep breath and yelled out, "I'm selling cherries!"
John smiled as people came over and started buying his cherries. Soon enough, he had sold all of his cherries and had made enough money for an ice cream. 
John was so happy! He ran back to the store with a smile on his face and got his ice cream. He went back home with a satisfied heart and enjoyed his sweet, cold treat.
