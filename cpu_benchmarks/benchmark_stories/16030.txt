Once upon a time there was a little girl named Zoe. Zoe wanted to go on a special adventure.
So Zoe grabbed her pass, put on her most comfortable shoes and headed outside.
Zoe was looking around when she heard an unfamiliar sound. She turned and saw a box with a big red button on it. Zoe pressed the button and the box began to record. Zoe was amazed!
She kept exploring and soon she stumbled across a big window. Zoe pressed her nose against it and saw a beautiful garden. Zoe tried to open the window but it was locked. She felt a bit uncomfortable as she stepped back.
Suddenly, a voice said, "Would you like me to open it?" Zoe looked around and saw an old lady with a key in her hand. Zoe nodded happily and the old lady opened the window. Zoe happily jumped through the window and explored the garden.
From that day on, Zoe would often come through the window and record her adventures with the box she found.
