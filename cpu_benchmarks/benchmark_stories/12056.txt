Once upon a time, there was a little kitten. She was very polite and loved to play with her friends. One day, it was raining outside and the kitten got very wet. She wanted to go inside to dry off, but her owner was not home. 
The kitten decided to go on an adventure to find a dryer place. She walked and walked until she found a big tree to hide under. But the rain was too strong and the kitten got even wetter. 
Suddenly, a big gust of wind came and knocked the tree down. The poor little kitten got stuck under the tree and couldn't get out. She meowed for help, but no one could hear her. 
Sadly, the kitten never got to dry off and was stuck under the tree forever. The end.
