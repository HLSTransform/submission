Once upon a time there was a crab who lived in the sea. His name was Spike. He was very soft and liked to settle on the sand.
One day, Spike was settling down and he saw a big crab. The big crab had nice big claws. "Hi, my name is Spike," he said.
The big crab said, "Hi, I'm Jack. Let's have some fun!"
So, the two crabs went for a swim. They had lots of fun together. Then, Jack said to Spike, "Let's try to catch a fish!"
Spike was scared, but he followed Jack. But Jack was too fast and Spike couldn't keep up. He got left behind in the deep blue sea. He tried to find his way back, but he couldn't. 
The sun was setting, and soon it was dark. Spike got colder and colder, until he couldn't move anymore.
The next morning, Spike didn't wake up. He had settled forever in the deep blue sea.
