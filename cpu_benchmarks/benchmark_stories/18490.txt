Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. They saw a big tire hanging from a tree. It looked like fun.
"Can we try the tire?" Lily asked Ben.
"Sure, let's go!" Ben said. They ran to the tire and took turns to sit in it. They pushed each other and spun around. They laughed and screamed.
The tire was very attractive. It was shiny and black. It had a red ribbon on it. It was a gift from the park man. He wanted to provide something new for the kids.
But after a while, Lily and Ben felt dizzy. They stopped the tire and got out. They felt sick and tired.
"Are you okay?" Ben asked Lily.
"I don't feel good. The tire made me sick." Lily said.
"Me too. Let's go home." Ben said.
They walked slowly to their mommies. They told them what happened. Their mommies hugged them and gave them water.
"Next time, don't play too long on the tire. It can make you sick." Their mommies said.
"Okay, mommy. We're sorry." Lily and Ben said.
They learned their lesson. The tire was fun, but too much fun was not good. They decided to play with other things next time. They still liked the tire, but they liked their mommies more.
