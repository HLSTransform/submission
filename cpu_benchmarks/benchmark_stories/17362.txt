Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play soccer in the park. Tom is tall and Sam is short. Tom can kick the ball very high and far. Sam can run very fast and catch the ball.
One day, they see a new boy in the park. He has a big soccer ball. He says his name is Ben. He asks Tom and Sam if they want to play with him. Tom and Sam say yes. They are happy to make a new friend.
They take turns to kick the ball. Tom kicks the ball to Sam. Sam kicks the ball to Ben. Ben kicks the ball to Tom. They have fun. But then, Ben kicks the ball too hard. The ball flies over the fence and hits a man on the head. The man is angry. He shouts at Ben.
"Hey, you! Why did you kick the ball at me? You hurt my brain! You are a bad boy!"
Ben is scared. He says he is sorry. He did not mean to hit the man. He says he just wanted to kick the ball high and far like Tom. He says he likes to play soccer.
The man is still angry. He says he does not care. He says he will take Ben's ball and go away. He says Ben can not play soccer anymore.
Tom and Sam are sad. They do not want Ben to lose his ball. They do not want Ben to stop playing soccer. They like Ben. They think he is a good boy. They want to help him.
They run to the fence. They call the man. They say they are sorry too. They say they will be more careful next time. They say they will not kick the ball at anyone. They say they will share their ball with Ben. They say they want to be friends with Ben.
The man is surprised. He sees Tom and Sam are nice and polite. He sees they care about Ben. He feels sorry for being angry. He says he is sorry too. He says he was having a bad day. He says he likes soccer too. He says he will give Ben's ball back. He says he will not take it away. He says he will let them play soccer.
Ben is happy. He thanks the man. He thanks Tom and Sam. He says they are his friends. He says they are brave and kind. He says he likes to play soccer with them.
They all smile. They hug each other. They go back to the park. They kick the ball together. They have fun. They are friends.
