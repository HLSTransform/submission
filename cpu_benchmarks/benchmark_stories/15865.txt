Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Victoria. She was a very polite girl who always said 'please' and 'thank you'. One day, she ran into trouble. She couldn't find the toy she wanted.
Victoria went over to her dad for help. "Daddy, can you supply me with a toy?" she asked very politely. 
Her dad smiled. He explained to her in simple words, "I will try my best to find the toy you need, but it might be tricky."
Victoria was very relieved. She said, "Thank you, Daddy. I'm so glad you can help!" 
So together, Victoria and her dad went looking for the toy. After a long search, they finally found it! 
Victoria was very happy. She gave her dad a big hug and said, "Thank you, Daddy! You supplied me with the toy I wanted." 
Her dad smiled and said, "You're very welcome, my dear. Always remember, if ever you need help, I'm here."
