One day, a little girl named Sue went to the park. She saw a new slide that was big and shiny. Sue was excited to play on the slide. She ran to the slide and climbed up the steps.
Sue saw a little boy named Tim sitting at the top of the slide. Tim looked scared. He said, "I need help to go down the slide." Sue smiled and said, "I will help you. Hold my hand and we will slide down together."
Tim held Sue's hand and they went down the slide. They laughed and had fun. They went on the slide again and again. Sue and Tim became good friends and played on the new slide all day.
