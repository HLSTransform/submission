Once there was a little boy who had an apple. He wanted to show it off, so he started walking up and down the street with it. He was walking very gracefully and everyone admired him.
One day he decided he should take his apple to the park. He brought it with him and proudly held it out to show everyone. Unfortunately, a group of bullies saw him and wanted to take it away from him.
The boy was scared, but he held onto it tightly. He tried his best to keep it safe, but the bullies were stronger and after a lot of struggling they managed to steal his apple away.
The boy was so sad and he learnt an important lesson. He realised that it is better to be humble and share things, than to be selfish and have to face such a bad ending.
