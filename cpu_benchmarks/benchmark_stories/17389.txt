Lila and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in their room. But today, they are restless. They want to go outside and see the sun and the birds.
"Mama, can we go out?" Lila asks. She raises her hand to get Mama's attention.
"Not now, sweetie. Mama is busy. You have to wait a minute," Mama says. She is working on her laptop at the table.
"But Mama, we are bored. We want to play out," Ben says. He raises his voice to sound more serious.
"I know, honey. But you have to be patient. Mama has to finish this work. Then we can go out together," Mama says. She tries to smile at them.
Lila and Ben sigh. They look at their toys. They do not want to play with them anymore. They want to see something new. They look at the window. They see the sun and the birds. They want to join them.
They have an idea. They sneak out of their room. They go to the door. They try to open it. But it is locked. They need a key.
They look around. They see Mama's purse on the chair. They think the key is inside. They go to the purse. They open it. They find the key. They are happy.
They run to the door. They put the key in the lock. They turn it. They hear a click. They open the door. They run outside.
They feel the sun on their skin. They hear the birds in the air. They are free. They laugh and jump and run.
Mama hears them. She looks up from her laptop. She sees the empty room. She sees the open door. She sees the purse on the floor. She knows what happened.
She drops her laptop. She runs to the door. She sees Lila and Ben outside. She is angry and scared.
"Lila! Ben! Come back here right now!" she shouts. She goes after them.
Lila and Ben hear her. They stop. They turn around. They see Mama. She looks mad. They are sorry.
They run back to her. They hug her. They say sorry.
"Mama, we are sorry. We just wanted to play out," Lila says.
"Mama, we are sorry. We did not mean to make you worry," Ben says.
Mama hugs them back. She is glad they are safe. But she is also upset.
"You should not have done that. You could have got hurt. You could have got lost. You have to listen to Mama. You have to stay inside until Mama says you can go out," she says.
She takes them inside. She locks the door. She puts the key back in her purse. She takes them to their room. She tells them to stay there. She tells them they are in trouble.
Lila and Ben are sad. They know they did wrong. They sit on their bed. They look at their toys. They do not want to play with them anymore. They want to say sorry to Mama. They want to hug her. They want to make her happy.
