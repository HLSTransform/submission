Jill and Tom are friends. They like to play with books and crayons. One day, they find a big book with many pages. The pages have pictures of animals and plants.
"Look, Tom, a purple flower!" Jill says. She points to a page with a purple flower and a bee.
"That is pretty, Jill. Can I color it?" Tom asks. He picks up a yellow crayon.
"Okay, Tom. But be careful. Do not color outside the lines," Jill says. She gives him the page.
Tom starts to color the flower and the bee. He is happy. He likes to color.
"Tom, Tom, come here!" Jill calls. She has turned to another page. The page has a picture of a lion and a zebra.
"What is it, Jill?" Tom asks. He puts down the crayon and goes to Jill.
"Look, Tom, a lion and a zebra! They are big and strong. Do you know what they say?" Jill asks.
Tom shakes his head. He does not know.
"Let me tell you. The lion says 'roar' and the zebra says 'neigh'. Can you say that, Tom?" Jill says.
Tom tries to say that. He says "roar" and "neigh". He sounds funny. Jill laughs. Tom laughs too.
They have fun with the book. They learn new words and colors. They are happy friends.
