Once upon a time there was a friendly boy called Jack. He loved to do new and exciting things.
One day Jack was playing in his garden when he spotted a suit. It was a shiny, green and purple suit. Jack knew that if he wore the suit he could do something special.
So, he put on the suit and ran around the garden. Then he made a magical wish! He wished he could reverse!
Suddenly, Jack was spinning around and around until he was going backwards! He laughed and giggled as he moved backwards around the garden.
Soon it was time for Jack to go to bed so he took off his suit and put it back in its place. From that day on Jack had lots of fun using his special suit to reverse!
