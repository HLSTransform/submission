JOHN was a happy boy. He had a notebook and he liked to draw in it.
He was playing in the park one day, looking for something to catch. He saw a smooth stone in the grass and he ran over to pick it up.
John held the stone in his hand, it felt so smooth. He put it in his notebook.
John smiled and continued to look for something else to catch. Soon he found a pretty butterfly. He ran up and tried to catch it but it flew away. John laughed and ran around the park, looking for more things to catch.
The day ended and John went home happy. He opened up his notebook and looked at the smooth stone he had found. He was glad he could catch a piece of the park and keep it forever.
