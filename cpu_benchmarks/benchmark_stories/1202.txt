Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily was walking in the park when she saw a big, scary dog. Lily was very scared and her voice became very quiet. 
Suddenly, a kind lady appeared and asked Lily what was wrong. Lily told her about the big, scary dog and the lady gently asked Lily if she wanted to pet the dog. Lily was very fearful but she wanted to be brave, so she slowly walked up to the dog and petted it.
Afterwards, the kind lady asked Lily if she felt better. Lily nodded and shrugged her shoulders. She was still a little scared but she was proud of herself for being brave. The kind lady smiled and said, "Sometimes, we have to face our fears to feel better." Lily smiled back and said, "Thank you for helping me."
