Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden and look for animals. One day, she found a frog by the pond. The frog was green and slimy, but Lily thought it was cute.
Lily decided to pick up the frog and play with it. She covered the frog with her hands and giggled as it jumped around. But then, Lily accidentally dropped the frog and it landed on a sharp rock. The frog got hurt and Lily felt very sad.
She tried to help the frog, but it was too late. The frog was not moving anymore. Lily realized that she had hurt the frog and felt disgusting. She buried the frog in the garden and promised to never hurt another animal again.
