Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mary. Mary was three years old and she loved exploring nature. One day, she went outside to explore her backyard. What she saw was the most beautiful sight! There was a field of pale grass that seemed to go on forever. When she saw it, she was filled with happiness, and she ran out to explore.
As she ran, she felt the soft blades of grass between her toes. She laughed and skipped and twirled through the grass, feeling so much joy. Time passed quickly, and before she knew it, the sun was setting. Mary sighed and said goodbye to the grass, not wanting to leave.
The days went by, but Mary could still feel the grass tickling her toes. She missed the soft feeling and the pale color. She wanted to go back to the field of grass, and feel the same joy again.
So, every night, Mary wished for just one more chance at exploring the field of grass. A chance to feel the soft blades beneath her toes and to smile at the beauty of it all. Her wish was the same every night, until finally the stars shined brightly down on the field one night. And with that, Mary hurried out to explore again.
