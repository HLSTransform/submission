Once there were two tiny twins. They loved to play together and always wanted to finish the same things. One day, the twins found a big hill. They wanted to climb it together, but it was very tall. The twins were patient and waited for their turn. Soon, one of the twins reached the top of the hill. The other twin was so proud, and was thrilled to finish it together. They were so happy that they had done it! For the rest of the day, the twins played together and had lots of fun. They were patient and waited for each other, just like they did when climbing the hill. They finished many fun activities together. It was a great day!
