Once upon a time, there was a compassionate girl named Lily. She lived in a small house near a river. Every day, she played by the river with her friends.
One day, Lily saw a little bird that could not fly. The bird wanted to reach its nest on a tree by the river. Lily wanted to help the bird. She had a big heart and always cared for others.
Lily and her friends made a plan. They found a long stick and used it to lift the bird up. The bird reached its nest and was very happy. Lily and her friends felt good for helping the little bird. They played by the river and had a fun day.
