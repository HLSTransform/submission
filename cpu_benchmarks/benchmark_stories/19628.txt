Monkey was embarrassed. He saw the stone on the path and he wanted to kick it. He stepped up and kicked the stone, but it didn't go very far. He tried again, but still the stone did not move. Monkey huffed, feeling embarrassed again. He asked his friend Cow to help and together they kicked the stone. The stone flew up! Monkey and Cow cheered loudly and laughed.
