Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to whistle. He would whistle all day long, while he played with his toys and even while he ate his snacks. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the barber. The barber was a kind man who had a big chair that went up and down. Timmy sat in the chair and the barber cut his hair. When the haircut was done, Timmy looked in the mirror and saw that he looked very different. He felt happy and proud of his new haircut. As they walked home, the sky started to get dark. Timmy held his mom's hand tightly as they walked back home, still whistling his favorite tune.
