Once there was a fisherman. He was out fishing in his boat one day. The wind was strong and the water was bumpy. The fisherman wanted to be safe, so he stopped the boat. Suddenly, he heard something in the water. He ran to the side and looked over. He saw a small duck, swimming around. The fisherman smiled and the duck came right up to the boat. He petted it's soft feathers and the duck chirped happily. The fisherman felt safe in the boat with the duck, so he stopped and enjoyed the moment. After a few minutes, the duck swam away. The fisherman waved goodbye and carried on fishing. He felt safe and happy.
