Mike and his mom were at the grocery store. Mike wanted a toy he saw on display. His mom said no. She told him that he had to wait for his birthday. Mike was very disappointed and angry. 
He went outside and saw a yellow taxi. He loved the bright color. He asked his mom if they could get a ride in the taxi. His mom said no. She said that getting a taxi was too expensive. 
Mike was very sad. He wanted a comfortable ride in the bright yellow taxi. He stood there looking at it while his mom finished her shopping. Once she was done, she hugged Mike and said that they were able to take a taxi home. 
Mike was delighted! He jumped and cheered as they got into the taxi. He felt very comfortable and special. He knew that his mom always looked out for him and he was grateful. 
The taxi driver was very friendly. He smiled at Mike and asked him how old he was. Mike proudly told him he was three! Mike smiled all the way home.
