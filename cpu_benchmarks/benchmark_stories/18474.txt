Yesterday, Timmy went to the park. He had fun playing on the swings and the slide. After a while, he saw a ball on the ground. He picked it up and started playing with it. Suddenly, a boy came over and took the ball from Timmy. He stole it!
Timmy was sad and went back home. When he got there, his room was messy. He saw toys on the floor and clothes on the bed. He knew he had to clean up. So, he started picking up the toys and putting them away. After a while, his room was clean again.
Even though someone stole his ball, Timmy felt better after cleaning up his messy room.
