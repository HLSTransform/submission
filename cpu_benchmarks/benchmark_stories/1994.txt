Once there was a bunny called Fred. He was very happy and always bouncing around his garden. He would jump high and low, left and right. One day he noticed something special in the garden. It was a colourful kite! Fred was so excited. He wanted to touch it and so he jumped up to the kite. He felt the fabric and the strings of the kite and it felt so nice.
Fred wanted to make the kite fly. He ran around the garden as fast as he could, bouncing and waving his arms around. Before long, the kite rose up into the air! Fred leapt and leapt in excitement, watching as the kite flew higher and higher.
When the kite eventually came back down, Fred was so happy. He jumped up and grabbed it, feeling the soft fabric in his hands. His friends the birds and the bees came to look and admire the colourful kite. It was a wonderful day and Fred was so proud that his hard work had paid off.
