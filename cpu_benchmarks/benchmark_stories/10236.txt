Once upon a time, a little boy named Tim found a hidden box in his yard. He opened the box and saw many tools inside. Tim was very happy and wanted to show his friend, Sam.
Tim ran to Sam's house and said, "Look, I found a hidden box with tools!" Sam looked at the tools and wanted to play with them. But Tim said, "No, they are mine. You can't play with them." Sam was sad and went back to his house.
Later, Tim felt bad and wanted to share his tools with Sam. He went to Sam's house and said, "I'm sorry. Let's play with the tools together." Sam was happy, and they played with the tools all day long. They learned that sharing is fun and that it's important to be a good friend.
