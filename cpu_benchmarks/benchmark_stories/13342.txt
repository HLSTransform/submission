Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a red dress and loved to draw with her red crayon. One day, she went to school and forgot her eraser. 
When she got to class, her friend Timmy saw that she didn't have an eraser. "Lily, you need an eraser to fix your mistakes," Timmy said. "I know, but I forgot it at home," Lily replied. 
Timmy thought for a moment and then said, "I have an extra eraser. I can set it on your desk for you." Lily was very happy and said, "Thank you, Timmy! You're a good friend." 
And from that day on, Lily and Timmy were the best of friends. They would draw together and always help each other out when they needed something. The end.
