Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars every day. One day, he saw a big race happening in the park. Timmy wanted to join the race, but he didn't have a license.
Timmy asked his friend, "How do I get a license to race my car?" His friend said, "You have to win a race to get a license." Timmy was excited and decided to join the race.
On the day of the race, Timmy's car was very dirty. His friend said, "You need to clean your car before the race." Timmy quickly washed his car and joined the race. He drove his car very fast and won the race.
Timmy was so happy that he won the race and got his license. From that day on, Timmy raced his car every day in the park with his friends.
