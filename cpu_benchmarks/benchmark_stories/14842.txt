Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Sunny. Sunny loved to fly high up in the sky and feel the wind in her feathers. She would soar over the trees and the houses, looking for tasty seeds to eat.
One day, while Sunny was flying, she saw some police cars with flashing lights and loud sirens. They were chasing a bad guy who had stolen some money. Sunny felt scared and wanted to fly away, but she knew she had to be brave and help the police.
Sunny flew down to the street and saw the bad guy running away. She flew after him, pecking him with her sharp beak. The bad guy was caught by the police, and Sunny felt proud of herself for helping. From that day on, she knew that being brave and helpful was better than being selfish and only thinking of herself.
