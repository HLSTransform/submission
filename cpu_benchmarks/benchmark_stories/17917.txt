Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Emma. She liked to play outside with her friends. One day, Emma decided to play inside. She grabbed a big bottle of spray and headed for the floor.
Emma began to spray the floor in unusual ways. She made swirls and zig zags. She even wrote her name in the floor! Then, Emma stepped back and laughed as she looked at her amazing art.
Suddenly, there was a loud noise. Emma's dad had come home. He was not happy at all with the mess on the floor. He shook his head and said it was time to clean up.
So, Emma had to spray the floor one more time, but this time she sprayed water. She had to use the mop to make the floor shine like new. Finally, the floor was clean and back to normal.
Emma had learned her lesson: it was fun to play with spray, but she had to be careful and not make a mess.
