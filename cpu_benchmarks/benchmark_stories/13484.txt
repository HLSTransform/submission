Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a charming smile and loved to play with her toys. One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. She saw a big slide and wanted to go down it, but it was too high for her. 
Suddenly, she heard a loud scream coming from the other side of the park. Lily got scared and wanted to go home, but her mommy told her to stay quiet and not be afraid. They walked towards the scream and saw a little boy who had lost his ball. 
Lily's mommy helped the boy find his ball and they all became friends. They played together and had a lot of fun. Lily was happy that she didn't have to be scared anymore and that she made a new friend.
