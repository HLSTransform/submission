Lila and Tom are happy. They like to play with their toys and books. They have a big port in their room. It is a big box with a hole. They can go inside and pretend it is a ship or a house.
One day, Lila has an idea. She finds a big cloth in the closet. She says to Tom, "Let's wrap the port with this cloth. It will be a secret port. No one can see us inside."
Tom likes the idea. He helps Lila wrap the port with the cloth. They tuck the ends under the box. They make sure there is a gap for the hole. They crawl inside the port. It is dark and cozy.
They giggle and whisper. They tell each other stories and jokes. They play with their toys and books. They have fun in their secret port.
Mom comes to check on them. She sees the wrapped port in their room. She smiles. She knows they are inside. She says, "Lila, Tom, are you in there?"
Lila and Tom hear Mom. They say, "Yes, Mom, we are in the port. It is our secret port. Do you want to come in?"
Mom says, "Sure, I would love to come in. Can I fit in the hole?"
Lila and Tom say, "Yes, Mom, you can fit in the hole. Come in, come in."
Mom crawls in the hole. She joins Lila and Tom in the port. They hug and kiss. They are happy. They have a secret port.
