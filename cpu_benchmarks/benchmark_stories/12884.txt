Once there was a lucky animal who lived in the forest, far away from humans. Every morning the animal woke up and roared, the sound echoing through the beautiful trees.
One day, a little girl stumbled upon the forest and heard the powerful roar. She was so curious and wanted to see what made such a sound. Walking carefully on a path, she spotted the animal. It was a tiger! The tiger looked at the little girl, and she to it. She ran towards it, shouting out of excitement.
The tiger was taken aback. It waved its paw, warning her to stay away. But the girl kept moving closer. Just as she was about to reach it, the tiger roared so loudly that the little girl stumbled back, startled.
She stayed put, waiting for the tiger to become calm. After some time, the tiger stepped forward with a calm look in its eyes. Then it opened its mouth and let out a much quieter roar. The little girl was relieved and very lucky that nothing bad had happened. From that day onwards, they were the best of friends. Roaring together in the beautiful forest.
