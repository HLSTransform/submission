Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the water and take baths. Every time she finished, her mommy would give her a towel to dry off. One day, Lily decided to hide the towel instead of putting it away in the store. 
When her mommy asked for the towel, Lily couldn't find it. Her mommy got impatient and asked why Lily didn't put it away in the store. Lily felt bad and realized that hiding things wasn't a good idea. 
Her mommy hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. We all make mistakes. But it's important to be responsible and put things away where they belong so we can find them when we need them." Lily promised to always put things away in the store from then on. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to be responsible and put things away where they belong, so we don't lose them and make others upset.
