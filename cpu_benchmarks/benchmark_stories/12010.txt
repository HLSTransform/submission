Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her teddy bear. One night, Lily went to bed and started to dream. In her dream, she was baking cookies in the oven with her teddy bear.
Suddenly, the oven started to make a bad smell. Lily's teddy bear said, "Oh no, something is burning!" Lily quickly opened the oven and saw that the cookies were burnt. She felt sad but her teddy bear said, "Don't worry, we can try again tomorrow."
The next day, Lily woke up and went to the kitchen with her teddy bear. They tried again and this time, the cookies turned out perfect. Lily was so happy and said, "I had a dream about this last night!" Her teddy bear smiled and said, "Dreams can come true."
