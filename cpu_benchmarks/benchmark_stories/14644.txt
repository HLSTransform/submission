Once there were two friends, Tommy and Sally. One day Tommy said to Sally "Let's go for a spin!". So they both ran outside and Tommy spun and spun until he was very dizzy. 
Then Sally said "Let's make a dove!". So Tommy grabbed a stick and Sally grabbed some leaves. Together they carefully made a dove. It was very nice. 
Tommy said, "Let's spin the dove!" so they both held the dove tight and began to spin around in circles. They spun and spun until they were very dizzy. 
When they stopped, the dove flew into the air and Tommy and Sally cheered. They watched it until it was out of sight. Then they said goodbye and went home. It was a nice day!
