Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy decided to create something special. He wanted to make a big tower out of his toy blocks. He worked hard and finally, he made a tall tower!
Timmy was so happy with his creation, but then he saw something strange. There was a pale tube on the ground near his tower. Timmy didn't know what it was, but he decided to play with it. He put the tube in his mouth and accidentally swallowed it.
Timmy started to feel sick and went to the hospital. The doctors couldn't save him because the tube was poisonous. Timmy's parents were so sad because they lost their little boy. They wished they could go back in time and stop Timmy from playing with the tube.
