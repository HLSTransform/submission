Once there was a boy named John who liked to make things out of wood. He had a big pile of original wood in his room. He had a saw and some nails, so he could make anything he wanted.
John wanted to make a chair. He used the saw to cut the pieces of wood, and then he nailed them together. It took a long time, but finally it was done. He had a chair!
John was so proud of his chair. It looked better than any chair he had ever seen. He listed it in the window, and everyone who passed by noticed it. They all said it was the most beautiful chair they had ever seen.
John had made something special. He had taken one piece of original wood and made it into something amazing. And he was very proud of it.
