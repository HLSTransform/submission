John was so excited because he finally had his very own kitchen! It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen with the bright porch, shiny cupboards and the big, brown table. He ran up to it and was ready to explore his brand new kitchen.
As he was looking around he heard a familiar voice coming from the kitchen.
"John! Is that you?" It was his grandma!
John was so happy that he immediately ran towards the kitchen to give her a big, tight hug.
"I recognize you, Grandma, it's me John!" he shouted, delighted.
Grandma beamed with joy.
"Yes, it's me, John," she said. "Let's go explore your kitchen together."
John couldn't wait to show her around and proudly opened the drawers and cupboards of his beautiful new kitchen to show Grandma all the cool stuff he had. Grandma was so impressed with his kitchen and she hugged John with pride.
"You made me so proud, John!" she said with a big smile on her face.
John was so happy that he had afixed a big, brown bow to the kitchen door, as a sign of his joy.
From that day, John loved spending time with his Grandma in his gorgeous new kitchen.
