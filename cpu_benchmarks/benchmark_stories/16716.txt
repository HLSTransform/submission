Tom and Mia are playing hide and seek in the house. Tom is the seeker and Mia is the hider. Mia runs to the living room and looks for a good spot. She sees a big sofa with a lot of pillows. She thinks it is a good place to hide. She crawls under the sofa and pulls a pillow over her head. She tries to be very quiet and still.
Tom counts to ten and then says, "Ready or not, here I come!" He walks around the house and looks for Mia. He checks the kitchen, the bathroom, the bedroom, but he cannot find her. He goes to the living room and sees the sofa. He thinks Mia might be hiding there. He walks over to the sofa and bends down. He sees a small bump under the sofa. He thinks it is Mia.
He says, "I found you, Mia! Come out, come out!" He pulls the pillow away and sees Mia's face. Mia blinks and smiles. She says, "You are good at finding, Tom! How did you know I was here?" Tom says, "I saw your hair sticking out from the pillow. And I heard you breathe. You should hide better next time." Mia says, "OK, I will. But now it is your turn to hide. I will count to ten and then I will find you." Tom says, "OK, OK. But don't peek!" He gets up and runs to find a new spot.
He looks for a place where Mia will not find him. He sees a closet with a lot of clothes and furniture. He thinks it is a good place to hide. He opens the door and goes inside. He pushes some clothes and furniture aside and makes a small space for himself. He closes the door and sits down. He feels tight and hot, but he does not mind. He thinks Mia will never find him here. He waits for Mia to come and look for him. He hopes she will not take too long. He starts to feel bored and sleepy. He yawns and closes his eyes. He falls asleep.
