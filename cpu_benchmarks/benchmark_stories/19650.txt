One day, there was a girl named Sarah. She was three years old and loved to paint. She had a box of special crayons and she used them to paint all sorts of great drawings.
To paint, Sarah needed to behave and focus. She sat very still, holding the crayons in her hands. She tried to make her paintings as perfect as she could.
Sarah loved the way the crayons looked. They were all different colors and so much fun to play with! She made many great drawings. She made colorful trees and animals, and sometimes even abstract pictures. Sarah was very proud of her artwork.
At the end of the day, Sarah put all the crayons back in the box. She was happy with how she had behaved and with the beautiful paintings she had made.
