Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very scared of monsters. He thought monsters would come and get him at night. But one day, Timmy decided he was brave enough to face his fear. 
He went to his room and looked under his bed. He saw a monster! But the monster was not scary at all. It was just a toy monster that Timmy had forgotten about. Timmy was so happy that he finished his fear. 
Timmy's sister, Sally, came into the room and saw the monster. She wanted to play with it, but Timmy said no. Sally thought Timmy was being selfish. But Timmy explained that he was not being selfish, he just wanted to keep the monster for himself. Sally understood and they played together with other toys instead.
