Once there was a little girl called Ellie. She was three years old and she was very proud. One day, she was in the garden carrying something. It was a long and thin screen! She was very proud of it and she was happy to carry it because she knew it was important. 
She carried it all the way to her house and wanted to show it to her mom. Her mom was very proud of Ellie and she said “You did a great job carrying that screen! You must have used your best strength!” Ellie was very happy to hear that her mom was proud of her. 
After that, she carried the screen inside the house. She was very careful not to drop it and she put it safely on the floor. She was so proud of herself for managing to carry the screen all the way home. 
And that was the story of Ellie and her proud carry of the screen!
