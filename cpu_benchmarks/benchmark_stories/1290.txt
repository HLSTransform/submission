Once upon a time there was a bald infant. He was only three years old.
Every day, the bald infant would do lots of fun things. He would go outside and play tag with his friends. He would look for bugs and splash in puddles.
One day, the bald infant was walking in the park when he discovered a big playground. He thought to himself, "I want to do something new!"
So the bold infant did something he had never done before. He climbed up the ladder to the top of the slide. He slid down and squealed with delight.
From then on, the bald infant would do this every day. He turned it into a fun game. He would climb up and slide down until the day was done.
The bald infant soon became known as the king of the slide. Everyone knew that he was the best at it - even the grown-ups!
The bald infant was very proud of what he could do. And thatâ€™s the story of the bald infant and his special adventure.
