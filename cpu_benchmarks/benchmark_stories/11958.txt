Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and chase butterflies. One day, she found a yellow flower and picked it. But when she got home, she realized she had accidentally plucked the whole plant, including the roots.
Feeling bad, Lily went back to the garden and put the flower back in the ground. She said sorry to the plant and asked it to forgive her. The plant forgave her and soon grew bigger and stronger than ever before.
As Lily was walking back home, she stumbled upon a skull lying on the ground. She was scared and didn't know what to do. But then she remembered what her mom had told her about forgiveness. She forgave the skull for scaring her and continued on her way home, happy to have learned a valuable lesson about forgiveness.
