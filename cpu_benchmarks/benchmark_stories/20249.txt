Once upon a time, there was a fat cat named Kitty. Kitty liked to play with her favorite toy, a small comb. One day, she lost her comb in the big park.
Kitty met a nice dog named Buddy. "Buddy, can you help me find my comb?" Kitty asked. Buddy said, "Yes, I can help you." So, Kitty and Buddy looked for the comb in the park.
After a while, they found the comb under a big tree. Kitty was very happy. She said, "Thank you, Buddy!" Then, Kitty and Buddy returned home to play together with the comb. And they became best friends.
