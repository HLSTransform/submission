Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Fin. Fin lived in the big sea with his family. They had a small home near some rocks. One day, Fin saw a big fish and wanted to become big like it.
Fin asked his mom, "Mom, how can I become big like that fish?" His mom said, "Fin, you will become big when you grow up. Just eat your food and play with your friends."
But Fin didn't want to wait. He swam far away from his home to find a way to become big. He saw a big, dark cave and went inside. In the cave, he found a magic rock that could make him big.
Fin touched the rock and said, "I want to become big now!" Suddenly, he became very big. He was happy, but he didn't know that the rock was bad. As he swam back home, he was so big that he broke his family's home by accident. His family was sad and had no place to live. Fin wished he had listened to his mom and waited to become big.
