Once upon a time, there was a naughty bear. The bear loved to play outside in the woods. One day, the naughty bear was playing near a campfire. He went a little too close and suddenly, the bear's fur was covered in ash. The bear got scared and he quickly scattered away.
The bear ran very fast through the woods. He ran past trees and bushes, dodging them as he went. Every time he ran, some of the ash from his fur scattered behind him.
The naughty bear kept running until he reached his home. He stopped to take a rest and looked back. He saw that the ash had scattered all over the place. He was very glad he made it home.
The bear decided to never go so close to a campfire again. He knew it was naughty to get his fur covered in ash!
