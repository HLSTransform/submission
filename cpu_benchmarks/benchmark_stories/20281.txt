Once upon a time, there was a nation with many people. In this nation, everyone was slow. They did not like to move fast. One day, a little boy named Tom wanted to change this. He thought, "I will make my nation rise and be fast!"
Tom went to his friend, Sue. He said, "I want to make our nation rise and be fast! Will you help me?" Sue said, "Yes, I will help you, Tom!" They went to the park to practice running. They ran and ran, and soon, they became faster.
More and more people saw Tom and Sue running in the park. They wanted to be fast too. So, they joined Tom and Sue. The nation started to rise and be fast. Everyone was happy because they were no longer slow. Tom and Sue had made their nation rise, and they all lived happily ever after.
