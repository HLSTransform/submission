Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. Jack loved to go for walks with his mom. One day, they went for a walk in the park. Jack's mom noticed that he didn't buckle his shoes properly. She said, "Jack, you need to improve how you buckle your shoes. It's important to keep them on your feet."
Jack tried to buckle his shoes again, but he couldn't do it. He said, "Mom, can you help me?" His mom said, "Of course, Jack. I'll show you how to do it properly." After his mom helped him, Jack felt proud of himself. He said, "I did it! I improved how I buckle my shoes!"
As they continued their walk, Jack saw a little girl crying. He asked her, "Why are you crying?" The little girl said, "I lost my toy." Jack said, "Don't cry. I'll help you find it." They searched together and eventually found the toy. The little girl said, "Thank you, Jack. You're not selfish like some other kids." Jack felt happy that he could help someone else.
