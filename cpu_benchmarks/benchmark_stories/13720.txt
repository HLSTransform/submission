Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play on his computer all day long. He would sit and gaze at the screen for hours and hours. 
One day, Timmy spilled his juice all over his computer. The computer stopped working and Timmy was very sad. He tried to fix it, but it was too dry. 
Timmy's mom told him that he couldn't play on his computer anymore until it was fixed. Timmy was very upset and didn't know what to do. He wanted to play on his computer so badly. 
But then Timmy had an idea. He went outside to play with his friends instead. They played games and had fun together. Timmy realized that he didn't need his computer to have fun. He was happy playing with his friends.
