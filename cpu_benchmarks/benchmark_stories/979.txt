Once there was a boy named Jamie. He was very ordinary. He wanted to be different, so he decided to pay a visit to the harbor. 
When he arrived, Jamie saw lots of boats and birds. He was so excited! He paid a man some money, and the man gave him a boat. Then he sailed away.
Jamie sailed over the waves. He watched the birds and the other boats around him. He was so happy! He sailed for a long time, until it was time to go home. 
When Jamie arrived at the harbor, the man told him he had to pay for the boat. Jamie was so disappointed. He didn't have enough money to pay for it. 
But then a kind person stepped up and offered to pay. Jamie was so happy! He thanked the person and said goodbye. Then he went home, feeling very ordinary but grateful.
