Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lizzie. She was only three years old, but she was very clever. One day, Lizzie's mom took her to the grocery store. 
When they got to the store, Lizzie was very excited because she had never seen anything like it before. Lizzie saw a big pile of new apples. She wanted to pick one. 
Lizzie's mom told her to be careful. "Be sure to pick the one with a label that is sharp and new," Mom said. 
Lizzie touched each one of the apples until she found one that was sharp and had a bright new label on it. She grabbed it and smiled. 
The moral of this story is that it is important to take care and be careful when making decisions. When you make sure that something is sharp and new, you can trust that it is the best choice.
