Once there was a little boy. His name was Stanley and he was three years old. Stanley loved to go outside and play. One day he wanted to take his toy motor out for a ride. He gathered up his toy motor and went to the garden. 
When Stanley put his motor down in the garden, he saw that it was broken! He tried to work on it but he didn’t know how. He was so sad and he felt so hungry because he had spent so muct time trying to fix the motor. 
He looked around but there was nobody to help him. Just then he heard a voice. “Do you need help?”, it said. Stanley had never seen this person before but the voice was so kind. He looked up and saw a friendly lady. 
The lady showed Stanley how to fix his motor and he was so happy! He thanked the lady for her help and she smiled at him. They said goodbye and Stanley quickly rode his motor around the garden. He was so glad his motor was working again. He was happy and relieved.
