Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars and trucks. One day, Timmy's dad took him to the park to ride his bike. Timmy's bike had gears that made it go faster.
Timmy's dad asked him if he wanted to ride on the bike path. Timmy said yes and they rode on the clear path. Timmy loved the feeling of the wind in his hair as they rode faster and faster. 
After a while, Timmy's legs got tired and they stopped to take a break. Timmy's dad asked him if he wanted a snack and Timmy said yes. They sat on a bench and ate some crackers together. Timmy was happy to spend time with his dad and ride his bike with gears on the clear path.
