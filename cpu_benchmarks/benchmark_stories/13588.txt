Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his toy car. One day, Timmy's mommy asked him to help her wrap a present for his grandma. Timmy was excited to help his mommy.
"Can I help wrap the present, mommy?" Timmy asked.
"Of course, Timmy. Can you please get the wrapping paper from the closet?" his mommy replied.
Timmy ran to the closet and found the wrapping paper hidden behind some boxes. He brought it to his mommy and they started to wrap the present together. While they were wrapping, Timmy's mommy asked him if he wanted to record a message for his grandma.
"I want to record a message for grandma!" Timmy exclaimed.
So, his mommy took out her phone and Timmy recorded a message saying, "I love you, grandma!" They finished wrapping the present and Timmy was so happy to help his mommy.
