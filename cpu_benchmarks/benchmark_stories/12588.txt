Lila was a busy daughter. She liked to help her mom with many things. She helped her mom to cook, to clean, to water the plants, and to feed the cat. She also liked to play with her toys, to read her books, and to sing her songs.
One day, her mom said, "Lila, today we are going to gather some apples from the tree. Do you want to come with me?"
Lila nodded and smiled. She loved apples. They were red and sweet and crunchy. She put on her hat and her shoes and followed her mom to the backyard. There was a big apple tree with many apples on it.
Lila and her mom each took a basket and started to pick the apples. Some apples were high and some were low. Some apples were big and some were small. Lila reached for the apples that were low and small. She put them in her basket carefully. She did not want to drop them or bruise them.
"Look, mom, I have gathered many apples!" Lila said proudly. She showed her basket to her mom.
"Good job, Lila! You are a great helper!" her mom said. She hugged Lila and kissed her cheek. "Let's go inside and wash the apples. Then we can make some apple pie. Do you like apple pie?"
Lila nodded and smiled. She loved apple pie. It was warm and soft and yummy. She held her mom's hand and walked to the house. She was a happy daughter.
