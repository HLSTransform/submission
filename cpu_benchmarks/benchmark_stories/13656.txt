Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They had a big blanket and some toys. They wanted to have a picnic on the grass.
"Let's spread the blanket on the ground," Tom said. He took one corner of the blanket and pulled it.
"OK, I'll help you," Lily said. She took another corner and pulled it too. They spread the blanket on the ground and smoothed it with their hands.
They put their toys on the blanket and sat down. They had some sandwiches, some apples and some juice. They ate and drank and talked.
"This is a fine day," Lily said. She looked at the sky and saw some clouds. "Look, that cloud looks like a bunny."
Tom looked too. He saw the cloud and smiled. "You're right, it does. And that one looks like a car."
They pointed at the clouds and made up stories about them. They had fun and laughed. They did not see the time pass. They were happy.
