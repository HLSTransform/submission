Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and stuffed animals. One day, her mom asked her if she wanted to learn math. Lily didn't understand what math was, but her mom said it was like counting and adding numbers.
Lily's mom taught her how to count and add with blocks and toys. Lily loved it and wanted to learn more. Her mom was so proud of her and told her she could be famous one day for being so good at math.
But one day, Lily got sick and had to go to the hospital. She didn't like it there and wanted to go home. Her mom tried to make her feel better by playing games and doing math problems, but Lily didn't want to anymore.
A few days later, Lily's mom got some bad news. Lily was very sick and wasn't going to get better. Lily didn't understand what was happening, but her mom told her she was going to be okay and that she loved her very much. Lily closed her eyes and went to sleep forever. Her mom was so sad and wished Lily could have become famous for her love of math.
