There was a fox who was always very hungry. One day, he saw an open window in the village. He thought it would be a good idea to steal some food. So he jumped in and saw a beautiful bottle of perfume. He was very excited and took it away very quickly.
When he left, he ran very fast and eventually made it back to his den. When he opened the bottle, he realised it smelled very nice and he was very happy. But then something loud happened.
The villagers had heard that their perfume was stolen and they were very angry. They chased after the fox and they eventually found him at his den. The fox was scared and he quickly gave back the bottle, apologising for stealing it.
The villagers were happy that he was honest and they went back home. From then on, the fox was much more careful about what he stole. He realised that stealing was wrong and he never did it again.
