Once there was a little girl named Abby. She was calm and liked to play outside. One day, Abby went for a walk in the park with her mom. 
Mom said, "Let's catch some butterflies!"
Abby loved catching butterflies. She chased some and tried to catch them with her hands. She had lots of fun.
 
After a while, Abby said, "Let's get some sugar!"
Mom smiled and said, "Ok, let's go to the store and get some sugar."
 
So Abby and Mom went to the store and found the sugar. Abby was so excited to get some sugar that she could barely stay calm. Mom bought the sugar and they went home happy. 
The end.
