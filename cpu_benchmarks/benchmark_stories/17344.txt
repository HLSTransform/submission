Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play with their toys in their room. But they do not like to clean up. Their room is very messy. There are cars, blocks, books, and dolls everywhere.
One day, Mom says, "Boys, you have to clean your room. It is too messy. If you do not clean it, you cannot go to the park later." Tom and Sam nod. They do not want to miss the park. They love the swings, the slide, and the sandbox.
But they do not really clean their room. They just hide their toys under the bed, in the closet, and behind the curtains. They think Mom will not see them. They say, "We are done, Mom. Can we go to the park now?" Mom nods. She does not check their room. She thinks they did a good job.
They go to the park and have fun. They swing, slide, and dig. They forget about their messy room. They are happy.
But when they come back home, they hear a loud sound. They run to their room. They see their toys all over the floor. The bed, the closet, and the curtains are broken. They see a big dog in their room. The dog is chewing on their toys. He is wagging his tail. He thinks he found a treasure.
Mom comes after them. She sees the mess. She is very angry. She says, "Boys, what did you do? You did not clean your room. You lied to me. You made a bigger mess. And you let the dog in. He is not our dog. He is the neighbor's dog. He ran away from his yard. How did he get in your room?"
Tom and Sam look at each other. They do not know what to say. They are very sorry. They wish they had cleaned their room. They nod. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We will clean our room. We will tell the truth. We will be good boys." Mom nods. She says, "You better do that. And you have to say sorry to the neighbor. And you have to give back his dog. And you have to help me fix the bed, the closet, and the curtains. And you have to go to bed early. No more park for you today."
Tom and Sam nod. They do not like their punishment. But they know they deserve it. They learned their lesson. They will not be messy and lie again. They hope Mom will forgive them. They hope the dog will not come back. They hope their toys are not ruined. They hope the neighbor is not mad. They hope they can go to the park tomorrow.
