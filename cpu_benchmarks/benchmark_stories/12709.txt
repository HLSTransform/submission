Mommy and Bobby were walking down the icy street. Bobby looked up at his mommy and said, "Mommy, can I reach the goat?"
Mommy smiled and said, "No, Bobby, the goat is too far away for you to reach."
Bobby pointed down the street and said, "But Mommy, there is a goat over there!" 
Mommy looked down the street and said, "Yes, Bobby, but look how slippery the road is. We will have to go around and take the longer route to reach it."
Bobby beamed with delight. The two of them started walking down the icy street. With each step, Bobby was getting closer and closer to the goat.
Finally they reached the goat. Bobby looked so happy that he had reached the goat. He petted the goat and the goat even let him sit on his back.
