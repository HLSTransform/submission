Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very curious. She wanted to know more and more about the world around her. One day, while she was playing, she noticed a strange sound coming from behind a bush. She started to get restless, and she walked closer to investigate.
When she peeped behind the bush, she was amazed to reveal a little puppy hiding there! The puppy's ears were pricked up, and he looked up at the little girl with big eyes. 
The little girl asked the puppy, "What are you doing here?"
The puppy wagged his tail, and said, "I was lost and I needed a place to rest". 
The little girl was very kind and said, "You can stay with me!". 
The puppy felt so happy, and the two of them became best friends and played for the rest of the day.
