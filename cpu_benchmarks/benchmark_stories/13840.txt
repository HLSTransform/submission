One day, a big cat and a little mouse were in a race. The cat had a strong urge to win, so he ran very fast. The mouse was light and quick, so he could hurry too. They both wanted to be the best.
As they raced, the cat and the mouse saw a big hill. The cat thought he could climb it fast, but the mouse was scared. The cat started to climb up the hill, but the mouse stayed down. The cat said, "Hurry, little mouse! We need to finish the race!"
The mouse felt the urge to climb the hill, so he started to go up. He hurried and hurried, trying to catch up to the cat. At the top of the hill, the cat and the mouse saw a big, bright light. They both wanted to reach it first.
The cat and the mouse ran as fast as they could towards the light. The cat was ahead, but the mouse hurried and caught up. They both reached the light at the same time. They were both winners! The cat and the mouse were happy and became friends.
