Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They run, jump, slide and swing. They have fun.
"Look at me, Anna!" Ben says. He swings high and fast. He kicks his legs and smiles.
"I see you, Ben!" Anna says. She swings too, but not so high. She is tired. She wants to rest.
"Are you tired, Anna?" Ben asks. He stops swinging and jumps off. He runs to Anna.
"Yes, Ben. I am tired. My legs are tired. My eyes are tired." Anna says. She stops swinging and gets off. She rubs her eyes.
"Let's sit on the bench, Anna. We can rest." Ben says. He takes Anna's hand and leads her to the bench. They sit down and lean on each other.
"That's better, Ben. Thank you." Anna says. She yawns and closes her eyes.
"You're welcome, Anna. You're my friend." Ben says. He yawns and closes his eyes too.
They rest on the bench. They are happy. They are friends.
