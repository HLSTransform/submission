Once there was a little girl. She was patient and curious. One day she went outside to explore. She saw a squirrel hop across the grass. She watched it go up and down a tree. She felt excited that she saw the squirrel. 
The girl wanted to get closer to the squirrel, so she moved slowly and carefully. The squirrel knew she was coming and stayed still. The girl got close and they both looked at each other.
The girl felt happy and peaceful. She stayed still and watched the squirrel for a long time. When it was time to go home, she said goodbye and waved. She felt peaceful as she said goodbye. The squirrel waved back and hopped away. 
The girl was patient and grateful for getting to see the squirrel. She was happy to have seen the squirrel and she felt excited all the way home. Each time the girl thought of the squirrel she smiled.
