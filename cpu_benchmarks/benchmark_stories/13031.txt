Once there was a big, rough dog. He loved sticks. He often stole them from other dogs.
One day, the rough dog found a really big stick. He wanted it more than anything. So he decided to steal it.
He snuck up very quietly. He grabbed the stick in his mouth and ran off. But the other dogs saw him and they were very angry.
They chased after the rough dog. He ran as fast as he could, but the other dogs were too fast. The rough dog dropped the stick and they took it back. 
Still, he was happy he tried. He never gave up on getting his stick.
