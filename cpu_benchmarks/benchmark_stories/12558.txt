Tommy loved to watch the parade. He liked the big drums, the shiny cars, and the funny clowns. He wanted to be in the parade too. He asked his mom if he could join the parade. He said, "Mom, can I be in the parade? Please, please, please!"
His mom smiled and said, "Maybe, Tommy. But you have to be brave. The parade is very loud and long. You have to walk a lot and wave to the people. Are you sure you want to do that?"
Tommy nodded and said, "Yes, mom. I want to be brave. I want to be in the parade. I can walk and wave and smile. Please, mom, let me be in the parade."
His mom hugged him and said, "Okay, Tommy. You can be in the parade. But you have to stay with me and hold my hand. And you have to listen to the parade leader. He will tell you what to do and where to go. Do you understand?"
Tommy said, "Yes, mom. I understand. I will stay with you and hold your hand. I will listen to the parade leader. Thank you, mom. You are the best mom ever."
Tommy and his mom went to the parade. They wore matching hats and shirts. They joined a group of other kids and parents. They walked and waved and smiled. Tommy had so much fun. He felt very brave. He was in the parade. He was happy.
