Tim and Sam were two cows who lived on a farm. They liked to eat hay and drink water from the pond. They had a big barn where they slept at night. But Tim and Sam were not happy cows. They always complained about everything.
They complained that the hay was too dry or too wet. They complained that the water was too cold or too dirty. They complained that the barn was too dark or too noisy. They complained that the farmer was too mean or too lazy. They complained that the other animals were too friendly or too rude.
One day, Tim and Sam saw a big truck on the road. It had a sign that said "Fresh Hay and Water". Tim and Sam thought that the truck was going to a better farm. They wanted to go there too. They decided to escape from their farm and follow the truck.
They waited until the farmer was busy and then they ran to the fence. They pushed the gate with their horns and it opened. They ran to the road and saw the truck. They followed it as fast as they could. They did not look where they were going. They did not see the cars or the people or the signs.
Soon, they came to a big building. It had a sign that said "Slaughterhouse". Tim and Sam did not know what that meant. They thought it was a nice word. They saw the truck go inside the building. They followed it too. They did not see the knives or the hooks or the blood.
They went into a big room. It had a sign that said "Final Destination". Tim and Sam did not know what that meant. They thought it was a fun word. They saw the hay and the water in the room. They ran to them and started to eat and drink. They did not hear the doors close behind them. They did not see the men with the guns.
They were too busy complaining.
