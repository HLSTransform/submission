One night, Jack hopped out of bed and looked out of his window. He saw a twinkling star and he wanted to reach it. So he made plans and got his friends together, they all decided to find a way to reach the star. 
Jack and his friends hoped around the garden looking for a way to get high enough to reach the star. They hopped and jumped, but none of their efforts worked. 
Just then, they heard Jack’s mom telling them to come in. She said, “What are you crazy kids doing out at this time of night?”
Jack told her that they wanted to reach the star. His mom said with a smile, “The best way to reach your dreams is to take small steps at a time. Working hard and trying your best can make all your dreams come true.”
Jack and his friends understood what his mom was teaching them and thanked her. They went back to bed with happy hearts and cuddled up in their soft blankets which were star-patterned. Jack fell asleep and dreamt of a star.
