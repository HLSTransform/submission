Anna liked to play in the attic. She had many toys there, like dolls and cars and books. She also liked to look at the old things that her grandma and grandpa had. There were boxes and bags and trunks full of clothes and pictures and letters.
One day, Anna found a big hat in a trunk. It was red and fluffy and had a feather on it. She put it on her head and felt very fancy. She wanted to show it to her mom and dad. She ran to the stairs, but she did not see the loose board on the floor.
Anna stepped on the board and it moved. She lost her balance and fell down the stairs. She bumped her head and her knee and her elbow. She cried out loud. The hat flew off her head and landed on a lamp.
Mom and dad heard Anna's cry and ran to the attic. They saw her lying on the floor, with blood on her face and her clothes. They were very scared and worried. They picked her up and hugged her. They said, "Are you okay, Anna? What happened?"
Anna sobbed and said, "I found a hat and I wanted to show you, but I fell and it hurt. And I lost the hat. I'm sorry, mom and dad."
Mom and dad kissed her and said, "It's okay, Anna. We're not mad at you. We're glad you're not hurt too bad. We'll clean your wounds and put a band-aid on them. And we'll find the hat. It's a very pretty hat. You look very cheerful in it."
