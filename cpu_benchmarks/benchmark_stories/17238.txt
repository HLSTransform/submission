Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her backyard with her toys. One day, her dad decided to grill some hot dogs for lunch. The smell of the grill made Lily's tummy rumble.
"Yum, hot dogs!" Lily said.
But her little brother, Max, said, "I hate hot dogs. They're yucky."
Lily didn't want Max to ruin her lunch, so she said, "No, hot dogs are beautiful. You should try one."
Max tried a hot dog and said, "Mmm, this is good! I don't hate hot dogs anymore."
Lily was happy that she could share her lunch with her brother, and they both enjoyed their beautiful hot dogs together.
