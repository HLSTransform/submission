Ben and Lily like to play soccer with their friends. They have a yellow ball and two goals. They run and kick and laugh. They are happy.
One day, a new player comes to play with them. His name is Sam. He is big and fast. He wants the yellow ball. He runs to Ben and pushes him. Ben falls and hurts his knee. He cries.
"Hey, that is not nice!" Lily says to Sam. "You cannot push Ben. He is my friend. You have to share the ball."
Sam does not listen. He takes the yellow ball and runs to the goal. He kicks hard. But he kicks too hard. The ball flies over the goal and hits a tree. The tree is angry. It drops a big branch on Sam's head. Sam falls and hurts his head. He cries.
Ben and Lily run to Sam. They help him get up. They give him a hug. They are kind. They say, "Are you okay, Sam? We are sorry you got hurt. Do you want to play with us?"
Sam nods. He says, "I am sorry, too. I was mean to Ben. I did not share the ball. Can we be friends?"
Ben and Lily smile. They say, "Yes, we can be friends. Come on, let's play together. We can take turns with the ball."
They all play soccer with the yellow ball. They run and kick and laugh. They are happy.
