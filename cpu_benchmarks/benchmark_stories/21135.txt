Once upon a time, there was a thoughtful kid named Tim. Tim loved to help his friends and family. He was always ready to explain things to them.
One day, Tim's friend, Sam, was sad. Sam did not know how to tie his shoes. Tim saw Sam and wanted to help. Tim went to Sam and asked, "Do you need help?" Sam said, "Yes, please."
Tim sat down next to Sam and started to explain how to tie shoes. He said, "First, make an X with the laces. Then, pull them tight. Next, make a loop with one lace. Hold the loop and wrap the other lace around it. Finally, pull the second lace through the hole and pull tight." Sam tried it and was able to tie his shoes. Sam was so happy and thanked Tim for being a good friend.
