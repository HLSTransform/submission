Sam and Mia are playing in the park. They like to run and slide and swing. They see a big black truck with a picture of a rhinoceros on it. They are curious and want to see the rhinoceros.
"Look, Mia, a rhinoceros!" Sam says. "Let's go and say hello."
"OK, Sam, but be careful. Rhinoceroses are big and strong and have horns," Mia says.
They run to the truck and peek inside. They see a big black rhinoceros lying on the floor. He looks sad and tired. He has a chain around his neck.
"Hello, rhinoceros," Sam says. "Why are you in the truck? Do you want to play with us?"
The rhinoceros does not answer. He just sighs and closes his eyes.
"Maybe he is sick or hurt," Mia says. "We should help him."
She finds a pair of scissors on the ground and tries to cut the chain. Sam helps her. They are almost done when they hear a loud voice.
"Hey, you kids, get away from there!" the voice says. "That's my rhinoceros and he's not for playing. He's for the circus."
They look up and see a mean man with a whip and a hat. He is angry and runs to the truck.
"Uh-oh, we have to go," Sam says. "Come on, Mia, run!"
But it is too late. The mean man grabs them and throws them in the truck. He locks the door and drives away.
"Help, help!" Sam and Mia cry. "Let us out!"
But no one hears them. They are stuck in the truck with the rhinoceros. They are scared and sad. They wish they never saw the rhinoceros. They wish they stayed in the park. They don't know what will happen to them. The end.
