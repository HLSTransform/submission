Ben and Mia are playing in the park. They see a big dog with a long tail and a red collar. The dog is barking and running around. Ben and Mia like dogs, so they go to pet the dog.
"Hello, doggy!" Ben says. "You are so cute and fluffy!"
"Can we give you some water?" Mia asks. "You must be thirsty!"
They find a fountain and fill a cup with water. They bring the cup to the dog and hold it out. The dog sniffs the cup and then drinks the water. He wags his tail and licks Ben and Mia's faces.
"Thank you, kids!" a voice says. Ben and Mia look up and see a man with a hat and a badge. He is holding a leash. "You are very kind and helpful. This is my dog, Rex. He is a police dog. He helps me catch bad people who break the law."
"What is the law?" Ben asks.
"The law is a set of rules that everyone must follow to be good and safe," the man says. "For example, the law says you must not steal, or hurt, or lie."
"Oh, I see," Ben says. "We follow the law at home and at school. We share, and say sorry, and tell the truth."
"That's very good," the man says. "You are smart and good kids. Do you want to pet Rex some more?"
"Yes, please!" Mia says. She and Ben stroke Rex's fur and ears. Rex barks happily.
Suddenly, they hear a loud noise. They see a car speeding on the road. The car is ugly and dirty. It has a broken window and a dent. The man with the hat and the badge frowns.
"That's a bad car," he says. "The people in that car are breaking the law. They stole the car and they are driving too fast. They are dangerous. I have to stop them. Come on, Rex!"
He clips the leash to Rex's collar and runs to his own car. He turns on the siren and the lights. He drives after the bad car. Rex barks loudly.
"Wow!" Ben says. "That's so cool!"
"Be careful!" Mia says. "We hope you catch the bad people!"
Ben and Mia wave to the man and Rex as they zoom away. They hope they will see them again. They think Rex is the best dog ever. They go back to playing in the park. They follow the law and have fun.
