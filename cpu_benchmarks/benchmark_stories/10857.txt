Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sing and dance with her brown teddy bear. One day, Lily's mommy bought her a microphone so she could sing even louder. Lily was so happy! She practiced every day and sang her favorite songs.
One day, Lily's grandma came to visit. She traveled a long way to arrive at Lily's house. When Lily saw her grandma, she ran to give her a big hug. Lily's grandma was so proud of her singing and asked her to sing a song with the microphone. Lily was a little shy at first, but then she started to sing. Her voice was so beautiful that her grandma started to cry.
From that day on, Lily sang with her microphone every day. She loved to sing for her family and friends. And every time her grandma visited, she would bring her a new microphone to add to her collection. Lily was so grateful for her microphone and for her grandma's love.
