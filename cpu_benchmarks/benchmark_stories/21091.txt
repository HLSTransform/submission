One day, a little boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, went for a walk. The sky was dark, and it looked like it would rain soon. Tim and Spot were very patient as they walked, waiting for the rain to start.
They saw a skull on the ground. Tim picked it up and said, "Look, Spot! A skull!" Spot barked and wagged his tail. They both thought it was very cool. They decided to take it home with them.
As they walked, it started to rain. Tim and Spot ran home as fast as they could. They got wet, but they didn't mind. They were happy they found the skull. When they got home, they showed the skull to Tim's mom. She said, "Wow, what a find!" Tim and Spot smiled and knew they had a fun adventure.
