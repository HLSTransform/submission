Once upon a time, there was a big red jeep. It had four big wheels and a loud horn. The jeep believed it was the best car in the town. All the other cars were envious of how cool the jeep looked.
One sunny day, the jeep saw a small blue car. The blue car was sad because it did not look as cool as the jeep. The jeep wanted to help the blue car feel better. The jeep had an idea and told the blue car to wait for a surprise.
The next day, the jeep came back with a big red bow for the blue car. The blue car was so happy and now looked very cool. All the other cars were envious of the blue car too. The jeep and the blue car became best friends and drove around the town together, sharing their coolness with everyone.
