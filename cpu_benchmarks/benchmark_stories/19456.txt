John and his mom were in an elevator going up to the top of a tall building. John was so excited he couldn't contain his excitement, so he started to laugh.
John's mom asked him why he was laughing and he said "I'm so happy to be going up in an elevator to the top of the building!".
His mom laughed and said, "That's a silly reason to be happy, John!".
John was a bit confused, but he kept laughing because he was so happy. Then, an ignorant man stepped into the elevator, he looked at John and his mom and said, "Why are you two laughing for no reason?".
John and his mom laughed even harder because of how ignorant the man was. The man said, "What's so funny?".
John's mom said, "We laughed because we were happy, not because we were being silly!"
John and his mom were laughing so much in the elevator that the man got out at the next stop and left them alone. John and his mom kept laughing, even after the man was gone. They were having too much fun to stop!
