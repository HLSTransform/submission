Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Maria. She was very competitive and wanted to be the best at everything she did. One day, Maria came to a path in the woods. She wasn’t sure which way to take.
She thought for a minute and decided to go right. When she took a few steps down the path, she heard someone say, “Wrong way!” Maria replied, “Who said that?” A little rabbit hopped out from behind a tree.
The rabbit said, “You should go the other way. That’s the way to the best flower field in the woods!” Maria was excited. She thanked the rabbit and headed down the left path. A few minutes later, she saw the flower field. She was so happy.
She stayed in the flower field for hours, picking the most colourful flowers. It was the best day ever! She smiled and waved to the rabbit on her way back home.
