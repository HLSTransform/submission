One day, a missile flew over the playground. Everyone was surprised to see it! The missile was flying really fast so all the children began shaking and hiding. The elders in the playground looked very serious. 
Suddenly, a loud noise came from the missile! Something was falling from the sky. Everyone watched as something landed in the playground.
It was a big egg! The children gathered around it to see what was inside. They looked at it, but nothing was happening.
Suddenly, the egg began to shake, and then it cracked! A tiny baby bird came out from the egg and chirped! All the children were in amazement. The serious faces of the elders turned into happy smiles. 
Everyone was so glad to see the little bird, and it was all because of the missile!
