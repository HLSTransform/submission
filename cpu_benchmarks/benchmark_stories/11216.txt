Once upon a time there was a bright little girl named Mia. She loved exploring new things and learning about the world around her. One day she was curious about what could lead her to adventure, so she asked her dad, "What can lead me on a grand adventure?" Her dad smiled and said, "Well, Mia. To have a grand adventure you must first use your brain. When you are curious, ask questions and pay attention to the world around you. Learning can lead you to all kinds of fun places." 
So Mia kept her eyes open and when she saw a bright desk in a corner of the room, she decided to have a closer look. When she opened the desk, she found a secret map tucked away inside! Mia was so excited that she couldn't help but ask her dad, "What does this map lead to?" 
Her dad said, "Mia, if you want to follow the map, it will lead you to the grandest adventure of all - discovery. Whenever you want to learn something new, just remember, knowledge is the road to success!"
Mia was so happy and thanked her dad for the great advice. From that day forward, Mia followed her curiosity and with the help of her secret map she was able to lead herself on a grand intellectual journey. She realized that learning was a special kind of adventure that no one else could experience and it always left her feeling bright and accomplished.
