Jack loved to learn new things. He was always looking for something new to discover. One day, his mother announced that they were going to a special lecture.
"It's a green lecture," said mom. "It will be interesting to hear what the speaker has to say."
Jack was excited. He helped his mom load the car and they started out on their adventure.
When they arrived, they saw a huge room filled with green chairs. The speaker approached the podium and launched into the lecture. Jack eagerly listened to the lecture and learned a lot.
When the lecture was finished, Jack and his mom said goodbye to the speaker and loaded up the car again. On the way home, Jack couldn't stop talking about the green lecture. From then on, Jack loved learning about new things and taking part in educational activities.
