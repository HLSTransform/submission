Once upon a time, there was a group of youth who liked to play together. They had a lot of fun, but sometimes they didn't agree on what game to play. One day, they wanted to play hide-and-seek, but one of the youth, named Timmy, wanted to play tag instead. 
The other youth didn't want to play tag because they thought it was too chaotic and not organized. Timmy was upset and didn't understand why they didn't want to play his game. He started to cry and ran away. 
The other youth felt bad and went to look for Timmy. They heard him crying from behind a tree and went to comfort him. They apologized for not wanting to play tag and said they would play it next time. Timmy stopped crying and smiled, happy that they heard him and wanted to be friends again. From then on, they made sure to take turns choosing games so everyone was happy.
