Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore the world around him. One day, he decided to go on an adventure to space. He put on his space helmet and climbed into his toy rocket ship.
As Timmy flew through space, he saw many planets and stars. Suddenly, he stumbled and his rocket ship started to shake. "Oh no!" cried Timmy. "What's happening?"
Luckily, Timmy was able to land his rocket ship on a wide planet. He stepped out of his ship and saw a friendly alien. "Hello!" said Timmy. "I'm Timmy. I'm on an adventure to space."
The alien smiled and said, "Welcome to our planet. It's very wide here. Would you like to explore with me?" Timmy happily agreed and they went on a fun adventure together. When it was time to go home, Timmy said goodbye to his new friend and flew back to Earth. He couldn't wait to tell his family about his amazing space adventure.
