Connor was a brave little boy. He was always eager to explore new places. One day, his parents took him to a huge castle. It had a large door, high walls and a long staircase. Connor started to climb the stairs but it felt very heavy and he had to take a rest. When he looked up the stairs, he saw a beautiful mirror. He wanted to see what was behind it, so he started to climb again.
When Connor reached the mirror, he put his hand on it and it opened with a loud creak! He was so excited to see what was inside. Behind the mirror there was a secret room full of treasures. Connor couldn’t believe his eyes. He wanted to take one of them home, but all of them looked very heavy. Finally, he found a necklace with a shining stone and he decided to take it.
He quickly took the necklace, turned around, and started to go back. Just as he was about to part from the secret room, he saw his reflection in the mirror. He was smiling, holding the necklace tight and looking very happy. That was the best day of Connor’s life.
