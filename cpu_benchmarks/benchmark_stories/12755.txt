Once upon a time there was a little girl named Alice. She loved to play make believe and dress up like a princess. One day, Alice wanted to spritz her favorite perfume. She held the bottle tight, then sprayed it all over her room with a big sniff! Unfortunately, the scent was too strong and made Alice sleepy. 
Alice's mom noticed the perfume in the air and became upset. She said, "Alice, what did you do? Why are you spraying perfume?"
Alice sighed and said, "I wanted to try it, but it made me sleepy". Her mom replied, "I'm sorry you are tired now, but you should never do this again. It's not safe."
Alice felt regret as she looked at the bottle in her hands. She put it back and silently apologized. From then on, Alice knew better than to spray perfume without permission.
