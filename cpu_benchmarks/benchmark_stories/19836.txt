Once upon a time there was a girl called Jane. Jane liked to write. Every day she would take out her pencils and paper and write all sorts of things. One day, Jane wanted to write something special. She went to her cupboard and took out a pink pencil. She thought it would make her writing even more special. Jane then found some loud music to listen to as she wrote.
She started writing and it felt very special. Every time she wrote a letter it was in pretty pink. She heard the loud music and it made her writing even more fun! She filled page after page with her special pink words. Everywhere she went people noticed how loud and pink her writing was. 
When she was finished, Jane showed her parents her special writing. They said it was the best writing they had ever seen! Jane was so proud of her special writing and she kept it in a special place. From then on, Jane loved to write with her pink pencil and loud music.
