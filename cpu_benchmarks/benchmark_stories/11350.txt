Once upon a time there was a pretty bubble. This bubble was special because it was separated into two parts - the top part and the bottom part.
One day a three year old found the bubble. "Look how pretty it is!" they said.
The bubble was so pretty that the three year old decided to take it home. When they got home, they showed it to their friends.
The friends couldn't believe how pretty the bubble was! They asked the three year old how it was separated into two parts.
The three year old smiled and said, "It's so simple! I just twist it and it separates into the top part and the bottom part".
The friends were very impressed and wanted to try it out themselves. So they all grabbed bubbles and started twisting and separating them into two parts.
In the end, they all had their own pretty bubbles! And they all enjoyed the fun of separating bubbles!
