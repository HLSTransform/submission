Yesterday, Joe found a long stick. He ran outside and his friend, Tim, was there. Joe was so excited and he ran up to Tim to show him the stick. He held it in the air and said, "Look, a long stick!" Tim smiled and said, "Throw it to me!" 
Joe smiled and threw the stick as hard as he could. Tim caught it and laughed. It was so much fun! They threw it back and forth for a long time until the sun went down. 
At the end, Joe said, "Let's do this again tomorrow!" Tim smiled and said, "Yes, let's!"
