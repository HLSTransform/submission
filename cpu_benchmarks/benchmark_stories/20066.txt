Once upon a time, there was a happy family. They loved to go on picnics in the park. One day, they went on a picnic and felt very excited. They packed lots of yummy food and drinks. 
When they arrived at the park, they found a nice spot to sit and eat. The sun was shining and the birds were singing. They felt so happy to be outside enjoying the nice weather. 
After they finished their picnic, they cleaned up and went home. Everything felt normal again, but they knew they would have more picnics in the future. And they would always feel happy when they did. The end.
