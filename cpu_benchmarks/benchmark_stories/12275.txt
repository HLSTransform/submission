One day, a small girl was feeling very helpless. She sat on the floor, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, she had an idea. She jumped up, grabbed her cardboard box and ran outside.
In the middle of the garden, she started to perform with her box. She pushed it around, flipped it upside down and spun it around. As she moved the box, she began to sing.
Suddenly, her dad appeared. He watched her, admiring her performance. "What are you doing?" he asked.
The little girl smiled. "I am performing with my board!" she said proudly.
Her dad beamed. "That's wonderful!" he exclaimed. He hugged her tight, and she hugged him back.
The little girl smiled. She was no longer feeling helpless. She had found something that made her happy.
