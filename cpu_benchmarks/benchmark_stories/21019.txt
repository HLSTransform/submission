Once upon a time there lived an elephant. He was very shy. He wanted to make some new friends, but he was too scared to ask.
One day, he was walking through the jungle and he saw a big rock. He touched the rock and it made a noise. He jumped back in surprise!
The rock said 'I can help you!' The elephant was amazed. The rock said 'I can print you a promise. It will help you make friends'. The elephant was excited.
The rock printed the promise and gave it to the elephant. The elephant took the promise and went to the meadow where all the animals played.
The elephant showed the promise to the animals, and soon he made lots of friends. Everyone was very happy!
