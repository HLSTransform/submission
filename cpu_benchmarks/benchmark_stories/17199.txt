Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch the pretty fireworks in the sky. One day, Timmy's mommy told him that he needed to eat healthy food to stay strong. Timmy didn't like the taste of vegetables, but he knew they were good for him.
One night, Timmy went to a big firework show with his family. He saw lots of different colors and shapes in the sky. Suddenly, he saw a firework that looked like a big carrot! He thought it was funny that a firework could match a vegetable.
After the show, Timmy's mommy gave him a carrot to eat. Timmy remembered the firework and thought it was a funny way to make eating healthy more fun. He ate the carrot and felt strong and healthy, just like the firework in the sky. The end.
