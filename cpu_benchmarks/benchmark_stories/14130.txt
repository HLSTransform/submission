One night, when all the stars were twinkling in the sky, Baby bear lay in bed, yawning and stretching. Suddenly, he heard a noise coming from the kitchen. He hopped out of bed and ran to see what it was.
When he opened the kitchen door he saw something magical. His toy boxes were bouncing around the kitchen floor, being pushed by a very playful little Toy Frog!
Baby bear gasped with delight. "What are you doing here?" he asked.
Toy Frog laughed as he jumped from one box to another. He grinned and said, "I'm here to play!" 
Baby bear was so excited that he started bouncing around the kitchen too. He and the Toy Frog played until the sun came up. After a long night of fun, Baby bear yawned and it was time for bed.
