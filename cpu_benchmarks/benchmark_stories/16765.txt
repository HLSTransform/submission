Lily and Max were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big puddle on the grass. Lily wanted to splash in it. Max wanted to fit in it.
"Look, Lily, a puddle!" Max said. "Can I fit in it?"
Lily laughed. "No, Max, you are too big. You will get wet and dirty."
Max did not listen. He ran to the puddle and tried to fit in it. He lay down on his tummy and stretched his arms and legs. But he could not fit. He was too big. The puddle was too small.
Lily watched him. She shook her head. She thought Max was silly. She walked to the slide and climbed up. She slid down fast and smiled. She liked the slide.
Max got up from the puddle. He was wet and dirty. He felt cold and sad. He wanted to slide too. He walked to the slide and tried to climb up. But he could not climb. He was too wet and dirty. He slipped and fell.
Lily saw him. She felt sorry for him. She got off the slide and ran to him. She helped him up and hugged him.
"Are you okay, Max?" Lily asked.
Max nodded. He was okay. But he was tired. He wanted to go home.
"Let's go home, Lily," Max said. "I don't want to play anymore."
Lily agreed. She was tired too. She took his hand and they walked home. They left the puddle behind. They learned a lesson. They did not try to fit in puddles anymore.
