Once upon a time, there was a little thing that liked to blink. It was small and round, and it lived in a very organized room. The thing loved to blink all day and night, making the room bright and happy.
One day, the little thing met a big thing that could also blink. They became good friends and decided to blink together. They made the room even brighter and happier than before.
Soon, more things came to join them in their organized room. They all blinked together and made the room the happiest place ever. The little thing was so glad to have so many friends, and they all lived happily ever after.
