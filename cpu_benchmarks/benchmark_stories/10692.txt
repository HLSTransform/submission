Once upon a time, there was a mole. The mole was very obedient. He always listened to his mommy and daddy mole. One day, the mole saw a yummy carrot. He wanted to eat it, but his mommy said no. The mole was sad.
Then, a kind rabbit came to the mole. The rabbit said, "Come with me, I have a surprise for you!" The mole followed the rabbit to a big garden. There were lots of carrots there! The mole was so happy, and he thanked the rabbit for being so nice. From that day on, the mole was even more obedient to his mommy and daddy.
