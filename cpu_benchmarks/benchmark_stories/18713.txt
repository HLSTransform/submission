Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her dolls and stuffed animals. One day, Lily went to the park to play. She saw a boy playing with a toy boat in the pond. She went to say hello.
"Hi, my name is Lily. What is your name?" she asked politely.
"My name is Max. Do you want to play with my navy boat?" Max asked.
"Yes, please!" Lily exclaimed.
Max handed her the boat, but Lily accidentally dropped it in the water. Max got upset and started to cry. Lily felt bad and didn't know what to do.
"I'm sorry, Max. I'll try to manage to get your boat back," Lily said.
Lily tried to reach the boat with a stick, but it was too far. Suddenly, a man in a navy uniform appeared and asked what was wrong.
Lily explained the situation, and the man politely offered to retrieve the boat with a net. Max was happy to have his boat back, and Lily was happy to have made a new friend.
