Once upon a time there was a lady called Maria who needed a stove. She searched and searched, but she couldn't find one. Everywhere she looked, none of the stoves were perfect.
One day, Maria came across a strange shop with an old stove in the window. She looked and looked, and it seemed perfect. She went inside and asked the shopkeeper if she could buy it. "Yes," the shopkeeper said. "It's perfect for you!"
So, Maria bought the stove and she took it home. She put it in the kitchen and it looked just like she wanted. From that day on, she always cooked perfect meals with her perfect stove.
Maria was so happy she had found the perfect stove. She never had to search again. She had everything she needed.
