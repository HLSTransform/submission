Once upon a time, there was a big orange cow. She lived on a farm with lots of other animals. One day, the farmer came to the field and told the cow to turn around. The cow didn't know what that meant, so the farmer gently pushed her until she was facing the other way. 
The cow was happy to see a new view. She saw the sun setting in the sky and the green grass blowing in the wind. She mooed happily and started to walk around. Suddenly, she saw a little girl with a basket of apples. The girl smiled and gave the cow an apple. The cow was very grateful and ate the apple quickly. From that day on, the cow loved to turn around and see new things.
