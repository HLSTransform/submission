Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a pink bunny. The bunny loved to play with his friends in the evening. They played hide and seek, and they had lots of fun.
One day, the pink bunny fell down while playing. He hurt his leg very bad. He cried and cried. His friends came to help him. They told him not to worry, and they will help him heal.
The pink bunny's friends took care of him. They brought him food and made sure he was happy. Soon, the pink bunny's leg healed, and he could play again. The pink bunny was very thankful to his friends.
The moral of the story is that friends help each other in hard times. When you are kind and help others, they will help you too.
