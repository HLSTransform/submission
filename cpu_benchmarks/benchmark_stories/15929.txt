Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to work and patch with her dad. One day, Lucy asked her dad for help with a fragile patch.
"Daddy, can you help me patch this?" asked Lucy.
"Sure thing, sweetie," he replied, "but you'll have to be very careful. This patch is very fragile so you'll need to be extra gentle when mending it."
Lucy nodded and slowly worked on the patch with her daddy, taking extra care not to damage it. After a while, their hard work paid off and the patch was as good as new.
Lucy and her dad hugged each other proudly and smiled.
"I'm so glad we could fix it together," said Lucy.
"Me too," said her dad, "We make a good team!"
