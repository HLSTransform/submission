Once upon a time there were two little boys called Tom and Will. Tom was three years old and Will was five. They were playing in the park and having lots of fun. 
Suddenly Tom saw an apple fall from a tree. With excitement he ran over to pick it up. He took a big bite and smiled. It was so tasty!
Will said to Tom "But you shouldn't just eat someone else's food without asking. That's not very polite." Tom thought about what Will said, and realized that he was right.
Tom said "Will, the apple tastes really good, but it doesn't belong to us. We should just leave it here so someone else can enjoy it too."
Will smiled and gave Tom a hug. "That was really kind of you", he said. Tom felt really happy and proud. He had discovered the value of sharing.
