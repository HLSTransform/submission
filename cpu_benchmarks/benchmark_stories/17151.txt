Once upon a time, there was a long floor in a big house. A little boy named Timmy loved to play on this long floor. One day, Timmy's friend came to visit him. "Welcome to my house!" said Timmy. "Let's play on the long floor together!" 
Timmy and his friend ran up and down the long floor, laughing and having fun. Suddenly, Timmy's friend tripped and fell on the floor. "Ouch!" he cried. Timmy felt bad and asked, "Are you okay?" His friend nodded and said, "Yes, I'm fine. But the floor is hard and hurts when you fall on it."
Timmy thought for a moment and said, "I know what we can do! Let's put some soft pillows on the floor so it won't hurt if we fall." His friend smiled and said, "That's a great idea!" They found some pillows and put them on the long floor. Now they could play and have fun without worrying about getting hurt. They both agreed that the long floor was even better now with the soft pillows.
