Once upon a time, there was a big, fierce lion. He lived in a jungle with many other animals. One day, the lion got hurt while playing with his friends. His paw hurt so much that he couldn't walk anymore. The other animals didn't know what to do, so they went to ask the wise owl for help.
The owl said that they needed a mechanic to fix the lion's paw. The animals didn't know what a mechanic was, so the owl explained that it's someone who fixes things. The animals searched the jungle and finally found a kind monkey who was a mechanic. The monkey was happy to help and asked for permission to fix the lion's paw.
The lion was scared at first, but the monkey was gentle and kind. He fixed the lion's paw and soon the lion could walk again. The other animals were so happy and grateful to the monkey. They realized that sometimes we need help from others and it's okay to ask for permission to get the help we need.
