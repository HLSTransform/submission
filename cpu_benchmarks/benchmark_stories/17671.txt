Once, there was a sister. She was so happy. She liked to eat delicious food. One day, her brother had an idea. He said, "Let's bury our food in the sand and play a game!" So they did. The sister buried her food in the sand. Her brother buried his food, too. Then they both dug it out! The sister's food was still delicious. She laughed and laughed. After that, the brother and sister played together all day long.
