Once, there was a big race. Many kids ran in the race. One boy, Tom, wanted to win. He wanted the victory. He saw another boy, Sam, who was very fast. Tom was jealous of Sam.
On the day of the race, Tom thought of a plan. He saw a big bag. He decided to fill it with sand. When Sam was not looking, Tom put the heavy bag on Sam's back. Sam did not know.
During the race, Sam was slow. He said, "Why am I so slow?" Tom ran fast and won the race. He was happy with his victory. But then, someone saw the heavy bag on Sam's back. They knew Tom cheated.
Everyone was mad at Tom. They gave the victory to Sam. Tom was sad and had no friends.
