Once upon a time there was a little girl. She wanted to use the sink. The sink was very high and she could not reach it. The little girl was very sad. She looked around her house and searched for something to help her. Suddenly, she saw a box and thought she could use it. She pulled the box over to the sink. She stood on the box and was able to use the sink. She was so happy! She used the sink over and over again and hummed a happy tune. The end.
