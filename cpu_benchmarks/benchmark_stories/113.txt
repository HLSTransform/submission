Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy tools. He had a toy hammer, a toy screwdriver, and a toy saw. Timmy's favorite tool was his toy wrench. He would pretend to fix everything with it.
One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy wanted to play with Timmy's toy wrench, but Timmy didn't want to share. Billy got upset and they started to argue. Timmy's mom heard the commotion and came in to see what was going on.
She told Timmy that it's important to share and raise your hand if you want to speak. She also said that it's not nice to make your friends dizzy with arguments. Timmy apologized to Billy and they continued to play together, sharing all of their toy tools. From that day on, Timmy learned the importance of sharing and being kind to his friends.
