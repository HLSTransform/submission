Lila was a little girl who loved animals. She had a dog, a bird and a fish at home. One day, she saw a kitten in the park. The kitten was light brown and had blue eyes. It was hiding under a bench and looked scared.
"Hello, kitten," Lila said softly. "Do you want to be my friend?" She reached out her hand to pet the kitten, but the kitten hissed and scratched her. Lila cried out and pulled back her hand. It hurt and had red marks.
"Why are you so mean, kitten?" Lila asked. "I just want to help you. You look hungry and cold." She took out a piece of cheese from her pocket and tossed it to the kitten. The kitten sniffed the cheese and ate it quickly. Then it looked at Lila with curiosity.
"Meow," the kitten said.
"Meow, meow," Lila said back. She smiled and moved closer to the kitten. The kitten did not run away this time. It let Lila touch its fur and rub its ears. It purred and licked Lila's hand.
"Are you sorry for scratching me, kitten?" Lila asked.
"Meow," the kitten said.
"I forgive you, kitten," Lila said. "You were just scared and did not know me. Now we are friends. Do you want to come home with me? I have a dog, a bird and a fish. They will be nice to you."
The kitten nodded and followed Lila. It did not struggle when Lila picked it up and hugged it. It was happy to have a new home and a new friend. Lila was happy too. She had a new pet and a new adventure. She named the kitten Luna, because it had eyes like the moon.
