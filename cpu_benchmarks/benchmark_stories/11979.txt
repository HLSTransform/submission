Once upon a time, a little boy named Timmy went outside to play. He saw his friend Johnny and they started to play hide and seek. Timmy was hiding behind a tree when he heard a loud noise. "What's that sound?" he asked Johnny. "It's thunder," replied Johnny. "It means a storm is coming."
Timmy was scared of the thunder and wanted to go home, but Johnny said he knew a way to help him feel better. "Let's go to the pond and throw rocks in the water," said Johnny. "It will distract us from the thunder." Timmy followed Johnny to the pond and they started to throw rocks. Johnny found a big rock and said, "I'll lead the way and throw this one in the water." Timmy was amazed as the rock made a big splash and the water turned icy cold.
After a while, the storm passed and the sun came out. Timmy felt better and thanked Johnny for helping him. "You're my best friend," said Timmy. "You always know how to make me feel better." Johnny smiled and they continued to play together, happy to be friends.
