Once upon a time there was a dark bird. The bird loved to soar through the sky. Every day he would look for something new to explore.
One day, the bird noticed rice spread across a field. He flew lower and noticed it was pouring rice from the sky. He was amazed!
The bird started to dive and scoop up the rice in his beak. He soared around in the sky, enjoying the delicious rice. Everywhere he flew he found more and more.
He kept soaring, eating as he flew. His beak and wings were dark from the rice. Finally, he was full, and flew back home, filled with joy.
