Once upon a time there was a panda. His name was Jack. He was very warm. He was looking for something to get. He looked around and saw lots of things. He saw a tree and some bushes. He saw a pond too. But nothing seemed right.
Suddenly, Jack saw something he wanted. It was a nice warm spot in the sun. He quickly got up and went over to it. He lay down and enjoyed the warmth. He stayed there for a while, until a butterfly came by. Jack was so excited, he hopped up and tried to get the butterfly. But it flew away.
Jack was disappointed, but he still had the warm spot. He stayed there a while longer until it got dark. Then he went back home. Jack was very happy. He had gotten something special. A nice warm spot in the sun.
