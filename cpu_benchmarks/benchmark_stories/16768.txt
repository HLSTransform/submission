Tim and Kim were twins who liked to play outside. But on Sunday, it was very cold and rainy. They could not go to the park or ride their bikes. They felt miserable and bored.
"Mom, can we watch TV?" Tim asked.
"No, you have watched enough TV this week. Why don't you read a book or draw a picture?" Mom said.
"But we don't want to do that. We want to have fun!" Kim said.
Mom sighed and said, "You know, there are many children who don't have toys or books or TV. They have to work hard or live in bad places. They would be happy to have what you have. You should be grateful and not complain."
Tim and Kim did not listen to Mom. They kept whining and sulking. They did not want to do anything. They just sat on the couch and shivered in the cold.
Then, they heard a knock on the door. Mom opened it and saw a man holding a big basket. He was smiling and said, "Hello, I'm from the church. We are collecting donations for the poor families in our community. Do you have anything to spare?"
Mom said, "Of course, come in. Let me see what I can find." She went to the kitchen and came back with some cans of food and a blanket. She put them in the basket and said, "Here you go. I hope this helps."
The man thanked Mom and said, "God bless you. You are very kind and generous. Have a nice day." He left with the basket.
Tim and Kim watched the man go. They felt ashamed and sorry. They realized how lucky they were and how selfish they had been. They said to Mom, "Mom, we are sorry. We were wrong. We have so much and we should be happy. Can we give some of our toys and clothes to the poor children?"
Mom smiled and hugged them. She said, "I'm proud of you. That's very nice of you. Yes, you can. Let's go and find some things to donate. Maybe we can also make some cards or cookies for them. That would make them happy."
Tim and Kim nodded and smiled. They felt warm and good inside. They learned to appreciate what they had and to share with others. They had a fun and meaningful Sunday after all.
