Anna and Ben like to play with their toys. They have many toys, like cars, dolls, blocks and books. But sometimes they do not like to share. Anna is bossy. She wants to play with all the toys. She says, "This is mine, and this is mine, and this is mine too!"
Ben is sad. He wants to play too. He sees a car that he likes. He says, "Can I play with the car, please?" Anna says, "No, this is my car. Go away!" She pokes Ben with her finger. Ben says, "Ow, that hurts! Stop poking me!"
Ben is angry. He pokes Anna back. Anna says, "Ow, that hurts too! Stop poking me!" They poke each other more and more. They make loud noises. They do not have fun.
Mom hears the noises. She comes to see what is wrong. She sees Anna and Ben poking each other. She says, "What are you doing? Why are you poking each other? That is not nice. That is not how you play."
Anna and Ben stop poking. They look at Mom. They feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were fighting over the toys. We did not share. We did not play nice."
Mom says, "It is okay to say sorry. But you have to mean it. You have to be kind to each other. You have to share your toys. You have to take turns. You have to play nice. Then you will have more fun."
Anna and Ben nod. They say, "Okay, Mom. We will be kind. We will share. We will take turns. We will play nice." They hug Mom. They hug each other. They pick up their toys. They play together. They have fun.
