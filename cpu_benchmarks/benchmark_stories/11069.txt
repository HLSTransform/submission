Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books. But today they are bored. They want to do something new.
"Let's look at the roof," Tom says. He points to the window. "Maybe we can see the stars or the moon."
"Okay," Lily says. She likes stars and moon. They are shiny and pretty. She follows Tom to the window. They climb on the bed and look up.
But they do not see stars or moon. They see a big hole in the roof. They see rain and wind. They see a branch from the tree. The branch is stuck in the hole.
"Oh no!" Lily says. She is scared. She thinks the branch will fall on them. She thinks the rain will wet them. She thinks the wind will blow them away.
"Don't worry," Tom says. He is brave. He thinks the branch is fun. He thinks the rain is cool. He thinks the wind is funny. He wants to touch the branch. He reaches out his hand.
But before he can touch the branch, they hear a loud noise. They hear their mom and dad. They hear them run up the stairs. They hear them open the door.
"What are you doing?" Mom says. She is angry. She sees the hole. She sees the branch. She sees the rain and wind. She sees Lily and Tom on the bed.
"We are looking at the roof," Tom says. He smiles. He thinks mom and dad will like the roof.
Mom and dad do not like the roof. They are not happy. They are not smiling. They take Lily and Tom off the bed. They hug them and kiss them. They tell them they are safe. They tell them they are sorry. They tell them they will fix the roof.
Lily and Tom are confused. They do not understand why mom and dad are sorry. They do not understand why they need to fix the roof. They think the roof is fine. They think the roof is fun.
But they are also sleepy. They are tired from looking at the roof. They yawn and rub their eyes. They cuddle with mom and dad. They say good night to the roof. They say good night to the branch. They say good night to the rain and wind. They close their eyes and fall asleep.
