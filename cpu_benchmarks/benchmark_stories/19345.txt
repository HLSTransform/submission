Once upon a time there was a clumsy boy called Ben. He loved ice-cream and always wanted to have some. One day, he saw a big tub of ice cream and he got so excited that he jumped in and tried to dive in. But he was too clumsy and he fell on the floor instead. He tried again, but he still could not dive. Then he saw his Mum running towards him and he thought that she was going to be angry. But instead she laughed and said, "It's ok Ben. I will help you get your ice-cream". She picked him up, and Ben held onto her as they jumped into the tub of ice-cream together. They rolled around in the tub, making a big mess. Ben was so happy that he was finally able to dive in the ice-cream with his mum. They laughed and played for hours until the ice-cream ran out. What a wonderful day!
