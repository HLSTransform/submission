Once upon a time, there was a proud dog named Bob. Bob had a shirt that he loved a lot. He wore it every day.
One day, Bob went to play with his friends. They played in the mud and had a lot of fun. But, Bob's shirt got very dirty. Bob sighed because he was sad.
Bob went home and his mom helped him clean the shirt. When it was clean again, Bob was very happy. He put on his shirt and felt proud once more.
