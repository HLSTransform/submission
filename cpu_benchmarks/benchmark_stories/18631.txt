Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the park with his friends. One day, they were playing hide and seek. Timmy found a great hiding spot behind a big tree. He peeked out to look for his friends, but he couldn't see them anywhere.
Suddenly, Timmy heard a loud noise. He looked around and saw that his friends had found a big drain. They were throwing rocks down it and making a big mess. Timmy knew that was naughty and could cause trouble.
Timmy decided to be brave and tell his friends to stop. He walked over to them and said, "Hey guys, that's not nice. We shouldn't throw things down the drain. It could hurt someone or make a big mess." His friends listened to him and stopped being naughty. They all played together happily ever after. The end.
