Once there was a girl called Emma. She was very honest and always told people the truth. 
One day, Emma was walking up a hill when she saw a bee. It was buzzing around and then it flew away. When Emma looked up, she saw a butterfly floating in the sky. 
She smiled and said, "I wish I could fly like that!" Just then, Emma suddenly slipped and fell. She fell onto her neck and her neck hurt a lot. 
"Ow, that hurt," she said. She slowly got up and started rubbing her neck. Then she heard a voice. "Are you ok?"
Emma turned around and saw her friend Joe. She nodded her head and said, "Yes, I'm okay. I just fell down because I was trying to fly like a butterfly!" 
Joe smiled at Emma and said,"That's not honest. You can't fly like a butterfly!" 
Emma nodded her head. She knew Joe was right. She had tried to be funny, but honesty was the best policy. "You're right Joe, I was being silly. Thanks for being honest," said Emma. 
Joe smiled and said, "No problem! Let's go home now."
And so Emma and Joe went home, happy that they were honest with each other.
