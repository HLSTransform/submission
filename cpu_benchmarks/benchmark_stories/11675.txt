Once upon a time there was a field full of color. Every day the little bird wanted to test it. He was curious to learn what the colorful field had to offer. 
One day he decided to test it and he jumped in. He was surprised to find all the different shades of red, yellow and blue. Not only was it colorful but it was also full of shapes, animals and fun! He hopped and played for hours until it was time for bed.
The next morning he woke up and went back to the field. He bumped into a butterfly and they started to play tag. The little bird spent the whole morning testing the field and flying around with the butterfly. 
He felt so happy and full of joy that his colorful field brought to him. He waved goodbye to the butterfly and when he went home, he couldn't help but smile.
