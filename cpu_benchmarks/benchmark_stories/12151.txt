Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Brooke who loved rainbows. She would watch them all the time, run around chasing them and wish she could catch one. One day Brooke decided she wanted to improve her skills. She went over to her mom and asked her to help.
"Mom can you help me improve?" she asked, excitedly. 
Her mom smiled and said, "of course." She told Brooke to focus on a white rainbow, and to practice chasing it until she couldn't run anymore.
The next day, Brooke ran out and concentrated on the white rainbow in the sky. She chased and chased until the sky was dark and she was too tired to keep running. 
The following day, Brooke had improved, and was able to catch the first few drops of the white rainbow before it disappeared.
"You did it!" her mom cheered. Brooke was so proud of her achievement and hugged her mom tightly. 
The two of them continued to chase the white rainbows each day, until Brooke had gained so much skill, she could chase them all day. 
From that day on, Brooke knew she could always improve and never give up on what she loves.
