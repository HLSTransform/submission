Once upon a time there was a mommy and a little girl. The mommy wanted to introduce her daughter to a new food. The food was called cereal. It was a very delicate cereal. The girl was very excited to try it. She tasted it and was pleased! She ate all the cereal and asked for more! She loved the cereal so much that she asked for it every day for breakfast. The end.
