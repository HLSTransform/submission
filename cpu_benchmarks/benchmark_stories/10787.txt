Once upon a time, there was a big red apple. The apple lived on a tree in a big green park. The apple loved to watch all the interesting things that happened in the park.
One day, a little girl named Sally came to the park. She saw the big red apple and wanted to eat it. She found a long stick and tried to get the apple down from the tree. She poked the apple, and it fell to the ground. Sally picked up the apple and smiled.
Sally took the apple to her mommy, who was sitting on a blanket. Her mommy helped her fold the blanket and put it in a bag. Then, they went home to eat the big red apple. They both thought it was the most interesting apple they ever ate.
