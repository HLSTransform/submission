Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play in the jungle near his house. The jungle was full of beautiful trees and animals. One day, Timmy met a monkey who was lost. 
"Can you help me find my way home?" asked the monkey. 
"Yes, I can," said Timmy. "Let's add more friends to help us." 
So, Timmy and the monkey went to find more friends. They met a parrot and a tiger. The parrot said, "I know the way, follow me!" 
But as they walked, they heard a loud noise. It was a hunter with a gun. The hunter wanted to catch the animals. The friends tried to run away, but the hunter caught the tiger. 
Timmy and the monkey were very sad. They went home and told Timmy's mom what happened. She hugged them and said, "I'm sorry. We need to take care of our jungle and its animals."
