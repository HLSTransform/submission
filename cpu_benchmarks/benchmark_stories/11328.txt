Once upon a time, there was a gifted girl name Francis. She lived in a place that was close to war. Francis's parents feared for her safety. 
One day, Francis asked her parents, "Can I go and play outside?"
"No, sweetie, it's too dangerous," her parents said.
"But I'm brave and gifted," Francis said. "I dare you to let me go."
Francis's parents thought long and hard. They knew that it was dangerous, but they also knew that Francis was very brave. So they decided to let her go. 
Francis smiled and ran out of her house. She enjoyed the warm sun and the nice breeze. She felt very free and happy.
The End.
