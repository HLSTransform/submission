Once upon a time, there was a kind lady who loved to cook. Every day, she would provide delicious meals for her family and friends. She always made sure her kitchen was clean before she started cooking.
One day, her friend came over to visit. The lady was happy to see her friend and decided to provide her with a special meal. She cooked some yummy spaghetti with meatballs and a clean salad.
Her friend loved the meal and thanked the lady for providing such a tasty and clean dinner. They had a great time together and promised to do it again soon. The lady was happy to have provided a good meal for her friend.
