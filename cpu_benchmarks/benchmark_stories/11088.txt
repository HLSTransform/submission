Lily and Tom were friends who liked to dance. They danced in the park, in the school, and in their homes. They danced to happy songs, sad songs, and silly songs. They danced with their arms, their legs, and their faces.
One day, they saw a poster for a dance contest. The poster said, "Unite with your partner and show us your best dance. The winner gets a big orange cake." Lily and Tom loved cake, especially orange cake. They decided to enter the contest and unite their dances.
They practiced every day, making up new moves and steps. They were very excited and confident. They wore matching orange outfits and went to the contest. There were many other dancers, but Lily and Tom thought they were the best.
They waited for their turn and then went on the stage. They smiled at the judges and the audience and started to dance. They danced with joy and energy, moving in sync and harmony. They danced so well that everyone clapped and cheered.
But then, something bad happened. Tom slipped on a banana peel that someone had thrown on the stage. He fell down and hurt his ankle. He cried out in pain and stopped dancing. Lily was shocked and scared. She did not know what to do. She stopped dancing too and ran to Tom.
The judges were not happy. They said, "You did not finish your dance. You did not unite with your partner. You lose the contest. No cake for you." They gave the cake to another pair of dancers who had danced without any problems.
Lily and Tom were very sad and angry. They did not get the cake. They did not win the contest. They did not have fun. They felt like they had wasted their time and their dance. They wished they had never entered the contest. They wished they had never seen the poster. They wished they had never seen the banana peel. They wished they had just danced in the park, in the school, or in their homes.
