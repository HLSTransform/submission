Once upon a time, there was a brave boy, who was playing in the park all by himself one day. Suddenly, he heard a noise and saw a big monster! The monster promised to not hurt him. 
The brave boy was scared but he decided to stay brave and negotiate with the monster. He said to the monster, “Please go away and leave me alone, I don’t want to get hurt”. 
The monster said, “I will leave if you promise to never tell anyone about me”. The brave boy said, “I promise!”
The monster kept his promise and left. The brave boy was so relieved. He learned an important lesson that day: no matter how scared you are, always stay brave.
