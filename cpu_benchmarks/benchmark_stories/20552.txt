Once upon a time there was a small girl whose name was Janey. She had long, dark hair and beautiful blue eyes. One day, Janey was playing in her room when suddenly she heard a noise coming from behind the curtain. She was scared at first, but then she got brave and slowly walked up to the curtain. She peeked behind it and was surprised to find a small mouse. The mouse was looking up at her and nodding its head.
Janey was very excited and smiled. She smiled back to the mouse and slowly lifted the curtain, so that it could get out. Then she watched as the mouse scurried away.
Janey was so happy that she danced around the room and looked for more little creatures. She looked under furniture and behind curtains but she didn't find any. Finally, she said goodbye to the mouse and went outside to play.
The End.
