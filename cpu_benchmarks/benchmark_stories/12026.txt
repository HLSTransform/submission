Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to bake with her mommy. One day, they decided to make a cake. Lily helped her mommy pour the flour and sugar into the bowl. She also cracked the eggs and mixed everything together.
After they finished baking the cake, they wanted to eat it. But mommy said they couldn't until daddy came home. Daddy had the license to cut the cake. So they waited patiently.
When daddy finally came home, he cut the cake into slices. Lily took a bite of her slice and made a funny face. It was bitter! Mommy and daddy tasted it too and agreed. They forgot to put sugar in the cake! But they still ate it and laughed about their mistake.
