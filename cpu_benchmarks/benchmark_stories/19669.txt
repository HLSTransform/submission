Once upon a time, there was an intelligent farmer. He had a job to do. Every morning, he had to tie his boots so he could go to his farm to work. He tried and tried, but he just couldn't tie them. 
The farmer went to ask his friend, the wise old owl, for help. The owl asked him, "Why don't you just ask your children?" The farmer thought it was a great idea, so he asked his three-year-old daughter for help. 
The little girl sat down and looked carefully at the farmer's boots. She watched her dad and she started to tie the laces just like her dad had done. Then the little girl took a double knot and said, "See, it's done!" 
The farmer hugged his daughter and said, "You are so very intelligent!" From then on, the farmer was able to tie his own boots and get to work much quicker. The wise old owl was proud of the little girl and thanked her for helping out the farmer. 
The end.
