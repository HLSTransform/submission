Once upon a time there was a small boy named Jack. He was three years old, and he loved to explore the world around him. 
One day, Jack was walking in the park and looking up at the sky when he saw something very strange - a hairy comet! He just had to take a closer look, so he ran over to measure it.
He walked around the comet and stretched his arms out to measure it when suddenly he heard a voice calling out to him:
"Hello there, Jack! What are you measuring?"
He turned around to see a friendly moon looking down at him. Jack smiled and told the moon:
"I'm measuring the hairy comet. It looks really cool!"
The moon smiled and said, "That's very brave of you, Jack. Let me help you measure it."
Jack was so excited! With the help of the moon, Jack measured the hairy comet in no time. When Jack was done, he thanked the moon and skipped back home, feeling very proud of himself.
