Once upon a time, there was a big lake. One morning, a young duck and her mother were paddling across it. As they went along, the duck noticed a big soap box floating in the lake.
“Mummy, what is that?” the young duck asked.
“That's a soap box,” her mother replied. “Let's go and take a closer look.”
The duck and her mother paddled over to the box and looked inside. They could see lots of big, colourful pieces of soap in there. 
“Wow!” the young duck said. “This is special soap! I want to take one home.” 
“Alright,” her mother said. “Just make sure to close the box tight afterwards so no other ducks can get in.”
The young duck nodded and carefully reached inside and picked out a big pink piece of soap. She put it in her bag, then shut the soap box tightly.
“Let's go home now,” said her mother.
The young duck nodded and both of them paddled off happily. The young duck was so proud of her new soap - it was going to make her bath time extra special!
