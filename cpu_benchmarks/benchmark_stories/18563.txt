Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but her room was always messy. One day, her mom came in and said, "Lily, we need to clean up your room. Can you help me?"
Lily replied, "Yes, mommy. But where do we put everything?"
"We can put your dolls in the toy box, your books on the shelf, and your clothes in the closet. We just need to be organized," her mom said.
Lily started to pick up her toys and put them away. She found a puzzle and said, "Mommy, this puzzle doesn't fit in the toy box yet. Can we keep it out?"
"Of course, Lily. We can find a special spot for it," her mom replied.
After a while, Lily's room was neat and tidy. She looked around and said, "Wow, mommy! Our room looks great now that it's organized."
"I'm glad you like it, Lily. Now you can play with your toys without making a mess again," her mom said with a smile.
