Once there was a little girl who wanted something very expensive. She looked around and around, but she could not find it. One day, she saw something special on the ground. It was a piece of paper. She picked it up and she smiled.
The little girl was very excited. She didn't know what it was, but she knew it was something special and expensive. She stood there and looked at it for a long time. Then, she decided to take it to her mom.
When she got home, the mom was surprised. She said it was a very special and expensive piece of paper. It was worth more than anything else in the house. The little girl was very happy that she found something so valuable.
From then on, the little girl always looked carefully when she was outside. She wanted to find other valuable things like the special paper. She never knew what she would find, but she was always hopeful that it would be something special and expensive!
