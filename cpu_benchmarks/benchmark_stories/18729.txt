Once upon a time, there was a little brown horse named Daisy. Daisy lived in a big barn with all her animal friends. One day, Daisy went outside to play and met a mischievous little rabbit named Benny.
Benny said to Daisy, "I want to play with you, but you have to give me a carrot first." Daisy replied, "I don't have a carrot to give you, but we can still play together." Benny didn't like that answer and started to get angry.
He said, "If you don't give me a carrot, I will tell the farmer that you ate all the hay." Daisy was scared and didn't want to get in trouble, so she ran away. Benny laughed and ran after her.
Daisy ran as fast as she could, but Benny was too quick. He caught up to her and pushed her into a muddy puddle. Daisy was sad and all covered in mud. She went back to the barn and told all her friends what happened. They were angry and chased Benny away.
From that day on, Daisy never played with Benny again. She learned that it's important to stand up for yourself and not let others bully you.
