Once upon a time, there was a mommy and her little girl. They went to the store to buy a new purse for the mommy. The little girl saw a silly clown and started to laugh. The mommy bought the purse and they went home. The little girl played with her toys and the mommy put her new purse on the table. The day came to an end and they went to bed, dreaming of silly clowns and new purses.
