One day, a little girl named Sally was playing in her garden. She looked around and saw a pan. Sally thought it was very interesting so she picked it up.
When Sally held the pan, she felt it was very lively. She wanted to know what it could do so she ran to the kitchen. 
Sally's mom saw her. She smiled and asked what she was going to do with the pan. Sally said she wanted to eat something in it.
Her mom told her she could use the pan to make pancakes. So Sally followed her mom's instructions, helping her mix the ingredients. Then they put the pan on the stove.
Soon, Sally and her mom were eating the delicious pancakes together. They were having a lot of fun. Sally was so happy to be able to use the lively pan to eat something special.
