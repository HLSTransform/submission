Sam and Lily liked to play with the fish tank in their room. They liked to watch the fish swim and eat. They also liked to touch the glass and see the water move.
One day, they found a small bag of fish food on the shelf. They wanted to feed the fish, so they opened the bag and poured some food into the tank. But they poured too much. The food made the water cloudy and the fish started to scatter. They looked scared and unhappy.
"Oh no, what did we do?" Sam said.
"We gave them too much food. We need to take some out," Lily said.
They tried to scoop out the food with their hands, but it was hard. The food was tiny and sticky. It stuck to their fingers and the glass. They also saw some food on the fish's scales. The scales were shiny and smooth. They made the fish look pretty.
"Look, the food is on their scales. Maybe they like it," Sam said.
"No, they don't. It can make them sick. We need to clean them," Lily said.
They tried to catch the fish with their hands, but it was harder. The fish were fast and slippery. They swam away from their hands. They were persistent. They did not want to be caught.
"Stop, stop, we want to help you," Sam said.
But the fish did not listen. They hid behind the plants and the rocks. They did not trust Sam and Lily.
Sam and Lily felt bad. They did not mean to hurt the fish. They wanted to make them happy. They did not know what to do.
Then they heard their mom come in. She saw the mess and the fish. She was not happy.
"Sam, Lily, what did you do?" she said.
