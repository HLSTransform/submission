Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jane. She was always curious and loved finding hidden things. One day, she went out to explore. She went on a wild adventure, so she packed her favorite snack - cocoa - and off she went! Jane walked around and soon she saw something that was very hidden. Up in the tree was a big surprise! It was a new friend, a tiny bird. Jane was very excited and wanted to meet her new friend. She went up the tree and gave the bird some cocoa and said hello. The bird was very happy to meet Jane. They chatted for a bit and then said goodbye. Jane was very happy she got to meet such a special friend. The end.
