Once there was a mill. It stood tall and thick in the middle of the field next to a big oak tree. A little girl spent every day playing in the fields around the mill. One day, she noticed a rope tied to the tree. She grabbed the rope and started to swing. Swinging higher and higher, the rope flew through the air. She imagined she was flying around the mill like a bird. Suddenly, the rope was too high, and she came tumbling down. But the little girl didn't feel scared. Instead, she felt brave and strong. She laughed and grabbed the rope again, continuing to swing. This time, she went even higher and higher. The little girl spun around and around, twirling on her rope like a human wheel. The thick rope held her tightly and she felt like she could keep on swinging forever. But eventually the sun started to go down and it was time for the little girl to go home. She waved goodbye to the mill, knowing that she could come back anytime to play.
