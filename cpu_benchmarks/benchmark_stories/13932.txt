Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a kind man named Tom. Tom liked to wash his hands a lot. He always had clean hands. Tom had a job. His work was to help people. He was not rich, but he was happy.
One day, Tom saw a big box near his house. The box was very dirty. Tom thought, "I can wash this box and make it clean." So, Tom washed the box until it was very clean. He felt good about his work.
The next day, a rich man came to the town. He was looking for his lost box. When he saw the clean box at Tom's house, he was very happy. He said, "Thank you, Tom, for finding my box and making it clean." The rich man gave Tom a big gift. From that day on, Tom was rich too. And he still liked to wash his hands.
