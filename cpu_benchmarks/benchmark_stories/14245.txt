It was a summer day and Billy wanted to go dig in the dirt. He ran out to the back yard and got his spade. He was so excited and he started digging in the dirt. He was searching for something special.
But then he got worried. He heard a noise he didn't know. He was scared and he wanted to stop digging. He was worried that something might hurt him.
But he saw a bird in the sky. It had something in its beak. He knew that it was safe and he smiled.
Billy wanted to keep digging and look for something special. He was no longer worried and he keptlooking for something until he finally found what he was looking for. It was a special stone and he was so happy. He held it in his hands and admired it.
