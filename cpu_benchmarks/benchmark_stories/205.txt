Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a big box under a tree. They think it is a treasure.
"Wow, look at this!" Sara says. "Maybe there are toys or candy inside!"
"Let's open it!" Ben says. He tries to lift the lid, but it is too heavy. He asks Sara to help him.
They push and pull, but the box does not move. They are sad. They want to see the treasure.
Then, a tall man comes to the tree. He has a hat and a coat. He sees the box and the children.
"Hey, what are you doing?" he says. He sounds angry. "This is my box! Go away!"
Sara and Ben are scared. They do not know the man. They do not want to make him mad.
"But we found it first!" Sara says. "We want to see the treasure!"
"There is no treasure!" the man says. "This is just a box of old books! They are mine! Now leave!"
He grabs the box and walks away. He does not look at the children. He does not say sorry.
Sara and Ben frown. They are not happy. They think the man is mean. They wish they could see the treasure.
They go to the swings and try to forget the box. They hope to find a real treasure someday.
