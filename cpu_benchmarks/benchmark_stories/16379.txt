One day, a boy went to the lake. He saw a fish in the clear water. The boy wanted to make a new friend. He called out, "Hello, fish! Do you want to play?"
The fish said, "Yes, I want to play with you." The boy was happy. They played all day in the water. The sun was shining and the sky was blue.
But then, the boy saw something big and scary. It was a big fish. The big fish was hungry. The boy and the small fish tried to run away. The big fish was too fast.
The big fish ate the small fish. The boy was sad. He went home and cried. His new friend was gone. The lake was not a happy place anymore.
