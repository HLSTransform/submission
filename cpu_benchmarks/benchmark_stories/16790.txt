Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to drink juice. Every day, his mom would give him a glass of juice with his breakfast. Timmy admired how the juice looked in the glass, with its bright colors and sweet smell.
One day, Timmy went to his friend's house to play. His friend had a toy car that Timmy had never seen before. It was blue and shiny, but Timmy noticed it was not like any other toy car he had seen. It was an original toy car, made by his friend's dad. Timmy admired how unique and special the toy car was.
After playing with the toy car, Timmy's friend's mom gave them both a glass of juice. Timmy enjoyed the juice so much that he asked his friend's mom for the recipe. She told him it was a secret family recipe, and Timmy admired how delicious and special the juice tasted. From that day on, Timmy loved to drink his friend's mom's original juice whenever he went to play.
