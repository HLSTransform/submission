Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat blueberries. One day, she went to the park and found a big bush of blueberries. She picked some and ate them all. They were so yummy!
After playing for a while, Lily felt tired. She said to her mom, "I want to nap now." Her mom said, "Okay, let's find a nice spot for you to rest." They found a thick blanket under a tree and Lily laid down.
As she closed her eyes, she dreamed of all the blueberries she had eaten. She felt happy and content. When she woke up, she said to her mom, "I had a good nap. Can we go find more blueberries now?" Her mom smiled and said, "Sure, let's go!"
