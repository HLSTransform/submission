Lily and Ben were playing with their toy kitchen. They liked to pretend they were making food for their dolls and stuffed animals. They had pots and pans, spoons and forks, and some plastic fruits and vegetables.
"Let's make soup!" Lily said. "What do you want to include in the soup?"
Ben thought for a moment. He picked up a carrot and a tomato. "These!" he said. "And some salt and pepper."
"Okay!" Lily said. She put the carrot and the tomato in a pot and filled it with water. She turned the knob on the stove to make it hot. "Now we have to wait for the soup to boil."
They sat on the floor and waited. They heard a bubbling sound from the pot. "It's ready!" Lily said. She turned the knob again to make it cold. She got a ladle and two bowls. She poured some soup into each bowl and gave one to Ben.
"Thank you!" Ben said. He tasted the soup. "Mmm, it's good!"
Lily tasted her soup too. "It is good!" she agreed. "But it needs something else."
"What?" Ben asked.
Lily looked around. She saw a long piece of string on the table. She had an idea. She grabbed the string and put it in her soup. "Noodles!" she said.
Ben laughed. He put some string in his soup too. "Noodles!" he repeated.
They pretended to eat the noodles with their spoons. They had fun making slurping noises. They finished their soup and smiled at each other.
"That was the best soup ever!" Lily said.
"Yes, it was!" Ben said. "But next time, let's include cheese!"
