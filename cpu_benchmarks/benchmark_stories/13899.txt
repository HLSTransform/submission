Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She loved to eat popcorn. One day, her mom bought a big bag of cheap popcorn. Amy was very happy.
Amy's mom said, "Let's wrap the popcorn in a pretty bag and share it with our friends." So, they found a nice bag and put the popcorn inside. They wrapped the bag with a bow.
Amy and her mom went to their friends' house. Amy said, "We have a gift for you!" Her friends opened the bag and saw the popcorn. They all smiled and said, "Thank you!" They ate the popcorn together and had a fun day.
