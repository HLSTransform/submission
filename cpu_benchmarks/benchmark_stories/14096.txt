Once upon a time, there was a brave little boy called Peter. He loved playing in the bright sun and smiling at the people he met.
One day, he saw a bird that looked a little sad. It was sat on a branch and didn't move.
Peter said to the bird, "Don't worry, I can help!"
The bird just stared back.
Peter was very persistent, so he tried again. He found some food and put it on the branch next to the bird.
The bird started eating the food and soon flew away, singing a happy song.
Peter smiled. He had used his brave and persistent heart to help the bird. He enjoyed feeling the warm sun on his face again and he knew he had done something good.
