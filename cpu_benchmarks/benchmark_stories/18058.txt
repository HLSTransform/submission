Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her dolls and wear pretty dresses. One day, Lily's mom bought her a new dress. It was pink and had lots of sparkles on it. Lily was so happy!
But when it was time to put on the dress, Lily got confused. She didn't know which arm to put in which sleeve. "Mommy, I'm confused," Lily said. "Can you help me?"
"Of course, sweetie," said Lily's mom. "Let me show you how to put on the dress. You can learn how to do it yourself next time."
And so, Lily's mom helped her put on the pretty pink dress. Lily felt so happy and proud that she had learned something new. "Thank you, Mommy," Lily said. "I love my new dress!"
