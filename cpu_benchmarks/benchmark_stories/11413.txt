One day, a little nation was feeling very sad. They had not been able to hear for a long time, and they felt lonely. Every day they tried to talk to the other nations, but no one could hear them. 
Peter, the leader of this little nation, was determined to find a way to help his people. He knew he needed to find a way to let them be heard.
While walking through the marketplace, Peter noticed a scale. He had an idea. He bought the scale and carried it back to his nation.
That night, Peter gathered the people of his nation together. He explained his plan. He said, "Tonight we are going to weigh our love for each other. That way, everyone will know how much we care." 
Everyone was amazed. They all shared a hug and gathered around the scale. With each hug, the scale went higher and higher. Finally, it hit the top! Everyone was so happy!
They realized that love could be heard, even by the deaf. From then on, the people in the little nation were never lonely again.
