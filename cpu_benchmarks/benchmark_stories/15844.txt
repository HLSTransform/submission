One evening, a little girl set off on an adventure. She brought her furry teddy bear with her.
As she walked through the woods, Mama Owl hooted. "Come here , little one," Mama Owl said. "I want to show you something."
The little girl followed Mama Owl, who set a beautiful twig down on a nearby branch. Then she flew off into the night.
The twig glowed in the dark. The little girl was so excited! She picked it up and held it tightly.
Suddenly, there was a rustling in the trees. Out came two little owlets!
"Look what I found!" the little girl said to the owlets. The owlets were so excited to see the twig. They cuddled up close to it and the little girl could tell they felt safe.
The little girl said goodbye to her new friends and set off back to home with her furry teddy bear and the special twig she found. She was so happy to have such an exciting evening adventure!
