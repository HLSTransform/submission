Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside, especially when it rained. One day, he went outside to play and it started to rain. Timmy loved the rain because it made everything wet and he loved to splash in the puddles.
Timmy's mom called him inside and told him to sit on the couch. Timmy sat down and noticed a big chest in the corner of the room. He wondered what was inside the chest.
Later that day, Timmy's mom told him it was time for bed. Timmy climbed into his bed and closed his eyes. He thought about the chest and wondered what was inside. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise coming from the living room. Timmy got out of bed and went to see what it was. When he got to the living room, he saw that the chest was open and there was a big surprise inside!
