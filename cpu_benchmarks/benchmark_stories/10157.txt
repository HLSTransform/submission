Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, they saw a rat running around. Lily's friend, Timmy, said, "Look, a rat! Ew, it's gross!"
Lily said, "Don't tease the rat. It's just trying to find some food."
Timmy said, "But rats are scary!"
Lily said, "No, they're not. They're calm and cute."
Timmy looked at the rat again and saw that it was just sniffing around for crumbs. He said, "You're right, Lily. I'm sorry for teasing the rat."
Lily smiled and said, "It's okay. Let's go play on the swings now!" And they all ran off to play together.
