Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play together. One day, Anna has a big box. She says to Ben, "Look, I have a box. It is from my grandma. She lives far away. She sends me a box every month. Do you want to see what is inside?"
Ben is excited. He likes boxes. He says, "Yes, please. Can I help you open it?"
Anna nods. She says, "Of course. You are my friend. We can share. But we need a key. The box is locked. Where is the key?"
Anna and Ben look around. They see a red envelope on the table. Anna says, "Maybe the key is in there. Let's open it."
They run to the table. They open the envelope. They find a shiny key. Anna says, "Wow, this is the key. Thank you, grandma. Let's open the box."
They run back to the box. They use the key to open the lock. They lift the lid. They see many things. They see books, toys, candy, and a card. Anna says, "Look, grandma sent us many things. She is so nice. She says she loves us. She says she misses us. She says she hopes we have fun."
Ben says, "She is very nice. I love her too. I miss her too. And I have fun with you. Can we play with the toys?"
Anna says, "Yes, we can. We can read the books too. And we can eat the candy later. But first, let's say thank you to grandma. Let's make a card for her. And let's send it to her. She will be happy."
Anna and Ben hug. They are happy. They have a box. They have a key. They have a grandma. And they have each other.
