Once upon a time, there was a big boy named Tim. Tim liked to play with his tools. He had a big hammer and a shiny screwdriver. One day, Tim's mom asked him to tie his shoes. Tim didn't know how to tie his shoes. So, his mom showed him how to tie his shoes with a big knot. Tim was so happy that he could tie his shoes like a big boy now!
