Once upon a time, two kids went for a walk in the park. Everything was nice and fun until they came across a barber. The barber looked very scary!
One of the kids got so scared that he started to cry. But his friend was brave and said "Let's push the barber away!". So both the kids pushed the barber away.
The barber was so scared that he ran away. The brave kid then hugged his scared friend and they both laughed. They continued with their walk and had lots of fun!
