Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play hide-and-seek. One day, she asked her mommy to play with her.
"Mommy, do you want to play hide-and-seek with me?" asked Lily.
"Of course, sweetie! Let's play!" replied her mommy.
Lily counted to ten while her mommy hid. When she finished counting, she looked for her mommy. She looked under the bed, behind the curtains, and in the closet. Suddenly, she saw a ghost!
"Ahhhh! A ghost!" shouted Lily.
"Don't be scared, Lily. That's just a toy ghost. It's not real," explained her mommy.
Lily felt better and continued looking for her mommy. Finally, she found her hiding in the organized closet. They both laughed and hugged each other. They had so much fun playing together!
