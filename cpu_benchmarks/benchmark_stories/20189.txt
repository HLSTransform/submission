Tom and Mia are playing in the park. They see a huge slide. They want to go on it.
"Look, Mia, a huge slide!" Tom says. "Let's go on it!"
"OK, Tom, but be careful. It is very high." Mia says.
They run to the slide. They climb the steps. They sit on the top. They are ready to slide down.
"Are you ready, Mia?" Tom asks.
"Yes, Tom, I am ready. Are you?" Mia answers.
"Yes, Mia, I am ready. Let's go!" Tom says.
They slide down the slide. They go very fast. They feel the wind in their hair. They laugh and scream. They have fun.
They reach the bottom of the slide. They stand up. They are happy.
"That was fun, Tom!" Mia says.
"Yes, Mia, that was fun!" Tom says.
They hug each other. They are friends.
They hear a beep. It is Tom's mom's phone. She is sitting on a bench. She is watching them.
"Tom, Mia, come here. It is time to go home." She says.
"OK, mom, we are coming." Tom says.
They run to Tom's mom. She has a phone in her hand. It is a new phone. It is shiny and colorful. It has many buttons and pictures.
"Look, Tom, Mia, this is my new phone. Do you like it?" She asks.
"Wow, mom, your phone is huge!" Tom says.
"Yes, mom, your phone is huge!" Mia says.
They look at the phone. They touch the phone. They are curious.
"Can we play with your phone, mom?" Tom asks.
"Sorry, Tom, Mia, this phone is not for playing. It is for working. Maybe later I can show you some games on it." She says.
"OK, mom, we understand." Tom says.
"Yes, mom, we understand." Mia says.
They are a little sad. They want to play with the phone. But they know they have to listen to mom.
They say goodbye to the park. They say goodbye to the slide. They get in the car. They go home.
They still have fun. They talk and sing. They look out the window. They see many things.
They love mom. They love her new phone. They love each other. They are happy.
