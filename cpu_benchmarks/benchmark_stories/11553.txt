One day, a weak bird named Tim wanted to deliver music to his friends. He lived in a big tree with many other birds. Tim loved to sing and make music, but he was not as strong as the other birds.
One morning, Tim met a big bird named Sam. Tim said, "Sam, I want to deliver music to our friends, but I am weak. Can you help me?" Sam smiled and said, "Yes, Tim! I can help you. We can make music together and share it with everyone."
Tim and Sam worked together to create beautiful music. Tim sang with his weak but sweet voice, and Sam played his strong wings like drums. The other birds heard the music and came to listen. They all loved the music and danced together.
In the end, Tim was happy because he could deliver music to his friends even though he was weak. And Sam was happy too, because he made a new friend in Tim. They all played and sang together, making the forest a happy place for everyone.
