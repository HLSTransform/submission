One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park. He was a lucky boy because he had a new toy car to play with. He took his toy car and a big bottle of juice with him. Tim was very happy.
At the park, Tim met a girl named Sue. Sue was trying to tie her shoe but she was having a hard time. "Can you help me tie my shoe?" she asked Tim. Tim said, "Yes, I can help you." So Tim helped Sue tie her shoe and they became friends.
Tim and Sue played with the toy car and they got thirsty. Tim shared his juice with Sue. They both drank the juice and felt happy. They played in the park all day and had lots of fun. At the end of the day, they said goodbye and went home. Tim and Sue were both very lucky to have made a new friend.
