Tommy was so proud of himself when he crawled across the living room. With just one push of his hands and two feet, he had made it all the way across! He was so proud that he started to dance.
Just then, his mom looked over at him and said, "Tommy, look at the skull on the floor! You should crawl over to it and give it a big hug."
Tommy hesitated but then he started crawling again. When he got to the skull, he gave it the biggest hug he could. Then he bent down and said, "Hello skull, I'm Tommy and I'm very proud of myself!" 
Tommy's mom smiled and said, "I'm so proud of you, Tommy! You made it all the way across the room without stopping." 
Tommy grinned as he crawled back to his mom. Then he hugged her and said, "I'm so proud that I made it across the room. Can we do it again?" 
Tommy's mom nodded and said, "I'm sure you can. Now let's get back to crawling!"
