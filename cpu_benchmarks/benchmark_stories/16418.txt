Tom is a boy who likes to eat toast for breakfast. He likes to put jam and butter on his toast. He likes to eat his toast with his mom and dad.
One morning, Tom wakes up and smells something new. He gets out of his bed and follows his nose. He goes to the kitchen and sees his mom making toast. But the toast is not like the toast he knows. The toast is big and round and has holes in it.
"Mom, what is that?" Tom asks.
"That is a bagel, Tom. It is a kind of toast that some people like to eat. Do you want to try it?" Mom says.
Tom is curious. He nods his head and says, "Yes, please."
Mom cuts the bagel in half and puts it in the toaster. She takes it out and puts cream cheese on it. She gives one half to Tom and one half to Dad.
Tom takes a bite of the bagel. He likes it. It is soft and chewy and creamy. He smiles and says, "Yum, this is good toast. Thank you, Mom."
Mom smiles and says, "You're welcome, Tom. I'm glad you like it. Maybe we can have bagels more often."
Tom nods and says, "Yes, please. I like new toast." He eats his bagel and feels happy. He likes to try new things. He likes to follow his nose. He likes to eat toast with his mom and dad.
