Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to draw with her pastel colors. She had a big box full of different colors and she kept them organized in her room. 
One day, Lily decided to plant a flower. She dug a small hole in the ground and put a seed in it. She watered it every day and watched it grow bigger and bigger. 
After a few weeks, the flower had grown tall and had beautiful petals. Lily was so happy to see her flower grow. She picked a pastel pink color and drew a picture of her flower. She kept it organized with her other drawings in her room. The end.
