John sat in the garden and stared up at the sky. It was a beautiful day, and he noticed something small flying around up there. It was a mail bird! He watched the mail bird deliver a special letter to the people who lived next door. 
John wanted one of his own. He ran inside and asked his mom for help. She smiled and said, "I can make one for you!" She handed him a small piece of paper and some art supplies. 
John carefully drew a picture of a bird on the paper and decorated it with colorful markers. He stuck two tiny feathers onto the paper bird's back. Lastly, he waved his magic wand over the bird and said, "I wish for you to fly!" The paper bird started to flutter around the room! 
John was so pleased with his creation that he sat and stared at it for a while. The mail bird flew around, delivering warm wishes to everyone in the house. John was amazed at what he had madeâ€”it was his own magical mail bird!
