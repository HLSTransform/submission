Once there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a very special toy at home. It was a big box of special things that she could mix. On special days, when she was feeling happy, she would take her box and mix the special things inside it.
One day Lucy took her box of special things to school. She wanted to mix the special things with her friends. But when she opened the box, one of her special things was broken. She felt so sad and hurt.
So Lucy took her broken special thing home with her and grabbed some glue. She mixed the glue on the broken special thing and then mixed it back in her box. Now it was good as new! Lucy was so happy. She hugged her box and ran to show her mom. 
Her mom said, "Mixed the special things, did you? That was a very smart thing to do, Lucy! Now the mix of special things in your box will always be safe and happy, no matter what happens!" Lucy ran back to her room, happy to have fixed her broken toy.
