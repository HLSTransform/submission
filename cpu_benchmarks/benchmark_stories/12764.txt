Mummy was in the kitchen, cooking something. It smelled delicious!
"Mummy, what are you cooking?" asked little Lucy.
"I'm making something special, just for you," said Mummy.
Suddenly, Daddy came home. "What smells so delicious?" he asked.
Mummy put on her oven glove and opened the oven door. "Would you like to try it?" she asked.
Daddy tasted it. "Mmm, it's so yummy!" he said.
Little Lucy wanted to have a taste too, so Mummy put some of the delicious food in a bowl for her.
"Let's all drink something yummy to go with it," said Mummy. 
So, the three of them each had a big glass of juice to drink with their delicious meal.
