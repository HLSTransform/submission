Once upon a time, there was a brave lion. He had a big fierce roar that scared all the animals in the jungle. One day, the lion's belt broke and he felt very sad. He couldn't go out and play with his friends because his pants kept falling down.
So, the lion decided to go to the river to fill his belly with water. He walked for a long time until he found a big river. The lion drank lots of water until his belly was full. While he was drinking, he saw a crocodile with a big belt around his waist.
The lion asked the crocodile where he got the belt from. The crocodile told him that he found it in the river. The lion was very happy and asked the crocodile if he could have the belt. The crocodile said yes and gave the belt to the lion. The lion put on the belt and it fit perfectly. Now, he could go out and play with his friends again!
