Once upon a time there was a boy and a girl who met in the park. They were very excited to meet each other, and the girl had something special to show the boy.
The girl said, "I have been working for weeks on a special project. It's an incredible stitch!" The boy's eyes lit up. He couldn't believe how perfect it was.
But then the boy had an idea. "Let's try stitching something together!" he said. The girl smiled and agreed. 
They got to work, but soon enough they ran into a problem. They were stuck, and they didn't know how to finish their special project. The girl and boy tried over and over but they couldn't figure it out. 
Suddenly, an amazing surprise happened. A big bird flew right out of the sky. It gently grabbed the project in its beak, and then flew away. The girl and boy both watched, amazed. 
The next day the bird came back with something incredible! It had finished the special project perfectly. The girl and the boy both were thrilled, and they hugged each other.
From then on, the girl and the boy were best friends who loved to stitch together!
