Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a mighty tree. This tree had a small hole in it. A tiny bird lived in the hole. The bird had many friends in the forest.
One day, the tiny bird heard a whisper. It was a squirrel. The squirrel was sad because he lost his nut. The tiny bird wanted to help his friend. So, they looked for the nut together.
They looked and looked, and then they found the nut near a big rock. The squirrel was very happy. The tiny bird and the squirrel went back to the mighty tree and played all day. They were the best of friends.
