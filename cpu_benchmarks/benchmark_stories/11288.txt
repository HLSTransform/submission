Once upon a time there was a badboy who was always causing trouble. His mommy was getting tired of him and decided to punish him. She said to the boy, "If you don't listen, I will take away a strip."
The boy didn't listen and sure enough his mommy took away a strip. Then she said, "You need to eat your sour fruit, or else you won't get the strip back."
The boy thought the fruit was too sour, but he still ate it. When he did his mommy said, "That's better. Now you can have your strip back." 
The badboy was happy and promised to be good from now on. He understood that when mommy said to listen, he had to do it, otherwise he would get punished.
