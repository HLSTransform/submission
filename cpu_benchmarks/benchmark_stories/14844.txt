Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite teddy bear named Brownie. One day, Lily's mom gave her a big, scary pill to take. Lily was afraid to take it.
"I don't want to take this pill, mommy. It's scary," Lily said.
"It's okay, sweetie. It will make you feel better. Just swallow it and you can have a treat," her mom replied.
Lily closed her eyes and swallowed the pill. She made a funny face and her mom laughed.
After a while, Lily felt much better. She went to her room to play with Brownie. She decided to hang him up on the wall with a string.
"Look, Brownie! You're hanging on the wall like a picture!" Lily said.
Brownie didn't say anything, but he was happy to be hanging up high for everyone to see.
