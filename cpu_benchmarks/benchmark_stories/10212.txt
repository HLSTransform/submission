Once upon a time, there was a cheerful cat named Max. Max loved to stretch in the warm sun. He would stretch his long legs and wiggle his little nose. Max lived in a small house with his best friend, a little girl named Lily.
One day, Max and Lily saw a big jug in the kitchen. The jug was full of cold water. Max and Lily were thirsty, so they wanted to get some water from the jug. Max stretched his legs and jumped up on the table. He tried to push the jug, but it was too heavy.
Lily had an idea. She found a small cup and gave it to Max. Max used the cup to get some water from the jug. He filled the cup and jumped down to share it with Lily. They both drank the cold water and felt very happy. Max and Lily learned that they could do anything if they worked together. And from that day on, they always helped each other and stayed the best of friends.
