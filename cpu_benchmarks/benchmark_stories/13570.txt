Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the park to play. She saw a big slide and wanted to go on it. She climbed up and slid down, it was so much fun!
Suddenly, Lily saw a dull insect on the slide. She didn't want to hurt it, so she gently picked it up. But then a boy came and said, "Ew, bugs are gross! Get rid of it!"
Lily didn't know what to do. She didn't want to hurt the insect, but she didn't want the boy to be mean. So, she said, "No, insects are cool. Look how pretty it is." The boy looked at the insect and said, "Wow, you're right. It is cool." And then they both watched the insect fly away.
