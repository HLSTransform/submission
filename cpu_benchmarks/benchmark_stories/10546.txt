Once upon a time, there were two little brothers. One brother was three years old, the other was his big brother who was six. 
One day, the little brother had a great plan. He climbed up to his big brother's bedside and whispered in his ear. "Let's play a game!" 
"What kind of game?" asked his big brother. "Let's see who can build the tallest tower!"
The big brother smiled. He loved games. So they decided to get started. 
While they were playing, they came across a small radio laying nearby. The little brother's eyes lit up. 
"I have an even better plan!" he said. "Let's put the radio in the middle of our tower. That way when the tower is tall, we can listen to music while we play!"
The big brother agreed. He quickly grabbed the radio and put it right in the middle. He wrapped it up tight with some string. 
Soon enough, their tower was towering over them! They celebrated by turning on the radio and listening to their favorite song. 
And that's the story of how the two little brothers had a great plan and built the tallest tower!
