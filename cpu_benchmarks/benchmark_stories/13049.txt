Once upon a time, there was a lively dancer. She twirled around and made everyone smile. All of the people at the show watched her gracefully spin. They were so amazed by her dancing!
The dancer loved to create. She could make new moves by spinning and leaping. She could also create beautiful costumes with sparkles and colors. Everyone was so impressed!
But one day the lively dancer stopped dancing. She couldn't create like she used to. All of the people were so sad. They missed seeing her spin and twirl.
Then a magical thing happened. One of the little kids at the show was so inspired by the lively dancer. He woke up one day with a new idea. He had created a new move just like the dancer!
Everyone smiled when they saw it. The little kid's move was just as lively as the dancer! Everyone started to clap and cheer for him. He was the happiest he had ever been and so was the dancer. She was so proud of him.
