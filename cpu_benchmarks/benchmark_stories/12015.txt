Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to paint with her bright colors. One day, Lily saw a laser pointer and thought it was so cool. She wanted to play with it, but her mom said no because it was dangerous. 
Lily didn't listen and took the laser pointer anyway. She shined it in her eyes and it hurt so much that she started crying. Her mom saw what happened and took the laser pointer away. She told Lily that lasers are not toys and can hurt people. 
From that day on, Lily learned that it's important to listen to her mom and not play with dangerous things. She went back to painting with her bright colors and was happy knowing that she was safe. The end.
