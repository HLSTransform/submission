Once upon a time, there was a thin bird who wanted to soar in the sky. She looked up to the bright blue sky and spread her wings. Then she jumped with all her might. But the bird was too weak. She fell down and broke a vase.
The bird's mother said, "You can't soar high into the sky. Oh, why did you try?"
The bird shook her head and said, "But I wanted to soar. I'm sorry I broke the vase."
The bird's mother said, "You must have patience before you try to soar so high. Now look at this broken vase. It's all your fault!"
The bird was so sad. She knew she would never soar high in the sky. She stayed in the nest, looking up at the bright blue sky. She wished she could feel the wind soar around her.
