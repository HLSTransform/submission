Once upon a time, there was a little boy who was very careful. He was very careful when playing with his toys. He was also careful when he ate his meals.
One night, the little boy decided to make a pan of soup for dinner. He was very careful when handling the pan so he wouldn't get hurt. When the soup was done cooking, the little boy ate it and then went to bed.
The little boy had a very comfortable bed, and he fell asleep quickly. He was so tired that he slept soundly all through the night. In the morning, the boy awoke feeling well rested.
The little boy learned that being careful is always important. He was thankful that he had been so careful with the pan, or else he might not have had such a good night's sleep.
