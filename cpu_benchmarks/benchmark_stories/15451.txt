Once there was a sad little boy. He wanted to have some popcorn, so he went to the kitchen to get it. But when he opened the cupboard all he found was an empty box. He was so sad he started to yell. Suddenly, he heard a noise outside. He opened the door and saw his mom with a big bag of popcorn. She had gone to the store to get it for him. The boy was so happy he started to yell even louder. He hugged his mom and they started eating the popcorn. The boy was so happy that he wasn't sad anymore. He knew he could always count on his mom to make him feel better.
