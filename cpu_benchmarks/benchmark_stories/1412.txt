Once upon a time, two friends named Jack and Jill were walking through the woods. As they walked, Jack saw a bright light coming from behind a tree. It was a big, round bulb that was shining light all around it.
The friends were very excited! They quickly grabbed the bulb and held it up so they could get a closer look. Inside the bulb was a very rich, sparkling gold!
Jill was so amazed, she couldn't believe what she was seeing. She shouted, "Let's take it home!"
Jack agreed, so the two friends quickly made their way home. They put the bulb into the ground and waited.
As the sun began to rise in the morning, the bulb lit up the sky. Jack and Jill looked up in awe as the light from the bulb rose high into the sky. Soon, the sky was filled with a golden brightness.
Jack and Jill were so proud of their new bulb. The rich golden light would remind them of their amazing adventure in the woods forever.
