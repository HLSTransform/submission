Once upon a time, there were two friends called Jack and Jill. They were best friends and always played together.
One day, Jack was careless and forgot to close the gate. Suddenly, a big wolf appeared! Jill was very scared, but Jack tried to be brave.
The wolf said he was only lost and was looking for his family. Jack felt bad and wanted to help the wolf. So he opened the gate and showed the wolf the way home.
The wolf thanked Jack and left. Jack remembered to close the gate and never forgot again. Jack and Jill were very happy that the wolf was safe.
They were happy they could help the wolf and that nothing bad had happened. From then on, Jack and Jill were very careful not to forget things.
