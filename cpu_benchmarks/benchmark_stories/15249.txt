Jane and her dad were at the beach. The sand was white and the sea was blue. Jane picked up a round jug from the sand. It was big and heavy. She twisted the lid, but it was not open. 
Her dad looked at the jug. He had a big smile on his face. He said it was time for a little game. He rolled up his sleeves and got to work. He twisted and turned the lid until it opened with a pop.
Inside the jug was a bald fish! Jane laughed and clapped. She gave the fish a big hug. Jane and her dad put the fish back in the sea. It swam away in the sun. 
Jane and her dad watched the fish until it was out of sight. Then Jane gave her dad a big hug and they went home to tell Mom all about their game at the beach.
