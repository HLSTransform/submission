Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a rag doll that she loved very much. The doll was her loyal friend and went everywhere with her. One day, Lily and her doll went to the park to gather flowers. They found lots of pretty flowers and put them in a basket. When they got home, Lily's mom helped her make a bouquet with the flowers. Lily put the bouquet in a vase and her loyal doll sat next to it. They were very happy together. The end.
