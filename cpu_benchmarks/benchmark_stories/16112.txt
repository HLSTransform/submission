One day, Tom was walking home from the grocery store. He saw a man painting a large well in the middle of the field.
Tom stopped and asked the man, "What are you doing?"
The man stopped and smiled. "I'm painting this well so everyone can see it," he said.
Tom asked, "But why?"
The man said, "Because it is a fierce well. People must be able to see it from far away."
Tom smiled. "That sounds cool!"
The man smiled back. "It sure is! Now I must go back to painting."
Tom watched as the man painted the well with fierce colours. The man worked hard until the well was a bright and beautiful sight. Tom waved goodbye and began walking home, feeling content and proud of the man's hard work.
