One day, a little frog named Tim jumped high and wide. He loved to show off his jumps to his friends. They would clap their hands, or "applaud", when he jumped.
One day, a big bird saw Tim jumping. The bird opened its big, wide mouth and said, "Hey, little frog, I can jump higher than you!" Tim looked at the bird and said, "No, you can't! I am the best jumper!"
The bird and Tim had a jumping contest. They both jumped high and wide. Tim's friends watched and waited. When it was over, the bird had jumped higher. Tim's friends still applauded for him because they knew he tried his best. Tim learned that it was okay not to be the best, as long as he had fun and tried his best.
