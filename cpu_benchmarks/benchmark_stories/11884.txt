Once upon a time there were two brothers, Jake and Mike. Jake was very envious of his brother's prune.
One day, while the brothers were out in the park, they received a surprise!
Mike said to Jake, "Look! A prune!"
Jake was so envious. He wanted a prune too.
So Mike said to him, "OK, we can share it."
The brothers took turns taking bites of the prune. But soon the prune began to rot.
Mike said, "We should have eaten it all at once!"
Jake looked sadly at the rotting prune and said, "Let's go find another one."
And they did. The end.
