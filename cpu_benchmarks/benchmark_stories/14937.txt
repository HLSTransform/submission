Jenny and her parents were in the living room of their modern house. Jenny was looking around and saw a very large carpet. She asked her parents what it was for.
Her father said it was a puzzle carpet. Jenny was surprised and asked, "A puzzle carpet? What is that?"
Her father explained that it was a carpet with all sorts of pieces of puzzles on it. The challenge was to solve all the puzzles that were hidden in the carpet.
Jenny was excited and asked if she could try to solve the puzzles. Her parents said yes and gave her some help.
Jenny spent the next few hours trying to solve the puzzles. Every time she solved one, she felt very happy. Eventually, she solved all the puzzles on the modern carpet. She was very excited and proud of herself.
