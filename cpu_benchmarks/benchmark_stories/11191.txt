Once upon a time there was a very jolly rabbit called Timmy. He lived in a wood with all his friends. Every morning he would spring around the tree, hopping and skipping as far as he could.
One morning, Timmy decided to race his friends. He and his friends sprang around the tree together, hopping and skipping faster and faster. Timmy's friends cheered him on as he raced and soon enough, he was declared the winner. 
"You did it!"his friends said. 
"I'm the fastest!" said Timmy.
"Here," said his friends, “take this lovely trophy as a reward".
Timmy was delighted to receive the trophy and couldn't thank his friends enough. He ran home with the trophy and proudly showed it off to his family. 
However, the next morning, Timmy had a surprise for his friends. When they arrived, Timmy was holding a bigger trophy, one he had made from clay and twigs.
"I wanted you all to have a trophy," he said, “In return for all the fun you give me”.
His friends were so touched that Timmy had chosen to give back to them. From then on, Timmy and his friends shared their wins. They learned the important lesson that even when you win, you can still find joy in sharing it with others.
