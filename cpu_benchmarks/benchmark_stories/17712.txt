One day Joe was on a trip with his family. He was having fun looking out the window of the car, but then it started to rain. Joe was sad, because he couldn't see out of the window anymore.
That's when His Mom had an idea. She made a request for Joe to close his eyes tight and pretend he could still see. Joe was a bit stubborn at first, but eventually he did as he was asked. 
With his eyes closed, Joe used his imagination and all the things around him to make up a new sight. He imagined he was in a grassy field with a big pink tree and a sparkling river. He began to feel happier and the rain had stopped. 
When Joe opened his eyes, he was surprised to find he was still in the car. He was just as happy, because he had still enjoyed the sight even though he had been in the car.
