One day, Bob was walking in the park. He saw a big herb. He was very happy and decided to take it home. He was almost finished picking the herb when he heard a noise. He looked around and saw an angry dog staring at him. Bob was scared and started to run. The dog chased him and kept barking.
Bob could feel his heart pounding. He ran to a nearby tree and climbed up. The angry dog followed him and watched from the ground. Bob stayed very still and did not move. After a long time the dog gave up and left.
Bob climbed down from the tree and looked at his herb. He smiled and was very happy that he could take it home. He hugged the herb like a friend and went back home. From then on, Bob always watched out for angry dogs when he went to the park.
