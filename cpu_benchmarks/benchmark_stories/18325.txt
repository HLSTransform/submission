One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mom. They brought a basket of snacks to eat. Lily's mom warned her not to wander too far away. 
Lily saw a butterfly and chased it. She followed it to a tree where a boy was sitting. The boy had a toy truck. Lily asked him if she could play with it. The boy said no and ran away. 
Lily was sad and went back to her mom. She saw that her snacks were gone. She asked her mom if she ate them all. Her mom said no and asked if anyone else was near their blanket. Lily said yes and told her mom about the boy with the toy truck. 
Her mom realized that the boy must have stolen their snacks. She told Lily that it's not nice to steal and asked her if she had any questions. Lily asked what "steal" meant. Her mom explained that it means taking something that doesn't belong to you. 
Lily was upset but her mom reminded her that the snacks were just things and that they could always get more. She also reminded her to be careful and not talk to strangers. From that day on, Lily made sure to keep her things close and to always ask her mom if she had any questions.
