One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. He saw a blue ball near a tree. Tim ran to the ball and picked it up. "Look, Mom!" he said, "I found a ball!"
As Tim played with the ball, he saw a big dog. The dog watched Tim and wanted to play too. Tim threw the ball, and the dog ran to get it. They played together and had fun.
Then, Tim saw a handle on a box under the tree. He wanted to see what was inside. "Can I open it, Mom?" he asked. "No, Tim," said his mom, "We don't know who it belongs to." But Tim did not listen. He opened the box and a big wind came out. It blew the blue ball far away. Tim was sad because he lost his new ball.
