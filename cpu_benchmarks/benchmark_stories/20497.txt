Once upon a time, there was a fierce monster. Everyone stayed away from it. One day, a brave girl saw the monster and admired it. She was brave enough to take a step closer. She held out her hand and waved hello. The monster was so surprised! It waved back with a smile.
The brave girl had a string in her pocket. She showed it to the monster and asked if it wanted to play. The monster nodded yes. For hours they played a game of tug of war with the string. They laughed and had a great time.
At the end of the day, the brave girl and the fierce monster said goodbye. The brave girl admired the monster for being so nice, and the monster admired the brave girl for her courage. This was the start of a beautiful friendship.
