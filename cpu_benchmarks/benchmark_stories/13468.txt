Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the snow with her mittens on. One day, she lost one of her mittens in the snow. She looked and looked, but she couldn't find it anywhere. 
Lily was sad because her hands were getting cold without her mitten. Suddenly, her dad had an idea. He said, "Let's reverse our steps and see if we can find your mitten!" So, they walked back the way they came and looked for the missing mitten. 
After a while, they found the mitten buried under the heavy snow. Lily was so happy and put her mitten back on her hand. She thanked her dad for helping her find it and they went back inside to drink hot cocoa. The end.
