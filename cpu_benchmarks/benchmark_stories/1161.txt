Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to decorate his room with colorful things. One day, he found a big box on the side of his house. Tim was very excited and could not wait to see what was inside the box.
Tim opened the box and found many pretty things to decorate his room. There were shiny stars, soft clouds, and even a big rainbow. Tim felt a little guilty because he did not know if the box was for him. But he wanted his room to look nice, so he took the things and started to decorate his room.
When Tim's mom came home, she saw the beautiful room and asked Tim where he got the pretty things. Tim told her about the box on the side of the house. His mom smiled and said, "That box was a surprise for you, Tim! I am happy you found it." Tim felt happy too, and they both enjoyed the pretty room together.
