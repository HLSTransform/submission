Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was only three years old. Lucy loved to explore her house but today she was feeling scared.
She tip-toed through her house until she found the kitchen. She was scared of the kitchen because it was so dark and brown. She could hear strange noises coming from inside. 
Lucy held her teddy bear tight and stepped into the kitchen. She was scared but she was brave too. Lucy walked over to the big brown door and opened it. 
Suddenly out jumped the biggest, softest, fluffiest cat she had ever seen! Lucy was so surprised she screamed out loud. Then she burst out laughing.
The cat was very friendly and loved to be tickled. Lucy had never been so happy before! She knew she would never be scared of the kitchen again.
