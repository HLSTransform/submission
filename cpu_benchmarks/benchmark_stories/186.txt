Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved motorcycles and he always dreamed of having one. One day, he saw a man riding a big motorcycle and he asked him, "Can I ride your motorcycle?" The man replied, "No, it's not safe for a little boy like you."
Timmy was sad and tired of waiting to ride a motorcycle. Then, he met a girl named Lily. They became good friends and Timmy told her about his dream of riding a motorcycle. Lily said, "I know someone who can help you. He's my uncle and he has a motorcycle. Maybe he can teach you how to ride it."
Timmy was so happy and grateful to Lily. He went to meet her uncle and he taught him how to ride the motorcycle safely. Timmy was so excited that he said, "Lily, when I grow up, I'm going to marry you for being such a good friend and helping me achieve my dream." Lily smiled and said, "I'm happy to be your friend forever." The moral of the story is that true friendship can help you achieve your dreams.
