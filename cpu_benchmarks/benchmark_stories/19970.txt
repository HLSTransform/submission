Tom and Sue were friends. They liked to play in the park. But today the sky was gloomy and it rained. They could not go to the park.
"I am sad," Tom said. "I want to play."
"Me too," Sue said. "But we can play at home. We can make a fort with pillows and blankets."
They went to Tom's house and made a fort in the living room. They had fun pretending to be pirates and explorers. They found some toys and books in the fort.
"Look, I found money!" Tom said. He held up a shiny coin.
"Wow, that is cool!" Sue said. "Where did you find it?"
"It was under the sofa. Maybe it is a treasure," Tom said.
"Maybe we can buy something with it," Sue said. "Like candy or stickers."
They thought about what they could buy with the money. They had many ideas.
But then they heard a knock on the door. It was Tom's mom. She looked worried.
"Tom, Sue, can you come here for a minute?" she said.
They left the fort and went to the door. They saw a man with a big bag. He was the mailman.
"Hello, kids," the mailman said. "I have a letter for your mom. It is very important."
He gave the letter to Tom's mom. She opened it and read it. She smiled.
"Oh, thank you, thank you!" she said. "This is the best news ever!"
"What is it, mom?" Tom asked.
"It is a check, Tom. It is money. It is from your grandma. She sent it to help us pay the bills. We have been having a hard time, you know. But now we can pay the rent and buy some food and clothes. We are so lucky!"
Tom and Sue looked at each other. They felt happy for Tom's mom. They also felt something else. They felt generous.
"Mom, we have something for you too," Tom said. He gave her the coin he found.
"It is money too. It is a treasure. We want to help you too," he said.
Tom's mom hugged him and Sue. She had tears in her eyes.
"Thank you, thank you, my sweet kids," she said. "You are the best treasure ever. You are so kind and thoughtful. I love you so much."
They all hugged and smiled. The rain stopped and the sun came out. The day was not gloomy anymore. It was bright and happy.
