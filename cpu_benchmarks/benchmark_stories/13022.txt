One day, Mikey was walking in the park. He heard a noise nearby and he went to check it out. It was his friend Daisy crying because someone had been selfish. She was very upset.
Mikey asked Daisy what had happened. She said that someone had taken her mug and she was very sad about it. Mikey felt bad for his friend and he wanted to help.
Mikey thought for a moment and then he had an idea. He told Daisy that he would go look for the mug and try to get it back for her. 
Daisy thanked Mikey, and he ran off to look for the mug. After searching for a while, Mikey saw the mug in the distance. He was so excited and he ran over to get it. 
When Mikey got back to Daisy with the mug, her eyes lit up and she gave Mikey a big hug. Daisy was so happy to have her mug back and Mikey was happy that he could help.
