Sam and Max liked to play golf with their dad. They had small sticks and balls that they hit on the grass. Sometimes they hit the balls very far, and sometimes they hit them very near. They had fun and laughed a lot.
One day, they found a weird ball in the grass. It was green and shiny, and it had a hole in it. Sam picked it up and showed it to Max.
"Look, Max, what is this?" Sam asked.
"I don't know, Sam, maybe it is a magic ball," Max said.
"Let's hit it and see what happens," Sam said.
They took their sticks and hit the ball together. But the ball did not fly. It split in two and made a loud noise. Out of the ball came a lot of candy and toys. Sam and Max were surprised and happy.
"Wow, Sam, this is a great ball, it is a candy ball!" Max said.
"Yay, Max, let's eat some candy and play with the toys!" Sam said.
They ran to the ball and grabbed the candy and toys. They shared them with their dad, who was also amazed by the weird ball. They had a very sweet and fun day.
