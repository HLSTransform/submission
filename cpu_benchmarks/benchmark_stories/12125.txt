Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo lived in a deep blue sea with his fish friends. One day, Nemo saw a big tube floating in the water. He swam closer to it and saw that it was empty. Nemo had an idea! He wanted to load the tube with lots of shiny pebbles. 
Nemo asked his friends to help him collect the pebbles. They all swam around and found the shiniest pebbles they could. Then, they carefully put the pebbles into the tube until it was full. Nemo was so happy that they had filled the tube! 
Nemo and his friends pushed the tube along the sea floor, and it made a loud noise as it rolled over the rocks. They were having so much fun that they didn't notice a big shadow above them. It was a hungry shark! Nemo and his friends quickly swam away, but the tube was too heavy to carry. The shark took a bite and the pebbles spilled out. Nemo and his friends were sad, but they knew they could always find more pebbles to load into the tube another day.
