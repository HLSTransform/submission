Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily became very angry because she couldn't find her favorite toy. She searched everywhere in her room, but she couldn't find it. 
Lily's mom saw her daughter was upset and asked her what was wrong. Lily told her mom about her missing toy. Her mom helped her search for it, but they still couldn't find it. 
Lily's mom then told her a story about a little girl who lost her favorite toy, but instead of getting angry, she decided to look for it with a happy heart. And do you know what happened? The little girl found her toy! 
Lily realized that getting angry didn't help her find her toy. She decided to search for it with a happy heart, just like the little girl in the story. And guess what? She found her toy too! The moral of the story is that when we stay calm and happy, we can find what we are looking for.
