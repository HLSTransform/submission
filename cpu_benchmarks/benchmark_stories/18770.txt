Tom is a fat otter who likes to play in the river. He has many friends who swim and splash with him. But sometimes Tom is naughty and does not listen to his mom. She tells him to stay close to the bank and not to go too far. But Tom wants to explore and see new things.
One day, Tom sees a big fish in the water. He thinks it is a toy and chases it. He swims faster and faster, and forgets about his mom. He does not hear her calling his name. He does not see the fish is a pike, with sharp teeth and a hungry look.
The pike turns around and snaps at Tom. Tom is scared and tries to run away. He cries for help. His mom hears him and swims to him. She bites the pike and makes it go away. She hugs Tom and says, "Are you okay, my baby?"
Tom is sorry and says, "I'm okay, mom. I'm sorry, mom. I was bad. I did not listen to you. I followed the fish. It was not a toy. It was a mean fish. It wanted to eat me."
His mom says, "I'm glad you are okay, Tom. But you were very naughty. You could have been hurt. You have to listen to me. I know what is good for you. I love you, Tom. But I have to punish you. You cannot play in the river for two days. You have to stay on the bank with me."
Tom is sad and says, "I'm sorry, mom. I love you, mom. I will listen to you. I will not be naughty again. Can I still play with my friends on the bank?"
His mom says, "Yes, you can play with your friends on the bank. But you have to be careful and stay close to me. And you have to say sorry to your friends for making them worry."
Tom says, "Okay, mom. I will say sorry to my friends. Thank you, mom. You are the best mom."
His mom says, "You are welcome, Tom. You are my best baby."
