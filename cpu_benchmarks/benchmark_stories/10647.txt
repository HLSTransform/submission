Once upon a time there lived a powerful dragon. He lived in a cave high in the mountains. Every day he liked to go out and play with the other dragons in the woods.
One day, while playing, the dragon went to a lake and soon his stomach started to growl. He wanted something to eat! Just then, a little boy named Jack approached. 
The dragon was scared and backed away. Jack noticed the dragon's hunger and said, "Don't be scared! I brought popcorn for you." 
The dragon looked at the popcorn, then looked at Jack. He expected the boy to run away, but Jack just smiled. 
The dragon asked, "Will you permit me to eat it?" Jack nodded yes and the dragon began to eat the popcorn. It was delicious! From then on, the dragon always looked forward to Jack's visits. 
Every day Jack would show up with a bag of popcorn and the dragon would permit him to stay as long as he wanted. Over time, the dragon and Jack became good friends, even though they were very different. 
But one day, something changed. Jack arrived with popcorn, but this time he also had a powerful wand. He waved the wand and the dragon was taken away by a magical force!
The dragon never saw Jack or the popcorn again. He still wonders what happened to his friend and why he had to leave so suddenly.
