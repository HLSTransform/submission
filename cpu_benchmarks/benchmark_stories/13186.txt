One day, a little bunny hopped through the woods. He felt calm and peaceful in the sunshine. Suddenly he noticed a container of lotion at the base of a tree. He was very excited and hopped closer to have a better look. 
He reached out and touched the lid and it opened. The bunny breathed in the sweet scent of the lotion and he wanted to try some. So he hopped closer and dipped his paw in. It felt so cool and soft, he couldn't help but giggle. 
He spent the rest of the day hopping around the woods, rubbing lotion on his fur until he felt super soft and smooth. He was so happy that he found the lotion, it made him feel so calm and content. 
The bunny hopped off into the woods, a calmer, softer bunny than ever before.
