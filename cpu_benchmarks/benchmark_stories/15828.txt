Joey was so excited. His mom and dad had told him they were all going to visit the farm. He ran around the house in circles, hopping with joy. Finally, it was time to leave and they were off.
At the farm, Joey's eyes lit up. He saw chickens and rabbits, cows and bulls. He ran up to the biggest bull on the farm and tried to grab its horn, but the bull quickly moved away. Joey felt disappointed.
Suddenly, he heard someone laugh. He looked around and saw an old man. The old man said, "Look at that funny little boy trying to grab the bull's horn!"
Joey smiled and replied, "Can I try again?"
The old man chuckled and said, "Sure thing, little fella!"
Joey happily ran up to the bull again and grabbed one of its horns. He laughed and said, "That was fun!"
The old man smiled and said, "That's what the farm is all about - having fun!"
