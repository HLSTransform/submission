A bunny hopped along the sidewalk until he came to a big billboard. He leaned in to look at it, but was startled when a big, red balloon bounced out of nowhere. The bunny jumped back, feeling scared. He quickly hopped to safety.
Just then, a little girl walked around the corner, clapping her hands. She was very excited when she saw the big, red balloon. She scooped it up with her tiny hands and shouted, "Wheeee! This is so much fun!"
The bunny watched as she bounced the balloon up and down in the air. He laughed and said, "It sure is a lot of fun bouncing a balloon."
The girl smiled and said, "Yes, I love it! I'm so glad we found it."
The bunny nodded, feeling happy to have found something that made the little girl so happy. He said goodbye to the little girl and hopped away, with a big smile on his face.
