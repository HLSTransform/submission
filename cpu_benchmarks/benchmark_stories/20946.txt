Once upon a time, there was a little paw. The paw was purple and it belonged to a kitty cat. The paw was so small, but it had a big dream. The paw wanted to succeed.
So every morning, the little paw said to the sun: "Please help me succeed!"
The sun smiled and replied: "Have courage little paw. You can do it!"
The paw was so excited. It gathered all its strength and started to try. It tried and tried, and eventually it succeeded!
The little paw was so proud. It danced and sang as it ran through the town, shouting "I succeeded! I succeeded!" 
The other animals were so happy for the little paw. They cheered and clapped for its wonderful success.
The paw ran back home and proudly told its family about its success. Now the paw believed that it could do anything it wanted. And it would never give up trying to succeed.
