Mark loves jazz. He likes to listen to the music and dance with his feet and hands. He has a big drum and a small horn that he plays with. He makes loud and fun sounds.
One day, Mark goes to the park with his mom. He sees a big dog with black and white fur. The dog is fierce. He barks and growls at Mark and his mom. Mark is scared. He runs behind his mom and holds her hand.
"Mom, what is that?" Mark asks.
"That is a dog, Mark. He is not nice. He is fierce. We should stay away from him," his mom says.
Mark nods. He does not like the fierce dog. He wants to play with his drum and horn. He sees a bench near a tree. He runs to the bench and puts his drum and horn on it. He starts to play jazz. He taps the drum and blows the horn. He makes loud and fun sounds.
The fierce dog hears Mark's jazz. He is curious. He stops barking and growling. He walks to the bench and looks at Mark and his drum and horn. He sniffs them. He likes the sounds. He wags his tail.
Mark sees the dog. He is not scared anymore. He sees that the dog is not fierce. He is friendly. He smiles at the dog.
"Hi, dog. Do you like jazz?" Mark asks.
The dog barks. He likes jazz. He likes Mark. He jumps on the bench and licks Mark's face. Mark laughs. He hugs the dog.
"Mom, look! The dog is nice. He likes jazz. He likes me. Can we keep him?" Mark asks.
His mom smiles. She sees that the dog is nice. She sees that Mark is happy. She nods.
"OK, Mark. We can keep him. But we have to give him a name. What do you want to call him?" she asks.
Mark thinks. He has an idea.
"Jazz. I want to call him Jazz. He is my jazz dog," he says.
His mom agrees. She likes the name. She likes the dog. She likes Mark's jazz.
Mark and Jazz are happy. They play jazz together. They are friends.
