Tom and Anna liked to play in the living room. They had many toys and books to have fun with. But they had to be careful not to touch Mom's things on the table. Mom had a big glass ashtray that she used to put her cigarettes in. She said it was not for kids and it could break.
One day, Tom and Anna were playing with their cars and dolls. They made noises and pretended to go on trips. Tom wanted to be the driver and Anna wanted to be the boss. She was very bossy and told Tom what to do. Tom did not like that. He wanted to do his own thing.
He saw Mom's ashtray on the table. He thought it looked like a wheel. He wanted to use it for his car. He reached for it and grabbed it. Anna saw him and shouted.
"Tom, no! That's Mom's ashtray! Put it back!"
But Tom did not listen. He held the ashtray and spun it around. He thought it was fun. He did not see Mom coming into the living room. She saw Tom with her ashtray and got angry.
"Tom, what are you doing? Give me that ashtray right now!"
She walked towards Tom and tried to take the ashtray from him. Tom did not want to give it up. He pulled it back and tried to run away. But he tripped on a toy and fell down. He dropped the ashtray and it smashed on the floor. It made a loud noise and glass pieces flew everywhere.
Mom gasped and Anna cried. Tom felt scared and sorry. He hurt his hand and his knee. He looked at Mom and said.
"I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't mean to break your ashtray. I just wanted to play with it."
Mom sighed and hugged Tom. She said.
"I know, Tom. But you have to be more careful. The ashtray was not a toy. It was dangerous and sharp. You could have hurt yourself or Anna. Next time, ask me before you touch my things. And listen to Anna when she tells you to stop. She was trying to help you."
Tom nodded and said.
"OK, Mom. I'm sorry, Anna. I won't be bossy anymore. Can we still play?"
Anna smiled and said.
"OK, Tom. I'm sorry, too. I won't be bossy either. Can we play something else?"
Mom smiled and said.
"Of course, you can. But first, let me clean up this mess. And then, let me put a band-aid on your hand and your knee. And then, let me give you both a kiss. And then, you can play."
Tom and Anna said.
"Thank you, Mom. We love you."
Mom said.
"I love you, too. Now, let's go to the kitchen and get some cookies."
