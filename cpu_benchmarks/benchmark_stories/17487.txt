Tim and Lily were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big flag on a pole. The flag had many colors and shapes. Tim and Lily wanted to touch the flag, but they were nervous. They did not know if they were allowed to touch the flag.
They saw a man who was sitting on a bench near the flag. He was wearing a hat and a badge. He looked like he worked at the park. Tim and Lily walked up to him and said, "Hello, sir. Can we touch the flag?"
The man smiled and said, "Of course you can. The flag is for everyone to enjoy. It is a symbol of our country and our freedom. You can touch it gently and respectfully, but do not pull it or tear it."
Tim and Lily thanked the man and went to touch the flag. They felt the soft fabric and the different patterns. They learned that the flag had stars and stripes and that each one had a meaning. They felt happy and proud to touch the flag.
The man watched them and smiled again. He was glad that Tim and Lily were curious and polite. He thought that they were good children who loved their country. He hoped that they would always respect the flag and what it stood for.
The moral of the story is: We should be respectful and curious about the symbols of our country and learn their meanings.
