One day, a kind little girl named Lily was playing in her backyard. She liked to explore the garden and see all the beautiful flowers.
Suddenly, she heard a loud sound coming from the front lawn. She wondered what it was and decided to follow it.
As she stepped out to the front yard, she saw a big puppy playing with a toy. She smiled and said, "Hi! What's your name?" 
The puppy stopped playing and barked back, "My name is Spot! Would you like to play?" 
Lily was very excited. "Yes!" she said. She followed Spot around the lawn, chasing him and playing catch with the toy. They had lots of fun.
When it was time to go home Lily said goodbye to Spot and thanked him for being so kind and letting her play.
The puppy barked back and said, "You're welcome! Come and play with me anytime!"
