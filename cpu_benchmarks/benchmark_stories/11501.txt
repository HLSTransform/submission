One day, a little girl named Lily went for a walk in the wide park. She saw a big tree and a pretty flower. Lily loved to play in the park.
While playing, Lily saw something shiny. It was a small, silver angel. The angel was stuck in a block of ice. "Oh no!" said Lily, "The angel is freeze!"
Lily wanted to help the angel. She thought hard, and then had an idea. Lily hugged the ice and her warm hands made the ice melt. The angel was free!
The angel smiled at Lily and said, "Thank you for helping me!" The angel gave Lily a big hug and flew away. Lily felt happy and went home to tell her mom and dad about her new friend.
