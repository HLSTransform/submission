Once there was a little girl called Millie. She was only three and she was really excited to go and see a show at the theatre. As she walked into the theatre, Millie saw a big stage. It was so big and empty, like a huge box. 
Millie sat down in the front row and waited for the show to begin. Suddenly, the lights went dark and the stage lit up. Millie's eyes lit up too and she started to stare at the stage. Millie wanted the show to begin, but it seemed to take forever.
Suddenly, the stage lights went up again and Millie saw a funny man step onto the dry stage. He was wearing a funny hat and colourful clothes. Millie started to laugh and her eyes sparkled. 
The funny man smiled at Millie and said "Welcome! Are you ready to have some fun?" Millie nodded her head and clapped her hands in excitement. She couldn't wait to see the show.
