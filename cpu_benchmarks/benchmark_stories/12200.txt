Once upon a time, there was a young boy. His name was Max and he had a beautiful red wagon. He liked to take their wagon to the park and would smile and laugh every time he pushed it around.
One day, Max was feeling so sad and he couldn't figure out why. He pulled his wagon to the park, but he didn't feel like laughing like usual. Instead, Max sighed and looked at his wagon.
Max wanted to make it special and so he bubbled it with colored markers and made a big green bird on it. Then he stood back and smiled, now it was the best wagon ever!
Max felt happy and excited again and he started to push around his wagon around the park. He laughed and smiled, glad that he had made his wagon so special. And he would never forget the feel of that wagon, as it he pushed it around.
