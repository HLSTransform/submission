The little robot was perfect. It could do so many amazing things. But one day, it started to tremble. It shook and shook, until it was too weak to move. The little girl was so sad. She hugged the robot tight and wished someone could help.
Suddenly, the room grew brighter. A big red robot appeared. It was shiny and strong! It floated up to the little robot and touched it gently. The little robot started glowing and soon, it was as good as new.
The little robot was perfect again! The girl hugged the big red robot and thanked him. He smiled and floated away. The girl and the robot were both so happy!
