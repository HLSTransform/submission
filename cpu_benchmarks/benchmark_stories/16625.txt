Jenny loves to swing on the big swing in the park. She likes to go high and feel the wind in her hair. She swings with her friend Tom, who is also three years old. They laugh and sing as they swing.
One day, they see a big truck in the park. The truck has a picture of a dolphin on it. Jenny and Tom are curious. They run to the truck and look inside. They see a big tank with water and a dolphin. The dolphin looks sad. It does not smile or jump.
"Hello, dolphin!" Jenny says. "Why are you in the truck? Do you want to play?"
The dolphin does not answer. It just swims slowly in the tank. Jenny and Tom feel upset. They want to help the dolphin.
"Where are you taking the dolphin?" Tom asks the man who drives the truck.
The man looks at them and says, "I am taking the dolphin to the zoo. The dolphin is sick and needs a doctor."
"Can we go with you?" Jenny asks. "We want to see the dolphin get better."
The man shakes his head and says, "No, you cannot. The zoo is far away and you need to stay with your parents. But you can visit the dolphin at the zoo when it is well."
Jenny and Tom are disappointed. They say goodbye to the dolphin and hope it will be happy soon. They go back to the swing and swing again, but they do not laugh or sing as much as before. They think about the dolphin and wish it well.
