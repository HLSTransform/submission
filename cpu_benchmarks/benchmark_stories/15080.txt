Once there was a boy. His name was Luke. He was three years old.
One day, Luke found a tower. It was tall and made out of blocks. He was very excited. He started to play with the blocks.
Before long, Luke had made a tower of his own. He was so excited. He tried to make it as tall as the other tower. He giggled and laughed. It was very funny.
Once the tower was finished, Luke was happy. He wanted to show it to everybody. He ran outside and showed it to his mom. She was excited too.
Suddenly, there was a loud crash! The tower had fallen over! Luke was sad, but he was still excited. He started to build a new tower. This one was even funnier than before! He laughed and had lots of fun.
