Tom and Lily are twins. They like to play with their toys. But sometimes they fight over them. Tom is selfish. He wants all the toys for himself. He does not like to share.
One day, their uncle comes to visit. He brings a big box. Tom and Lily are excited. They think it is a new toy for them. They run to the box and try to open it. But their uncle stops them. He says, "Wait a minute. This is not a toy. This is a cake. I made it for your birthday."
Tom and Lily are surprised. They did not know it was their birthday. They look at the cake. It is chocolate with white frosting and sprinkles. It looks yummy. They want to eat it. But Tom wants more. He says, "I want the whole cake. It is mine. I am older than Lily by two minutes."
Lily is sad. She says, "That is not fair. We are twins. We should share the cake. It is our birthday. Not just yours."
Tom does not listen. He pushes Lily away. He tries to grab the cake. But his uncle prevents him. He says, "No, Tom. You are being selfish. You cannot have the whole cake. You have to share with Lily and me. Sharing is caring. If you do not share, you will not get any cake at all."
Tom is angry. He stamps his feet. He cries. He says, "I do not want to share. I want the cake. Give me the cake."
Lily is sorry for Tom. She says, "Tom, please do not cry. I will share with you. You can have half of the cake. And I will have the other half. And we can give some to uncle too. He made the cake for us. He is nice."
Tom thinks for a moment. He sees that Lily is right. He sees that his uncle is smiling. He sees that the cake is big enough for everyone. He feels ashamed. He says, "I am sorry, Lily. I am sorry, uncle. I was selfish. I will share with you. Thank you for the cake. It looks delicious."
Lily and uncle hug Tom. They say, "It is okay, Tom. We forgive you. We love you. Happy birthday, Tom and Lily."
They cut the cake. They eat the cake. They enjoy the cake. They are happy. They are not selfish. They are twins.
