Once upon a time, there was an elderly lady named Granny. Granny was very kind and loved to clean her house. One day, while she was cleaning, she found a skeleton in her closet! She was very scared and didn't know what to do.
She called her granddaughter, Lily, and said, "Lily, I found a skeleton in my closet! Can you help me clean it up?" Lily was very brave and said, "Yes, Granny! Let's clean it up together!"
They got some cleaning supplies and started to clean the skeleton. It was hard work, but they did it! Granny was so happy and said, "Thank you, Lily! You are such a good helper!" From that day on, Granny and Lily always cleaned together and had lots of fun. The end.
