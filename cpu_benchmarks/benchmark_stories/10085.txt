Tom and Anna wanted to watch a movie. They liked movies with animals and songs. They asked their mom to take them to the movie theater.
Mom said, "Okay, but we have to hurry. The movie starts soon. Put on your coats and shoes."
Tom and Anna ran to their room. They grabbed their coats and shoes. But Tom had a problem. His shoes did not fit. They were too small. He tried to push his feet in, but it hurt.
"Mom, I can't fit my shoes!" he cried.
Mom came to his room. She saw his shoes. She said, "Oh, Tom, these are your old shoes. You need your new shoes. They are in the closet. Hurry and get them."
Tom opened the closet. He found his new shoes. They were blue and shiny. He liked them. He put them on. They fit. He smiled.
"Mom, I fit my shoes!" he said.
Mom smiled too. She said, "Good job, Tom. Now let's go. Anna is waiting in the car."
Tom and Anna went to the movie theater with Mom. They bought popcorn and juice. They found their seats. They watched the movie. It was about a lion and a mouse who became friends. It had animals and songs. It was interesting.
Tom and Anna liked the movie. They clapped and laughed. They thanked Mom for taking them. They had a fun day.
