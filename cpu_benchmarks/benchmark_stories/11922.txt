Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play by the ocean and watch the fish swim. One day, he saw an octopus in the water. The octopus was confused because he lost his way home.
Timmy asked the octopus, "Why are you confused?"
The octopus replied, "I don't know where my home is."
Timmy thought for a moment and then said, "I can help you find your way home." He then jumped into the water and swam with the octopus until they found his home.
The octopus was very happy and said, "Thank you for helping me. You are a good friend."
Timmy smiled and replied, "I am happy to help. Friends help each other."
