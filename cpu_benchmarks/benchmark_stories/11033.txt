Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play together. One day, they go to the park with their moms. Lily has a new phone. It is thin and shiny. She likes to watch videos on it.
"Look at my phone, Tom!" Lily says. "It is so cool. You can watch anything you want."
Tom does not have a phone. He has a ball. He likes to throw and catch it. He thinks phones are boring.
"I don't want to watch your phone, Lily," Tom says. "I want to play with my ball. Come on, let's have fun."
Lily shakes her head. She does not want to play with Tom's ball. She wants to watch her phone. She turns away from Tom and puts her phone in her pocket.
"Fine, then. I will play by myself," Tom says. He runs to the grass and throws his ball high in the air.
Lily sits on a bench and takes out her phone. She watches a video of a funny cat. She laughs and smiles. She does not see Tom playing with his ball. She does not see a big dog running towards Tom. She does not hear Tom scream.
The dog likes balls. It sees Tom's ball and wants to get it. It jumps on Tom and knocks him down. It bites Tom's ball and runs away. Tom is scared and hurt. He cries and calls for his mom.
Lily hears Tom cry. She looks up from her phone and sees Tom on the ground. She sees the dog with Tom's ball. She feels sorry for Tom. She puts her phone away and runs to Tom.
"Tom, are you okay?" Lily asks. "I'm sorry, I did not see the dog. I was watching my phone."
Tom's mom comes and hugs Tom. She checks his arm and leg. They are scratched and bruised, but not bad. She gives Tom a band-aid and a kiss.
"It's okay, Lily," Tom says. "I'm glad you came. I was scared. The dog took my ball."
Lily hugs Tom. She says, "I'm sorry, Tom. I was not a good friend. I should have played with you. Your ball is more fun than my phone."
Tom smiles and says, "It's okay, Lily. You are a good friend. Maybe we can share. You can watch my ball and I can watch your phone."
Lily nods and says, "Yes, that sounds good. Sharing is good. We can have fun together."
They hold hands and walk to the playground. They see the dog with the ball. They laugh and chase the dog. They get the ball back and play with it. They also watch some videos on Lily's phone. They are happy and have fun. They learn to share and be kind.
