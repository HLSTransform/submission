Once upon a time, there was a chubby witch. She lived in a big, dark house in the forest. One day, she decided to go on a walk. She put on her pointy hat and grabbed her broomstick. 
As she flew through the forest, she saw a little girl picking berries. The witch wanted to scare her, but the girl was not afraid. She said, "Hello, witch! What are you doing?" The witch was surprised and said, "I'm going for a walk." 
The little girl asked if she could come along, and the witch said yes. They walked and talked together, and the witch realized that not all people were afraid of her. From that day on, the witch and the little girl became friends and went on many more walks together.
