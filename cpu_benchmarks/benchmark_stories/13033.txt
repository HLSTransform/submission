Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Suzy who wanted to cross a bridge. But the bridge was very high and she was scared. She saw a big stone by the side of the bridge and thought it might help.
She picked up the stone and threw it as far as she could. The stone sailed through the air and landed on the other side of the bridge. Suzy smiled, and ran across the bridge. She didn't have to worry because she had delayed crossing the bridge.
When she landed on the other side, she saw a huge castle with high walls. It looked very strange and she wanted to go in. But the guard would not let her in, no matter how much she begged.
The guard said, "Wait here until I come back". He went into the castle, and Suzy couldn't believe how long it took. She almost fell asleep she waited so long.
Finally the guard came back and opened the door for her. Suzy went inside, and was amazed by the beauty and wonders inside the castle. She had finally crossed the high bridge and reached her destination.
