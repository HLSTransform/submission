Ralph was walking around in the park when he observed a tiny stamp on the ground. He got closer to take a better look at it. Ralph was worried; it looked like it was from a special stamp collection that belonged to his friend, Ben.
He called out, "Ben! Are you here?"
Ben walked up, looking worried. "Oh no, it looks like I dropped my stamp," he said.
Ralph smiled at Ben, "I found it!"
Ben was so relieved and gave Ralph a big hug. "Thank you, Ralph!"
Ben carefully put the stamp back into his collection and the boys continued their walk in the park.
