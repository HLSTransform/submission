Freddy was a smart little boy. One day, he was looking for something to do. He saw his pencil and paper and started to write. He wrote all the letters he knew. Then he saw an oak tree outside. He loved the oak tree and wanted to write about it. So he wrote, "The oak tree is big and strong". Then he wrote, "The oak tree has leaves that rustle in the wind". Freddy was so proud of what he had written. He wanted to show everyone, so he ran inside to show his mom. She was so proud of him and now he writes about the oak tree every day.
