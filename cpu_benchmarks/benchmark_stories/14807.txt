Sara likes to stare at the view from her window. She sees many things: trees, birds, cars, people. She likes to make up stories about them in her head. Sometimes she pretends she is a bird and flies with them. Sometimes she pretends she is a car and zooms with them. Sometimes she pretends she is a person and talks with them.
One day, Sara sees something new in the view. It is a big, shiny, round thing. It is very bright and colorful. It looks like a ball, but bigger. Sara wonders what it is. She stares at it for a long time. She wants to touch it and play with it. She thinks it must be fun.
She asks her mom what it is. Her mom looks at the view and smiles. She says it is a balloon. She says someone is having a party and they put up the balloon to decorate. She says the balloon is filled with air and it floats in the sky. She says the balloon is not real, it is fake.
Sara feels sad. She does not like fake things. She likes real things. She likes trees, birds, cars, people. She does not like the balloon. She thinks it is boring and silly. She stops staring at it. She looks for something else in the view. She sees a cat. She likes cats. She pretends she is a cat and meows with it. She feels happy again.
