Lily and Sam were playing in the garden. They liked to look for bugs and flowers. Lily saw a green bug on a leaf. She wanted to catch it.
"Look, Sam, a green bug!" she said. "I want to see it close."
She reached out her hand and grabbed the bug. The bug was angry. It bit Lily's finger. Lily screamed and dropped the bug.
"Ow, ow, ow!" she cried. "The bug hurt me!"
Sam ran to Lily and saw her finger. It was red and swollen. He was scared.
"Mom, mom, help!" he shouted. "Lily has a boo-boo!"
Mom heard Sam and came to the garden. She saw Lily's finger and the bug. She knew it was a bad bug. A bee.
"Oh no, Lily, you are allergic to bees!" she said. "We have to go to the doctor right now!"
She picked up Lily and ran to the car. Sam followed them. He was sad. He wished he had seen the bug first. He wished Lily was not allergic to bees. He wished they could keep playing in the garden. But they could not. The end.
