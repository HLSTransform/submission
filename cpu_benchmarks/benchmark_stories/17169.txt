Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the store with her mommy to buy a candle for their home. They picked out a pretty red candle with a rough texture.
As they were leaving the store, a man stopped them and asked for some money. Lily's mommy said, "I'm sorry, I can't pay you right now." The man looked sad and walked away.
Later that night, Lily and her mommy lit the candle and it made their home smell nice. But then, the lights went out! It was very dark and scary. Lily's mommy remembered the man from the store and said, "I wish we could have helped him. Maybe he could have fixed our lights." 
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. It was the man from the store! He had fixed their lights and said, "Thank you for helping me pay for my dinner. I saw you looking at that rough candle and knew you needed some light." Lily and her mommy were so happy and grateful. From that day on, they always tried to help others when they could.
