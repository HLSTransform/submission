One day, a child was walking through the forest. As he walked, he heard a noise. He looked around, but he couldn't see what was making the noise. He kept walking until he heard the noise again. This time he saw something adorable. 
On the ground was a stick that was wiggling and moving. He was so surprised he took a step back. The stick was talking to him! It said, "My name is Twiggy and I need some help". 
The little boy was so excited. He bent down and said, "Hi Twiggy, what can I do to help?". Twiggy said, "My tree broke in a storm and I can't get back home. Can you help me?". 
The child picked up the stick and carried it back to the tree. As soon as he put the stick back in the tree, Twiggy said, "Thank you for helping me. I knew I could count on you". 
The child smiled and said goodbye to Twiggy. He was so happy to have helped Twiggy find her way home. As he walked away, he knew that he had done something really special.
