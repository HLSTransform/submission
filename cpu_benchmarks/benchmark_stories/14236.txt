Dave was feeling miserable. He was hot, tired and his throat was very dry. All he wanted to do was relax in a cool place, but he was miles away from home and he had to struggle to continue the journey. 
Dave was walking in a forest when he saw a log in the path. He was so tired that he decided to take a rest on top of the log. As soon as he did, he noticed the log started to move. He tried to scramble off, but it was too late. The log was rolling and he was stuck, feeling more and more miserable. 
Dave was rolling on the log for what seemed like forever. He tried his best to jump off, but the log kept rolling faster and faster. Dave was very scared, and he was struggling for his life. 
Eventually Dave reached the edge of the cliff. The log suddenly stopped and Dave felt a big relief. But it was too late; Dave was already so close to the edge that he rolled off and he fell down into the deep abyss. 
Dave's struggles were all in vain, and his miserable journey came to an end.
