John lay on the seat of the soft green car. He felt pale and tired. All around him was quiet and plenty of grass. 
John looked down at his heels. The old shoes were scuffed and worn, but he knew he could run with them. He wanted to try and run away from the car, across the grass and feel the warm sun. 
Just then, he spotted a bright red balloon in the distance. He quickly sat up and clapped his hands in excitement. He was determined to get that balloon no matter how far it floated.
John jumped out of the car and raced across the grass. He ran as fast and as hard as his heels could take him, his heart pounding in anticipation. 
Finally, John reached the balloon. He smiled as he caught it in his hands and lay back down in the car, the bright red balloon still in his grip. 
John lay there in happiness, knowing he had accomplished his goal. The wind gently pushed the balloon higher, taking John soaring through the air with it.
