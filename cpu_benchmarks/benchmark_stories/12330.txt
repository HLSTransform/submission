Once upon a time, there was a very powerful king. He lived in a grand castle surrounded by courts and law makers who worked hard to make sure everyone behaved properly.
One day, the king wanted to take a seat on his throne. When he arrived, he noticed a small girl sitting there. She smiled at him, and said: “Good morning your Majesty.”
The king, who was surprised and a bit annoyed, asked her: “What are you doing in my throne? Is this how you show respect to the law?”
The little girl replied: “Oh, no sir. I just wanted to learn how it feels to be powerful.”
The king was impressed by the girl’s honest answer and kindly said: “We need to obey the law, but that doesn’t mean we can’t admire power. Just make sure to remember that with great power comes great responsibility.”
The little girl thanked the king and left, understanding the lesson he had taught: that respecting authority is a powerful thing.
