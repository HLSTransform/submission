Tommy was walking through the forest. He was very excited, searching for a surprise. Suddenly, he stumbled on a branch and fell to the ground. "Ouch!" he yelled.
But then he saw something. It was a box! He carefully picked it up and brushed off the dry leaves. On the shoulder of the box there was a sticker with one word written on it: "Surprise!"
Tommy was so excited that he couldn't wait to open it. He quickly took off the top and inside he saw a most beautiful thing he had ever seen. It was a toy truck!
Tommy felt so happy that he jumped up and down and shouted, “Yay! Thank you, surprise!”
