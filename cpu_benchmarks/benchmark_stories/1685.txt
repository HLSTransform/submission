Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily received a phone call from her grandma. Her grandma's voice sounded very happy. "Hi Lily, how are you?" said her grandma. "I'm good, grandma. How are you?" replied Lily. "I'm doing well, thank you. I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you that I love you," said her grandma.
Lily was happy to hear from her grandma, but then she heard a loud noise outside. She was scared and didn't know what to do. "Grandma, I'm scared. There's a loud noise outside," said Lily. "Don't worry, Lily. It's just a thunderstorm. It will pass soon," said her grandma. Lily felt better knowing that it was just a thunderstorm.
After a while, the thunderstorm stopped and Lily's mom came to check on her. "Are you okay, Lily?" asked her mom. "Yes, I'm okay now. I received a phone call from grandma and she made me feel better," said Lily. Her mom smiled and gave her a hug. Lily felt happy knowing that her family was there to make her feel better.
