Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was a loyal dog to his owner, Tim. Tim loved Max very much. Max loved to run and play on the ground. 
One day, Tim took Max to the park to play. Max was having fun running around and chasing his ball. But then, some kids came and started to disturb Max. They threw sticks at him and tried to scare him. Max didn't like that. 
Tim saw what was happening and quickly went over to Max. He picked him up and hugged him. "Don't worry, Max," he said. "I won't let anyone disturb you." Max felt safe in Tim's arms and was happy to have such a loyal owner.
