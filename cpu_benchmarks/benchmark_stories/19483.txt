Once there was a little fish who liked to peek through the deep blue water. He swam around looking for adventure and fun.
One day he saw a net that was sunk deep in the water. He got closer and he could see that there were little treasures inside. He swam even closer and peeked in.
He saw colorful shells, shiny stones and some delicious snacks! He was so excited that he had found this secret net!
He quickly collected all the treasures he could find and put them in his pouch. Then he went back to his friends and showed them all the wonderful things he had found. They were so excited that he had found this hidden net! 
From then on, his friends and him would go and peek in the deep blue water and try to find the secret net again. They had so much fun exploring and finding new treasures in the deep sea.
