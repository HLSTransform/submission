Once upon a time, there was a driver named Tim. Tim had a unique car that was very colorful. One day, Tim drove his car to the beach. When he arrived, he saw the waves and wanted to splash in the water. He ran to the water and started jumping up and down, splashing all around. It was so much fun! After he was done, he got back in his car and drove home. The end.
