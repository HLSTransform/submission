Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with cars and trucks. They have many cars and trucks in their room. They make noises like vroom and beep.
One day, Ben is sick. He cannot play with Anna. He stays in bed. He has a fever. He feels hurt. Anna misses Ben. She wants to play with him.
She calls him on the phone. She says, "Hi, Ben. How are you? I miss you. Do you want to play with cars and trucks?"
Ben says, "Hi, Anna. I am not well. I feel hurt. I miss you too. I want to play with cars and trucks, but I cannot. I have to rest."
Anna says, "I am sorry, Ben. I hope you get well soon. I have a new car. It has a big motor. It is very fast. I will show you when you are better."
Ben says, "Thank you, Anna. Your new car sounds cool. I want to see it. I will get well soon. Then we can play with cars and trucks again."
Anna says, "OK, Ben. I will wait for you. I love you, friend. Bye."
Ben says, "I love you too, friend. Bye."
They hang up the phone. They smile. They think of each other. They think of cars and trucks. They think of playing together. They are happy.
