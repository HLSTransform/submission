Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite one was Anna. Anna had long hair, a pink dress and a smile on her face. Lily took Anna everywhere with her, even to bed.
Yesterday, Lily and her mom went to the park. It was a sunny day and there were many people and animals there. Lily saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She asked her mom if she could go. Her mom said yes, but told her to be careful and to hold Anna tight.
Lily ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. She was very excited and forgot to hold Anna tight. When she reached the top, she let go of Anna and slid down. She had fun, but when she got up, she realized that Anna was not with her. She looked around and saw Anna lying on the ground, far away from the slide. She felt scared and sad.
"Mommy, mommy, I lost Anna!" she cried.
Her mom heard her and came to her. She saw Anna on the ground and ran to get her. She picked her up and checked if she was okay. She saw that Anna had a small tear on her dress, but nothing else.
"Don't worry, Lily, Anna is fine. She just has a little boo-boo. We can fix it at home. I'm sorry you lost her, but I'm glad we found her. You have to be more careful next time, okay?" she said.
Lily nodded and hugged Anna. She was happy that her mom was there and that Anna was safe. She said sorry to Anna and kissed her. She learned her lesson and promised to hold Anna tight from then on. She and her mom left the park and went home. They had a busy day, but a good one.
