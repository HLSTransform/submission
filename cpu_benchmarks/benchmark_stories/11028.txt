Tom is a boy who likes to play with his toys. He has a lot of cars, trucks, and trains. He likes to make them go fast and make loud noises. He does not like to share his toys with his sister, Lily.
One day, Tom is playing with his toys in his room. He hears a knock on the door. It is Lily. She wants to play with him.
"Tom, can I play with you?" she asks.
"No, go away. These are my toys. You have your own toys," Tom says.
"But I want to play with you. You are my brother. Please, let me play with you," Lily says.
Tom does not listen to Lily. He closes the door and locks it. He keeps playing with his toys. He does not care about Lily.
Lily is sad. She goes to her room. She sees her old doll on the bed. She picks it up and hugs it. She sees a bottle of lotion on the dresser. She remembers that her mom gave it to her. She says it is good for her skin. She decides to put some lotion on her doll.
She opens the bottle and squeezes it. But too much lotion comes out. It spills on the doll, on the bed, and on the floor. It is sticky and slippery. Lily tries to wipe it off, but it makes a bigger mess. She does not know what to do.
She hears a loud crash from Tom's room. She runs to see what happened. She sees Tom on the floor. He slipped on his toys and fell. He hurt his knee. It is bleeding. He is crying.
Lily feels sorry for Tom. She forgets about the lotion. She runs to him and hugs him. She says, "I'm sorry, Tom. Are you okay?"
Tom stops crying. He looks at Lily. He sees that she is covered in lotion. He says, "What happened to you? You are all wet and sticky."
Lily says, "I was trying to put lotion on my doll, but I made a mess. I'm sorry, Mom will be mad at me."
Tom says, "It's okay, Lily. I made a mess too. I was playing with my toys, but I did not share with you. I'm sorry, you are my sister. I love you."
Lily says, "I love you too, Tom. Let's clean up our mess and then we can play together."
Tom and Lily smile. They help each other clean up their rooms. They put some band-aid on Tom's knee. They share their toys and play nicely. They are happy.
