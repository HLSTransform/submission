Once upon a time, there was a clever little girl named Lily. One day, she found a secret box in her room. She was so excited to see what was inside!
Lily's mom asked her, "What are you doing, Lily?" 
"I found a secret box! Can we examine it together?" Lily replied. 
Her mom smiled and said, "Of course!" 
They carefully opened the box and found a beautiful necklace inside. "Wow, it's so pretty!" Lily exclaimed. 
Her mom said, "You're a clever girl, Lily. You found a special treasure." 
Lily was so happy and wore the necklace every day. She loved her special secret box and the treasure inside.
