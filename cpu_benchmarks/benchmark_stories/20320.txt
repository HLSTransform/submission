One day, a little otter named Ollie wanted to play with his friends. He saw them sliding on the wet rocks and splashing in the water. It looked like fun.
"Can I play with you?" Ollie asked.
"Sure, Ollie, come and join us!" his friends said.
Ollie tried to slide on the rocks like his friends, but he was too scared. He stopped halfway and clung to the rock.
"Ollie, what are you doing?" his friends laughed. "You have to slide all the way down!"
Ollie felt sad. He wanted to slide, but he was afraid of falling.
"Ollie, don't be afraid," his friends said. "We will help you. You can do it!"
They pushed Ollie gently and cheered him on. Ollie felt a rush of air and water as he slid down the rock. He landed in the water with a splash.
"Wow, that was fun!" Ollie said.
"See, Ollie, you did it!" his friends said. "You are a great slider!"
Ollie smiled. He was happy. He tried to slide again and again. He had a lot of fun with his friends. He learned that trying new things can be scary, but also funny.
