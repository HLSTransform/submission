There were two friends named Bob and Sarah. They both were playing in the park. Sarah had an avocado in her hand. She was smiling and said to Bob, "Let's send the avocado down the slide!" 
Bob thought it was a great idea. He wanted to give it a try. So they put the avocado at the top of the slide and Sarah was gonna send it down. 
But the avocado was too stubborn! Bob and Sarah tried many times but the avocado just stayed at the top and wouldn't go down. 
Finally, Sarah got an idea. She said, "Let's put something underneath it. That will make it easier for the avocado to send down!" 
So Bob and Sarah took turns to push the avocado down the slide. It was so much fun! They laughed and cheered with each turn. Finally, the avocado was sent down the slide and they both cheered! 
The end!
