Once upon a time, there was a pretty girl. She wore a dress that was pink like a flower. One day, the girl got married to a nice man. They were both very happy.
The man and the girl stood close together and the man tied a ribbon around their hands. This ribbon was a special sign. It meant that the man and the girl would be together forever and ever. They were now married.
The girl was very happy. She felt special and loved. Every day, she would look down at the ribbon and it's bright pink colour, and remember how special the day was when the man tied the ribbon around her hand.
The man and the girl had a wonderful marriage. Together, they experienced many happy times and did lots of fun things. The pink ribbon was a sign of their special love, and it always reminded them of their bond and how much love they shared.
