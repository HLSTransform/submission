Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big sign. The sign says: "Help us gather apples. Get a reward."
Sara and Ben want to help. They run to the apple trees. They pick the red and green apples. They put them in a big basket.
"Look, we have many apples!" Sara says.
"Yes, we do. Let's take them to the sign," Ben says.
They carry the basket to the sign. A nice lady is waiting for them. She smiles and says: "Thank you for helping us. You are very kind. Here is your reward."
She gives them two big cookies. The cookies have chocolate chips. They look delicious.
"Wow, thank you!" Sara and Ben say.
They bite the cookies. They are sweet and crunchy. They are the best cookies ever.
Sara and Ben are happy. They helped and got a reward. They share their cookies with the nice lady. They have a good day.
