Once upon a time, there was a bunny named Benny. Benny loved to eat carrots. One day, Benny went to the garden to find some carrots to eat. But it was raining and the ground was wet. Benny's feet got wet too.
Benny heard a sound and looked around. He saw a bird whistling on a branch. Benny tried to whistle too but he couldn't. He wanted to be able to whistle like the bird. 
Benny found a big carrot and started to eat it. He felt happy and forgot about the rain. He knew that he couldn't whistle yet, but he felt proud that he found a yummy carrot.
