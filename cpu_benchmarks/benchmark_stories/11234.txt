Jake was a naughty little boy. Every day he did things he was not supposed to do, like taking toys from his brother. His dad was getting angry.
One day, when he started to take a toy again, his dad snapped: "No, Jake! You can't take it!"
Jake stopped and looked down sadly. He didn't understand why he couldn't take the toy. His brother had so many toys, why couldn't he take one too?
"It's not fair!" yelled Jake. But his dad just said: "No, you can't take it. Not yet. You have to be patient."
Jake looked up. His dad's face had a soft expression and Jake knew that he must obey his dad. He nodded and went to play with his other toys. Soon, he forgot all about the toy he wanted.
Then the day came when his dad said that he could have the toy. Jake shouted happily and jumped with joy.
He finally got the toy he wanted and it felt great! He had been patient and behaved well and now he could take the toy. Jake was very happy and he never did anything naughty again.
