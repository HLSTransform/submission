One day, Jimmy was walking down the street with his parents. He saw a vendor selling all sorts of colourful things. Jimmy was so excited. He wanted to buy it all!
Jimmy's dad said, "You can pick one thing Jimmy. What do you want?"
Jimmy pointed at a bright yellow item on the vendor's table and said, "Please! I want that!"
They bought it and made their way home. When they got back, Jimmy asked his mom to help him decorate his room with his new item. His mom smiled and said, "Yes, of course!"
So they got to decorating. Jimmy's mom hung up the item on the wall and put some stickers around it. It was looking very beautiful and cheerful.
Jimmy smiled and clapped his hands loudly. He was so happy with how it turned out. He jumped around and said, "My room looks so nice now! Thank you mommy!"
