One day, Mommy and Daddy took Tom to the backyard. He was so excited. "Look, Daddy! I see many wild animals!" he said.
Daddy went to a tree and pulled out a box. It had a microphone and a button that he pressed.
Mommy said, "It's a recorder. It will record all the animals and the sounds all around."
Tom was so happy. He watched while Daddy recorded the birds in the sky and the squirrels that ran all around the backyard. 
Suddenly, a large wild bear appeared in the backyard. Tom and Daddy stopped recording and shouted with fear. 
Mommy quickly grabbed the recorder and ran inside the house. Daddy followed her with Tom in his arms. They were all very scared of the bear. 
But Daddy had the recorder so they were able to record the wild bear. Tom was excited to hear the recording later.
