Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He was excited because he was going to try something new.
He stood up and clapped his hands. He was so happy and his clapping was very loud. He tried again - and this time he did it right!
He smiled proudly because he felt like a success. He clapped even louder to show how happy he was.
He wanted to share the good news with everyone, so he ran around to tell his mom and dad. He clapped as loudly as he could to show them how excited he was!
His mom and dad were so happy for him. They clapped along with him to celebrate his success. He happily clapped as his family shared in his joy.
