Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her colorful cube. One day, Lily accidentally dropped her cube and it broke into tiny pieces. She felt sad and didn't know what to do.
But then, her big brother came to help. He was very persistent and tried to fix the cube. He used glue and tape, but it still wouldn't stick together. Finally, he had an idea and used some string to tie the cube back together. It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough for Lily to play with again.
Lily was so happy and thanked her brother for his help. She learned that even when things break, there are always ways to fix them with a little bit of help and persistence. The end.
