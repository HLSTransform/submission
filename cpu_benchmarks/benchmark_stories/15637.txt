Ben and Mia love to watch movies with their mom and dad. They like to act like the people in the movies. Sometimes they are brave, sometimes they are funny, sometimes they are sad. They use their toys and clothes to pretend.
One day, they watch a movie about a big dragon and a princess. Ben wants to be the dragon and Mia wants to be the princess. They roar and scream and run around the living room. Mom and dad laugh and clap.
"Can we have popcorn, please?" Mia asks. Popcorn is their favorite snack. It is crunchy and salty and yummy.
"Sure, sweetie," mom says. "But you have to share with your brother, okay?"
"Okay, mom," Mia says. She is kind to Ben. She knows he likes popcorn too.
Mom makes popcorn in the kitchen. She puts it in a big bowl and brings it to the living room. Ben and Mia stop acting and sit on the couch. They take turns to grab popcorn from the bowl. They say thank you to mom and dad.
They watch the movie and eat popcorn. They are happy and cozy. They hug mom and dad. They love their family.
