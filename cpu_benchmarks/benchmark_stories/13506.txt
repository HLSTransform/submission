Once upon a time, there was a dancer named Lily. She loved to dance and twirl around. One day, she got stuck in a big room with no windows or doors. She tried to find a way out, but she couldn't. 
Suddenly, a helpful mouse appeared. The mouse said, "I can help you escape!" Lily was so happy to hear that. The mouse showed her a small hole in the wall that she could fit through. 
Lily thanked the mouse and started to dance her way out of the room. She was so happy to be free again. From that day on, Lily was always careful to watch where she was going so she wouldn't get stuck again.
