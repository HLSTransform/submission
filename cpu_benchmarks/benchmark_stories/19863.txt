Once upon a time, there was a big hen. She lived in a big farm with lots of animals. The hen loved to lay eggs. Every day, she would lay a big, brown egg.
One day, a boy came to the farm to play. He saw the big hen and wanted to take her egg. The hen saw the boy and tried to protect her egg by pecking him with her beak. But the boy was too quick and he took the egg.
The hen was very sad. She didn't want to lay eggs anymore. The other animals tried to cheer her up, but she just sat in her nest all day. 
Days passed and the hen became very sick. The farmer took her to the vet, but it was too late. The vet found a pin inside the hen's stomach. The pin was very large and had been there for a long time. The hen had swallowed it when she was trying to protect her egg from the boy. The pin had made the hen very sick and she couldn't lay eggs anymore. The other animals were very sad and missed their friend.
