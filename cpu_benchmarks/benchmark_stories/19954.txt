Tim and Sue are twins. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big bag on a bench. They are curious. They want to see what is in the bag.
They walk to the bench. They open the bag. They see a lot of balloons. They are happy. They like balloons. They take some balloons out of the bag.
Suddenly, they hear a loud voice. It is a man. He is angry. He says, "Hey, those are my balloons! Give them back!"
Tim and Sue are scared. They drop the balloons. They run away. The balloons rise in the air. They fly away.
The man is sad. He says, "Oh no, my balloons! Come back!"
Tim and Sue are sorry. They did not know the balloons were his. They hide behind a tree. They watch the balloons go up and up. They hope the man will find his balloons. They say, "Sorry, mister. We did not mean to take your balloons."
