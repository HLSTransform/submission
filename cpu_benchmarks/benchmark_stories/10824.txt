Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear her sunglasses because they made her look cool. One day, Lily and her mom went to the park to play. While they were playing, Lily saw a boy crying. She asked him why he was crying and he said he lost his soft teddy bear. Lily wondered how she could help the boy.
Lily's mom suggested they look for the teddy bear together. They searched high and low, but they couldn't find it. Lily then had an idea. She took off her sunglasses and gave them to the boy. She said, "Here, you can have my sunglasses. They will make you look cool too. And maybe they will help you find your teddy bear."
The boy stopped crying and put on the sunglasses. He smiled and said thank you. They continued to search for the teddy bear and eventually found it. The boy was so happy and grateful. Lily learned that sometimes helping others is more important than looking cool.
