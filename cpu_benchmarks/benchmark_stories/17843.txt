Once upon a time there was a battery in a gloomy forest. It was a big battery, and it liked to go on adventures.
One day the battery decided to go explore. It hopped and skipped through the forest and came across a cool pond. It gleamed in the light and the battery wanted to go and have a splash. 
As the battery stepped into the water, it noticed something sparkling in the corner. Wondering what it could be, the battery slowly approached. To its surprise it was a little toy boat! The battery carefully grabbed the boat and made its way back home.
When the battery got home, it put the boat to good use and raced around the pond all day. It was lots of fun and everyone that watched had smiles on their faces.
The battery went on many more adventures and always kept the boat close by for when it needed it. The battery was never gloomy again and even shared its joy around the forest.
