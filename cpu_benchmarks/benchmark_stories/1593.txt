Lily was a cat who liked to sleep on the sofa. The sofa was warm and soft and smelled like her owner. Her owner was a nice lady who gave her food and milk and petted her every day.
One day, a new cat came to the house. His name was Tom and he was big and black and had green eyes. He looked at Lily and said, "This is my sofa now. Go away, little cat."
Lily was scared and angry. She did not want to share her sofa with Tom. She said, "No, this is my sofa. You are not the owner. You are a bad cat. Go away, big cat."
Tom did not listen. He jumped on the sofa and pushed Lily off. He curled up on the warm spot and purred. He had stolen Lily's sofa.
Lily ran to her owner and meowed. She wanted her owner to help her. Her owner saw what Tom had done and frowned. She picked up Tom and said, "No, no, no. You are not a nice cat. You cannot steal Lily's sofa. Lily is my cat and she is a good cat. You have to go back to your own house."
She took Tom outside and closed the door. She went back to Lily and hugged her. She said, "I'm sorry, Lily. Tom was a naughty cat. He will not bother you again. You can have your sofa back. I love you, Lily."
Lily was happy and relieved. She snuggled with her owner on the sofa and purred. She had her warm and soft and nice sofa back. She loved her owner too.
