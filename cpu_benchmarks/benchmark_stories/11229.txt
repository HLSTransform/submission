Once upon a time, there was a small baby called Chris. Chris was three years old and very tidy. He loved to tidy his toys and always made sure his room was neat and clean.
One day, Chris was in the park with his mum. He saw a group of children and went over to join them. They were talking about the news and one of the children mentioned a new movie that was coming out.
Chris was so excited and ran over to tell his mum. He said, "Mummy, they said there is a new movie and I want to watch it!"
Chris's mum laughed and said, "That's great news Chris, but let's wait until it comes out and we will ask Daddy if it's okay".
Chris couldn't wait to go to the movie and couldn't stop talking about it. He was so happy and started tidying his room. He couldn't wait to go and see the new movie!
