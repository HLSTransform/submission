Once upon a time, there was a prince. He was a brilliant prince. He lived in a big castle with his mom and dad, the king and queen. The prince liked to play outside with his friends. They liked to run, jump, and laugh.
One day, the prince had to go on a trip. He needed to pack his bag. His mom helped him pack his clothes, toys, and snacks. The prince was excited to go on the trip, but he was also a little sad. He would miss his friends and his big castle.
On the trip, the prince saw many new things. He saw big mountains and beautiful flowers. He made new friends and played with them. After a few days, it was time for the prince to go back home. He packed his bag again and said goodbye to his new friends. When he got home, he told his old friends all about his brilliant trip. They were all happy to see the prince again.
