Tom and Mia were playing with blocks. They liked to build towers and houses with different shapes and colors. Tom had a lot of triangles. He said they were his favorite shape. Mia had some circles and squares. She said they were nice too.
"Look at my tower!" Tom said. "It is very tall and strong. It has many triangles on top. Do you like it?"
"Yes, it is very nice," Mia said. "But I like my house more. It is very comfortable and cozy. It has many windows and doors. Do you want to come in?"
Tom nodded. He walked to Mia's house and looked inside. He saw a soft pillow, a fluffy blanket and a teddy bear. He smiled and said, "This is very comfortable. Can I stay here?"
"Sure, you can stay here," Mia said. "But be careful. Don't destroy my house. It took me a long time to build it."
Tom said, "OK, I will be careful. I won't destroy your house." But he was not careful. He moved too much and knocked down some blocks. The house started to fall apart. Mia saw what happened and shouted, "Tom, stop! You are destroying my house!"
Tom was scared. He tried to fix the house, but it was too late. The house was destroyed. Mia was sad and angry. She said, "Tom, you are a bad friend. You destroyed my house. You don't care about me. Go away!"
Tom felt sorry. He said, "I'm sorry, Mia. I didn't mean to destroy your house. I care about you. Please don't be mad at me."
Mia looked at Tom. She saw that he was sorry. She said, "It's OK, Tom. I forgive you. But next time, be more careful. And don't touch my triangles. They are mine."
Tom said, "OK, Mia. I won't touch your triangles. And I will help you build a new house. A bigger and better one. With more windows and doors. And a triangle roof."
Mia smiled. She said, "Thank you, Tom. You are a good friend. Come on, let's build a new house. And then we can play inside. And be comfortable."
Tom and Mia hugged. They were happy. They picked up the blocks and started to build a new house. A bigger and better one. With more windows and doors. And a triangle roof.
