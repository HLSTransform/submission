Once upon a time, there was a queen. She was yellow and very pretty. She wanted to go on a big trip and travel around to see the world!
So she packed her bags, waved goodbye to all her friends, and hopped in her car. She drove for hours and hours until she came to a big green mountain. At the top of the mountain was an old castle.
The queen stopped her car and said, "This is it! I made it!" She got out of the car and opened the gate. 
When the queen walked inside, she was amazed by all the different colors and shapes. She saw a small yellow bird flying around. 
The queen reached up to the bird and said, "Please come with me. We will travel together!" The yellow bird happily agreed and the two set off on a wonderful journey around the world.
