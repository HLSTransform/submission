Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Rory. She was only three and very curious.
One day, Rory was in the kitchen. She watched as her mom stirred something in a big pot on the stove. It was big and brown. 
Rory asked, "Mommy, what are you stirring?"
Her mom smiled and said, "I'm making soup because it's cold outside. Would you like to help?"
Rory clapped her hands and nodded. Her mom gave her a spoon. Rory stirred the soup and it made a funny noise. 
Rory stirred and stirred until her mom said it was done. Then, she put the soup on the table. 
Rory was so happy she sang, "The soup is on the side. The soup is warm and brown." 
They both laughed and enjoyed the tasty soup. 
The end.
