Once upon a time there were two friends, Ann and Susie. They were adding things to their playground. They added swings and birds and trees.
But the best thing they added was a slide! Ann and Susie took turns sliding down the slide. It was so much fun! Ann went first and Susie followed after.
The slide was very hot because the sun was shining on it. So Ann and Susie went and got some water and they poured it on the slide to cool it down.
They had a lot of fun playing on the slide and they kept adding things to their playground. The friends laughed and laughed while they played until it was time to go home.
