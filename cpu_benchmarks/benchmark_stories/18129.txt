Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a big bookcase in her room that was full of books. One day, Lily wanted to gain more knowledge, so she asked her wise grandma for help. 
Her grandma showed her a special book that was full of interesting stories and facts. Lily was so excited to read it that she quickly put it on the bookcase. 
As she read the book, Lily felt herself becoming wiser and smarter. She was happy that she had gained more knowledge and couldn't wait to read more books from her bookcase.
