One day, Tim saw an enormous rocket in his yard. He was very excited. He wanted to show his friend, Sam. "Sam, come see the big rocket!" Tim said.
Sam came running to see the rocket. It was so big and shiny. But then, Sam did something silly. He tripped and fell on the rocket. It made a loud noise. Tim and Sam felt embarrass.
The rocket started to shake and smoke. "Oh no!" said Tim. The rocket went up into the sky very fast. It made a big boom. Tim and Sam were sad. They knew they should not have touched the rocket. They wished they could have played with it longer.
