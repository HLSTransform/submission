Once upon a time, there was a clever little girl named Jenna. Jenna had a special magic which made her clothes shrink whenever she wished it.
One day, Jenna was walking in her garden when she heard her mother calling her from the house. “Jenna!” she cried. “Come inside and get ready for dinner!”
As Jenna entered the house, she felt her clothes shrinking around her. Jenna knew that her special magic had worked yet again!
Once inside, Jenna's mother smiled and said, “Oh, how clever you are! I love seeing how you can make your clothes shrink and grow.”
Jenna couldn't help but smile back. She was very pleased with her special magic. 
They both hugged and went to the kitchen to eat dinner. Jenna had worked her magic yet again!
