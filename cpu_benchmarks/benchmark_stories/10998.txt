Lily and Ben were very hungry. They wanted to eat turkey for dinner. Mom said she would cook a big turkey in the oven. Lily and Ben helped Mom put salt and butter on the turkey. Then they put it in a big pan and Mom put it in the oven.
Lily and Ben waited and waited. They smelled the turkey and it made their mouths water. They asked Mom, "Is the turkey ready yet?" Mom said, "Not yet, my loves. It needs more time. Why don't you drink some juice and play with your toys?"
Lily and Ben drank some juice and played with their toys. They had fun, but they still wanted to eat turkey. They asked Mom again, "Is the turkey ready now?" Mom said, "Yes, it is. Come and see." She took the turkey out of the oven and put it on the table. It was brown and juicy and smelled delicious.
Lily and Ben ran to the table. They said, "Yay, turkey!" Mom said, "Be careful, it's hot. Let me cut some pieces for you." She cut some pieces of turkey and put them on their plates. She also gave them some carrots and potatoes and gravy.
Lily and Ben ate and ate. They said, "Mmm, this is the best turkey ever. Thank you, Mom." Mom said, "You're welcome, my loves. I'm glad you like it." She ate some turkey too. They all enjoyed their dinner.
When they were done, Lily and Ben looked at the pan. It was empty. There was no turkey left. They said, "Wow, we ate all the turkey. We were very hungry." Mom said, "Yes, you were. And you did a good job. Now, who wants some pie?" Lily and Ben said, "Me, me!" They smiled and hugged Mom. They were happy.
