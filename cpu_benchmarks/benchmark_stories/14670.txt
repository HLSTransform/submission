Once upon a time there was a girl. She was very proud. Every day she would wear a big yellow dress. The dress was made of paper.
The girl was so proud of her dress. She liked to show it off to her friends. They would all admire her dress and tell her how pretty it looked.
One day, the girl went to a special party. Everyone was wearing their best clothes. The girl wore her yellow paper dress and beamed with pride. She felt like a princess.
At the end of the night, the girl went home. She was sad to take off her dress, but she was happy that she had worn it and been so proud. She ran into the house with a big smile.
