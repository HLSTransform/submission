One day, a little red radish rolled away. He was looking for somewhere to call home. He rolled and rolled, but nowhere seemed just right. Then he came upon an ugly old garden.
The radish felt discouraged, so he decided to keep rolling. But just then the garden grew a smile. A kind, elderly woman appeared and she said, "Come here, little radish. This is the perfect place to stay."
The radish didn't feel so sure, but the old woman encouraged him. She said, "This garden is full of beauty, and you will add a special touch to it." Those words filled the radish with warmth, so he listened to the old woman and stayed.
And sure enough, soon the little radish found his place in the garden and brought lots of beauty to the ugly plot of land. He thanked the old woman for her kindness and support. And from that day on, the radish was filled with courage and joy, just like the old woman.
