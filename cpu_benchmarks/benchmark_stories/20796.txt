Once there was a young boy named Joe. He lived on a big farm with his parents, his siblings and some animals. Every morning he woke up early to help his parents work on the farm.
One day, Joe's dad gave him a very special job. He told Joe to keep an eye out for a tuna. So Joe went around the farm looking for it.
Soon, Joe saw something swimming in the pond. He shouted, "Daddy! Daddy! I found a tuna!"
His dad ran over and said, "Well done, Joe! You did a great job!"
Joe was very proud of himself. He had done such a good job at keeping his eyes open for the tuna. From then on, Joe was always looking for new animals on the farm.
