Once upon a time, there was a nice little boy. He was three years old. He was very silly and he liked to laugh.
One day, the boy saw something in the bushes. It was a blueberry! He wanted to pick it, but it was high up, so he couldn't reach it. He started to cry.
His mommy came to him and asked him what was wrong. He showed her the blueberry. His mommy said, "It's ok, son. I'll get it for you". But the boy shook his head. He insisted that he wanted to get it himself.
The mommy tried to talk the boy out of it. She said it would be too hard. But the boy was very stubborn. He kept insisting that he could get the blueberry.
Finally, the mommy stopped. She gave the boy a ladder and he climbed all the way up. He was a bit scared at first, but he kept going. He kept insisting he could do it.
The blueberry was close now. He finally got it! He was so happy, he laughed and laughed. His mommy was so proud of him for being so brave and for insisting on getting the blueberry.
