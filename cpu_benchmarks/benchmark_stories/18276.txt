Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine and run around with her friends. One day, Lily's mom told her to be careful because it looked like it might rain later. 
Lily didn't really understand what her mom meant by "be careful", but she nodded her head anyway. She went outside to play and soon forgot all about the rain. 
As the sun started to set, Lily noticed that the sky was getting dark and cloudy. She remembered what her mom had said and decided to head back inside. 
Just as she got to the structure of her house, the rain started to pour down. Lily was so glad she had been careful and listened to her mom's warning. She snuggled up inside with a warm blanket and listened to the rain tapping on the roof.
