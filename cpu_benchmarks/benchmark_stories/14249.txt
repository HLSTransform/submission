One day, Peter and his Grandpa went looking for a special gift. They searched high and low, but couldn't find it. Suddenly, Peter spotted something under the bed. He crawled underneath and saw a box full of dust. He opened it and found some naughty toys inside. He excitedly showed them to Grandpa. Grandpa smiled and said that it was the perfect gift. Peter happily hugged Grandpa and they took the naughty toys home.
