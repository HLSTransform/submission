Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint pictures with bright colors, but today she only had dull colors. She was sad because she wanted to make a pretty picture for her mommy.
As she walked through the forest looking for inspiration, she saw a snake slithering across her path. She was scared, but the snake didn't seem to want to hurt her. Instead, it led her to a beautiful meadow with colorful flowers.
Lily was so happy and began to paint a picture of the meadow with all the bright colors she could imagine. When she finished, she realized that the dull colors she had before were the perfect backdrop for her bright and beautiful painting. She thanked the snake for showing her the way and went home to show her mommy her masterpiece.
