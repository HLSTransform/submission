Once upon a time, there was a lizard named Lizzy. Lizzy was a powerful lizard who liked to stretch her legs and arms every day. One day, Lizzy went for a walk and saw a big rock. She wanted to climb the rock, but it was too high for her. Lizzy decided to stretch her legs and try again. She stretched and stretched until she was able to climb the rock. Lizzy felt very powerful and happy. From that day on, Lizzy stretched every day so she could do more powerful things. The end.
