Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy who loved to lie in the grass and read poems. One sunny day, she met a very big, reliable dog named Max. Max could talk, and he said, "Hi Amy, do you want to play with me?" Amy was very happy and said, "Yes, let's play together!"
As they played, Max asked Amy, "What is your favorite poem?" Amy told Max her favorite poem and they laughed together. They played all day and became good friends. Max was always there for Amy, and she knew he was a reliable friend.
One day, Amy's mom told her, "Amy, you should always be honest and kind, like your friend Max." Amy learned that being reliable and truthful, like Max, was very important. From that day on, she promised to always tell the truth and be a good friend to everyone. And Max and Amy lived happily ever after, always playing and reading poems together.
