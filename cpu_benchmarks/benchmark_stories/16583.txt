Sara and Ben are playing with plastic blocks in the living room. They are trying to build a big tower with different colors. Sara likes red blocks and Ben likes blue blocks. They take turns to put one block on top of another.
But then, Ben sees a yellow block that he wants. He reaches for it, but Sara grabs it first. She says, "No, this is mine! I need it for my tower!"
Ben is angry. He yells, "That's not fair! You have more blocks than me! Give me the yellow block!"
Sara yells back, "No, you give me the blue block! You have too many blue blocks!"
They start to pull and tug at each other's blocks. They make a lot of noise and mess. The tower falls down and the blocks scatter everywhere.
Mom hears the yelling and comes to the living room. She sees the broken tower and the plastic blocks all over the floor. She is not happy. She says, "Sara and Ben, what are you doing? Why are you yelling and fighting? You are supposed to share and play nicely!"
Sara and Ben feel ashamed. They say, "Sorry, Mom. We wanted to build a successful tower, but we couldn't agree on the colors."
Mom says, "Well, you can still build a successful tower, but you have to work together and respect each other's choices. How about you mix the colors and make a rainbow tower? That would be beautiful and fun!"
Sara and Ben think that is a good idea. They say, "Okay, Mom. We will try that. Thank you for helping us."
They hug Mom and then start to pick up the plastic blocks. They apologize to each other and say, "Let's be friends and build a rainbow tower!"
They smile and laugh as they put the blocks together. They are happy and proud of their successful tower. Mom is happy and proud of them too.
