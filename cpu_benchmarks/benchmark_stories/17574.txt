One day, Ben and Lily went to the zoo with their mom. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and birds. They liked to watch them and learn their names. But their favorite animal was the kangaroo. The kangaroo had a big pouch where it kept its baby. The baby was very cute and sometimes popped out to say hello.
"Can we pet the kangaroo, mom?" Ben asked.
"No, honey, we can't. The kangaroo is not a pet. It is a wild animal. We have to stay behind the fence and be quiet," mom said.
Ben and Lily nodded. They understood. They did not want to scare the kangaroo or make it angry. They just wanted to look at it and smile.
But then, they saw something bad. A big, ugly dog came running from the other side of the zoo. It had sharp teeth and a loud bark. It jumped over the fence and ran towards the kangaroo. The kangaroo was scared. It tried to hop away, but the dog was faster. The dog bit the kangaroo's tail and pulled it down. The baby fell out of the pouch and rolled on the ground.
"Help! Help!" the kangaroo cried.
"Mom, do something!" Lily shouted.
Mom grabbed a stick and ran after the dog. She hit the dog on the head and made it let go of the kangaroo. The dog ran away, whimpering. Mom picked up the baby and gave it back to the kangaroo. The kangaroo hugged the baby and thanked mom.
"Thank you, thank you, you saved me and my baby. You are very brave and kind," the kangaroo said.
"You're welcome, I'm glad you're okay. I'm sorry about the dog. It was very ugly and mean," mom said.
Ben and Lily ran to mom and the kangaroo. They were happy that the kangaroo and the baby were safe. They gave them a hug and said sorry too.
"We're sorry, kangaroo. We love you and your baby. You are very beautiful and sweet," Ben and Lily said.
The kangaroo smiled and said, "I love you too, kids. You are very nice and smart. Thank you for being my friends."
The end.
