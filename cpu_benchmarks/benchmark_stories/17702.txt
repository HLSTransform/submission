Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to find something special. She searched everywhere, up high and down low. She looked in rivers and in the sky. She searched for something orange and sparkly. 
Finally, after a long time of searching, the little girl found something special. It was a beautiful orange mineral. She was so excited that she had found it! She picked it up and held it in her hand. It was so sparkly and so shiny!
The little girl was so happy that she had found this special mineral. She hugged it tight and thanked the sky for helping her find it. She looked forward to all the wonderful things she could do with it.
