Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Lizzy and she was so eager to find out what was in the big box. Every day she asked her mom, "What is in the box?" But Mommy always said, "It's a mystery."
One day, Lizzy went outside and saw a bird. She was so excited and said, "Hi bird! I want to play with you!" So the bird flew closer and soon Lizzy was feeding it little pieces of bread.
Mommy came out and said, "Oh, Lizzy, you made a new friend!" Then Mommy smiled and said, "Maybe we can share the mystery in the box with your new bird friend!"
Lizzy smiled really big and said, "Oh yeah! Let's open the box!" So Mommy opened the box and inside were lots of colorful bird seeds.
Lizzy and Mommy filled the bird feeder with the bird seeds and hung it in the tree. Then they watched as the bird came back to the tree to eat. Every day, the bird came back to the tree to eat, and Lizzy was so excited to feed it.
The end.
