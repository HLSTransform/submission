Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends, but one day she got lost. She cried and cried until her aunt found her. 
"Auntie, I was so scared!" Lily said.
"It's okay, sweetie. You're safe now," her aunt replied, giving her a big hug. "But next time, you need to hurry and tell an adult where you're going."
Lily nodded and promised to be more careful. From that day on, she always made sure to stay close to her aunt or tell her where she was going. She learned that it's important to be safe and to ask for help when she needed it.
