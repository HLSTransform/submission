Once there was a boy named Tom. Tom was a very fair boy who liked to play outside. One day he was playing near a pond, blowing bubbles with his bubble wand. He loved to watch the bubbles drift up into the sky. 
But suddenly, one of the bubbles broke! Tom was so sad and wanted to repair the bubble. He searched around until he found a glue stick, then worked hard to glue the pieces of the broken bubble back together. 
Once he was done, Tom blew the repaired bubble and watched it float away. He was so happy and proud of himself. Tom had used his fair skills to repair the bubble and it worked perfectly! And from then on, he enjoyed playing with bubbles in a very fair way.
