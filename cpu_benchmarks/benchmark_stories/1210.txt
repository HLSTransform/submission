Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to play in the park with her friends. While playing, she found a shiny chain on the ground. She picked it up and put it around her neck. 
But soon, she found out that the chain was too heavy and uncomfortable. She wanted to remove it, but it was tangled in her hair. She tried to pull it off, but it only made a messy knot. 
Lily's friends saw her struggling and came to help. They carefully untangled the chain from her hair and helped her remove it. Lily felt relieved and happy to be free from the heavy chain. From that day on, she knew to be careful with things that could get messy or tangled.
