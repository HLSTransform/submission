Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy loved cheese more than anything in the world. He would always sneak into the kitchen to find some cheese to eat.
One day, Timmy met a big mouse named Tommy. Tommy was very wealthy and had lots of cheese. Timmy asked Tommy, "Can I have some cheese, please?" Tommy replied, "No, you can't have my cheese. You need to work hard and become wealthy like me."
Timmy was sad and decided to leave. On his way home, he met a wise old owl who said, "Timmy, never be greedy. Always work hard and be kind to others. That's the way to true happiness."
Timmy learned a valuable lesson that day. He realized that being wealthy wasn't just about having lots of cheese, but also about being kind and working hard. From that day on, Timmy worked hard and shared his cheese with others.
