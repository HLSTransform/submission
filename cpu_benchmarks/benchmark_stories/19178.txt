Once upon a time, there was a small temple. In the temple, there was a tasty cake. A little boy named Tim wanted to eat the cake.
One day, Tim went to the temple. He saw the cake and wanted to become big and strong. He thought the cake would help him. So, Tim took a big bite of the cake.
But the cake was magic. When Tim ate the cake, he became very small. He was so small that a big bird came and took him away. Tim was sad and scared. The end.
