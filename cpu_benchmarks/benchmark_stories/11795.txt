Once upon a time, there was an ugly sword. Nobody wanted the sword because it was rusty, old, and sharp.
One day, a brave knight came to try and guess how to make the sword special again. He first tried a polishing cloth. He rubbed and rubbed the sword until it was shiny. He then went to the blacksmith and asked for special sparks to make the sword unique. The blacksmith agreed and the knight was able to put the sparks all over the sword. The knight was very happy!
The knight wanted to share the special sword with everyone, so he asked the villagers to share it. They all agreed, and one person said that the sword was a symbol of friendship.
The moral of the story is that friendship always matters. Working together can make the most ordinary thing look special. So never underestimate the power of friendship!
