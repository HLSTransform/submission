Timmy wanted to stay up late, but his mother told him it was time for bed. He tried to talk his way out of it, but Mama said no available words would help him stay up. So, Timmy lay in bed and closed his eyes. He wished he had one more hour to play, but before he knew it, Timmy was fast asleep. 
The dream he had was filled with lots of fun things he'd seen during his day, like puppies running and laughing kids. In his dream, nothing was as far away or as tired as it had been that day. 
When he awoke the next morning, Timmy couldn't remember much of his dream. But he knew, no matter what, he was happy he'd slept.
