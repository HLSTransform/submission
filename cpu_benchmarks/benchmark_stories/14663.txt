Once upon a time, there was a baby rabbit who needed to get across a big field. But when she looked out at the field, she saw a shiny wire blocking her way. She tried to go around it, but she just got more confused.
Suddenly, she saw a big, white bird flying above her. He saw the trouble she was in, and flew down to help. The bird said, "Don't worry little rabbit, I'll help you get across."
The bird took the rabbit in his big talons and flew over the wire. When they landed on the other side, the rabbit thanked the bird. She waved goodbye and hopped away. The bird flew off into the sky, happy to help.
