Once upon a time, there was a big boy. He was very lively. He loved to play outdoors with his friends.
One day, the boy woke up with a great idea! He wanted to make a kite. He went outside with his friends to find some supplies to make the kite.
The boy and his friends searched for sticks, string, and colorful paper. They collected all the things that they needed.
The boy put the supplies together. He made a very lively kite. Then, he and his friends flew the kite in the sky. The kite flew as high as the clouds. Everyone was very happy! The kite was a big success.
