Once upon a time there was a boy. His name was Jake. Jake liked to play outside. Every day he would hear the birds singing.
One day, Jake was looking around and he saw an arrow. It was blue. Jake wanted to touch it, but he was scared. He heard a noise and he was very scared.
It was just a squirrel! The squirrel said, "Hello!" It wanted to play.
So, Jake and the squirrel played together. They had so much fun! They chased each other around, they raced and they played hide and seek. As they were playing, they heard a noise.
It was an arrow flying through the sky! It was blue, just like the arrow Jake had seen. The squirrel and Jake watched the arrow fly away.
They had so much fun playing together. They became best friends!
