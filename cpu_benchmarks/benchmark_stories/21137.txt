One day, a little girl named Mia went for a walk. She saw a black cat. The cat was nice and let Mia carry it. They walked and walked until they saw something very pretty.
The pretty thing was a big rainbow in the sky. It had lots of colors, like red, blue, and yellow. Mia and the black cat liked the rainbow. They wanted to find the end of the rainbow.
Mia and the black cat walked and walked to find the end of the rainbow. They saw many things like trees, flowers, and birds. At last, they found the end of the rainbow. They were very happy and played there all day.
