Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mom. She saw a little boy playing with a ball and asked if she could join in. The boy said yes and they had so much fun playing together.
After playing for a while, Lily's mom said it was time to go home. Lily was sad because she wanted to play more. The little boy said, "Don't be sad, I have something fun to show you!" He took out a book and said, "Let's read this together!"
Lily and the little boy sat down and read the book together. They had so much fun reading and looking at the pictures. When they finished, Lily's mom said it was time to go home. Lily said goodbye to the little boy and thanked him for the fun day. She couldn't wait to come back to the park and play with him again.
