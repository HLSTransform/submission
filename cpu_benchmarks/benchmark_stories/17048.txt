Once upon a time, there was a baby. The baby liked to play with toys. One day, the baby was in the park with mom and dad. The baby saw a big red ball and wanted to play with it.
The baby went to the ball and started to play. Suddenly, a big dog came and took the ball away. The baby was sad and began to scream. The mom and dad heard the baby and became alert.
Mom and dad ran to the baby and hugged him. They took the ball back from the dog. The baby was happy again. They all played together with the ball and had a fun day at the park.
