It was a bright and sunny day, and the sun was shining brightly in the sky.
At the park, a little girl called Daisy was playing when she noticed something sparkle in the grass. She bent down and picked up a shiny object. It was a penny! She held it up to the sun and it shone brightly.
Daisy was very excited and she put the penny in her pocket. Then she went over to an old bench and found a newspaper there. It was yellow and had writing on it. Daisy didn't know what the writing said, but she liked the way the newspaper was shining in the sun.
Suddenly, something else caught Daisy's eye - in the newspaper was a picture of an unknown person. It was a man's face. She wondered who he was and why his picture was in the newspaper. 
Daisy liked looking at the newspaper and watching it shine in the sun. She decided to take it home with her to show her family. She put the newspaper in her bag and went home. 
The sun still shone brightly as Daisy walked home, feeling very happy.
