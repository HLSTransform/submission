Lily liked to dance. She danced in her room, in the garden, and in the park. She danced with her doll, her dog, and her mom. She danced when she was happy, when she was sad, and when she was bored. Dancing made her feel good.
One day, Lily saw a poster. It said: "Dance Show. Come and watch. Or come and join." Lily wanted to join. She asked her mom if she could. Her mom said yes, but she had to practice a lot. Lily said she would.
Lily practiced every day. She learned new moves, new songs, and new costumes. She made friends with other dancers. They helped each other. They had fun. Lily was excited for the show.
The day of the show came. Lily put on her costume. It was pink and sparkly. She felt comfortable and pretty. She went to the stage. She saw a lot of people. They were watching. They were waiting. Lily felt nervous.
She looked for her mom. She saw her in the front row. She smiled at Lily. She said: "You can do it. I'm proud of you. Just dance and have fun." Lily felt better. She nodded at her mom. She waited for the music. She was ready to dance.
