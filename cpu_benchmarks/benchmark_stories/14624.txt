Toby was a very happy 3 year old boy. He was excited because today he was going to the park! He hopped into the car and his Mum began to load it with lots of fun things. She took out a cushion and handed it to Toby. It was incredible! He couldn't believe that it was so soft and fluffy. His Mum smiled and said that it was his special cushion for the park.
So off they went to the park. Toby couldn't wait to get out of the car, he just wanted to start playing. He ran out of the car and jumped onto his cushion. He felt like he was in a big comfy bed.
Toby had an incredible time at the park. He jumped around, danced and played on the swings. His cushion was a great help with all the fun he was having, as he could rest on it in between games.
When it was time to go, Toby loaded his cushion back into the car. They drove home and Toby fell asleep dreaming of his day at the park.
