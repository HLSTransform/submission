Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play games with her friends. One day, they decided to play a game of sorting. They had to sort all the toys by color. Lily was very good at sorting and she won the game.
After the game, Lily's friend Sarah said, "I wish I was as good at sorting as you are, Lily." Lily replied, "You can be, Sarah. Just practice and you will get better."
The next day, Lily went to play with her friends again. But Sarah was not there. Lily asked her other friends where Sarah was. They said, "Sarah is feeling gloomy today. She thinks she is not good at anything."
Lily knew what to do. She went to Sarah's house and said, "Let's play a game of sorting. You can be on my team and we can sort the toys by size." Sarah agreed and they played the game. This time, Sarah won and she was very happy.
Lily taught Sarah that everyone is good at something and it's important to practice to get better. From that day on, Sarah was never gloomy again.
