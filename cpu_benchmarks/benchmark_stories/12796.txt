Mia was at the beach with her mom. She was so excited! She looked around and saw a dolphin swimming in the water. She asked her mom if she could catch it. Her mom said it might be too hard for little Mia, but if she was patient, she could try. 
Mia was determined to catch the dolphin. She waited and watched the dolphins for a long time. Finally one of the dolphins swam close to the shore. Mia ran in the water and tried to grab the dolphin. She was getting closer and closer and then, finally, she caught it! Mia was so excited she could hardly believe it. 
Mia held on to the dolphin tight and it jumped and splashed around in the water. Mia was so proud of herself. She had been patient and it paid off. Mia and her dolphin played together until sunset and then the dolphin swam away. Mia had a great day with her new friend and would never forget it.
