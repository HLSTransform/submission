Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. One day, she found a cool hut made of sticks and leaves. It was a secret place where she could play with her toys and read her books.
As she was playing, she noticed a vine hanging from a tree. She decided to twist it around the hut to make it look pretty. But when she pulled too hard, the hut started to shake and sway. She quickly let go of the vine and ran outside.
Lily realized that she shouldn't have twisted the vine so hard. She felt sad that she might have broken her cool hut. But when she went back inside, she saw that the hut was still standing strong. She was so happy that her cool hut was okay!
