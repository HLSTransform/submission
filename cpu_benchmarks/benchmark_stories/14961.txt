One day, Mark wanted to go outside. He went to his parents and asked, "Can I please go outside?" His parents smiled and said, "Yes, you may go outside. Just be sure to be back before the sun sets."
Mark was so excited. He ran out of the house and into the garden. He saw a beautiful flower and decided to pick it. He touched the petals and said, "It looks so peaceful!"
Suddenly, he heard a loud noise. His dad called out, "Mark! Get away from that flower! It can give you a shock!" Mark was surprised. He had never heard of such a thing.
His dad tried to explain, "The flower has electricity that's inside it. It's like a small light, but it's a bit dangerous. That's why we don't permit you to touch it."
Mark nodded and stepped back from the flower. He realized that even though it was pretty, it was something he should stay away from.
He continued exploring the garden, but the peaceful atmosphere was now gone. It would take some time before the fear of electricity was gone from his mind.
