Jill was a happy 3 year old girl. She loved spending time with her Grandma each week. Grandma was elderly, but she was always filled with fun ideas. One afternoon, she asked Jill if she wanted to watch a video.
Jill said yes and they spent the next two hours laughing and smiling as they watched the movie together. Afterwards, they talked about all the funny scenes they had watched. Every time they talked about it, they would start laughing again.
When it was time to go home, Jill gave her Grandma a big hug. She thanked her for spending the afternoon with her. She knew that spending time with Grandma was always special, and it always made her happy.
