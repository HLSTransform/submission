Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to swing and slide and run. But they also liked to climb the big tree. The tree had many branches and leaves. It was fun to see how high they could go.
One day, they saw a bird's nest on a branch. It had eggs inside. Lily and Ben wanted to see the eggs. They climbed higher and higher. But the branch was thin and weak. It could not hold them. It broke with a loud snap.
Lily and Ben fell down. They landed on the grass. They were not hurt, but they were scared. They cried and called for help. Their mom and dad heard them. They ran to the tree. They hugged Lily and Ben and made sure they were okay.
They also saw the bird's nest. It had fallen too. The eggs were broken. The bird's mom and dad were flying around. They were sad and angry. They chirped and pecked at Lily and Ben. They wanted their eggs back.
Lily and Ben felt sorry for the birds. They did not mean to break the eggs. They said sorry to the birds. But the birds did not understand. They remained mad. They did not want Lily and Ben near their tree.
Lily and Ben learned a lesson. They should not climb the tree. They should not touch the bird's nest. They should respect the birds and their home. They went to play somewhere else. They hoped the birds would find a new nest. They hoped the birds would be happy again.
