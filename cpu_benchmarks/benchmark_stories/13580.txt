Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play in the park with her friends. One day, she saw a big row of ducks swimming in the pond. She went closer to gaze at them. They looked so cute and fluffy.
Suddenly, Lily's friend Timmy came over. "Hi Lily! What are you doing?" he asked. "I'm watching the ducks. Look at them, they're so cute!" Lily said. Timmy looked at the ducks too and said, "Wow, they're so cool. I wish I could swim like them."
After a while, Lily and Timmy decided to leave the ducks and go play on the swings. But as they were leaving, Lily noticed that the ground was very dry. "Look Timmy, the ground is so dry. We should water it so the flowers can grow," she said. Timmy agreed and they found a watering can to help the flowers grow.
Lily and Timmy had a fun day playing in the park and helping the flowers grow. They even went back to see the ducks again before going home. It was a great day!
