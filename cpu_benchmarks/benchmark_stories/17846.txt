Anna was in her room. It was a sunny day. She saw a butterfly outside and ran to the window to look at it. The butterfly was flying fast. Anna laughed. She ran around the room, chasing the butterfly. She laughed and laughed, hopping and jumping. When the butterfly flew away, Anna could still hear her laughter echoing in the room. She was so happy. She went to her bed and curled up with a smile on her face.
