Once upon a time there was a gifted little girl named Jada. She loved playing with marbles and she was the champion at the marble game in town.
One day, she was asked to play her best marble game. She was excited and eager to show off her amazing marble skills.
When the game started, Jada was doing well and everything seemed to be going according to plan. But then, something strange happened. She began to question her ability and soon, felt discouraged. 
The other players started to notice this too. They realized that Jada was distracted and started to take advantage of the situation. They soon gained the upper hand and before long, the other players had taken all of Jadaâ€™s marbles.
At the end of the game, Jada was defeated and the other players laughed at her. She had been disgraced and embarrassed in front of everyone, including her parents. Her heart was broken and she ran away in tears. Sadly, she never returned to the marble game again.
