Once upon a time there was a boy who loved to tease his little brother. Every day they would go outside and play in the garden. One day, the little brother had an idea to make his brother smile. He asked him to do a funny motion. The big brother was so surprised and started to laugh. The little brother had a modest smile on his face and he was so proud.
The big brother said, "That was such a funny motion! Can you do it again?" The little brother happily said "yes!" and repeated the motion with a big smile. All day they continued to laugh and play, enjoying each other's company.
The little brother looked up to his big brother and was so thankful for the moments they shared. The big brother was glad that he could always make his little brother laugh. And from then on, they always stayed close and had lots of fun together.
