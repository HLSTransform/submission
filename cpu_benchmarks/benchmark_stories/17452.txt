Sara liked to observe things. She liked to watch the birds, the cars, the clouds, and the people. She had a big window in her room, where she could see many things.
One day, she saw a new thing in the window. It was a doll. It was big and pink and had long hair. It was sitting on a chair in the yard of the house next door. Sara wondered who it belonged to. She wanted to play with it.
She asked her mom if she could go outside and see the doll. Her mom said yes, but she had to be careful and not go too far. Sara put on her shoes and coat and ran outside. She crossed the street and went to the yard where the doll was.
She saw that the doll had a name tag. It said "Lily". Sara said hello to Lily and touched her hair. It was soft and shiny. She lifted Lily from the chair and hugged her. She felt harmless and friendly.
But then, she heard a voice. It was a girl, coming out of the house next door. She looked angry and scared. She shouted, "Hey, that's my doll! Give it back!"
Sara was surprised and scared too. She didn't know the girl. She didn't mean to take her doll. She just wanted to play with it. She said sorry and put Lily back on the chair. She ran back to her house and told her mom what happened.
Her mom said it was okay. She said that sometimes people don't like to share their things. She said that Sara should always ask before she touches someone else's things. She said that Sara could play with her own dolls, or make new friends who like to share. She gave Sara a hug and a cookie. Sara felt better. She still liked to observe things, but she learned to be more careful.
