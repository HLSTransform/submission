One day, a little boy was walking in the forest when he noticed something big and grey. He walked closer and saw it was a huge hippo! The little boy was very frightened, but also excited. He had never seen a hippo so close before.
The little boy carefully reached out to touch the hippo. The hippo was soft, like a big teddy bear. He started petting it and making hippo noises. The hippo was friendly and it enjoyed the little boy's company.
The little boy and the hippo started running around and playing together. They even danced and rolled around in the grass. It was so much fun and it made them both very excited.
The little boy smiled and waved goodbye to his new hippo friend. He ran off happy, knowing he would never forget the wonderful time they shared.
