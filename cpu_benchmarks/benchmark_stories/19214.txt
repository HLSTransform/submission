Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside in the forest. One day, Timmy found an axe on the ground. He picked it up and started to swing it around. "Wow, this is fun!" Timmy said.
Suddenly, a loud noise scared Timmy. It was a big bear! The bear wanted the axe. "Give me the axe!" the bear growled. Timmy didn't want to give it up because he liked playing with it. "No, it's mine!" Timmy said.
The bear and Timmy argued for a while, but then Timmy had an idea. He said, "I'll give you the axe if you give me a hug!" The bear thought about it and decided it was a fair trade. Timmy gave the axe to the bear and the bear gave Timmy a big, warm hug. From that day on, Timmy and the bear were friends and they played together in the forest.
