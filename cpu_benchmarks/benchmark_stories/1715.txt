Once upon a time, there was a princess who wore a long veil on her head. She loved her veil very much because it made her feel like a real princess. One day, while she was playing in the garden, she heard a loud ring. 
"Who could that be?" she wondered. She went to answer the door and found a little bird who had hurt its wing. The bird asked the princess for help.
The princess was happy to help and took the little bird to her room. She took off her veil and used it to wrap the bird's wing. But when the bird was all better, it wouldn't give the princess back her veil!
The princess was upset and said, "Please give me back my veil. It's very important to me." The bird replied, "I'm sorry, but I need it to make a nest for my babies." The princess thought for a moment and said, "Okay, you can keep my veil, but can I come visit your babies sometime?" The bird happily agreed, and the princess went back to playing in the garden, feeling happy that she had helped someone in need.
