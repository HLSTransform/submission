Once upon a time, there was a kind and thoughtful mommy who had a new infant. One day, the mommy was holding the infant and the infant started to cry. "What's wrong, little one?" asked the mommy. "I think the baby's diaper needs to be changed," said the mommy's friend who was visiting. 
The mommy said, "Thank you for noticing. I'll go get a new diaper." As the mommy was walking to get a new diaper, she accidentally stepped on a toy and it made a loud snap sound. The infant stopped crying and looked up at the mommy. "What was that noise?" asked the infant. "Oh, don't worry, it was just a toy," said the mommy. 
After the mommy changed the infant's diaper, the friend said, "You're such a good mommy. You're always so thoughtful and take such good care of your baby." The mommy smiled and said, "Thank you. I love my little one so much." The infant cooed and smiled, happy and content in the arms of its loving mommy.
