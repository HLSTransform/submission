Once upon a time, there was a popular girl named Lily. She loved going out and meeting new people. She was always having fun and making new friends.
One day, a big threat came to town. Everyone was scared and Lily had to stay inside. She was very sad that she couldn't have her fun any more. She wished for things to go back to the way they were before.
Lucky for her, soon the threat was gone. Everyone was so happy that Lily could go outside again! Soon she was the popular girl she had been before. She returned to meeting new people, and having fun.
The end!
