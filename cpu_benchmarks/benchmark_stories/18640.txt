Once upon a time, there was a family of bears. They decided to go on a vacation to the beach. They packed their bags with toys, snacks, and sunscreen. Baby bear was so excited to go on the vacation.
When they got to the beach, they found a spot to sit and put their heavy bags down. Mama bear said, "Let's play in the sand!" Baby bear replied, "Okay, I want to build a sandcastle!" So, they started building and playing.
After a while, Papa bear said, "I'm tired. Can we sit down?" Mama bear said, "Sure, let's find a seat." They found a bench and sat down to rest. Baby bear said, "This vacation is so much fun!" The end.
