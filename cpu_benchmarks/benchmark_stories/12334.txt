Once upon a time there was a chubby boy. He lived in a very big city. Every night he looked out of his window and watched the stars rise in the night sky.
One night he asked his mom, "What's beyond the city stars rise to?" His mom smiled and said, "One day you'll find out."
The chubby boy was very curious, so he decided to climb out of his window to find out what was beyond the city. As he climbed higher, the stars seemed to get brighter and brighter. He felt like he was getting closer and closer to the stars.
When he reached the top of the tall buildings he looked around and realized he was on top of the world. Below him was the city he was from, and he could now see how tiny it really was.
In the night sky above him were millions of stars, twinkling and blinking in a beautiful way. They were so close, he felt like he could reach out and touch them.
He was so happy that he had risen high enough to see the stars. He knew then that he could now reach higher than ever before. He was sure that whatever he set his mind to, he could achieve.
