Once upon a time there was a strong forest. In the forest, lived a little rabbit. She had a very special job. She was supposed to protect the forest.
One day, a fox came to the forest. The fox said to the rabbit, "I don't like this forest. I want to tear it down!"
But the rabbit said to the fox, "No! This forest is so strong, and I must protect it." She ran back and forth, hopping around the fox to keep him away from the trees.
The fox thought for a moment, and said, "I guess this forest is too strong. I will have to find somewhere else to play."
The rabbit was so happy that the fox realized the strength of the forest. She continued to protect the forest, and the other animals in the forest thanked her for her hard work.
