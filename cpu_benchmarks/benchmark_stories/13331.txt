Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a journal, where she drew pictures and wrote about her day. Lily was very polite, and she always said "please" and "thank you."
One day, Lily met a new friend named Tim. They played together and had fun. Tim saw Lily's journal and asked, "Can I see your journal, please?" Lily said, "Yes, of course!" They looked at the journal together and laughed at the funny pictures.
After playing, it was time for Tim to go home. Lily closed her journal and said, "Thank you for playing with me, Tim." Tim said, "You're welcome, Lily. I had a great time!" They both learned that being polite and sharing made their friendship even better.
