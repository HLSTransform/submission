Sara liked to play with her dolls, but she did not like to clean up after. She left them on the floor, on the bed, on the table, everywhere. Her mom told her many times to put them away, but Sara did not listen. She said it was boring to clean up.
One day, Sara's mom had a surprise for her. She said they were going to visit a farm, where there were horses and cows and chickens. Sara was very happy, because she loved animals. She put on her coat and hat and ran to the car.
When they got to the farm, Sara's mom took her to the stable, where the horses were. Sara saw a big brown horse with a white spot on its nose. She wanted to pet it and feed it a carrot. But her mom said, "No, Sara, you cannot go near the horse. You have to stay here and watch."
Sara was confused and sad. She asked her mom why she could not play with the horse. Her mom said, "Because you did not clean up your dolls, Sara. You were very naughty and did not do what I asked you. This is your punishment. You have to stay in this boring stable and look at the horse, but you cannot touch it or talk to it."
Sara felt very sorry and wished she had listened to her mom. She realized that cleaning up was not so boring after all, and that it was better than missing out on fun things. She said to her mom, "I'm sorry, mom, I was wrong. Please, can I play with the horse now? I promise I will clean up my dolls when we get home."
Her mom smiled and hugged her. She said, "I forgive you, Sara, but you have to keep your promise. You can play with the horse for a little while, but then we have to go. And when we get home, you have to put away your dolls and help me with the dishes."
Sara nodded and said, "Okay, mom, I will. Thank you for taking me to the farm. I love you." She ran to the horse and gave it a carrot and a pat. The horse neighed and licked her hand. Sara was happy and learned her lesson.
