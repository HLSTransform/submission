Lily was hungry. She wanted a snack. She walked to the kitchen and saw the big refrigerator. She knew there were yummy things inside. She opened the door and peeked inside.
She saw a bowl of fruit, a carton of milk, a jar of jam, and a plate of cookies. She smiled. She liked cookies. She reached for the plate, but then she heard a voice.
"Lily, what are you doing?" It was her mom. She sounded angry.
Lily quickly closed the door and turned around. She saw her mom standing in the doorway. She looked at Lily with a frown.
"I'm sorry, mom. I was just looking for a snack," Lily said.
"You know you're not supposed to take cookies before dinner. That's not healthy. And you're not supposed to open the refrigerator without asking. That's not safe. You could hurt yourself or spill something," her mom said.
Lily felt bad. She knew her mom was right. She lowered her head and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I won't do it again."
Her mom sighed and walked to the refrigerator. She opened the door and peeked inside. She saw the plate of cookies. She smiled. She liked cookies too. She took one and gave it to Lily.
"Here, you can have one cookie. But only one. And only because you're my creative little girl. You made such a nice drawing today. I'm proud of you," her mom said.
Lily smiled and took the cookie. She hugged her mom and said, "Thank you, mom. I love you."
"I love you too, Lily. Now let's go wash our hands and get ready for dinner," her mom said.
They walked out of the kitchen, holding hands and eating their cookies. They were happy.
