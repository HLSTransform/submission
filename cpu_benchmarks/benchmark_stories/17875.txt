Once there was a girl who liked to pretend. She used her imagination to make up new games and adventures. One day she found a penny on the ground. She thought it was so unusual to find a penny on the ground - she had never seen one before!
She wanted to do something special with it so she decided to pretend it was magic. She closed her eyes and waved it over herself and then opened her eyes to see what would happen. She was so excited when she saw glittery sparkles coming out of the penny - it had worked!
She kept playing pretend with the penny, finding out what other fun things it could do. Every day she would pretend the penny could do something new and it was always exciting. The penny made her imagination grow and she had lots of fun pretending with it.
