Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a very useful backpack that she loved to take with her everywhere she went. One day, she went on a walk with her mom and dad. 
As they were walking, Lily saw a pretty flower under a tree. She wanted to pick it, but her mom said, "No, we can't pick flowers from someone else's garden." 
Lily was sad, but she understood. As they continued their walk, she saw a shiny rock under a bush. She asked her dad if she could pick it up and he said, "Sure, you can take it home with you." 
Lily was so happy to have found something to put in her backpack. When they returned home, Lily showed her rock to her little brother. He loved it too and asked if he could borrow it for a little while. 
Lily said, "Sure, you can borrow it, but you have to return it to me later." Her brother promised to return the rock and Lily was happy to share her useful backpack with him.
