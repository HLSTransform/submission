Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a smooth and soft blanket that she loved to hold in her hand. One day, Lily's mom asked her to part with her beloved blanket so that she could wash it. Lily was sad, but she knew it was important to keep her blanket clean. So she gave it to her mom and waited patiently for it to be returned to her. When her mom brought it back, it was even smoother and softer than before! Lily was so happy to have her favorite blanket back in her hand.
