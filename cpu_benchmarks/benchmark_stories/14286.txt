Once upon a time there was a little girl called Anna. Anna was always in a hurry and very impatient. She was always rushing off to do as much as she can in her day. One day, on her way to the park, Anna saw a pigeon perching on a branch of a tree in the middle of the path. Anna was in such a rush because she wanted to play with her friends at the park. But the pigeon was in Anna's way and it did not want to move. Anna became very impatient, "Go away pigeon!", she said. But the pigeon stayed, it just looked at Anna. 
Anna realised that if she continued to rush it might not end well. So she stopped, took a few deep breaths and relaxed. The pigeon also relaxed and flew away after some time. Anna felt glad that she had saved the pigeon from getting hit. 
The moral of the story is to remember to relax, even when you are in a hurry. If you stay patient and relaxed, you can get much further faster.
