One day, a boy named Tim was eager to find something sweet. He went outside to look for a treat. Tim saw a green plant and thought it was mint. He kneeled down to pick some leaves.
Tim brought the leaves to his mom. She looked at the leaves and said, "This is not mint." Tim was sad but still wanted to taste it. He thought it might still be sweet.
Tim put the leaf in his mouth and it tasted bad. He spit it out and his mouth felt funny. His mom was worried and took him to the doctor. Tim learned that not all leaves are good to eat.
