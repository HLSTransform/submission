Tom and Lily are going to visit their grandma. They are very happy because they love their grandma. She lives in a big house with a garden and a dog. She always makes them yummy food and tells them funny stories.
But before they go, they have to pack their bags. They have to take their clothes, their toys, and their gifts for grandma. Tom has a gift for grandma. It is a long scarf that he made with his mom. He used red and blue wool and a big needle. He worked very hard on it. He thinks grandma will like it a lot.
Lily also has a gift for grandma. It is a picture that she drew with her crayons. She drew grandma and herself and Tom and the dog. She used many colors and stickers. She wrote "I love you grandma" on it. She is very proud of it. She thinks grandma will be very happy.
They put their gifts in their bags and zip them up. Then they go to the car with their mom and dad. They buckle up and wave goodbye to their house. They are ready to go.
"Are you excited to see grandma?" mom asks.
"Yes, yes, yes!" Tom and Lily say.
"What did you make for her?" dad asks.
"I made a long scarf!" Tom says.
"I drew a picture!" Lily says.
"Wow, those are wonderful gifts!" mom says. "Grandma will love them very much!"
Tom and Lily smile and hug their gifts. They can't wait to see grandma and give them to her. They know she will hug them and kiss them and thank them. They love their grandma very much.
