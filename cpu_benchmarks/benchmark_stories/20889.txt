Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lea. Lea was only three years old. She was very excited when mum and dad said she could help with the chores. 
Lea carefully sorted through the laundry. She separated the colours from the whites and the big pieces from the small ones. After the sorting was finished, the big pieces went into the washing machine and the small pieces were ironed. Lea watched carefully as mum took the red shirt out of the basket and put it on the ironing board. Mum plugged the iron in, waited for it to heat up, and then began ironing the shirt. 
When the red shirt was finished, Lea ran over and said, "I did it mum!" Mum smiled at her and said, "Yes, you did a good job! You are a very helpful little girl."
Lea was so proud of herself. She could not wait to sort and iron more clothes next time.
