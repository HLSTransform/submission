Ben and Lily went to the beach with Mom and Dad. They liked to play in the sand and look for shells. Sometimes they found big shells that had something inside. Mom and Dad said those were oysters. Oysters were animals that lived in the water and made pearls.
One day, Ben and Lily found a very big oyster shell. They opened it and saw a shiny white ball. It was a pearl. They were very happy and showed it to Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad smiled and said they were very lucky. They said a pearl was a rare and beautiful thing that oysters made.
Ben and Lily wanted to know how oysters made pearls. Mom and Dad tried to explain. They said oysters had soft bodies that they protected with their shells. Sometimes, a small thing, like a grain of sand, got inside the shell and hurt the oyster. The oyster covered the thing with a smooth layer of something called nacre. The oyster did this over and over until the thing became a pearl.
Ben and Lily listened and nodded. They thought oysters were very clever and gifted. They thanked the oyster for giving them the pearl. They decided to keep the pearl as a special treasure and a reminder of their fun day at the beach.
