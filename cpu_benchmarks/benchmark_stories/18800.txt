Lily and Tom are playing with blocks. They want to make a big tower. They add more and more blocks to the tower. They are happy.
But then, a big wind comes. It blows on the tower. The tower falls down. Lily and Tom are sad.
"Oh no!" Lily says. "Our tower is gone!"
Tom has an idea. He says, "Let's make a new tower. But this time, let's use some rub."
"What is rub?" Lily asks.
"Rub is something sticky. It can hold the blocks together. Look, I have some rub here." Tom shows Lily a tube of glue.
"Wow!" Lily says. "How do we use it?"
Tom says, "We put some rub on the blocks. Then we stick them together. Like this." Tom squeezes some glue on a block and sticks it to another block.
Lily tries it too. She says, "This is fun!"
They use the rub to make a new tower. The tower is bigger and stronger than before. They are proud.
The big wind comes again. It blows on the tower. But the tower does not fall down. The rub holds the blocks together. The tower is mighty.
Lily and Tom cheer. They say, "We did it! We made a mighty tower!"
