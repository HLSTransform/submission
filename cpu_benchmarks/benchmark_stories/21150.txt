Once upon a time, there was a boy. His name was Jack. Jack loved to play. He liked to play in the garden, and on the porch. 
One day, Jack was feeling very playful. He went to the porch to find something to do. He saw a ball! He picked it up and threw it in the sky. Up and up it went, until it reached the clouds.
Jack laughed and looked around. He noticed a bird on the porch. He smiled, and said hello to the bird. He reached out to give it a pat. Quickly, he threw some pieces of bread to the bird. 
The bird was so excited! It began to peck and play with the food. Jack was so happy to watch this playful bird. He threw a few more pieces of bread, and the bird kept pecking and playing. 
Jack playfully waved goodbye to the bird, and went inside. He had made a new friend.
