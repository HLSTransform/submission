One day, a little rabbit named Lily was in her garden. She loved to grow things. She had a new herb to plant. She was anxious to see it grow big and strong. She knew that the herb would help her friends feel better when they were sick.
Lily dug a hole to put the herb in. She saw a big rock in the hole. She tried to move the rock, but it was very heavy. She pushed and pushed, but the rock did not move. Lily was tired and worried. She thought, "How can I plant my herb with the big rock in the way?"
The next day, Lily asked her friend, a strong bear named Ben, to help her move the rock. Ben came to the garden and saw the rock. He tried to move it too. As Ben pushed the rock, his foot began to slip. He pushed harder, and the rock finally moved! Lily was so happy that she could now plant her herb.
Lily put the herb in the hole and covered it with dirt. She watered it every day, and soon the herb grew big and strong. When her friends were sick, Lily would give them some of her special herb. They always felt better after having some. Lily knew that asking for help was a good thing, and she was proud of her garden.
