One day, Johnny was walking in the woods. He looked around and saw lots of trees and birds. Suddenly, he heard a noise. A little bird was whistling! Johnny was so surprised he stopped and listened. The bird had such a smart and cheerful sound. Johnny thought it was wonderful and he smiled.
He wanted to whistle too, so he put his fingers to his lips and tried. But it didn't work, no sound came out. So he tried again and this time he was successful. Johnny laughed and he kept on whistling until he forgot all about the bird.
The bird heard Johnny and flew down to him. The bird was very curious about the noise. He flew onto Johnny's nose and just looked at him. Johnny wasn't scared and he smiled at the bird. He could feel the little bird's feet tickling his nose. They stayed like that for a few minutes until the bird flew away.
Johnny was so happy from the experience and he continued whistling as he walked home. He was amazed at how smart the little bird had been and he was proud of himself for being able to whistle. He smiled the whole way home.
