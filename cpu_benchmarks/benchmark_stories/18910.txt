Sara and Ben like to play at the shore. They see sand and water and shells and crabs. They make a big castle with sand and shells. They are happy.
But then a crab comes out of the water. It is red and angry. It walks to the castle and breaks it with its claws. Sara and Ben are sad and mad.
They run to the crab and try to catch it. But the crab is fast and smart. It pinches Sara's finger with its claw. Sara cries out loud. It hurts a lot.
Ben sees Sara's finger. It is red and swollen. He is sorry for Sara. He gets a clean cloth from his bag and wraps it around Sara's finger. He hugs Sara and says, "It's OK. The crab is gone. We can make another castle."
Sara smiles and says, "Thank you, Ben. You are a good brother. I love you." They hug and kiss. They are happy again. They go back to the shore and make a new castle. They are careful of the crabs. They have fun. The end.
