Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy and his friends were playing hide-and-seek when they saw a scary mask on the ground. Timmy's friends thought it was funny and put the mask on, but Timmy didn't like it. He felt scared and wanted to go home.
As they were walking home, they heard a loud noise. Timmy's friends started to panic and run away, but Timmy stayed calm and honest. He saw that the noise was just a big truck passing by. Timmy's friends were happy that they were safe, and they thanked Timmy for being brave.
From that day on, Timmy's friends knew that he was always honest and brave, even when things got scary. They never played with scary masks again, and Timmy was happy to be able to play with his friends without feeling scared.
