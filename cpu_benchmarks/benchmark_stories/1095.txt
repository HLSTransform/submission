Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue was very patient, which meant she was very good at waiting. One day, Sue asked her mom for something to do. Her mom said that she could borrow something special from the attic. Sue was so excited! 
She walked up the stairs and opened the door to the attic. It was so dark, but Sue was brave and she kept going. She looked around until she found something that caught her eye. It was an old box, and inside was a sparkly surprise!
She was so happy that she could borrow the sparkly surprise to play with. She ran downstairs to show her mom the sparkly surprise. Sue was so grateful that she was able to borrow the surprise from the attic! 
From then on, Sue was very patient when she wanted something and her mom always said that she could borrow it. Sue never forgot how special it was to borrow from the attic.
