Once there was Lucy, a shy 3 year old. She was picking tomatoes in the garden but wasn't sure what to do with them.
Suddenly, she heard a voice coming from the tree above her. Startled, she looked up to see a bright yellow bird.
"Hello Lucy, what are you doing there?" the bird asked.
Lucy was a bit scared, but she replied, "I'm picking tomatoes."
The bird flew down and perched next to Lucy. 
"Tasty tomatoes! Would you like to know what to do with them?" the bird said cheerfully.
Lucy nodded her head.
"Well," the bird continued, "you can make a delicious tomato soup. Listen, this is what you need to do..."
The bird went on to explain how to make soup out of the tomatoes. Lucy listened carefully and when the bird finished, she thanked it.
Before flying away, the bird said, "Don't forget to be brave and try new things, even if you are shy."
