One day, a little girl named Amy wanted to test a new cookie recipe. She asked her mom, "Can I make cookies today?" Her mom said, "Yes, you can, Amy."
Amy got all the things she needed to make the cookies. She mixed everything in a big bowl. Then, she put the cookies in the oven. They smelled so good!
When the cookies were done, Amy took them out of the oven. She tried one and said, "Yum! But it is a little dry." So, she shared the cookies with her friends and they all loved them. They said, "Thank you, Amy! These cookies are so good!"
