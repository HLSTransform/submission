Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Sam. She loved going for walks with her dad. One day, Dad took Sam to the park. She saw a big track and she wanted to have some fun.
Dad said "let's try running on the track." So Sam and Dad started to run. Their feet made a sound like pitter-patter. Sam was so excited - she laughed and laughed!
Then Dad said "Let's see if you can jump over that log on the track". Sam was a bit scared, but she decided to try it. She jumped with all her might, and soared over the log.
Sam was so proud of herself. She laughed with joy. Then, she and Dad hugged and had a big squeeze. They ran back home, happy together.
