Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was playing in the park when she fell and hurt her knee. Lily was frightened and cried a lot. Her mommy came and gave her medicine to make her feel better. 
The next day, Lily went back to the park to play. She saw a boy who had taken her toy. She was angry and wanted to take it back. But then she remembered how she felt when she was hurt and how her mommy forgave her when she made a mistake. 
Lily decided to forgive the boy and asked if they could play together. They had lots of fun and even shared Lily’s toy. Lily learned that it’s important to forgive others, just like her mommy forgave her.
