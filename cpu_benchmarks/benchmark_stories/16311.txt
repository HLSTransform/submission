Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play dress-up and wear pretty clothes. Her mommy would always pick out the best fashion for her to wear. 
One day, Lily and her mommy went to the store to buy a new dress for a party. Lily was so excited to wear her new dress, but she was also very impatient. She kept asking her mommy, "Is it time to wear my new dress yet?" 
After they got home, Lily's mommy put the new dress in the closet for safekeeping. But when it was time for the party, Lily couldn't remember where her new dress was. She looked and looked, but couldn't find it. 
Finally, her mommy remembered that she had put the dress in the closet. Lily was so happy to have found her new dress and couldn't wait to show it off at the party. From then on, Lily made sure to remember where her favorite clothes were kept.
