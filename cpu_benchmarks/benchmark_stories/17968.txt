One day, a big, impressive dog named Max went for a walk. Max liked to take turns on the road. He saw a little cat named Lucy. Lucy seemed sad.
Max asked Lucy, "Why are you sad?" Lucy said, "I can't find my toy. I lost it when I took a turn on the road."
Max wanted to help Lucy. They looked for the toy together. They took many turns on the road. At last, they found the toy near a big tree.
Lucy was very happy. She said, "Thank you, Max!" Max felt good for helping his new friend. From that day, Max and Lucy played together all the time.
