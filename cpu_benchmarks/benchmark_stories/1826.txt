Once there was a little boy who really wanted a kayak. So he asked his mom and dad, but they said no. The little boy was really upset, so he decided to ask his Uncle for help. He found his Uncle and demanded that he get a kayak. Uncle was very reliable and said he would see what he could do.
The next day Uncle arrived with a big red kayak for the boy. The boy was thrilled and could not wait to try it out. So he ran to the lake and hopped in. He enjoyed paddling around with his new kayak. He was so happy that his Uncle had been so reliable and had found him such a cool present.
