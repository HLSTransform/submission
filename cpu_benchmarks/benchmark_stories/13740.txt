Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in the pool. But today, it is very hot. Sara and Ben feel lazy. They do not want to swim or splash. They just want to sit in the shade.
Mom comes to the pool. She says, "Come on, Sara and Ben. The pool is fun. You can cool off and have fun. Why are you so lazy?"
Sara and Ben complain. They say, "Mom, we are tired. We do not want to play in the pool. We want to rest. The pool is boring. Can we have a snack?"
Mom shakes her head. She says, "No, Sara and Ben. You have to play in the pool first. Then you can have a snack. You are not tired. You are lazy. Lazy is not good. Lazy makes you sad and grumpy. Playing makes you happy and healthy. Come on, get in the pool."
Sara and Ben sigh. They do not like to be lazy. They do not want to be sad and grumpy. They want to be happy and healthy. They get in the pool. They swim and splash. They have fun. They forget to complain. Mom smiles. She is proud of Sara and Ben. She says, "Good job, Sara and Ben. You are not lazy. You are brave and strong. Now you can have a snack." Sara and Ben are happy. They say, "Thank you, Mom. We love you. We love the pool."
