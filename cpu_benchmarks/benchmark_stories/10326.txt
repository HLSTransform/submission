Lily loved to dance. She danced every day in her room, in the garden, and at school. She wanted to be a dancer when she grew up. She had a lot of dresses and shoes for dancing.
One day, she saw a new dress in the shop window. It was pink and shiny and had a big bow. Lily wanted it very much. She asked her mom to buy it for her. Her mom said no. She said they had no money for a new dress. Lily was angry. She cried and screamed and kicked. She demanded the dress.
Her mom was sad and tired. She tried to calm Lily down. She said they could go to the library and read a book about dancers. She said they could make a dress from old clothes. She said they could watch a dance show on TV. She said she loved Lily very much.
But Lily did not listen. She did not want anything else. She only wanted the dress. She ran away from her mom and into the street. She did not look where she was going. She did not see the big car. The car hit her hard. Lily fell down and did not get up.
Her mom ran to her and held her. She cried and screamed and called for help. But it was too late. Lily was gone. She never danced again.
