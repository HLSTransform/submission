Lily liked to play the flute. She had a pink flute that made pretty sounds. She played it every day in her room. She was happy.
One day, her brother Max came into her room. He was angry. He wanted to play with his cars, but Lily was making too much noise. He grabbed her flute and ran away. Lily was sad. She chased him down the hall.
"Give me back my flute!" she cried.
"No, it's mine now!" he shouted.
They reached the living room, where their mom was sitting on the couch. She saw them fighting and was mad. She told them to stop and share. She took the flute from Max and gave it to Lily. She told Max to say sorry.
Max did not want to say sorry. He was still angry. He pushed Lily hard. Lily fell to the floor. She hit her head on the table. She felt pain. She started to cry.
Mom heard her cry and was worried. She ran to her and saw blood on her head. She was scared. She knelt down and hugged her. She told Max to go to his room. She called dad and the doctor.
Lily was confused. She did not understand why Max was so mean. She did not understand why her head was bleeding. She did not understand why mom was crying. She wished she could play her flute again. She was not happy.
