One day, Alex and his mom were heading to a birthday party together. Alex was very excited for the party. He couldn't wait to wear his cute costume. 
"Mom, what is my costume?" he asked. 
"You'll have to wait and see!" giggled his mom. 
When they arrived at the party, Alex's mom showed him his costume. It was a red cape with a bright golden star! 
"Wow! I look so creative!" Alex was so happy he started bouncing up and down. 
His mom smiled and said, "I thought you'd like it! Now it's time to solve the biggest game of the afternoon." She pointed to a big, colorful puzzle in the corner of the room. 
Alex immediately hopped over to the puzzle, eager to begin. He soon found it wasn't very difficult to solve. In no time, Alex had solved the puzzle and was beaming from ear to ear. 
"Good job, Alex! I knew you could do it," his mom praised him. 
Alex was so proud of himself. He couldn't stop showing off his costume, and his parents couldn't stop bragging about how creative and clever their son was.
