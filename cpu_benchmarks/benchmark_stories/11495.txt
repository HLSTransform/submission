One day, a lovely little girl named Lily went to the store with her mom. She saw a big jar of candy on the shelf. Lily's eyes got very big. She asked her mom, "Can I please have some candy?"
Her mom said, "You can have some if you promise to share with your brother, Jack." Lily nodded her head and said, "I promise!" She was very excited.
When they got home, Lily opened the jar and began to examine the candy. She picked out the best ones for her and Jack. As she was doing this, she remembered her promise to share.
Lily went to find Jack and said, "I have some candy from the store. Let's share!" Jack was very happy. They sat down and enjoyed the candy together, just like Lily promised.
