Once upon a time there was a girl who really wanted to go to the office. She was so excited to go and see what it looked like!
When she got there, she was very impressed. The office was tall and big with lots of exciting things to do. She looked around and saw desks, chairs and computers. She wanted to speak to someone but there was nobody around. 
She kept walking and soon she saw a man. She asked him why he was in the office and he told her he was there to work. She was so excited to hear that and wanted to stay and play. 
The man showed her around the office and she was amazed. She thought it was so impressive! She learnt all about the office and the people who worked there. 
Finally, when it was time for her to go the man gave her a big smile. She had had a great day learning about the office. She promised herself that one day she would grow up to work there too.
