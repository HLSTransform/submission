Sam and Mia like to play with paper. They can fold it and make many things. They can make hats, boats, planes and more. They have a lot of fun with paper.
One day, they find a big rod in the yard. It is orange and shiny. They wonder what it is. They think it is a toy. They want to play with it.
Sam says, "I want to fold the rod and make a snake." Mia says, "No, I want to fold the rod and make a bracelet." They both pull the rod and try to fold it. But the rod is hard and does not fold. It only bends a little.
They get angry and start to fight. They yell and cry. They do not share the rod. They do not have fun.
Mom hears them and comes to see. She sees the rod and says, "Oh no, this is not a toy. This is a hose. It is for watering the plants. You cannot fold it. You can only roll it."
She takes the rod and rolls it up. She puts it away. She says, "You should not play with things that are not yours. You should ask first. And you should be nice to each other. Sharing is caring."
She gives them some paper and scissors. She says, "Here, you can fold the paper and make whatever you want. But please, do not fight. Play together and have fun."
Sam and Mia say, "Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Sam. Sorry, Mia." They hug and say, "We love you, Mom. We love you, Sam. We love you, Mia."
They take the paper and scissors and start to fold. They make many things. They make hats, boats, planes and more. They share and help each other. They have a lot of fun with paper.
