Once upon a time, there was a princess named Lily. She had a pretty dress that was pink and sparkly. One day, she met a prince named Jack. He had a big smile and a shiny sword.
"Hello, Lily," said Jack. "Will you marry me?"
Lily blushed and said, "Yes, I will marry you, Jack!"
But then, the king said, "Jack, you need a passport to marry my daughter. Go get one from the dark forest."
So, Jack went to the dark forest and found a passport. He brought it back to the king and he and Lily got married. They lived happily ever after.
