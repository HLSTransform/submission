Once upon a time, there was a little squirrel named Nutty. Nutty loved to gather nuts to eat. One day, Nutty found a big nut, but it was stuck in a tree. Nutty tried and tried, but couldn't get the nut out. Nutty started to scream for help.
A kind bird named Tweetie heard Nutty's screams and flew over to help. Tweetie calmly flew up to the tree and gently knocked the nut loose. Nutty was so happy and grateful that he shared his nuts with Tweetie.
From that day on, Nutty and Tweetie were the best of friends. They would gather nuts together and have fun playing in the trees. Whenever Nutty needed help, he knew he could scream for Tweetie and she would come to his rescue.
