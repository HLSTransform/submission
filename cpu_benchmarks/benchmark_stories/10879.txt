Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to walk on the street with her mommy. One day, they saw a powerful wind blowing. 
Lily said, "Mommy, look! The trees are waving!" 
"Yes, they are," mommy replied. "We need to be careful because the wind is so strong." 
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was their neighbor, Mr. Johnson. He said, "Hello, Lily! Did you see how powerful the wind is today?" 
Lily smiled and said, "Yes, Mr. Johnson. The trees are waving so much!" 
Mommy and Lily continued to walk, holding hands tightly. They were happy to see the powerful wind, but they were also happy to be safe at home.
