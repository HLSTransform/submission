Sara and Ben were playing in the park. It was summer and the sun was hot. They liked to run and slide and swing. They saw a big dog with a red ball. The dog was friendly and wagged its tail.
"Can we play with the dog?" Sara asked Ben.
"Sure, let's go and say hello," Ben said.
They ran to the dog and petted him. The dog licked their faces and dropped the ball. Sara picked up the ball and threw it. The dog ran after it and brought it back. They played catch for a while and had fun.
Then a man came and shouted at them. He was the dog's owner. He was angry and rude.
"Stop! Stop! What are you doing with my dog? Get away from him! He is not your toy! He is mine!" he yelled.
Sara and Ben were scared and confused. They did not do anything bad. They just wanted to play with the dog.
"Sorry, sir, we did not know. The dog was nice to us. We did not hurt him," Sara said.
"I don't care! You are ignorant kids! You have no right to touch my dog! Go away and leave us alone!" the man said.
He grabbed the dog and the ball and walked away. He did not say thank you or goodbye. He was mean and rude.
Sara and Ben felt sad and hurt. They did not understand why the man was so angry. They did not like him. They liked the dog.
They went back to their parents and told them what happened. Their parents hugged them and said they were sorry. They said the man was wrong and they did nothing wrong. They said the dog was lucky to have them as friends. They said they were proud of them for being kind and polite.
Sara and Ben felt better and smiled. They decided to forget the man and remember the dog. They hoped the dog was happy and safe. They hoped to see him again. They loved the dog.
