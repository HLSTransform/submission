Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his toy hammer. He would pretend to fix things all around the house with it.
One day, Timmy's friend Tommy came over to play. Tommy saw Timmy's hammer and said, "Wow, that's a cool hammer! Can I play with it?"
Timmy thought for a moment and said, "I really like my hammer, but I value our friendship more. You can play with it for a little while."
Tommy was happy and played with the hammer for a bit. But then, he started to get selfish and didn't want to give it back. Timmy reminded him, "Sharing is important and it's not nice to be selfish."
Tommy realized his mistake and gave the hammer back to Timmy. They continued to play together and had lots of fun. The end.
