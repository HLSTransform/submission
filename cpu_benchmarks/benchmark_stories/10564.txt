One day, there was a dog named Jazz. He was very hungry, but nobody wanted to feed him. He wanted to find food for himself, but he had no idea where to look. He howled in the night in the hope that someone would take pity on him and feed him.
Suddenly, he had an idea. He started barking and howling even louder. He figured that maybe someone would hear him and come to his rescue. Eventually, a nice old lady heard his cries and came to feed him. She was so kind and gave him the food he was craving. He ate it all up and felt happy in his tummy.
Despite the old ladyâ€™s kindness, there were still people who were so mean that they wanted to hurt poor Jazz. They would yell and yell at him in a harsh manner and try to scare him away. He was so frightened that he would run and hide when he heard their voices.
Finally, one day, Jazz found another kind soul who fed him and kept him away from the harsh people. He was so thankful and they became the best of friends. From then on, the nice person fed him everyday, and Jazz was so happy.
