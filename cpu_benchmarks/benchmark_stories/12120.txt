Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play games with her friends. One day, they decided to play hide and seek. Lily wanted to win because she was very competitive. 
She found a great hiding spot in a dark corner of the room. But then, she heard her friends coming. She quickly shut her eyes and held her breath so they wouldn't find her. 
After a while, her friends gave up and went to play something else. Lily opened her eyes and realized she had won the game! She felt so happy and proud of herself. From that day on, Lily knew that sometimes it's important to be competitive, but it's also okay to have fun with friends.
