Sam was very tired. He had played all day with his toys and his dog. He wanted to go to bed, but he had to wait for his mom and dad. They were listening to the radio in the living room. Sam heard them talk and laugh.
Sam yawned. He rubbed his eyes. He walked to the living room. He saw his mom and dad on the couch. They smiled at him. They turned off the radio. They said, "It's time for bed, Sam. Come here, we'll read you a story."
Sam climbed on the couch. He snuggled with his mom and dad. They opened a book. It had pictures of animals. Sam liked animals. He pointed at them and said their names. He saw a lion, a monkey, a giraffe, and a snake.
Sam yawned again. He was very sleepy. He closed his eyes. He heard his mom and dad read the story. They said, "The lion has a wide mouth. He can roar very loud. The monkey has a wide smile. He can make funny faces. The giraffe has a wide neck. He can reach the tall leaves. The snake has a wide tongue. He can smell the air."
Sam dreamed of the animals. He dreamed he was with them in the jungle. He roared, he smiled, he reached, and he smelled. He was happy. He slept well. He did not hear his mom and dad say, "Good night, Sam. We love you."
