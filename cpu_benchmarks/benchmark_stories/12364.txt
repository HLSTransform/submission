Once upon a time, there was a furry cat called Milly. Milly was always very curious and loved to explore new places.
One day, Milly found a mysterious puzzle in the garden. It looked very interesting so she decided to play with it. Milly spent the whole morning trying to figure out the puzzle. She was determined to receive the surprise at the end.
Suddenly, the sky grew dark. But Milly was too excited to notice and kept playing. Meanwhile, the thunder roared and lightning flashed. Milly didn't give up and held on to the puzzle tightly. She was getting closer and closer to solving the puzzle.
Luckily, just as the rain began to pour, Milly finally managed to receive the surprise inside the puzzle. She couldn't believe her luck!
The furry cat smiled in delight and ran home, content with her new discovery. From that day onwards, Milly never gave up no matter how hard a challenge she faced.
