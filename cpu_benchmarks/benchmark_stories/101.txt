Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bake with her mom. One day, Lily wanted to make cookies all by herself. Her mom said she could try.
Lily put all the ingredients in a bowl and stirred them together. She was so happy when she tasted the sweet dough. She put the cookies in the oven and waited for them to bake.
But when the cookies were finished, they were burnt and hard. Lily was sad. She didn't have success with her cookies. Her mom hugged her and said it was okay. They would try again another day.
