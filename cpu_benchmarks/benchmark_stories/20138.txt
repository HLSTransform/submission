Tom and Lily are twins who love to play music. Tom likes to play the drum and Lily likes to play the horn. They have a big box of toys that make different sounds. One day, they find a new toy in the box. It is a shiny metal thing with many holes and buttons. It has a long tube that you can blow into.
"What is this?" Tom asks.
"I don't know. Let's try it!" Lily says.
They take turns to blow into the tube, but they only make loud and funny noises. They laugh and giggle at the silly sounds.
"Look, Mommy!" Tom says. "We found a new toy!"
Mommy comes to see what they are playing with. She smiles and says, "That is not a toy, my dears. That is a saxophone. It is a musical instrument that you can play jazz with."
"Jazz?" Lily asks.
"Yes, jazz. It is a kind of music that is very cool and fun. Do you want to hear some jazz?" Mommy asks.
"Yes, please!" Tom and Lily say.
Mommy puts on a CD of jazz music and plays it for them. They hear the saxophone and other instruments make beautiful and lively sounds. They clap and dance along to the music.
"Wow, this is amazing!" Tom says.
"I love jazz!" Lily says.
Mommy hugs them and says, "I'm glad you like jazz, my dears. Jazz is a wonderful way to express yourself and enjoy life. But remember, the saxophone is not a toy. It is a special instrument that needs care and practice. If you want to play it, you have to learn how to do it properly and respect it."
"Okay, Mommy. We understand," Tom and Lily say.
They put the saxophone back in the box and thank Mommy for showing them jazz. They decide to keep playing with their drum and horn, but they also dream of playing the saxophone one day.
The moral value of the story is: respect and appreciate music and musical instruments.
