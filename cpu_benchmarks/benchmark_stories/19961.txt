Anna liked to play in the park with her friends. They liked to climb the big tree and sit on the branches. They felt like birds in the sky. Sometimes they sang songs and told stories.
One day, a new boy came to the park. His name was Ben. He wanted to play with Anna and her friends, but he was shy. He did not know how to climb the tree. He watched them from the ground and wished he could join them.
Anna saw Ben and felt sorry for him. She was a compassionate girl. She wanted to help him. She asked her friends to permit Ben to play with them. They agreed. They climbed down from the tree and greeted Ben. They taught him how to climb the tree and sit on the branches. They shared their songs and stories with him.
Ben was happy. He thanked Anna and her friends for being kind to him. He said he liked the tree and the branches. He said he liked them too. They became friends and played together every day. They felt like birds in the sky.
