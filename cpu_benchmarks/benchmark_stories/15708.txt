Once upon a time, there was a little boy who had a very loyal friendâ€”a toy dragon! The dragon was very small, no bigger than a jug. One day, the little boy was playing in his room when he was hit with a magical sparkle. Suddenly, the dragon started to shrink! 
The little boy was devastated. He looked to the dragon and asked, "Why are you getting so tiny?"
The dragon tapped into the little boy's energy and spoke with a tiny voice, "I'm shrinking to protect us both. I'm making myself small so I can be with you wherever you go!"
The little boy gave the dragon a big hug and said, "Thank you for being so loyal to me, friend."
The dragon smiled and said, "It's what friends are for." 
And the little boy and his loyal dragon lived happily ever after.
