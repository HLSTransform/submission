One day, Jake was walking by a lake when he saw something sparkling on top of the water. He got closer and realized it was a diamond. The diamond was purple and it was so pretty. Jake wanted to pick it up but he was afraid he might drop it. 
Suddenly, Jake heard a noise. It was a small green frog hopping on the grass. 
"You want to pick the diamond, right?" said the frog. 
Jake nodded. 
The frog laughed and said, "Don't worry, I will help you get it. Come closer and use your hand to pick the diamond."
So Jake stepped closer to the edge of the lake and carefully picked up the diamond. He was so excited. He said a big 'thank you' to the frog before running to show his mom the beautiful purple diamond.
