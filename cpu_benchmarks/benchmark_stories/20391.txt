Once upon a time, there was a big lion. He lived in the jungle with his friends. One day, the lion saw an ambulance driving by. It had a loud siren that made a "wee-oo-wee-oo" sound. The lion was curious, so he followed the ambulance.
The ambulance stopped at a house. The lion saw that someone was hurt. The ambulance took the person to the hospital. The lion wanted to help, so he let out a big roar. The people in the ambulance heard him and smiled. They knew the lion wanted to help too.
From that day on, the lion became friends with the ambulance drivers. He would follow them around and roar to help them when they needed it. The lion felt happy that he could help others.
