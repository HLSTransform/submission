Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play in the park. They had a big ball, a red bike and a yellow kite. They shared their toys and had fun together.
One day, they saw a new path in the park. It was shiny and smooth and had pretty flowers on the sides. Lily and Ben wanted to see where it went. They took their ball, their bike and their kite and followed the path.
The path led them to a pond with ducks and fish. Lily and Ben were happy to see the animals. They threw some bread to the ducks and watched them eat. They tried to catch some fish with their hands, but they were too fast. They laughed and splashed in the water.
But then, a big wind came and blew their kite away. Lily and Ben ran after it, but they could not catch it. The kite flew over the trees and out of sight. Lily and Ben were sad and angry. They started to blame each other for losing the kite.
"It's your fault, you let go of the string!" Lily said.
"No, it's your fault, you pushed me!" Ben said.
They shouted and pushed and pulled each other's hair. They had a big fit and forgot about their ball and their bike.
A man who was walking his dog saw them and came to help. He asked them what was wrong and why they were fighting. Lily and Ben told him about their kite and how they lost it.
The man shook his head and said, "I'm sorry you lost your kite, but fighting won't bring it back. You should be kind to each other and share your toys. You are twins and you have each other. That's more important than a kite."
Lily and Ben felt ashamed and sorry. They hugged each other and said they were sorry. They thanked the man and his dog and went back to their ball and their bike. They decided to play with them and forget about the kite.
They learned that snapping at each other and having a fit was not good. They learned that being nice and sharing was better. They learned that they loved each other more than any toy.
