Once there was a boy. His name was Ben. Ben was a happy boy and he liked to play with his friends.
One day Ben's friends did something weird. They said mean things and threatened to hurt him. Ben was very scared.
He started to cry. His friends saw he was sad and said they were sorry. Ben smiled a little, but he was still scared.
Then his mommy came. She said nobody should ever threaten one another and Ben felt safe. He was happy when his mommy hugged him and the threat was gone.
"It's ok Ben," his mom said. Ben smiled again and stopped crying.
