Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Max. She had a box in her hand and she was walking around town. Max had a lot of friends who all wanted to come and play with her. 
Max's friend Annie asked her, "Max, why do you have that box?"
Max smiled and said, "I'm recommending this box to my friends. Everyone wants to get one!"
Annie asked, "What's so special about it?"
Max replied, "It is made from a charming red material and it even has a special handle for carrying it. Everyone should get one!"
Annie nodded, impressed. She said to Max, "That does sound great, let's get you one too!" 
Max agreed and soon Max and Annie were both walking around with their charming boxes in hand. Everyone loved the boxes, and Max would go on to recommend them to all her friends.
