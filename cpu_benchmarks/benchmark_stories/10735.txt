Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved balloons, especially the red ones. One day, she saw a man who had many balloons. Lily wanted one, but she didn't have any money. The man was rich and didn't need her money, so he gave her a balloon for free. 
Lily was so happy and she knew that her friends would be happy too. She ran to her friends and showed them the balloon. They were so happy and played with it. Lily knew that she had the best friends in the world. 
From that day on, Lily knew that even though the man was rich, he was still kind and generous. She also knew that balloons could make people happy. She loved her red balloon and kept it with her always.
