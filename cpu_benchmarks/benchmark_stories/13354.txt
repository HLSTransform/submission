Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and twirl around in her pretty pink dress. One day, she went to the park and saw some other kids playing a game. They were being very competitive and trying to win.
Lily wanted to join in, but she started to feel a little tired. She realized that she needed some oxygen to help her breathe better. So, she took a deep breath and ran over to the other kids. They were surprised to see her, but they welcomed her to play.
Lily was a little shy at first, but then she started to dance around and have fun. She didn't care about winning or being competitive, she just wanted to have a good time. And that's exactly what she did!
