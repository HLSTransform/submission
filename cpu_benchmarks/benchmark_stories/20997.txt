John was a little boy. He was three years old and had lots of things he liked to do. Today, he decided to go for a walk.
John walked for a long time but he couldn't see much. Then, he saw something in the distance. He stopped and looked.
John was excited. He saw a jelly! It looked so tasty. He wanted to go and get it.
John ran to the jelly and pointed at it. "Look at this jelly! Can I eat it?" he asked.
John's mom smiled. "Yes, you can eat it. But remember, we have to be quiet," she said softly. 
John nodded and carefully picked up the jelly. Then he quietly ate it. It was delicious! 
John was happy. He had eaten a tasty jelly and had been very quiet. He smiled and skipped away. What an adventure!
