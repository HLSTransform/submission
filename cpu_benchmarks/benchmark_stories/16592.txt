Sara liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Lily. Lily had a pink blouse and long hair. Sara liked to brush her hair and change her clothes.
One day, Sara saw her brother Tom in her room. Tom was holding Lily and laughing. He said, "Lily is smelly. She needs a bath." He ran to the bathroom with Lily.
Sara was angry. She did not want Tom to wash Lily. She knew that water would ruin her blouse and her hair. She wanted to prevent Tom from doing that. She ran after him and shouted, "Stop! Give me Lily!"
Tom did not listen. He turned on the faucet and put Lily under the water. Sara saw Lily's blouse get wet and her hair get tangled. She cried, "No! You are mean! You hurt Lily!"
Sara grabbed Lily from Tom and hugged her. She glared at Tom and said, "Go away! You are not my friend!" She ran back to her room with Lily. She tried to dry her blouse and comb her hair. She hoped that Lily would be okay. She said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I love you."
