Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy who had a car. They loved their car very much, but it was very dirty. So, they decided to clean it. They took a big bucket and filled it with soapy water. Then, they got a sponge and started to scrub the car. They worked very hard and soon the car was clean and shiny.
After they finished cleaning the car, mommy said, "I am hungry. Let's cook some dinner." Daddy agreed and they went inside the house. Mommy put on her apron and started to cook. She made spaghetti and meatballs, which was daddy's favorite. They ate their dinner and were very happy. Then, they went to sleep, dreaming of their clean car and yummy dinner. The end.
