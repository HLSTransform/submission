Once there lived a poor family with two children, Jane and John. Jane was three years old. Every day, Jane's family would gather around the kitchen table and laugh at the jokes that Jane told. 
One day, Jane noticed that her brother John was leaning against the wall. She asked him, "Why are you leaning?" John smiled and said that he was resting. 
Jane thought that was a funny joke and started to laugh. She went over to her mother and said, "Mama, John is leaning on the wall like a lazy cat!"
Her mother smiled and said, "That is a funny joke, Jane. But let's not make poor John feel bad. We should both help him stand up." 
So, Jane and her mother both held John's hands, helping him to stand up. Then, they all started to leave the kitchen and Jane was laughing the whole way. 
From then on, Jane and her family shared a lot of funny jokes, but they always were kind to each other.
