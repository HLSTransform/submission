Once upon a time, in a peaceful forest, there was a little stream. The water in the stream moved slowly and made a soft sound. Near the stream, there was a big, bouncy ball.
One day, a rabbit and a squirrel found the bouncy ball. The rabbit said, "Look, a ball! Let's bounce it!" The squirrel agreed, "Yes, let's play with it!"
They took turns bouncing the ball near the stream. The ball went high in the air and came back down. The rabbit and the squirrel laughed and played all day long. The peaceful stream watched them have fun.
As the sun went down, the rabbit said, "It's time to go home." The squirrel nodded, "Yes, let's play again tomorrow."
The next day, the rabbit and the squirrel met at the stream and played with the bouncy ball again. They had lots of fun and became the best of friends. And the peaceful stream was always there, watching them play and have a good time.
