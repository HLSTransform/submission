Once upon a time, there was a little penguin named Pingo. Pingo lived in a fancy igloo made of ice. He loved his igloo very much, but he was always very lonely.
One day, Pingo met a little bird named Tweety. Tweety was very sad because she had lost her way home. Pingo felt sorry for Tweety and decided to help her. He showed her the way home and they became good friends.
Pingo learned that being kind and helpful to others is important. He realized that even though his igloo was fancy, it was not as important as having friends. From that day on, Pingo was never lonely again. Whenever he saw someone weep, he would offer his help and make new friends.
