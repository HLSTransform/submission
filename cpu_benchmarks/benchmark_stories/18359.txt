Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a brown dog named Zip. Zip was a happy dog who loved to play with his friends. One day, he heard some news from his friend, a little bird.
"Zip, I have news!" said the little bird. "There is a big party in the park today. All the animals are going."
Zip was excited and wanted to go to the party too. He put on his favorite hat and ran to the park. When he got there, he saw that everyone was sharing their toys and food. Zip thought it was nice to share, so he brought his favorite ball to the party.
At the party, Zip played with his friends and shared his ball with everyone. All the animals had fun and were happy. At the end of the day, Zip went home with a big smile on his face. He learned that sharing is good and it makes everyone happy.
