Anna and Ben are restless. They do not want to nap. They want to act like animals.
"Let's act like lions," Ben says. He roars and crawls on the floor.
"OK, I will act like a zebra," Anna says. She makes stripes on her face with a crayon and runs around.
They have fun acting like animals. They make a lot of noise.
Mom hears them and comes to their room. She is not happy.
"What are you doing?" she asks. "You are supposed to nap. Look at this mess!"
"Sorry, Mom," Anna and Ben say. "We are restless. We want to act like animals."
Mom sighs. She picks up the crayon and wipes Anna's face.
"You can act like animals later," she says. "But now you need to rest. You have a big step tomorrow. You are going to preschool for the first time."
Anna and Ben feel excited and nervous. They want to go to preschool, but they also want to stay with Mom.
"Will you come with us, Mom?" Anna asks.
"Of course, I will," Mom says. "I will be there to help you and hug you. But you will also make new friends and learn new things. You will like preschool, I promise."
Anna and Ben nod. They hug Mom and lie down on their beds. They close their eyes and try to sleep. They are still restless, but they also feel happy. They dream of acting like animals with their new friends.
