Tom and Sue were going to visit their grandparent. They were very happy and excited. They wanted to pack their bags with their favorite things. Tom packed his toy car, his ball and his book. Sue packed her doll, her crayons and her hat.
Their parent helped them to close their bags and put them in the car. They said goodbye to their dog and their cat. They drove for a long time, singing songs and playing games. They saw many things on the road: trees, cows, bridges and trucks.
When they arrived at their grandparent's house, they ran to hug them. Their grandparent was very happy and proud to see them. They showed them their bags and their things. Their grandparent smiled and said: "You are very humble and kind. You don't need many things to be happy. You have each other and you have us. We love you very much." Tom and Sue hugged them back and said: "We love you too, grandparent. You are the best." They had a wonderful time together.
