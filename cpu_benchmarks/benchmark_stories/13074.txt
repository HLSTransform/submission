Once there was a little girl. Her name was Daisy and she was very smart.
One day, Daisy was playing with her friends in the park. Suddenly, her mom came over and said, "Daisy, it's time for a lecture." Daisy didn't want to stop playing, so she tried to resist. She shook her head and said, "No, I don't want to."
But her mom was very firm. She said, "Come on now, Daisy. It's important." So Daisy had to give in.
The lecture was about being nice to her friends. Her mom said, "Remember to share your toys and be kind to each other. That's how smart people behave." Daisy understood what her mom was saying and promised to be nice.
After the lecture, Daisy went back to playing with her friends. She was glad that she had listened to her mom. Resisting her mom's words would have been a bad idea!
