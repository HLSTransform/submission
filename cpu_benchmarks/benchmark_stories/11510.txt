One day, a bunny named Bob wanted to hop to his friend's house. He was very excited for his trip. The sun was shining, and the sky was blue. Bob was very alert as he hopped along the path.
As he hopped, he saw his friend, the squirrel named Sam. Sam was sad. "What's wrong?" asked Bob. Sam said, "I lost my nut, and I can't find it." Bob wanted to help, so he hopped around to look for the nut.
They looked high and low, but they could not find the nut. Then, Bob had an idea. "Let's ask the bird, maybe she saw it," said Bob. They went to the bird, who was very alert. She had seen the nut fall in the tall grass. Together, they all hopped to the tall grass and found the nut. Sam was very happy, and they all went to play together.
