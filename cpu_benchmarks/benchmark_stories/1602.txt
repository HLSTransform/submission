Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play with toys. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big yacht. The yacht was blue and white and had a sail and a wheel. They liked to pretend they were sailors and go on adventures.
One day, they decided to play with the yacht in the bathtub. They filled the tub with water and put the yacht in. They made waves with their hands and said, "Ahoy, matey!" and "Look, a shark!" They had a lot of fun.
But then, they heard their mom call, "Time to get out, kids!" They did not want to stop playing, but they knew they had to obey. They grabbed the yacht and tried to take it out of the tub. But the yacht was too big. It did not fit. It got stuck.
They pulled and pushed, but the yacht did not move. They started to cry. They did not want to break their toy. They did not want to make a mess. They did not know what to do.
Their mom heard them cry and came to see what was wrong. She saw the yacht stuck in the tub and smiled. She said, "Don't worry, kids. I can help you." She took a towel and wrapped it around the yacht. She gently twisted and lifted the yacht out of the tub. She said, "There you go. Your yacht is out and dry. Now, let's get you dry too."
Tom and Lily were happy. They hugged their mom and said, "Thank you, mom. You are the best." They dried themselves and put on their pajamas. They took their yacht to their room and put it on their shelf. They said, "Good night, yacht. We love you." They went to bed and dreamed of sailing.
