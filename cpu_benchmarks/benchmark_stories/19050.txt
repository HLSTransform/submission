Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a jug of lemonade that she loved to sip on. One day, she was feeling very tired and her mommy told her to take a nap. Lily didn't want to take a nap because she thought it was bad. But mommy said it was important to rest so she could feel better. 
Lily climbed into bed and closed her eyes. She dreamed of drinking lemonade from her jug and playing with her toys. When she woke up, she felt much better and her jug of lemonade was still there waiting for her. From then on, Lily knew that naps weren't bad and sometimes they made her feel even better.
