Lily liked to go to the gym with her mom. She liked to play with the balls and the mats and the ropes. But she did not like to share with the other kids. She wanted to have all the toys for herself.
One day, a boy named Ben came to the gym with his dad. He saw Lily playing with a big red ball. He asked her if he could play with it too. Lily said no. She hugged the ball and ran away. Ben was sad. He wanted to play with the ball.
Ben was persistent. He followed Lily around the gym. He asked her again and again if he could play with the ball. Lily said no every time. She got angry. She threw the ball at Ben. It hit him in the face. He cried.
Lily's mom saw what happened. She was not happy. She told Lily to say sorry to Ben and to share the ball. Lily did not want to. She pouted. She said no.
Lily's mom had an idea. She told Lily to reverse the roles. She asked her how she would feel if Ben had the ball and did not let her play with it. She asked her how she would feel if Ben threw the ball at her. Lily thought about it. She felt bad. She realized she was not nice to Ben.
Lily went to Ben. She said sorry. She gave him the ball. She asked him if he wanted to play with her. Ben smiled. He said yes. He wiped his tears. He thanked her. They played with the ball together. They had fun.
Lily's mom was proud of Lily. She hugged her. She told her she did a good job. Lily was happy. She learned to share. She made a new friend.
