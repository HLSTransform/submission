Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She liked to wake up early in the morning to read her favorite magazine. Mia was always grateful when her mom gave her a new magazine.
One day, Mia saw her friend Tom. Tom asked, "Mia, why do you wake up so early?" Mia said, "I love to read my magazine. It makes me happy!" Tom wanted to be happy too, so he asked his mom for a magazine.
Tom's mom gave him a magazine and he started to read it with Mia. They both loved to read and learn new things. They were very grateful for their magazines and their friendship. And from that day on, they always woke up early to read together.
