Once upon a time there was a small rabbit called Daisy. Daisy loved to keep things and was very successful in doing so; recently she had found a beautiful pastel blue shell on the beach and kept it. One day, Daisy took a lovely walk through the meadows and met a squirrel called Jack. Daisy was very excited to share her shell with Jack and proudly showed her shell to Jack.
Jack said, "That's an amazing shell; I'm so jealous! You are so successful at collecting things".
Daisy smiled and said, “Thank you, Jack. I love to keep things, but I also like to share them with my friends.”
Jack was very impressed with Daisy and this moral of Daisy's; sharing was caring. They both hopped away, promising to one another to keep sharing with the friends around them. 
The moral of the story is that it's better to share than to keep things for yourself. Sharing with friends not only makes us successful, but it also brings us closer together.
