Once there was an intelligent pen. It was so clever it could lock things! One day it locked a box, and everyone wanted to know what was inside. So the intelligent pen decided to keep the secret.
The next day, everyone tried to open the box, but it was too hard. Everyone asked the intelligent pen to help, but it just smiled and kept quiet.
The day after, the intelligent pen unlocked the box. Inside was a big surprise - a big chocolate cake! Everyone thanked the pen and clapped. They all ate the cake, and as they did they realised the intelligent pen had been a big help. They thanked it again and again!
