Once upon a time, there was a blue bird that lived in a tree. The bird loved to sing and fly around the tree. One day, a little girl saw the bird and said, "Hello bird, I like your blue feathers."
The bird said, "Thank you, little girl. I am happy to have blue feathers."
The little girl asked, "Do you have an owner?"
The bird replied, "Yes, I do. My owner is the tree."
The little girl said, "I want to send a message to your owner. Can you help me?"
The bird said, "Sure, I can send your message to my owner. What do you want to say?"
The little girl said, "Tell the tree that I love it and I want to visit it every day."
The bird said, "Okay, I will send your message to the tree. Thank you for talking to me, little girl."
