Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to roll down the hill and laugh. They saw a big cage with a tiger inside. The tiger was impressive. It had orange and black stripes and sharp teeth.
"Wow, look at the tiger!" Lily said. "It is so big and strong!"
"Let's go closer and say hello," Ben said. "Maybe it is friendly."
They ran to the cage and waved at the tiger. The tiger growled and looked at them with hungry eyes.
"Hello, tiger!" Lily said. "Do you want to play with us?"
The tiger did not want to play. It wanted to eat. It saw a hole in the cage and pushed it open. It jumped out and ran towards Lily and Ben.
"Help! Help!" Lily and Ben screamed. "The tiger is coming!"
They tried to run away, but they were too slow. The tiger caught them and bit them. They cried and hurt. The tiger was not friendly. It was mean and scary.
The end.
