Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a smooth doll. Every day, she would take her doll on a trip and learn new things. But one day, she wanted to go on a longer trip than usual and her parents said no. The little girl was so sad and wanted to learn more, so she kept asking and asking. 
Finally, the little girl's parents agreed that she could go on the special trip if she promised to be careful. She was so excited and promised to be extra careful. On the day of the trip, the little girl was surrounded by new things. She did not know where to look first. 
The little girl had a smooth and wonderful time. She ate new and strange types of food and tried new things she had never seen before. She even found a new game to play, and she was excited for more trips like that one. 
At the end of the day, the little girl learned a lot. She had a great adventure and she was so happy. The little girl learned that when she works hard, she can go on special trips and have fun.
