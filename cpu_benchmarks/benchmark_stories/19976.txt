Ben and Lily were having lunch with Mom. Mom gave them some bread and jelly to eat. Ben liked jelly a lot. He put a lot of jelly on his bread and took a big bite. Lily did not like jelly. She made a face and pushed her plate away.
"Mom, I don't want jelly. I want cheese," Lily said.
Mom looked at Lily and shook her head. "No, Lily, you have to eat what I give you. Jelly is good for you. It has fruit and sugar. Cheese is for later."
Lily pouted and crossed her arms. She did not want to eat jelly. She wanted to eat cheese. She looked at Ben and saw him smiling and eating his jelly bread. She felt angry and jealous. She decided to ignore Ben and Mom. She turned her head and looked out the window.
Ben saw Lily ignoring him and Mom. He felt sorry for Lily. He liked cheese too, but he liked jelly more. He wanted to share his jelly with Lily and make her happy. He broke his bread in half and held out one piece to Lily.
"Here, Lily, you can have some of my jelly. It is very yummy. You can try it and see," Ben said.
Lily heard Ben's voice and looked at him. She saw him holding out his bread with jelly. She felt a little curious and a little hungry. She reached out and took the bread from Ben. She smelled it and nibbled it. It was sweet and soft. She liked it a little bit.
"Thank you, Ben. Your jelly is good. But I still like cheese more," Lily said.
Ben smiled and nodded. "You're welcome, Lily. I like cheese too. Maybe Mom will give us some cheese later. But for now, let's eat our jelly and be good."
Lily smiled and nodded too. She ate her bread with jelly and felt better. She did not ignore Ben and Mom anymore. She talked to them and laughed with them. Mom was happy to see them getting along and eating their lunch. She gave them a hug and a kiss and said they were good children.
