Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Ella. She lived with her mom and dad. But, one day her Uncle came to visit and things got really exciting!
Uncle brought with him something amazing: an incredible bucket. Inside the bucket were some funny things. "What are they?" Ella asked her Uncle. Uncle told her that they were treats. He said, "Why don't we pour them onto the table?" 
So Ella and Uncle poured the treats onto the table. They both grabbed handfuls and started to eat. The treats were so yummy and Ella couldn't believe how incredible they all tasted.
When Ella and Uncle had finished all the treats, Uncle scooped all the crumbs into the bucket and put it away. Ella gave her Uncle a big hug for bringing such wonderful treats. Ella and Uncle promised to do it all again soon. 
The End.
