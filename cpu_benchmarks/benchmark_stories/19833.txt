Once upon a time there was a little girl. She had a toy called a rubber. Every day she liked to stir the rubber with a spoon. One day while she was stirring the rubber something special happened. The rubber started to move!
Soon the rubber was walking, just like a person. The little girl was so excited and happy! But then something strange happened. The rubber got very slow and stopped moving. It had gone dead.
The little girl was sad. She liked playing with the rubber and now it wasn't moving anymore. But then she had an idea. With the spoon she started stirring the rubber again. And this time, the rubber came alive! 
The little girl and her rubber played together for the rest of the day. Whenever the rubber went dead, the little girl just had to stir it and it started moving again. What a wonderful day!
