Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the grass. One day, he saw a cricket jumping around. The cricket was green and had long legs. Timmy thought the cricket was funny.
He said to the cricket, "Hey little guy, why are you jumping around like that?" The cricket replied, "I'm trying to find my way home." Timmy smiled and said, "You're so smelly, I don't want to be your friend." The cricket felt sad and replied, "Why do you tease me? I just want to go home."
Timmy realized he was being mean and said sorry to the cricket. He helped the cricket find its way home and they became friends. From that day on, Timmy learned to be kind to all creatures, big and small.
