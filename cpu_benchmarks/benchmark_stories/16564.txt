Sam and Lily were playing in the backyard. They saw a big ladder leaning on the wall. They wanted to climb it and see what was on the roof.
"Can we go up the ladder?" Sam asked Lily.
"I don't know. It looks very high and heavy. Maybe we should ask Mom first," Lily said.
But Sam was curious and brave. He grabbed the ladder and tried to move it. It was very heavy and hard to move. He pushed and pulled, but the ladder did not budge.
"Help me, Lily!" Sam said.
Lily ran to Sam and tried to help him. They both pushed and pulled, but the ladder did not move. They were getting tired and frustrated.
Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them.
"What are you two doing?" It was Mom. She had come out to check on them.
Sam and Lily turned around and saw Mom. They recognized her voice and her face. They felt guilty and scared.
"We wanted to climb the ladder and see the roof," Sam said.
"That's very dangerous, Sam. You could fall and hurt yourself. And the ladder is too heavy for you to move. You could drop it and break something. You should never play with the ladder without asking me first," Mom said.
She was not happy. She took the ladder and put it away. She told Sam and Lily to come inside and have a snack. She also told them to say sorry and promise not to play with the ladder again.
Sam and Lily felt sorry and ashamed. They said sorry to Mom and promised to be more careful. They followed Mom inside and had a snack. They decided to play with their toys instead of the ladder. They learned their lesson.
