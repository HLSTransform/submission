Once upon a time there was a brave prince. He had a magical sword and he used it to save his kingdom from danger.
One day the prince was walking in the forest when he heard a loud noise. He blinked in surprise. It was a dangerous monster!
The prince lifted his sword and said, "I must protect my kingdom!" He faced the monster and bravely shouted, "Go away or I'll use my sword!"
The monster didn't move. It was big and scary. But the prince was brave and he blinked. He held his sword high and charged at the monster. 
He fought and fought and in the end, the prince won! The monster was defeated and the kingdom was safe. Everybody cheered and thanked the prince for his bravery.
