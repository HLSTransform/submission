Once upon a time there was a little girl who wanted a castle. She asked her mom if she could have one, but her mom said it was too expensive. The little girl was sad, but she was very brave.
So the little girl decided to look for a cheap castle. She asked her friends and they told her to look in the park. So she went to the park, and she found a nice empty castle. It was small but it was cheap.
The little girl was so happy. She told her mom, and together they went to buy the castle. When they got home, the little girl worked hard to make it look perfect. She put a little flag on top and arranged the windows.
Finally, the little girl had her own castle. She played pretend in it all the time and she was so proud. Whenever anyone asked, she said with a smile that she found a cheap castle in the park.
