Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. She would run and jump on the ground. Sometimes she would even roll around on the grass. It felt so gentle on her skin. 
One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. She saw a big slide and asked if she could go on it. Her mommy said yes, so Lily climbed up the ladder and slid down. She enjoyed it so much that she went on it again and again. 
After a while, Lily and her mommy sat down on the ground and had a picnic. They ate sandwiches and fruit and drank juice. The sun was shining and the birds were singing. Lily felt so happy and content. She loved spending time with her mommy and enjoying the beautiful day.
