Tom and Mia were very enthusiastic to go on a safari with their parents. They wanted to see lions, elephants, giraffes and other animals. They packed their bags and got in the car.
On the way, they saw a sign that said "Do not take anything from the park". Tom asked his dad, "Why can't we take anything from the park?" His dad said, "Because the park belongs to the animals and the plants. They need them to live and be happy. If we take something, we might hurt them or make them sad."
Mia nodded and said, "That makes sense. We should respect the park and the animals." Tom agreed and said, "Yes, we should. We can take pictures and memories instead."
When they arrived at the park, they saw many amazing animals. They saw a lion roaring, an elephant spraying water, a giraffe eating leaves and a monkey swinging. They took pictures and learned about the animals from their guide. They had a lot of fun and were very respectful.
At the end of the day, they thanked their guide and their parents for the safari. They said, "We had a great time. We learned a lot and we did not take anything from the park. We are happy and we hope the animals and the plants are happy too."
The moral value of the story is to respect nature and not take anything that does not belong to us.
