One day, Sarah and her mom went to the park. Sarah was excited to get on the playground equipment.
She ran up to the slide and she said, "Mommy, can I get on the slide?"
"Yes, Sarah, you can," her mom said.
Sarah went down the slide. She loved it!
Then Sarah noticed something. There was something stuck in the zipper on her coat. It was a dead bug!
"Mommy, look!" she said.
Sarah's mom looked at the zipper. "Oh no!" she said. "I am sorry Sarah, but now you are going to have to get a new coat."
Sarah was sad. She had wanted to keep this coat for a long time. She started to cry.
But then her mom gave her a hug and said, "Don't worry, Sarah. We will get you a new one with a nice zipper."
Sarah was happy. She felt better, and was ready to get a new coat with a nice new zipper.
