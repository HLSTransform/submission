Once upon a time, there was a nice house. In the house, there was a pretty bedroom. The bedroom had a big bed, a cute chair, and a small table. The bedroom looked very good.
One day, a little cat came into the bedroom. The cat was very cute and liked the bedroom a lot. The cat saw a soft toy on the bed and started to play with it. While playing, the cat started to sneeze.
The sneezes were very loud. The cat sneezed and sneezed, making the bedroom messy. The cat felt bad about making the pretty bedroom messy. So, the cat cleaned the bedroom and made it look good again. The cat was happy and continued to play without sneezing.
