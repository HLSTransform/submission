One day, a brave little boy named Tim went to the store with his mom. He wanted to buy some juice. When they got to the store, Tim saw many kinds of juice. He wanted to pick the best one.
At the store, Tim met another boy named Max. Max said, "I want that juice too!" They both wanted the same juice. Tim thought for a moment and said, "Let's be fair. We can both have some juice."
Tim and Max decided to share the juice. They were both happy. As they walked away, Tim tripped and the juice fell. The bottle broke and juice went everywhere. Tim felt sad, but Max said, "Don't worry, we can clean it up together."
Tim and Max worked together to clean up the juice. They were both brave and kind. In the end, they became good friends and learned that sharing is better than fighting.
