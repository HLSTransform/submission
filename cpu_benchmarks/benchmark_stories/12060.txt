Once upon a time, there was a little baby. The baby was happy and played with toys all day. One day, the baby's big sister came to play. The big sister was envious of the baby's toys and wanted to play with them too. 
The baby didn't want to share the toys and held onto them tightly. The big sister said, "Can I play with your toys too? I like them." The baby didn't answer and kept holding onto the toys. 
The big sister then said, "If you release the toys, we can play together and have fun." The baby thought about it and finally released the toys. They both played together and had lots of fun. The end.
