Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big truck on the street. It was shiny and loud and had many colors. Tom and Lily wanted to see it closer.
"Let's go to the truck!" Tom said. He ran to the street without looking. Lily followed him.
But a car was coming fast on the street. It honked and braked. Tom and Lily were scared. They stopped in the middle of the street.
A man came out of the car. He was angry. He pointed at Tom and Lily and said, "You are selfish! You could have been hurt! You should not run to the street without looking! Go back to the sidewalk now!"
Tom and Lily felt bad. They knew they did wrong. They ran back to the sidewalk. They said sorry to the man. The man nodded and drove away.
The truck was gone too. Tom and Lily missed it. But they learned a lesson. They decided to be more careful and not selfish. They hugged each other and went home.
