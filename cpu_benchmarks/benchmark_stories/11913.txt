Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her garden and look at the pretty flowers. One day, she saw a big rock in her garden that she wanted to move. She tried and tried, but it was too heavy for her to lift.
Lily was sad that she couldn't move the rock, but her mom told her to keep trying. So, Lily decided to ask for help from her friends. Together, they were able to lift the rock and move it out of the garden.
Lily learned that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Sometimes, we need others to be successful. From that day on, Lily always asked for help when she needed it and she was very successful in everything she did.
