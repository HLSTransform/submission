Once upon a time there was a dark night. The night was cold and no light shined. Then, the sky suddenly filled with a bright and harsh light! 
The harsh light burned so bright but no one knew where it came from. Suddenly, the sun appeared in the sky! The sun was so bright that everyone could see clearly. 
The sun's light burned so strong, but it was warm and made everything feel happy. The light gave everyone hope and happiness. 
The light changed the dark night into a happy and sunny day. Everyone celebrated and smiled. Even when the sun went back down, the light it created was still strong enough for everyone to remember.
