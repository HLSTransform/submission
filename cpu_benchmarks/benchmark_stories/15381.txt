Tommy was very excited when his mum told him he was getting a pet. He had wanted a pet for a long time and was so happy that his dream was finally going to come true.
When the day arrived, Tommy's mum took him to the pet store and showed him the beautiful puppies. He fell in love with one of them straight away and decided that was the one he wanted. 
They took the puppy home and Tommy was so excited. He named the puppy Rocky and they were best friends from that day on.
Tommy and Rocky went everywhere together, from the park to the beach. They had so much fun and played together all the time. Rocky was such a beautiful pet and always made Tommy smile. 
Tommy was so happy that his mum had surprised him with such a special pet. Whenever he thinks about it he gets super excited!
