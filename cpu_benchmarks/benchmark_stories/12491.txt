Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went for a walk in the park with her mommy. They saw a big, wide tree and sat down under it to rest. Lily felt very sleepy and closed her eyes.
After a while, Lily woke up and realized that she had slept for a long time. She looked around and saw that the sun was setting. She quickly got up and told her mommy that they had to go home before it got dark.
As they walked home, Lily felt happy and safe knowing that her mommy was with her. She also felt grateful for the big, wide tree that gave them shade and a place to rest. From that day on, Lily always remembered to take naps when she felt sleepy and to appreciate the beauty of nature around her.
