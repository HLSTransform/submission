Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He was very excited to go to the park with his mom. They packed a picnic basket with sandwiches, apples, and juice. Timmy's mom said the basket would include all their favorite foods.
When they got to the park, Timmy saw a big slide and wanted to try it. He climbed up the ladder and went down the slide with his arms in the air. It was so much fun! Timmy's mom took a picture of him and said he looked very brave.
After playing on the slide, they sat down on a blanket and ate their picnic lunch. Timmy's mom told him how proud she was of him for being so brave on the slide. Timmy felt happy and excited that his mom was proud of him.
