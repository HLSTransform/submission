Jim was a lazy boy. One day he went to the park to meet some friends. They were hungry so they decided to get some pizza. 
At the pizza shop they saw a big pizza with cheese, ham and veggies. Jim was so excited that he asked if he could have a slice. The shopkeeper gave him a big slice and he gobbled it up.
After they finished eating, they played in the park for a while. They ran around, played tag and rode their bikes. It was so much fun!
When it was time to go home, Jim said goodbye to his friends and thanked the shopkeeper for giving him the pizza. He was so happy to have met them and enjoyed eating the yummy pizza.
