Lily wanted to go to the parade. She loved to see the big floats, the funny clowns, and the loud music. She asked her mom if they could go.
"Sorry, Lily, we can't go today. We have to stay home and help grandma. She is sick and needs us," mom said.
Lily was sad. She did not want to miss the parade. She did not understand why grandma was sick. She wanted to have fun.
"Can we go another day, mom?" Lily asked.
"Maybe, Lily, but not today. Today we have to accept that grandma is more important than the parade. We have to show her we love her and care for her. Can you do that, Lily?" mom said.
Lily nodded. She loved grandma too. She wanted her to feel better. She gave mom a hug and said, "OK, mom, I will help you with grandma. But can we watch the parade on TV?"
Mom smiled and said, "Of course, Lily, we can watch the parade on TV. Maybe we can even see something beautiful that we would not see in person. Come on, let's go and make grandma some soup."
Lily and mom went to the kitchen and made some soup for grandma. They brought it to her room and gave her a kiss. Grandma thanked them and said, "You are so sweet, Lily and mom. You make me happy. You are my beautiful parade."
