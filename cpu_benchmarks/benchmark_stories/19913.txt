Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Buddy. Buddy was very happy because he had a big bowl of food that his owner filled every day. One day, Buddy saw a flea on his fur. He didn't like the flea, but he didn't know what to do.
Buddy went to his owner and said, "I have a flea on me. Can you help me?" His owner said, "Sure, I'll give you a bath and wash the flea away." Buddy was happy and wagged his tail.
But when Buddy got in the bath, he saw the water fill up higher and higher. He was scared and tried to jump out, but he slipped and fell. Buddy was ashamed because he knew he should have been more careful. The water filled up so much that Buddy couldn't breathe and he drowned. Poor Buddy!
