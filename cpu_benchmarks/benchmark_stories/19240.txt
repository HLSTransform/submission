Once upon a time, there was a boy who loved to sleep. He would sleep all the time, no matter where he was. One day, he was sleeping in his bed when a strange man walked in the room. The boy was scared and he jumped up. The man said to him, "Don't worry. I'm a fine man and I only want to say hello to you." The boy smiled and said hello back. The stranger said goodbye, and the boy was happy to see him go. The boy went back to sleep, feeling safe and fine. The end.
