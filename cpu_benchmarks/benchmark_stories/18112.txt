Once upon a time, there were two friends. Their names were Jack and Jill. They loved to play together every day. One day, Jack wanted to use Jill's scissors to cut some paper. But Jill said no, and they started to quarrel. 
Their quarrel got louder and louder, and they started to feel sad. Suddenly, Jack had an idea. He said, "Let's use my bright markers to draw instead of cutting with scissors!" Jill loved the idea and they started to draw together. 
They drew bright flowers, big trees, and even a happy sun. They forgot about their quarrel and started to laugh and play again. From that day on, they decided to share their toys and never quarrel again.
