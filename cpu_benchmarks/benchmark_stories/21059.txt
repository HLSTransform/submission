Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play and dance together. One day, they find a radio in the park. It is big and shiny. It plays music that makes them happy.
"Look, a radio!" Anna says. "Let's dance!"
"Yes, let's dance!" Ben says. They turn on the radio and start to dance. They jump and spin and clap. They have fun.
But then, a man comes. He is angry. He has a hat and a coat. He says the radio is his.
"Hey, you kids! That's my radio! Give it back!" he shouts.
Anna and Ben are scared. They stop dancing. They look at the man.
"Sorry, mister. We didn't know. We just wanted to dance," Anna says.
"Sorry, nothing. You stole my radio. It's mine. Go away!" the man says. He grabs the radio and walks away.
Anna and Ben are sad. They have no radio. They have no music. They have no fun.
They go home. They don't talk. They don't dance. They cry.
