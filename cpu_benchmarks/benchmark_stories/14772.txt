Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to climb the big tree and sit on the branch. They could see the pond and the ducks from there.
"Look, Lily, the ducks are diving in the water!" Ben said. "They go under and then come up again. They look so funny!"
"I want to dive too!" Lily said. "Can we dive from the branch?"
Ben shook his head. "No, Lily, that is not a good idea. The water is too deep and too cold. And we don't have wings like the ducks. We could get hurt."
Lily pouted. "But I want to have fun like the ducks. You are no fun, Ben. You are too serious."
Ben felt sad. He wanted Lily to be happy, but he also wanted her to be safe. He thought of a way to make her smile.
"OK, Lily, how about this? We can pretend to dive from the branch. We can make a big splash sound and then say 'quack, quack'. But we don't really jump, we just stay on the branch. Is that fun?"
Lily nodded. She liked to pretend. She and Ben leaned over the branch and made diving noises. They laughed and said 'quack, quack'. They had fun like the ducks, but they were safe on the branch.
