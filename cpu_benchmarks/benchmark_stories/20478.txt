Once upon a time, there was a humble and brave knight. He had a magic spear that he kept close with him at all times. One day, the knight went out in search of an adventure. As he wandered, he came across a giant mountain. He stopped and wondered what was over the mountain and decided to climb it. As he hiked up the mountain, it seemed like it would never end. Finally, he reached the top and found a beautiful garden. He looked around in wonder and smiled. He grabbed his spear and cautiously walked around the garden. Suddenly, he heard a noise and his spear reached through the air, ready to protect him. But, then he saw a group of bunnies hopping around, just playing together. The knight laughed and smiled and continued to wander around the garden marveling at all the wonders he found.
