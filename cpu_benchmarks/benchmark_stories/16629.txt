Lily likes to talk to her grandma, who lives far away. She misses her a lot. Sometimes, she calls her on the phone, but sometimes, she wants to show her something. Then, she uses her mom's tablet to send her a message.
One day, Lily draws a picture of a flower with many colors. She is very proud of it. She wants to share it with her grandma. She asks her mom to help her send a message with the picture.
"Mom, can you help me send a message to grandma?" Lily says.
"Sure, honey. Let me see your picture. It's very pretty. I'm sure grandma will love it." Mom says.
Mom takes the tablet and opens the app. She helps Lily type "Hi, grandma. I love you. This is a flower for you." She also attaches the picture. Then, she presses the send button.
"There, we sent your message. Now, we wait for grandma to reply." Mom says.
Lily smiles and hugs her mom. She likes to send messages to grandma. She thinks it's a modern way to talk. She hopes grandma will like her flower. She wonders what grandma will send back. Maybe a picture of her cat, or a story, or a song. She can't wait to see.
