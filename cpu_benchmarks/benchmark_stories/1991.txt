Billy was feeling happy, so he asked his mom if he could go to the park. She said yes, and he quickly got into his running shoes.
At the park, Billy saw something even better than the slides and swings; a tall gym. Excitedly he ran to the ladder and started to climb. He made it all the way to the top without stopping.
"Be careful, Billy!" his mom called.
But Billy wasn't listening. He wanted to get to the top of the gym. Suddenly he slipped and started to fall!
"Oh no!" he cried.
Billy's mom quickly tried to help, but she was too late. Billy hit the ground with a thud. His mom was sad but relieved that Billy was okay. She helped him back home for a rest.
Billy learned a lesson that day. He never tried to climb the tall gym again.
