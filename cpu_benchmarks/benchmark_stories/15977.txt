Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, Lily was walking in the yard when she saw a chicken. The chicken looked hungry, so Lily gave it some food.
As she was walking back to her house, she heard a loud noise. It was her brother, Max. "Lily, come quick! The parade is starting!" Max shouted. Lily loved parades, so she ran to join in.
As the parade marched down the street, Lily saw the chicken again. This time, it was wearing a little hat and marching with the other animals. Lily was so happy to see the chicken with its new friends. She smiled and said, "I'm glad I fed you earlier. Now you can march with your friends in the parade!"
