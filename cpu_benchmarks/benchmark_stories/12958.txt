Once upon a time, Spike and his friend Daisy were out in the forest looking for adventure. Suddenly Spike stumbled over a big spike in the ground and stubbed his toes. He began to cry, holding his hurt foot tightly.
Daisy quickly came to his side and said, "Spike, don't worry, I'll help you."
Spike said, "It hurts so much. I don't want to forgive the spike for hurting me!"
Daisy put her arm around him and said, "Spike, I understand why you're mad. But it will help you feel better if you can forgive the spike. Here, let me help you up."
So Daisy held Spike's hand and helped him to his feet. With her help, Spike slowly was able to forgive the spike as he walked away. 
When they got back home, Spike was happy he had made the right decision. He felt relieved and grateful to have a helpful friend like Daisy by his side.
