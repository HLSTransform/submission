Once there was a new boy named Peter. Peter was always very curious. One day he saw an insect and wanted to pay it a visit. So he slowly walked up to it and waved hello.
The insect was very surprised to see this new friend. They started talking and Peter asked the insect lots of questions. It was happy to have a new friend and they decided to have some fun. 
They played tag and hide and seek. Peter was also teaching the insect how to play a new game he invented. They were having so much fun together. After some time, Peter said goodbye and thanked the insect for being such a great friend. 
The insect was very sad to see Peter go and it waved goodbye to the new boy. Now whenever Peter sees an insect he always says hello, because he will never forget the new friend he made.
