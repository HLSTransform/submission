Once upon a time there was a little girl named Molly. She was three years old and loved to have fun. One day she went to the park with her mum.
Molly played on the swings, climbed up the slide and ran around in circles. She had so much fun!
When it was time to go, Molly thanked her mum for a great day. Her mum said, "You're welcome!" and smiled.
Molly was happy - she'd had lots of fun. She thanked her mum again, and the two of them walked home together.
