Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park and swing on the swings. One evening, Lily went to the park and saw her friends playing a game. They were trying to guess which animal was the most popular.
Lily wanted to play too, so she guessed that the most popular animal was a bunny. Her friends laughed and said it was a puppy. Lily was surprised but happy to learn something new. She played with her friends until it got dark and her mommy called her home for dinner.
Lily had a fun evening at the park with her friends. She was happy that she got to play and learn something new. She couldn't wait to go back and play again.
