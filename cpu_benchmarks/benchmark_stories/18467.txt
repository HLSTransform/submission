Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Timmy. Timmy loved blueberries. One day, Timmy's mommy brought him a small basket of blueberries. Timmy was very happy and ate all the blueberries.
After eating the blueberries, Timmy's tummy started to hurt. He didn't know why, so he asked his mommy to explain. His mommy told him that he ate too many blueberries and that's why his tummy was hurting.
Timmy learned that he should only eat a small amount of blueberries at a time. And from then on, he enjoyed his blueberries without any tummy aches.
