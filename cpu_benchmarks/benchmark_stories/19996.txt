Tom and Sam were friends who liked to play in the park. They liked to swing on the big swings and go fast and high. One day, they saw a new swing that looked like a skull. It was black and scary and had big teeth.
"Let's try it!" said Tom. He ran to the skull swing and climbed on it. He pushed with his feet and started to swing.
"Be careful!" said Sam. He was afraid of the skull swing. He thought it was too big and too scary. He stayed on the small swing and watched Tom.
Tom swung higher and higher. He felt proud and brave. He laughed and shouted. "Look at me! I'm the king of the skull swing!"
But then, something bad happened. The skull swing broke. It snapped and cracked and fell to the ground. Tom fell with it. He hit his head on the hard dirt. He felt a lot of pain. He cried and screamed.
Sam ran to Tom. He saw blood on Tom's head. He saw the skull swing broken and twisted. He felt sad and scared. He called for help. "Help! Help! Tom is hurt!"
But no one came. The park was empty. Tom and Sam were alone. Tom stopped crying. He stopped screaming. He stopped moving. He was very still. Sam shook Tom. He tried to wake him up. But Tom did not wake up. He was gone. Sam felt alone and lost. He wished he never saw the skull swing. He wished he never played in the park. He wished he stayed home with his mom. He wished Tom was still his friend.
