Once there was a little boy called Jack. He wanted something special to eat. So, he asked his mum. "Mum," he said. "Can I have some yogurt?" His mum smiled and said, "Of course." 
So, Jack and his mum went to the shop and bought some yogurt. Jack was so happy! He hopped up and down in excitement. When they got home Jack took his yogurt out of the bag and opened it. It was blueberry flavour. That was his favourite! He scooped up a spoon full and took a big bite. "Yum," he said. 
Jack started to eat his yogurt. He thought about how important it made him feel. He hoped that this moment would last forever. 
Jack's mum watched and smiled. She was happy that her son was enjoying the yogurt and she was happy to see him hoping for a wonderful moment.
