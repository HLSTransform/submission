Once upon a time, there was a big bear named Benny. Benny had a big button on his shirt that he loved to show off to his friends. One day, Benny went to the forest to play with his friend, a little rabbit named Rosie.
Rosie said, "Benny, let's dance!" Benny loved to dance, so he said, "Yes, let's dance!" They danced and danced until they were tired. Then, Rosie noticed that Benny's button was missing.
Benny was sad because he loved his button so much. Rosie said, "Don't worry, Benny. We will find your button together." They looked and looked until they found the button in the grass. Benny was so happy that he gave Rosie a big hug.
The moral of the story is that friends help each other, even when it's hard.
