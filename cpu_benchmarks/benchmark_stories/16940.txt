Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They saw a big wall with many flowers on it. They wanted to see what was behind the wall.
"Let's peek over the wall," Tom said. "Maybe there is something fun there."
"OK," Lily said. "But be careful. Mom said we should not go too far."
They climbed on a chair and looked over the wall. They saw an enormous dog. It was black and furry and had big teeth. It was sleeping on a mat.
"Wow, look at that dog!" Tom said. "It is so big and scary. I want to touch it."
"No, Tom, don't do that!" Lily said. "It might wake up and bite you. It is not our dog. We should leave it alone."
But Tom did not listen. He jumped over the wall and ran to the dog. He tried to pet its head. The dog opened its eyes and growled. It was angry. It jumped up and chased Tom.
"Help, help!" Tom cried. "The dog is after me!"
Lily was scared. She did not know what to do. She saw a flower on the wall. It was red and pretty. She picked it and threw it to the dog. The dog stopped and sniffed the flower. It liked the flower. It wagged its tail and licked the flower.
"Quick, Tom, come back!" Lily said. "The dog is busy with the flower. Hurry!"
Tom ran back to the wall and climbed over it. He was safe. He hugged Lily and thanked her.
"I'm sorry, Lily," Tom said. "I was wrong. I should have listened to you and Mom. I should not have bothered the dog. It was not nice of me."
"It's OK, Tom," Lily said. "I'm glad you are OK. You learned your lesson. Next time, be more careful and respectful."
They went back to their mom and told her what happened. Mom was happy that they were OK. She praised Lily for being brave and smart. She gave Tom a hug and a kiss. She also gave him a flower.
"Here, Tom," Mom said. "This is for you. It is a flower. It is a gift from the dog. It is a way of saying sorry and making friends. Do you like it?"
Tom smiled and nodded. He liked the flower. He also liked the dog. He learned that flowers can make people and animals happy. He learned that peeking can be dangerous. He learned that listening can be wise. He learned a lot that day.
