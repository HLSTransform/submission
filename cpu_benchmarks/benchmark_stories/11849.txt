Once upon a time, there was a careless fly. She buzzed and zipped around without a care in the world.
One day, she was buzzing around and looking for a special place to rest. She was about to land on a piece of flower when she felt something happen. She suddenly could not move. Everything around her was still and she was frozen in place.
"What happened to me?" she said, scared and confused.
Just then, she heard a voice. It was a little girl!
"I froze you! See, I have a special magical wand," said the girl, waving a sparkly wand around.
"Oh, please don't keep me here. I need to fly and explore the world!" said the fly.
The girl smiled and waved her wand again. The fly suddenly felt free and she flew away, thankful that the girl was kind enough to let her go. The fly never forgot her lesson: never be careless!
