Once upon a time, there was a bear named John. John was walking in the woods one day when he suddenly heard a loud noise. It was shaking and shaking and shaking! He was very scared and did not know what to do. He started to run and came across an emergency. The emergency was very big and John was very tiny. He was not sure what to do.
A firefighter inside the emergency saw John and opened the door. She was very kind and said: "Don't worry, come inside and it will be warm and safe." So John decided to go inside. The firefighter was very nice and gave John a hug. She said: "Everything will be okay now".
John was very happy to be warm and safe. He stayed inside the emergency with the kind firefighter until the shaking stopped. Then, he thanked her and said "goodbye". He waved to the firefighter and went back home. He was happy that he made it safely back home even though there was a lot of shaking.
