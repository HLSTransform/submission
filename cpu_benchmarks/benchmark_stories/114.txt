Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to ride her bike every day. One day, she saw a big sunflower in her neighbor's garden. It was so attractive and pretty that she wanted to touch it. 
Lily asked her mom, "Can I touch the sunflower?" Her mom replied, "No, Lily. The sunflower is not for touching. It's for looking at." 
Lily was sad, but she understood. The next day, Lily rode her bike past the sunflower again. But this time, she saw a butterfly on the sunflower. The butterfly was so attractive that Lily wanted to touch it. 
She asked her mom, "Can I touch the butterfly?" Her mom replied, "No, Lily. The butterfly is not for touching. It's for flying." 
Lily learned that some things are meant for looking and some things are meant for riding and flying. She was happy to see the sunflower and the butterfly every day on her bike rides.
