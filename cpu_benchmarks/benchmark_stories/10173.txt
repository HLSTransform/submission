Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park to play. She saw a fence that was locked. She wanted to go inside the park, but she couldn't because the fence was locked.
Lily looked around and saw a man. She went to him and said, "Excuse me, sir. Can you help me unlock the fence?" The man smiled and said, "Sure, I can help you."
He took out a key and unlocked the fence. Lily was so happy and she thanked the man. She went inside the park and played on the swings and slides. It was a fair day and Lily had so much fun.
