Once upon a time, there was a bunny called Hop. He was a small bunny and he loved hopping around. Every morning, Hop would hop around the garden looking for something to do. 
One day, as Hop hopped around, he came across a strange knob. It was big and round and it had a special glow. Hop hopped right up to it and gave it a gentle tap. But nothing happened. 
So Hop took a few steps back and hopped as high as he could. He kicked the knob with his back foot and suddenly the knob started flashing! Hop hopped back again as the knob opened up with a slow creak. 
Hop jumped in with excitement and found himself in a room full of wonders. He hopped around, exploring everything from the giant slide to the chocolate fountain. 
Hop hopped out of the room with the knob and has been hopping back to it for adventures ever since!
