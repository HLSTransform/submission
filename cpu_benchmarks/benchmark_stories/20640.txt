Once upon a time, there was a dancer who was unpack her bags. They were slow but she was determined to get it done. She had lots of items inside, like a long skirt, slippers, and a ribbon.
At last, the dancer was finished. After a light stretch, she put on her long skirt and slippers. She was ready to dance! Carefully, she tied the ribbon around her hair, took a few steps and jumped - slow and high! She hopped around her room and smiled.
Unpacking was hard, but it gave her the tools to do more. The dancer was happy and grateful to have the room to dance in.
