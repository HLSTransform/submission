Mia and Leo are best friends. They like to play together every day. Sometimes they play with toys, sometimes they play with books, and sometimes they play with their bodies. They like to do yoga.
Yoga is when you make shapes with your body. You can be a cat, a snake, a tree, or anything you want. Yoga makes you feel good and strong. Mia and Leo learned yoga from their teacher, Ms. Rose.
One day, Mia and Leo decided to do yoga in the park. They found a nice spot under a big tree. They laid down their mats and started to make shapes. They were very quiet and focused.
"Look, I'm a lion," Leo whispered to Mia. He opened his mouth wide and roared softly.
"I'm a butterfly," Mia whispered back. She flapped her wings and smiled.
They did more shapes and had fun. They felt powerful and happy.
Then they heard a loud noise. It was a dog. A big, black dog. It was running towards them. It looked angry and scary.
Mia and Leo were afraid. They jumped up and ran to the tree. They hugged each other and hoped the dog would go away.
"Shh, don't make a sound," Mia whispered to Leo.
"Maybe it will leave us alone," Leo whispered to Mia.
They closed their eyes and breathed slowly. They tried to be calm and brave.
The dog came closer and closer. It sniffed their mats and their shoes. It barked and growled.
But then, something happened. Ms. Rose came to the park. She saw the dog and the children. She knew what to do.
She walked up to the dog and said, "Hey, boy, what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here. Come on, let's go home."
She reached out her hand and touched the dog's head. The dog stopped barking and growling. It wagged its tail and licked her hand. It followed her to the gate.
Mia and Leo opened their eyes and saw Ms. Rose. They were so happy and relieved. They ran to her and hugged her.
"Thank you, Ms. Rose, you saved us," Mia said.
"You're amazing, Ms. Rose, you're so powerful," Leo said.
Ms. Rose smiled and hugged them back. She said, "You're welcome, my little yogis. You're powerful too. You did a great job staying calm and quiet. I'm proud of you."
They walked back to their mats and packed their things. They said goodbye to the park and the tree. They said thank you to Ms. Rose again.
They went home with their teacher, feeling good and strong. They learned a new lesson that day. Yoga is not only fun, but also helpful. It can help you face your fears and find your power.
