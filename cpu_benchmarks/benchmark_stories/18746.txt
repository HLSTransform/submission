Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a ball and a bike. They have fun.
One day, they see a big gate. The gate is red and shiny. It has a sign. The sign says: "Do not enter. Danger."
Tom says: "Let's go in. It looks cool."
Sam says: "No, we should not. The sign says no. It is not safe."
Tom says: "Don't be scared. It is easy. Just open the gate and go in. I want to see what is inside."
Sam says: "No, thank you. I want to stay here. You can go if you want. But I will not go with you."
Tom says: "Fine. You are boring. I will go by myself. You will miss the fun."
Tom opens the gate and goes in. He leaves Sam and the ball and the bike outside.
Sam waits for Tom. He plays with the ball and the bike. He has fun.
Tom does not have fun. He sees a big dog. The dog is angry and loud. It runs to Tom. It barks and bites. Tom is scared and hurt. He cries and runs. He wants to go back to the gate. But he cannot find the gate. He is lost.
Sam hears Tom cry. He runs to the gate. He sees Tom and the dog. He calls for help. He says: "Tom, Tom, are you okay? I am here. I will help you."
A man comes. He is the owner of the dog. He says: "What are you doing here? This is my yard. You should not be here. This is a bad dog. He does not like strangers. He can hurt you."
He takes the dog away. He says: "I am sorry. Are you hurt? Do you need a doctor?"
Tom says: "Yes, I am hurt. The dog bit me. It hurts a lot. I am sorry. I should not have come in. I did not listen to the sign. I did not listen to Sam. I was wrong."
The man says: "It is good that you are sorry. But you should be more careful. You should follow the rules. You should listen to your friend. He is a good friend. He tried to stop you. He tried to help you. He is smart and brave. You should be like him."
Tom says: "You are right. Sam is a good friend. He is smart and brave. I am not. I was foolish and selfish. I will be like him. I will follow the rules. I will listen to my friend. I will say sorry to him."
The man says: "That is good. Come on. I will take you to the doctor. He will make you better. Then you can go back to the park. You can play with your friend. You can have fun. But remember: do not enter the gate again. It is not easy. It is danger."
Tom says: "Okay. Thank you. I will remember. I will not enter the gate again. I will play with Sam. He is my best friend. I love him."
The moral of the story is: do not do things that are not safe. Follow the rules. Listen to your friends. They care about you. They know what is best for you. They can help you. They can make you happy.
