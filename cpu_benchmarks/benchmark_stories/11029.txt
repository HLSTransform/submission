Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to kick the ball to each other and catch it. Sometimes the ball went too far and they had to run after it.
One day, the ball flew over the fence and landed near a big building. Ben and Lily ran to the fence and looked at the building. It was very tall and had many windows. They saw some people working inside.
"Let's go get the ball," Ben said. He climbed over the fence and ran towards the building.
"No, Ben, wait!" Lily said. She was scared. She saw a sign on the building that said "Danger". She did not know what it meant, but she knew it was bad. She tried to warn Ben, but he did not hear her.
Ben reached the ball and picked it up. He was happy. He turned around and saw Lily waving at him. He waved back and smiled. He did not see the big truck that was coming out of the building. The truck was loud and fast. It had a big arm that lifted things.
The truck driver saw Ben and honked his horn. He tried to stop, but it was too late. The truck hit Ben and the ball. Ben fell down and the ball flew away. Lily screamed and cried. She ran to Ben and hugged him. She was very sad.
The truck driver got out of the truck and ran to Ben. He was very sorry. He called for help. He said he did not see Ben. He said Ben should not have been there. He said the building was not safe. He said the sign was a warning.
Lily did not understand. She only wanted Ben to be okay. She hoped he would wake up and play with her again. She hoped the ball would come back. She hoped the building would go away. She hoped the truck would never come back. She hoped the sign would never be there. She hoped the day would be mild and nice again.
