Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to dig in the sand and look for shiny things. One day, they found a coin. It was round and silver and had a picture of a man on it.
"Wow, look at this!" Ben said. "It is so fancy!"
"Can I see?" Lily asked. She reached for the coin, but Ben pulled it away.
"No, it is mine!" he said. "I found it first!"
Lily felt sad. She wanted to share the coin with Ben. She thought it was not nice to keep it all for himself.
"Please, Ben, let me see the coin," she said. "We can take turns to hold it."
But Ben did not listen. He put the coin in his pocket and ran away. He wanted to protect the coin from Lily and anyone else.
Lily followed him. She hoped he would change his mind and be her friend again. She saw him run into a big dog. The dog barked and jumped on Ben. Ben was scared. He dropped the coin and cried for help.
Lily ran to Ben. She pushed the dog away and hugged Ben. She saw the coin on the ground and picked it up.
"Here, Ben, you can have the coin," she said. "I am sorry I made you angry. I just wanted to see it."
Ben looked at Lily. He felt sorry too. He realized he had been mean to her. He took the coin and gave it back to her.
"Thank you, Lily," he said. "You are very brave and kind. You protected me from the dog. I am sorry I did not share the coin with you. You can have it. It is yours."
Lily smiled. She was happy that Ben was her friend again. She did not care about the coin anymore. She gave it back to Ben.
"No, Ben, it is ours," she said. "We can share it. We can both look at it and play with it. It is more fun that way."
Ben and Lily hugged. They put the coin in their backpack and went back to the park. They played in the sand and looked for more shiny things. They were happy. They learned to share and protect each other.
