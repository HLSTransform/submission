One day, Mandy and her dad went to the park. They saw a big slide with a seat at the top. It was a long slide, stretching out all the way to the ground.
Mandy's dad said, "Mandy, why don't you try sliding down this big slide?"
Mandy filled up with excitement. "Yes, I want to do it!"
Her dad sat her on the seat at the top of the slide. He then said, "Be careful, Mandy, the slide is very long. Count to five and then you'll be at the bottom."
Mandy said, "Okay, I will." As she started down the slide, she counted to five and then filled up with joy when she reached the bottom.
She looked up and saw her dad smiling. He said, "That was a lot of fun, wasn't it?"
Mandy smiled and said, "Yes, it was!"
