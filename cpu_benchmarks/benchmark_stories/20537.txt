John was ready to go on a trip. He had his luggage all packed and he knew exactly where he wanted to go. He was so excited to explore new places and learn something new.
He asked his mom and dad if they were ready to go too. His dad said they were, so together they took John's luggage and went to the train station. When they got there, John looked around and saw lots of people carrying bags. 
John knew right away that everyone was ready to go on a journey, just like him. He was so proud of his own luggage, and the thought of all these people coming from different places made him very happy. 
His dad then helped John get on the train and the journey began! As he waved goodbye to his parents, he couldn't help but feel excited and ready for his adventure.
