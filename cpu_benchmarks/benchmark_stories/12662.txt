Once upon a time, there was a big, big tree. It had large branches that reached up to the sky. One day, the sun came out and shone its sunshine on the tree. The tree was happy and swayed its branches in the breeze.
Suddenly, a little bird flew by and landed on one of the branches. The bird started to sing a beautiful song. But then, a mischievous squirrel came along and tried to steal the bird's food. The bird didn't like that and gave the squirrel a slap with its wing.
The squirrel ran away and the bird continued to sing in the sunshine. The tree was happy to have such a lovely sound in its branches. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
