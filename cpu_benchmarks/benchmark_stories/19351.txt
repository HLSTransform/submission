Once upon a time, there was a small boy who wanted to be successful. He was only three years old, but he was determined to try his best. So he put one foot in front of the other, and he marched forward. He marched through his garden, and across the lawn, marching ever onward in his quest for success.
He marched each day, and he marched each night. He kept marching, no matter what. Many days, he felt helpless and scared, but he kept marching anyway. He marched for months and months, never giving up.
At last, the little boy reached his goal! He had achieved success and was so proud. He danced and twirled and jumped for joy.
The little boy had learned a valuable lesson: if you march forward, you can reach your dreams.
