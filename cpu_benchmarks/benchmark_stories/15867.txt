Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to play chess. She would spend hours playing with her mom, taking turns moving the little playing pieces.
One day, the little girl and her mom were playing chess when suddenly the pieces started to glow! She was so frightened. The mom said, "It's okay! That is just magic! See the pieces are still just pieces."
The little girl was still too scared to play. But then her mom showed her that while the pieces were glowing they could make really fun games. The pieces moved by themselves and the little girl laughed and clapped with delight.
Soon the pieces stopped glowing, and the frightening feeling was replaced by joy. The little girl and her mom had a great time playing with the magical chess pieces.
