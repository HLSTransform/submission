Once upon a time there was a mom and a dad who had a naughty little boy. He loved to run around and shout and that was not allowed. So one day the mommy told the boy not to do that anymore. But he did not listen.
So the daddy got really mad. He said that the little boy must be punished. He gave the naughty boy a pipe. He said if he runs around and shouts again he will have to play this pipe for a whole day.
The little boy was so sad. He said he would never do it again. But one day he forgot and ran around and shouted. So the daddy said he must play the pipe for a whole day.
The little boy was very sad. He knew he had been naughty, but the punishment was too hard. He started to cry and the dad started to feel bad. That night, the mom and dad said they loved him and wouldn't punish him again.
The little boy was very happy and he promised he'll never shout again. He played his pipe everyday, but now it was just for fun. He was happy again.
