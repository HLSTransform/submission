Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was very hungry. He saw a big orange on the table. The orange was round and looked tasty.
Tom tried to reach the orange, but he was too small. He tried to climb on a chair, but he could not manage. Then, his friend, the cat, came to help. The cat jumped on the table and pushed the orange to Tom.
"Thank you, cat!" said Tom. "Now we can eat the orange together!" The cat meowed happily. They both ate the orange and were not hungry anymore. They were very happy and played together all day.
