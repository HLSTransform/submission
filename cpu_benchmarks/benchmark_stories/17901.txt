Once upon a time, there was a sad rubber. It was always alone, because it could not fit in with the other toys. The other toys were made of wood, plastic and fabric. But no one wanted to play with the sad rubber. 
One night, the rubber heard a sound outside its window. The sound was small and gentle. The rubber opened the window and saw a beautiful caterpillar. 
The caterpillar asked why the rubber was so sad. The rubber explained that no toy wanted to play with it because it could not fit in. But the caterpillar said it did not mind. 
The caterpillar and the rubber became best friends. They played in the garden and had fun together. Because of the caterpillar, the rubber was no longer sad.
