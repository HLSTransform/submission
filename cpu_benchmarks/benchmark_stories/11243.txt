Once upon a time there was a huge bear. He lived in the west in a very big forest. One day, he came upon a clearing in the forest and there he saw two little cubs playing. 
The bear smiled at the cubs and said, "Hello little ones! What are you doing out here all alone?" 
The cubs stopped playing and stood up to face him. One of the cubs said, "We're not alone. We have a big brother and he's coming to get us soon." 
Just then, there was a loud call from the west. A voice demanded, "Where are my cubs?" 
The cubs gasped and ran to find their brother. He was huge and his voice boomed through the woods. The cubs hugged their brother and the bear stepped back, knowing he was in the presence of a mighty protector. 
The bear nodded at the cubs and their brother and said, "Be safe out here." And with that, the huge bear disappeared back into the forest.
