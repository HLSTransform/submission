Once upon a time, there was a rabbit named Bun. He loved to eat carrots. Every day, he would hop to the garden to nibble on some tasty carrots.
One day, Bun saw a big shadow. He looked up and saw a grumpy farmer. The farmer was holding a carrot in his hand. Bun wanted that carrot so badly that he started to panic.
Bun quickly hopped away and hid in his burrow. He knew that the farmer would take all the carrots away. But then, he remembered that he had saved a carrot for a rainy day. He went to his secret stash and ate his carrot. He was happy and full, and he didn't have to panic anymore.
