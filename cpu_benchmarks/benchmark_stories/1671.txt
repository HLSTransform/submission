Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to dance and twirl around. He would dance whenever he felt happy or excited. One day, Timmy saw an old man walking with a cane. The old man looked nervous and scared.
Timmy went up to the old man and started to dance around him. The old man smiled and started to tap his cane to the beat of Timmy's dance. They danced together for a while and had so much fun.
Timmy learned that even if someone looks different or scared, you can always make them happy by dancing with them. It's important to be kind and make others feel good. Timmy felt proud of himself for making the old man smile and dance.
