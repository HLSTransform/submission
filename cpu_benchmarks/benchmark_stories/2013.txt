Once upon a time, there was a nosy girl named Sarah. She was always pretending to be something in the world of make-believe. One day, she had a great idea! She was going to pretend to be a racecar, driving around as fast as she could. She ran around the backyard, speeding in circles.
The next day, Sarah was ready to pretend racecars again. But this time, she surprised herself when she felt like she was really going faster than before. She couldn't believe it! She was actually going faster than ever before.
Sarah couldn't believe it! It was almost like she had gotten some kind of magical boost of speed. Little did she know that her family had bought her a big-wheeled scooter the night before.
The scooter was the perfect tool for Sarah to pretend she was a racecar. She zipped around the yard, pretending to win races. She was so happy with her newfound speed that she kept pretending for days!
