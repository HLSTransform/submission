Once upon a time, there was a lonely little bird named Tim. Tim lived on a roof of a small house. He had no friends to play with, and he was sad.
One day, Tim saw a cat on the ground. The cat looked up and said, "Hi, I am Sam. Can you come down to play with me?" Tim wanted to play, but he was scared. He didn't know if he could reach the ground.
Tim was brave and tried to reach the ground. He flapped his wings and flew down. Sam was happy to see Tim. They played together all day long. Tim was not lonely anymore. They became best friends and always played together, on the roof and on the ground.
