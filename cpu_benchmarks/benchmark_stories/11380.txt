Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mia.  She liked to play in her garden, and often she would catch little bugs. One day she was feeling lonesome, so she decided to take a walk.
When she was outside, Mia heard a noise. She saw a bright yellow ambulance and many people outside the house. She asked the people what was going on, and they told her that her neighbour had been very sick. Then the ambulance drove away, and everyone said goodbye to her neighbour.
Mia felt sad that her neighbour needed to go to the hospital. She was worried that he would be lonely without his friends and family. That night Mia had bad dreams that she was also taken away to the hospital. 
The following day, however, when Mia went to the garden to catch some bugs, she saw her neighbour was standing there. He smiled at Mia and said he had come home from the hospital!
Mia was so happy that her neighbour was feeling better and no longer had to be lonely. From then on, Mia would always come to the garden to catch bugs with her neighbour.
