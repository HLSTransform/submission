Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to play outdoors and had so much fun each day in the sunshine!
One day, she took off outside and ran around until she felt quite dizzy. When she came back inside, her mom said it was time for a wash.
Lucy was so excited! She knew that if she washed, she would be so clean and ready for her next day of fun. She decided to take a warm bath, using her special bubble soap.
Lucy enjoyed washing and when she was done, she felt so soft and sparkly. She was all ready for another sunny day of playing!
