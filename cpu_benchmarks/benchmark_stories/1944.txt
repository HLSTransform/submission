Once there was a little girl who was feeling very lonely. Then one day she spotted a box in the corner of the room. She opened the box and she saw that it was filled with nice clothes. She was so excited and she quickly removed them one by one. She put the clothes on, and for the first time in a long time, she didn't feel lonely anymore. She twirled around in the room, feeling so happy with her new clothes. From that day on, her room was no longer lonely and she knew she'd never be lonely again.
