Once upon a time, there was a chubby bunny named Benny. Benny loved to eat carrots and play in the fields. One day, Benny saw a beautiful flower and wanted to pick it. But his mommy told him that he shouldn't pick the flower because it was not nice to take things that didn't belong to him.
Benny didn't listen to his mommy and picked the flower anyway. Later that day, Benny's friend asked him where the flower came from. Benny felt sad and realized that he had made a mistake. He missed the flower and wished he could put it back where it belonged.
Benny learned that it was important to listen to his mommy and not take things that didn't belong to him. From that day on, he promised to be a good bunny and never take anything without permission.
