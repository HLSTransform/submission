Once there were two friends, Lucy and Jack. They wanted to go to the store. Jack was excited to get some candy.
Their mum said they could go but they must stay together. They walked to the store and Jack saw the hot candy. He wanted to gain some right away.
They went to the counter and the storekeeper gave them the candy. Jack was so happy and said thank you.
On their way back they saw an ice cream stand. Jack wanted to have an ice cream too but his mum said no. She said he was too full from the candy. He was sad but understood.
The two friends ran back home, laughing and smiling. They were happy to have gained something special.
