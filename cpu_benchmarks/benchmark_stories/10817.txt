Once upon a time, there was a little flower. It was a new flower, just born from a seed. The flower wanted to bloom and show its pretty colors to the world. But there was a problem. The flower was planted in a pot with no drain, so it was always wet and sad.
One day, a kind gardener saw the flower and knew what to do. He took the flower out of the pot and put it in a new one with a drain. The flower was so happy! It finally had a chance to bloom and show its beauty to everyone.
But there was a conflict. A big, mean bird saw the flower and wanted to eat it. The bird tried to grab the flower with its sharp claws, but the flower was too quick. It used its leaves to protect itself and the bird flew away.
From that day on, the flower continued to bloom and grow. It was happy in its new pot with a drain and knew that it was safe from any harm.
