Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lucy. She was a very happy girl.
One day, she was walking along the beach and she saw a big wave. She smiled and ran to the wave. She waved her arms in the air and said, “hello wave!”
The wave seemed to repeat her words. She thought this was very useful and smiled even bigger.
She kept repeating her words to the wave and she made silly faces too. The wave kept repeating her words and making her smile.
The wave was a very useful friend to Lucy. Wherever she went, the wave followed.
They had lots of fun together, talking and waving to each other.
 
The end.
