Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to play in the park and chase after balls. One day, Max saw a big dog with a shiny chain around his neck. Max was curious and went to say hello. The big dog nodded his head and Max barked happily.
Max loved playing with the big dog, but he also loved being independent. He didn't want to be tied up with a chain like the big dog. So, Max ran around the park and played with his ball, feeling free and happy. The big dog watched Max play and nodded his head in approval. Max was happy to have a new friend, but he was even happier to be independent and free.
