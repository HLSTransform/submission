Once upon a time, there was a brave boy. His name was Johnny. Johnny loved to whistle. He would whistle all day on long, sunny days.
One day, Johnny was invited to a party. He was so excited to go. When he arrived at the party, he started to whistle loud and proud. Everyone at the party heard his happy tune and began to sing and dance.
At the end of the party, everyone gave Johnny a big round of applause. They thanked him for his song and for being so brave.
Johnny smiled and said thank you. He whistled one final time and went back home, happy to have had such a fun time at the party.
