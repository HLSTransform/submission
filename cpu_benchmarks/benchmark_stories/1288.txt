Sammy liked to show his sock. It was a fierce red one with blue stripes. He would proudly show it to his mommy and daddy and even to his friends. 
Whenever Sammy wanted to be strong, he put on his sock. It made him feel brave and fierce. One day, Sammy put on his sock and challenged his dad to a race. His dad laughed and said, "Okay! Let's go!" 
Sammy was so determined to beat his dad, he forgot one important thing: his shoes! Sammy was undeterred, he showed his sock and kept running. 
At the finish line, Sammy and his dad were neck and neck. When Sammy crossed the line, he stood tall and proud. His dad, fooled by Sammy's fierce determination, clapped and praised him, "Wow! You won!" 
Sammy was so happy he had won the race. He was now sure that his sock made him the fiercest runner around. From that day on, he always wore his fierce red sock when he wanted to show the world he could do anything.
