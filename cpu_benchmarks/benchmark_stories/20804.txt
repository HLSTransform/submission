Once upon a time there was a yellow cow. Every day she would give milk to an old man who lived at the end of the road. One day, the old man got very sick, so the cow took care of him. She gave him milk to help him get better. But it wasn't enough.
At the same time, a young girl found a magical wand. She used it to restore the old man's health. When the old man was feeling better, they all had a big party and the cow was invited.
The cow was so happy because she knew her milk had helped the old man. She felt it was a big part of restoring him to health. From that day, the cow and the old man were best friends. Whenever the old man felt bad, the cow was there with a glass of milk to make him feel better.
