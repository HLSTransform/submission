One day, a fish named Bob wanted to design his home. He lived in a reef with his friends. Bob wanted his home to be original, so he asked his friends for help.
Bob asked his friend, Sally the sea star, "Can you help me make my home different?" Sally said, "Yes, we can use pretty shells and stones." They started to work on Bob's home together.
But then, a big shark came to the reef. The shark was very hungry and wanted to eat the fish. Bob and Sally were scared. They tried to hide in Bob's home, but the shark found them. The shark ate Bob and Sally. The other fish were sad because they lost their friends.
