Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and collect pretty rocks. One day, she found a really big rock that she wanted to keep forever. But her mommy told her that they were going on a trip and she couldn't bring the rock with her.
Lily was very stubborn and didn't want to leave her rock behind. But her mommy told her they had to pack their bags and get ready to go. So, Lily decided to pack her rock in her backpack and bring it with her.
On the trip, Lily showed her rock to everyone she met. They all thought it was very pretty and special. When they got home, Lily put her rock on her dresser and looked at it every day. She was happy that she packed it and brought it with her on the trip. The end.
