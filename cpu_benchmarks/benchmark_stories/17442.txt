Sam liked to play with his toy cars. He had many cars of different colors and sizes. He liked to make them go fast and make loud noises. He had one car that was his favorite. It was a red car with a big motor. It could go faster than any other car. Sam called it his super car.
One day, Sam went to the park with his mom and his super car. He saw a big hill and wanted to try it. He thought his super car could go up and down the hill very fast. He asked his mom if he could go. His mom said yes, but be careful. She said the hill was steep and there were rocks and holes. She said his super car could get hurt or lost.
Sam did not listen. He was too excited. He ran to the hill and put his super car on the top. He pushed it hard and watched it go down. It went very fast and made a loud noise. Sam was happy. He ran after it to get it back. But he was too late. His super car hit a big rock and flew into the air. It landed far away in the bushes. Sam could not see it.
Sam was sad. He looked for his super car in the bushes. He could not find it. He called for it. He did not hear it. He cried for it. He did not feel it. He lost his super car. He wished he had listened to his mom. He wished he had been careful. He wished he had played with his ordinary cars. He regretted pushing his super car so hard. He learned a hard lesson. He missed his super car.
