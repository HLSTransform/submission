Once upon a time, there was a big, strong man who loved to help people. He had big muscles that he used to lift heavy things and carry them around. He was very kind and always wore a beautiful smile on his face.
One day, a little girl got lost in the forest. She was very scared and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, the big, strong man appeared and asked if he could help her. The little girl was so happy to see him and she knew he would keep her safe.
The big, strong man picked up the little girl and carried her back to her home. The little girl was very grateful and thanked him for his help. She thought he was the most beautiful person she had ever seen, with his big muscles and kind smile. From that day on, the little girl knew that if she ever needed help, she could always count on the big, strong man with the beautiful smile.
