Once upon a time there were two friends called Sarah and Benjamin. Sarah was so excited for their fun day of playing together. They had all sorts of equipment such as a ball, a beach bucket and a frisbee.
The first thing they did was play with the ball. They ran around in circles and laughed. Then they even tried to throw it over the fence. They both tried so hard but they couldn't quite do it.
Then they decided to take a rest. They lay together under a tree, shading from the hot sun. Sarah was so exhausted she started to nod off and soon she was fast asleep. Benjamin stayed awake, watching his friend nap.
They stayed like that for a while and then it was time for Benjamin to go home. Sarah said goodbye, feeling ever so happy to have spent time with her best friend. Before he left, he whispered softly “I can’t wait until we can play together again.” Sarah smiled, already excited for their next day of playing together.
