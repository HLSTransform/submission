Once upon a time, there was a happy duck. She loved to swim in the pond. But she always complained that it was too small. She wanted a bigger pond where she could flop around with all of her duck friends.
One day, she saw a big blue pond in the distance and started quacking excitedly. She swam over there to investigate.
When she got there she saw so many ducks splashing and swimming around. She jumped in with them and started enjoying herself. She wiggled her tail and bobbed in and out of the cool water.
She had so much fun! After a while though, she started to complain that she was hungry. She was lucky that she spied a juicy worm wiggling near the side of the pond.
The happy duck gobbled up the worm, quacked loudly, then swam back to her little pond. From then on, whenever she was feeling a little fed up, she would visit the big blue pond and frolic with her new friends.
