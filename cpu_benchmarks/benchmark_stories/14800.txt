Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big slide. They want to go on the slide.
"Can we go on the slide, please?" Tom asks his mom.
"OK, but be careful. The slide is wet. You might slip," his mom says.
Tom and Sam run to the slide. They take turns to go down. They have fun. They laugh and shout.
Then, they see a man. The man has a big hat and a long coat. He has a bag with him. He walks to the slide. He puts his bag on the ground. He climbs the ladder.
"What is he doing?" Sam asks.
"I don't know. Maybe he likes the slide too," Tom says.
The man reaches the top of the slide. He sits down. He smiles. He pushes himself down.
But the slide is too wet. The man slips. He slides very fast. He can't stop. He screams.
Tom and Sam watch. They are scared. They hope the man is OK.
The man reaches the end of the slide. He flies off. He lands on his bag. His hat and coat fall off.
Tom and Sam see what is in his bag. It is amazing. It is full of toys. There are cars, dolls, balls, books, and more.
The man gets up. He is not hurt. He is angry. He sees his bag is open. He sees his toys are out. He sees Tom and Sam are looking.
"Hey, those are mine! Give them back!" he yells.
He runs to his bag. He tries to grab his toys. But Tom and Sam are faster. They pick up some toys. They run to their mom.
"Mom, look what we found! This man has toys! Can we have some?" they ask.
Their mom looks at the man. She sees his hat and coat. She sees his bag. She knows who he is. He is a bad man. He is a thief. He stole the toys from a store.
She calls the police. She tells them what happened. She gives them the toys. She tells Tom and Sam they did a good thing.
The police come. They catch the thief. They take him away. They thank Tom and Sam and their mom.
Tom and Sam are happy. They are proud. They are brave. They hug their mom.
They don't need the toys. They have each other. They have fun. They are friends.
