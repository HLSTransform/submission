Anna and Ben were going to the park with their mom. They liked the park very much. They could play on the swings, slide down the slide, and run on the grass. They were very happy.
But when they got to the car, mom said, "Oh no, we have a delay. The car is not working. We have to wait for dad to come and fix it."
Anna and Ben were sad. They did not want to wait. They wanted to go to the park now.
"Can we play here, mom?" Anna asked.
"Sure, you can play here, but be careful. Don't go too far," mom said.
Anna and Ben looked around. They saw a big tree with many leaves. They saw a fence with some flowers. They saw a spot on the ground with some rocks and sticks.
"Let's make a fancy house with the rocks and sticks," Ben said.
"OK, that sounds fun," Anna said.
They went to the spot and started to build their house. They used the rocks for the walls and the sticks for the roof. They picked some flowers and put them on the door. They made a window with a leaf.
They were very proud of their house. They pretended to live in it. They said hello to their neighbors. They invited mom to visit.
Mom smiled and said, "Wow, you made a very fancy house. You are very creative. I'm sorry we had a delay, but I'm glad you had fun."
Just then, dad arrived. He fixed the car. He said, "OK, we can go to the park now. Are you ready?"
Anna and Ben said, "Yes, we are ready. But can we take our fancy house with us?"
Dad laughed and said, "Sure, we can take your fancy house with us. But you have to help me carry it."
Anna and Ben nodded. They helped dad carry their house to the car. They put it in the back. They got in the car. They waved goodbye to their spot.
They were happy. They were going to the park. And they had their fancy house.
