Lily liked to study her pet cat, Milo. She watched him sleep, play, and eat. She learned how he liked to be petted, and how he hated water. She also learned that he had a bitter tongue.
One day, Lily wanted to taste Milo's tongue. She thought it might be like candy, or milk, or cheese. She waited until he was sleeping on the couch, and then she crawled over to him. She opened his mouth gently, and stuck out her tongue.
But Milo's tongue was not like candy, or milk, or cheese. It was bitter, and rough, and prickly. Lily made a face, and spat out the fur. She felt a sharp pain in her tongue, and started to cry.
Milo woke up, and saw Lily crying. He was confused, and scared. He licked her face, and tried to comfort her. He did not understand why she had tasted his tongue. He thought she was his friend, and he loved her.
Lily stopped crying, and hugged Milo. She said she was sorry, and that she loved him too. She learned that Milo's tongue was bitter, but his heart was sweet. She decided to never taste his tongue again, and to study him in other ways.
