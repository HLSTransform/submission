Once upon a time there were two friends; one was named Tom and the other was named Sam. Tom enjoyed spelling, but Sam was not so fond of it. 
Tom was always leaning over books, thinking about all the words he knew. 
One day Sam asked Tom, "Why do you like spelling?" 
Tom replied, "It's fun and I like to learn new words." 
But Sam was still frustrated, so they decided to have a spelling contest. 
Tom was confident in his spelling ability, but Sam was a bit afraid. He knew his spelling was a bit messy. 
Tom said, "I promise I won't put you down, it'll just be a fun game!" 
Sam finally agreed, and the two began the spelling contest. 
Tom was great at spelling and finished first, while Sam struggled a bit. 
When it was all over, Tom smiled and said, "See it wasn't so bad after all!" 
Sam sighed and smiled, happy that he had finally conquered his fear and leaned more about spelling.
