Once upon a time there was a boy called Tom who was three years old. He loved paper. Whenever he saw a piece of paper he would insist on having it.
One day his mum took him to the library. When they arrived, Tom was so excited. He saw many interesting books. He wanted to touch each and every one of them.
“Can I please have a piece of paper?” Tom asked his mum.
“Oh Tom, you can’t take paper from the library,” his mum said.
But Tom was persistent. He insisted and insisted until his mum finally gave in. She gave him one piece of paper.
Tom was happy. He used the paper to draw a beautiful picture. His mum was so proud of him. 
The two of them went home, with Tom holding onto his piece of paper. He promised himself that he would never let go of it.
