Once upon a time there was a duck who was feeling very bored. He looked around his pond and saw nothing interesting to do. Suddenly, he noticed a bright star in the sky.
The duck had an idea! He decided to decorate the pond with stars. So he swam around and gathered lots of pretty stones and shiny leaves. He arranged them into a big star shape at the bottom of the pond. 
The duck was so glad. He liked it so much that he decided to invite some friends to share his special pond. He gathered some ducks who also wanted to help decorate. 
The ducks made more stars, as well as a moon and some flowers. It looked so bright and beautiful. Everyone was so happy with the way they had decorated the pond. The whole pond sparkled and glowed in the night. 
The duck was so glad that he had a special pond to share with his friends. It was the most wonderful pond, and they were all so lucky to have it.
