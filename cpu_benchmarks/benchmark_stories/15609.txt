Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in their big house. One day, they discover a new thing in their house. It is a white box with a door and buttons. They wonder what it is.
"Let's go inside and see," Sara says. She opens the door and pulls Ben in. She pushes a button with a number on it. The door closes and the box moves up and down. Sara and Ben feel funny in their tummies.
"What is this?" Ben asks. He is scared.
"I think it is an elevator," Sara says. She remembers seeing one in a book. "It takes us to different floors."
"Can we go back?" Ben says. He does not like the elevator.
"OK," Sara says. She pushes another button. The door opens and they see their mom. She is surprised to see them.
"Where have you been?" she asks. "I was looking for you."
"We found an elevator," Sara says. She is proud.
"An elevator?" mom says. She is confused. "We don't have an elevator in our house."
She looks at the white box. It is not an elevator. It is a laundry chute. Sara and Ben have been riding up and down with the dirty clothes.
Mom laughs. She hugs Sara and Ben. She is glad they are safe.
"Next time, let's play with something else," she says. "How about some blocks?"
Sara and Ben agree. They do not want to go in the white box again. They follow mom to their room. They play with their blocks and have fun.
