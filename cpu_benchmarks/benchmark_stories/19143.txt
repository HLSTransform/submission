Once upon a time, there was a rare bear named Bob. Bob was not like other bears. He liked to poke things with his big paw. One day, Bob went for a walk in the woods.
As Bob walked, he met a small bird. The bird was looking for a friend to play with. "Hi, I am Bob," said the bear. "Do you want to play a match with me?" The bird said, "Yes, I want to play with you."
Bob and the bird played a game of hide and seek. Bob was very good at poking around to find the bird. The bird was also good at hiding. They had a lot of fun. After the match, Bob and the bird became best friends. They played together every day, and they lived happily ever after.
