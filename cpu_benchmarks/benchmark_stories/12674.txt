Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear a pretty bow in her hair. One day, she saw an amazing bow in the store window. She asked her mommy to buy it for her, but her mommy said they didn't have enough money right now.
Lily was sad, but she knew that her mommy loved her and would always try to make her happy. So, she decided to make her own bow using some colorful ribbons she found in her toy box. It wasn't as amazing as the one in the store, but Lily was proud of her creation.
When her mommy saw Lily's homemade bow, she was amazed at how creative her little girl was. She knew that Lily had a special talent for making things. From that day on, Lily knew that she could always make something amazing with her own two hands.
