Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw pictures with her crayons. One day, she drew a picture of a big, red apple. She was so proud of her picture and showed it to her mommy. 
"Wow, Lily! That's a beautiful picture," her mommy said.
Lily smiled and said, "I want to make it even more pretty."
She took out her glitter and started to decorate the apple. Suddenly, the apple started to reveal a secret. It was actually a rich, golden apple! 
Lily was amazed and said, "Mommy, look! The apple is so pretty and rich!"
Her mommy smiled and said, "Yes, it's a magical apple. You made it even more beautiful with your picture." 
Lily was so happy that her picture made the apple reveal its secret. From that day on, she loved to draw pictures of magical things.
