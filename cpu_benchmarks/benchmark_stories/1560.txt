Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite toy, a teddy bear named Brownie. One day, Brownie's ear fell off and Lily was very sad. Her mom said they could replace the ear with a new one. 
Lily went to the toy store and found a new ear for Brownie. She was so happy! But then, when she got home, she realized that she had lost Brownie. She looked everywhere, but he was gone. 
Lily was very sad again. Her mom suggested they switch Brownie for a new toy. They went back to the toy store and found a big, heavy toy truck. Lily thought it was cool and took it home. 
But when she went to bed that night, she couldn't stop thinking about Brownie. She wished she had him back. The next day, Lily went on a walk and saw Brownie in the park. She ran to get him, but a big dog came and took Brownie away. Lily was very sad and missed Brownie so much.
