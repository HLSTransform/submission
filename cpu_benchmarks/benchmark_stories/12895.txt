Once there was a little boy named Tim. He was 3 years old and very curious. One day, Tim wanted to take a walk around his neighbourhood. He put on his hat and shoes and ran outside.
When he got outside, it was hot! Tim started to walk round the block. As he was walking, he saw his friend Sam. He waved and shouted "Hi Sam!"
Sam came over and said, "Hey Tim. It's hot today, isn't it?"
Tim smiled and said "Yes, it's very hot! Let's go for a walk!"
So Sam and Tim walked round the block together, talking and laughing. When they finished walking, they said goodbye and went home.
Tim felt tired but happy from his walk. He couldn't wait to go on another walk the next day!
