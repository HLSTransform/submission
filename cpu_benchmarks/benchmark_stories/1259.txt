Once upon a time there were two friends, Gary and Amy. Gary wanted to go to the fun park nearby but he did not have enough money. But luckily, Amy was very generous and she gave Gary a ticket so he could go. Gary was so happy and he thanked his friend. They both went to the park and had a fantastic time. They went on all the rides and played all the games, until it was time to go home. Gary was now able to complete his fun day at the park thanks to Amyâ€™s generous ticket!
