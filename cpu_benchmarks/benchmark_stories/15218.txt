One day, there was a big purple cat named Tom. Tom was a very curious cat. He loved to play in the garden. One day, he found a small book in the garden. The book was called a passport. Tom did not know what a passport was, but he thought it was fun to play with.
Tom met his friend, a small dog named Tim. Tom said, "Look, Tim! I found a passport!" Tim looked at the passport and said, "Oh no, Tom! That is not a toy. We need to give it back to its owner." But Tom did not want to give it back. He wanted to keep playing with it.
Tom had an idea. He said, "I know! I will bury the passport in the garden. Then no one will find it, and I can play with it whenever I want!" So, Tom dug a hole and put the passport in it. He covered it with dirt and patted it down. Tim was sad, but he could not stop Tom.
Later that day, a man came to the garden. He looked very sad and worried. He said, "I lost my passport. I need it to go home. Has anyone seen it?" Tom and Tim looked at each other. They knew they should tell the man about the passport, but they were scared.
The man never found his passport. He could not go home, and he was very sad. Tom and Tim felt bad for the man, but they did not tell him about the passport they buried. They knew they should have listened to Tim and given the passport back.
