Nan and her mommy went on a safari. Nan was very excited. Mommy told Nan that she could see many different animals, but she must be mild. Nan was excited to see all the animals, but she was a bit scared too.
At the safari, Nan saw elephants and lions. She saw a zebra and some monkeys, too. Nan was so glad she came on the safari, but she was still a bit scared. 
Then, Mommy dared Nan to try something new. Nan was so brave that she dared to go a little closer to the animals. She saw how amazing they were up close.
After that, Nan and Mommy went home. Nan was very proud of herself for daring to explore the safari. It was a mild but wonderful adventure for Nan.
