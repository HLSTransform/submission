Ben likes to play with his toy cars. He has many cars of different colors and sizes. He makes them zoom and crash on the floor. Sometimes he pretends they are racing or chasing each other.
One day, he plays too rough with his red car. He throws it against the wall and it breaks. The wheels fall off and the car is bent. Ben is sad and angry. He loves his red car. He cries and runs to his mom.
Mom sees Ben and his broken car. She hugs him and tells him not to worry. She says she can repair his car. She takes him to the kitchen and gets some glue and tape. She puts the wheels back on and fixes the car. She tells Ben to be gentle with his car and not throw it again.
Ben is happy and grateful. He thanks his mom and hugs her. He takes his car and goes back to his room. He plays with his car and his other cars. He makes them zoom and crash on the floor, but not too hard. He wants his car to stay in order. He knows his car is weak and needs his care. He loves his car and his mom.
