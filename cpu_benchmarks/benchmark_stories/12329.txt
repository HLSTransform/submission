Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Jake. He loved to go to the beach and explore. One day, he saw a seal pop its head out of the water. Jake smiled and decided he wanted to befriend the seal. 
He slowly walked towards it, but the seal seemed scared. It was squealing a lot and jumping back into the water. Jake was confused. He wanted to show the seal that he was friendly, so he shouted, "Don't be scared! I won't shoot you!" 
The seal peeped his head out of the water again, and Jake realised that someone had taught the seal it was bad to be around people. He was determined to show the seal that humans could be kind too. He moved closer and started to talk kindly to it. 
Slowly, the seal stopped squealing and allowed Jake to touch it. After a few minutes, the seal seemed happy and calm, and it even let Jake give it a hug! 
From that day forward, the seal and the little boy would meet at the beach everyday, and the seal and Jake became best of friends.
