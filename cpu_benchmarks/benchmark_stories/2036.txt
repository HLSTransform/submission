John was a big rabbit who loved to explore the forest. He jumped through the trees and hopped around in the grass, looking for interesting things. One day, he spotted a pattern on the ground and he wanted to get closer and have a look. He started hopping towards it, but then he saw something big and scary in the distance - a bear!
John was scared and wanted to escape, so he quickly hopped away. He hopped faster and faster, running away from the bear. He kept running until he couldn't run anymore, but he was still far away from the pattern he had been looking at. He was safe, but he couldn't get to the pattern.
Sadly, John had to give up and go home. He never got to explore the pattern and he was disappointed. He knew he had been brave to try, but he couldn't escape the bear.
