Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She heard something ringing. She quickly ran out of her house. 
When she arrived outside, she saw a big, tall museum. It looked empty, with all the windows and doors shut tight. 
Lucy asked her friend, "What's that ringing?" 
Her friend replied, "It's the museum ringing because it's empty." 
Lucy had never seen a museum before and she was curious. She asked, "What's inside?" 
Her friend said, "Lots of magical things! You should go inside!" 
Finally Lucy plucked up the courage to go inside. When she opened the door, she saw all sorts of treasures and adventures that she had never seen before! She was amazed. 
From then on, Lucy and her friend always went to the museum on weekends to explore and discover all the magical things inside. 
The End.
