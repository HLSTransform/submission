Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo lived in the big ocean with his friends. One day, the sun was very hot and Nemo felt very warm. He wanted to cool down, so he swam to a shady spot. 
As he was swimming, Nemo saw a big wave coming towards him. He blinked his eyes and swam as fast as he could to avoid it. When he got to the shady spot, he saw his friend Dory there. Dory said, "Hi Nemo, are you hot? You can swim with me in the cool water." 
Nemo was happy to have a friend to swim with. They swam and played in the ocean until the sun went down. Nemo was grateful for his friend and the cool water that helped him feel better. From that day on, Nemo knew that when he was hot, he could always count on Dory to help him cool down.
