One day, Tom was at the park with his Mom. He saw a friendly case on the ground near the swings. He asked Mom if he could have it, so Mom said yes. Tom was so excited to receive the case. 
He opened it up when he got home. Inside was a small toy car. Tom was so happy to have it. He rolled the car around on the floor. 
Then he wanted to show his new toy to his friend, Joe. So he and Mom went to Joe's house. His friend was so friendly and pleased to see the case. He thanked Tom for the car and they both pushed the car around on the floor for hours. 
At the end of the day, Joe and Tom both held their toy cars and Mom gave them each a hug. Tom had received something special from the park and shared it with his friend.
