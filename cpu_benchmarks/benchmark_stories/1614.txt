Sara and Ben like to play in the park. They have a ball and a bike. They have fun with their friends. One day, they see a big hole in the ground. They want to see what is inside.
They go near the hole and look down. They see something white and hard. It looks like a big stick. But it is not a stick. It is a skeleton. A skeleton is what is inside you when you have no skin or hair or eyes. Sara and Ben are scared. They want to run away.
But they are too late. A big dog comes out of the hole. It is angry and hungry. It has sharp teeth and long claws. It wants to eat Sara and Ben. It jumps on them and bites them. Sara and Ben scream and cry. They have no chance. The dog eats them and their ball and their bike. The dog is happy. Sara and Ben are gone. The end.
