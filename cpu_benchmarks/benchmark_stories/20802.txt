Mummy was running late and feeling embarrassed. She grabbed a hook from the side table and hurriedly wrapped it around her bag handle. Suddenly, she heard the hook drop on the floor. She quickly bent down to pick it up, but before she could get it, little John dashed past. He had snatched up the hook and was rapidly wrapping it around his finger. Mummy smiled and relieved her embarrassment. She reached out her hand and John gave her the hook. With a happy twirl, he ran off to play. Mummy sighed and put the hook back in its place. What an adventure a 3 year old could have with the most simple of objects.
