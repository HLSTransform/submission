Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends, but one day a big storm came. The sky turned dark and the wind blew hard. Lily was scared, so she went inside her house.
Her mom told her that it was normal for storms to come sometimes, but they would always pass. Lily felt better knowing that. She closed the curtains and snuggled up with her favorite blanket. She listened to the rain tapping on the window and felt safe inside her cozy home. Eventually, the storm passed and the sun came out again. Lily went outside to play with her friends, happy that everything was back to normal.
