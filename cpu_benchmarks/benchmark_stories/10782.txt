Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot loved to walk and play outside. He was always eager to go out and have fun.
One sunny day, Spot went for a walk with his best friend, a little girl named Lily. They walked and walked until they found a big field with lots of green grass. Spot was happy to see the grass and started to run and jump.
Lily and Spot played in the grass all day long. They laughed and had so much fun. When it was time to go home, they walked back, tired but happy. They couldn't wait to come back and play in the grass again.
