Lily loved to play with her fairy doll. She named her fairy doll Rose, because she had pink wings and a pink dress. Lily and Rose liked to fly around the garden and look at the flowers and the birds. Lily would squeeze Rose gently and tell her she was her best friend.
One day, Lily and Rose saw a big butterfly. It was yellow and black and very pretty. Lily wanted to catch it and show it to Rose. She ran after the butterfly, but it was too fast. She did not see the big rock in her way. She tripped and fell down. She hurt her knee and her elbow. She started to cry.
Rose flew out of Lily's hand when she fell. She landed on a leaf. She saw Lily crying and felt sad. She wanted to help her. She flew to Lily and landed on her shoulder. She whispered in her ear, "Don't cry, Lily. You are brave and strong. I am here for you. You are important to me."
Lily felt something tickle her ear. She looked and saw Rose. She smiled and wiped her tears. She hugged Rose and said, "Thank you, Rose. You are kind and sweet. You are here for me. You are important to me too."
Lily and Rose felt happy and loved. They forgot about the butterfly. They went back to the garden and played some more. They were the best of friends.
