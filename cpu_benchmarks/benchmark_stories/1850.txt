Timmy was outdoors in the cold. He shivered, because he was not wearing a coat. He looked around and noticed a beautiful image. It was a unicorn, standing in the grass.
"Hi there," he said.
The unicorn replied, "Hi Timmy. Would you like to have an adventure?"
Timmy smiled and nodded. The unicorn moved and Timmy followed, until they came to a river. The river was still and the water was cold.
"Let's see how long we can remain in the water," said the unicorn.
Timmy wanted to remain in the water for a long time and he closed his eyes. He stayed there, feeling the cold and imagining the beautiful image of the unicorn. Suddenly he heard his mother's voice calling and he knew he must go home.
He opened his eyes and waved goodbye to the unicorn. Then he turned and ran off home, still imagining the beautiful image of the unicorn in his mind.
