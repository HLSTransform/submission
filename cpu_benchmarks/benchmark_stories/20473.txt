Once there were two friends called Sam and Mia. Sam wanted to talk to Mia about something but was feeling a bit shy. He finally mentioned it to her. Mia had a different opinion to Sam, but that was ok. The opinion Mia had was very smelly! Sam was surprised by Mia's smelly opinion. But he still liked Mia, even if her opinion was smelly. They both laughed together and made up their own smelly opinion. They still talk about it now.
