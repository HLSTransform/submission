Once upon a time, there was a big jeep. It was red and shiny. One day, the jeep started to move. It drove on a bumpy road and went up a hill. The jeep was so fast and it was so much fun!
After a while, the jeep stopped near a big tree. There were some yummy apples on the tree. The jeep's driver picked some apples and they were very delicious. The driver shared the apples with the jeep and they both enjoyed them very much.
