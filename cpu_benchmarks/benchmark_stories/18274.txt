Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to draw. She would draw with her chalk on the smooth sidewalk every day. One day, Lily's friend Timmy came over to play. Lily asked Timmy if he wanted to draw with her, but Timmy refused. 
Lily was sad because she wanted to share her love of drawing with her friend. She asked Timmy why he didn't want to draw, and he said he didn't like chalk because it made his hands dirty. 
Lily had an idea. She went inside and got some wet wipes. She gave them to Timmy and said, "Now you can draw with me and keep your hands clean!" Timmy was happy and they drew together on the smooth sidewalk until the sun went down. From that day on, Timmy never refused to draw with Lily again.
