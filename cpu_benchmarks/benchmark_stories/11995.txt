Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Red. She had a red hood that she always wore when she went to visit her grandma. Red loved to go through the forest, but her mother always warned her about the big bad wolf who lived there.
One day, Red was walking in the forest when she saw a very attractive wolf. He had big, shiny eyes and a fluffy tail. He asked her where she was going and Red told him she was going to visit her grandma. The wolf said he wanted to go too, but Red was scared.
Red remembered what her mother had told her about the big bad wolf and she started to run. The wolf chased after her, but Red was too fast. When she got to her grandma's house, she told her what had happened. Her grandma said, "I knew that wolf was trouble. You did the right thing by running away."
From that day on, Red always remembered to be careful when she went through the forest. She never saw the attractive wolf again, but she knew that she had to be careful because there might be other wolves out there.
