Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go to the beach and surf with her dad. One day, they found a hidden spot where the waves were big and fun to ride. Lily admired her dad's surfing skills and wanted to be just like him.
But one day, while they were surfing, a big wave came and knocked Lily off her board. She tried to swim back to the surface, but the waves were too strong. Her dad tried to save her, but he got caught in the current too.
Sadly, they both drowned and never came back. The hidden spot where they surfed became a place of sadness and tears for those who knew them.
