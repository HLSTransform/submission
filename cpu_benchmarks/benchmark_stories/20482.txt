Timmy was a very curious boy. He loved exploring his house and finding new things. One day, he was playing in the living room when he heard a loud noise coming from outside. It was so loud that it made Timmy jump! He went to the front door and saw that it was his mom's friend, Connie. She had come to invite them all to her house for dinner.
Timmy and his family went to Connie's house and had a wonderful time. They laughed, they ate, and they even played some games! When it was time to go home, Connie said goodbye and showed them to the exit.
Once outside, Timmy noticed that the noise he heard earlier was coming from a truck. It had a loud horn. Timmy wanted to ask Connie why the truck was so loud, but by then it was too late. He waved goodbye to Connie and went home with his family. But Timmy knew he would want to visit Connie's house again soon.
