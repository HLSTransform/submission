Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she saw her friend Timmy with a rabbit. It was so cute! Lily loved the rabbit and wanted to play with it. She asked Timmy if she could borrow the rabbit, but Timmy was nervous to let her take it. 
Lily promised to take good care of the rabbit and not to hurt it. She said she would bring it back as soon as she was done playing with it. Timmy finally agreed and let her borrow the rabbit. 
Lily had so much fun playing with the rabbit! She gave it carrots to eat and cuddled with it. When it was time to return the rabbit, Lily thanked Timmy for letting her borrow it. She promised to ask for permission next time before taking anything that wasn't hers.
