Ben and Mia are playing with blocks in their room. They like to build towers and houses and cars with the blocks. Ben is very proud of his big tower. He says to Mia, "Look at my tower! It is so tall and strong!"
Mia looks at Ben's tower and feels jealous. She wants to have a big tower too, but she only has a few blocks left. She thinks of a bad idea. She says to Ben, "Can I see your tower? It is so nice!"
Ben smiles and says, "Sure, you can see it. But be careful, do not touch it. It might fall down."
Mia nods and pretends to be nice. She walks closer to Ben's tower and waits for him to look away. When he is not looking, she pushes the tower with her hand. The tower falls down and makes a loud noise. The blocks scatter all over the floor.
Ben hears the noise and turns around. He sees his tower destroyed and his blocks everywhere. He feels very angry and sad. He shouts at Mia, "Why did you do that? You are a bad sister! You ruined my tower!"
Mia laughs and says, "I did it because I wanted to. Your tower was boring. Now the floor is more fun!"
Ben starts to cry and runs to their mom. He tells her what Mia did. Mom comes to their room and sees the mess. She scolds Mia and makes her pick up the blocks. She says to Mia, "You should not destroy your brother's things. That is very mean and naughty. You should say sorry to Ben and share your blocks with him."
Mia feels sorry and ashamed. She says sorry to Ben and gives him some of her blocks. She helps him rebuild his tower. Ben forgives her and lets her play with his tower. They hug and make up. They play nicely with the blocks until it is time for dinner. Their room is not empty anymore. It is full of blocks and love.
