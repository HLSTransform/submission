Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a big medal. He was very proud of his medal. He won it for being good at running. Tim loved to show his medal to his friends.
One day, a girl named Sue saw Tim's medal. Sue wanted the medal too. She thought, "I will steal the medal when Tim is not looking." So, when Tim was playing, Sue took the medal and ran away.
Tim saw that his medal was gone. He was very sad. He asked his friend, "Did you see my medal?" His friend said, "Yes, Sue took it." Tim went to Sue and said, "Please give me back my medal. Stealing is not nice."
Sue felt bad. She said, "I am sorry, Tim. I will not steal again." She gave the medal back to Tim. Tim was happy to have his medal back. Sue learned that stealing is wrong and it is better to ask for something than to take it without asking.
And from that day on, Sue never stole again. She learned to be kind and ask for things. Tim and Sue became good friends. They played together and had lots of fun. The moral of the story is, "Stealing is wrong, and it is better to ask for something than to take it without asking."
