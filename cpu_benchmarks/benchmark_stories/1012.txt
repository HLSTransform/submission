Once upon a time there was a boy who wanted to play basketball. He begged his mum and dad to come outside and play with him. He said please, please, please!
His mum and dad said OK and they all went outside. The boy had a very long basketball. It was way bigger than his mum and dad's!
He dribbled the basketball up and down the long driveway. He tried to run very fast, but he kept tripping over the basketball!
His mum and dad laughed a lot and they said, "It's OK! You'll get better at dribbling the basketball."
The boy smiled and kept trying, until he was very tired. He gave the big, long basketball one more try and finally he succeeded! He dribbled all the way up the driveway, triumphantly!
Mum and dad cheered and said, "Well done! You kept trying and now you know how to dribble the basketball."
The boy felt very proud of himself and smiled a big smile. He was so happy to have finally succeeded in dribbling the long basketball.
