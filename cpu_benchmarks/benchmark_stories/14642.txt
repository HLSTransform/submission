Mommy was teaching. She wanted to show me something. It was dark as night outside. We went out and my mommy taught me how to count with the stars. She showed me how to look for the brightest one and then count slowly up to five. After that, we went inside and Mommy taught me how to draw the numbers too. She showed me the shapes and how to make them. I practiced until bedtime. 
Mommy said I was a good student and she gave me a hug. She said I was doing a good job and she was proud of me. It made me feel happy. I couldn't wait to learn more from my mommy soon.
