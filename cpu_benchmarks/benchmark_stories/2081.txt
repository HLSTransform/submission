Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very lonely because he didn't have any friends to play with. One day, Timmy went outside to play and saw a bird in his backyard. The bird looked very sad and Timmy wanted to help.
Timmy asked the bird, "Why are you sad?" The bird said, "I can't find any gas to fly." Timmy wanted to help the bird, so he went inside his house and got some bread to give to the bird. The bird ate the bread and felt better.
Suddenly, a bad guy came to Timmy's backyard and wanted to shoot the bird. Timmy was scared, but he knew he had to protect his new friend. Timmy yelled, "Stop! Don't shoot the bird!" The bad guy ran away and the bird flew away happily. Timmy felt happy too because he made a new friend. The end.
