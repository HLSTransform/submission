Once upon a time, there was a big snowstorm. It started snowing and snowing, and the snow was so deep that it blocked the path of the little rabbit. The rabbit couldn't find shelter to protect herself, so she started hopping around in the snow, looking for something warm.
Finally, she saw a gentle light in the distance. She hopped closer, and soon she noticed an old tree with a little shelter underneath it. There was a kind old fox inside the shelter, slowly melting the snow with a lantern.
The fox was very gentle and friendly. He let the little rabbit sleep comfortably in his shelter and even shared some of his food with her. As the snow melted and the sun came out, the little rabbit smiled with joy and thanked the fox for his kindness and protection. The fox smiled back, and the little rabbit happily hopped away.
