Once there was a wise old fox who was taking a walk in the forest. As he walked, he came across two bears who were discussing something. The fox curiously asked what they were discussing.
The bears told the fox that they were trying to decide who should get the pick that was in the meadow. The fox saw that the pick was a very nice one, so he asked the bears why they couldn't both have it. 
The bears said that it would not be fair if one bear got the pick but the other didn't. The fox nodded and agreed with them. He then told the bears that it would be best if they would both come to a solution that would be fair and would also have a good moral value.
After thinking for a moment, the bears agreed that the best solution was for neither of them to take the pick. The fox smiled and discussed with them why it was important to be fair and not do bad things. The bears agreed and decided the best thing to do was to leave the pick in the meadow. They bid farewell and the fox smiled, knowing that he had taught the bears a valuable lesson.
