Once upon a time, there lived a little girl. She was 3 years old and was always very happy. One day, she went to the park with her mama and daddy. 
She looked around and found a big green ball. She was so excited! She picked it up and gave it a hug and a kiss. It was very mild, so it made her happy. 
Next, she found a green frog. She was so curious because she had never seen one before. She bent down low and looked closely and it was mild too. 
Finally, she found a big green tree. She clapped her hands in excitement and ran to it. She gave it a big hug and couldn't believe how mild it felt. 
The little girl was so happy! She couldn't believe how many different green things she had found. She was now sure that green was the best color ever.
