Once upon a time there was a deaf cat. He lived in a big city, but he was very lonely. One day, he decided to go on an adventure! Everywhere he went he looked for something to make him happy. 
The cat walked for many days, until one day he saw something ahead - an oasis! It looked so beautiful and he could see birds swimming and singing around it. So the cat stopped for a rest.
He tasted the water and it was delicious. He jumped in the water, drinking and swimming until he was filled with joy. The cat was now so happy.
The days went by and the cat continued to explore, but he always came back to the oasis to fill his heart with joy. The cat couldn't believe how lucky he was to find such a special place. He was one happy deaf cat!
