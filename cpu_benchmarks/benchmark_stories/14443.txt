Once upon a time, there was a car. It was old and made lots of strange noises. One day, it stopped moving. The owner took the car to a mechanic. The mechanic looked at the car and said it was very broken. He said it would be expensive to fix the car.
The mechanic loaded the car onto a big truck. He drove the truck to his garage. He worked on the car for many days. He had to fix a lot of broken stuff inside the car.
Finally, the mechanic said the car was ready. The owner was very happy. The car drove like new again! The owner thanked the mechanic, even though it was expensive.
