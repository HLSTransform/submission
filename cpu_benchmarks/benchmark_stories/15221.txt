One day, a little girl named Lucy was playing with her toy box. She had many toys, but her favorite was a big red screw. She loved to hold it and pretend it was a magic wand. Lucy's little brother, Tim, saw her playing and wanted to play with the screw too. He asked, "Can I play with the screw, please?" Lucy didn't want to share, so she said, "No, it's mine!" Tim was upset.
Tim went to their mom and told her that Lucy wouldn't share the screw. Mom said, "Lucy, you need to share your toys with your brother." Lucy was upset, but she gave the screw to Tim. Tim was happy and started to play with it.
After a while, Lucy felt bad for not sharing with her brother. She went to Tim and said, "I'm sorry for not sharing. Can we play together?" Tim smiled and said, "Yes, let's play!" They played with the screw and had lots of fun. When it was time for bed, Lucy gave Tim a big kiss and said, "I love you, little brother." Tim hugged her and said, "I love you too, big sister." They went to bed happy, knowing that sharing was more fun than keeping the toys all to themselves.
