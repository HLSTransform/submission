Once upon a time, there was a young girl who wanted to help out some of her friends. She had a great idea on how to unite the youth in her community! She thought of an easy way to do this.
She hosted a fun event. Everyone was excited to come! She asked them to play some games, do some dancing, and eat some yummy snacks.
The youths quickly became friends. They had fun together, faster than they could ever imagine.
Thanks to the young girl, the youths in her community were now united and they would always stay connected. The end!
