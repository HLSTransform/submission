Once upon a time there was a little boy called John who went to the park with his mum. He was very excited and began to run around. Suddenly he stumbled over and hit the ground. He started to cry, making his mum angry.
Mum said, "Stop crying! Look I brought you a sandwich to make you feel better."
John was happy, he took a bite but then he made a face.
"What's wrong?" asked Mum.
John said, "It tastes disgusting!"
Mum smiled and said, "It's ok, take it home for later."
John reluctantly agreed, and took the sandwich home. Later that night, he opened it and saw that it was full of ants! He screamed and started to cry again.
Mum came running in. Seeing what had happened, she said, "Oh no, unfortunately the sandwich was too disgusting to eat after all!"
