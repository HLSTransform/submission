Once upon a time, there were two best friends. Their names were Mike and Jane. Every day, they would play together. One day, Mike mentioned to Jane that he had seen an alligator in the forest. Jane was scared but Mike told her not to worry.
The two friends decided to go and find the alligator. When they arrived, the alligator was very big and Mike thought it was funny. He started to laugh, but Jane said: "Don't laugh! Alligators are not funny. They can be dangerous".
At that moment, both friends remembered that they should never get too close to an alligator. They both promised each other to always be careful when they went exploring.
The moral of the story is: Whenever you explore new places, always stay safe and be careful!
