Once there was a big and perfect trumpet. The trumpet was so beautiful that it was difficult to look away. One day, a little girl named Anna was admiring the trumpet when she pushed it lightly, and it shut! Anna was very surprised and didn't know what to do. She looked around, but no one was there to help. She felt sad and alone, thinking that she had ruined the perfect trumpet.
Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. Anna looked around and saw an old man with a trumpet of his own. He said hello and asked if Anna was looking for a friend. Anna said yes and, to her surprise, the old man said he could help. He asked her to help him find some special stones.
Anna ran around the garden and soon found all the special stones. The old man smiled and said that now they had enough to fix the trumpet. He took some of the stones and told Anna to blow into the trumpet. When Anna blew, the trumpet made a beautiful, loud sound. Anna and the old man smiled - the trumpet was perfect again!
