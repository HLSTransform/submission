Lily and Tom were playing in the garden. They saw a big tree with many fruits. They wanted to try some.
"Look, Tom, there are apples and pears and oranges. Can we pick some?" Lily asked.
"I don't know, Lily. Maybe they belong to someone. Maybe they are not good to eat," Tom said.
But Lily was curious. She climbed the tree and reached for a red apple. She bit it and smiled.
"Mmm, this is yummy, Tom. You should try it too," she said.
Tom climbed the tree too and picked a green pear. He bit it and made a face.
"Yuck, this is sour, Lily. I don't like it," he said.
He threw the pear away and looked for another fruit. He saw a yellow fruit that looked like a banana, but had a strange shape. He peeled it and tasted it.
"Wow, this is sweet and juicy, Lily. You should try it too," he said.
Lily came closer and looked at the yellow fruit. She had never seen it before. It was mysterious.
"What is it, Tom? What is the name of this fruit?" she asked.
"I don't know, Lily. Maybe it is a new fruit. Maybe it is a magic fruit," Tom said.
They shared the yellow fruit and enjoyed it. They felt happy and full.
"Thank you, tree, for giving us these fruits. They are delicious," Lily said.
"Yes, thank you, tree. You are very kind," Tom said.
They climbed down the tree and ran back to their house. They told their mom and dad about the fruits they found. Their mom and dad smiled and hugged them.
"That's wonderful, Lily and Tom. You are very lucky to find such fruits. Do you know what the yellow fruit was?" their mom asked.
They shook their heads.
"It was a mango, Lily and Tom. A mango is a tropical fruit that grows in warm places. It is very rare to find one here. You must have found a very special tree," their dad said.
Lily and Tom looked at each other and smiled. They wondered what other fruits the tree had. They decided to visit it again tomorrow. They hoped to find more mysterious fruits.
