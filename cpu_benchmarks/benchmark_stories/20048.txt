Once upon a time, there was a little birdie who lived in a pine tree. The pine tree was very tall and had lots of green leaves. The little birdie loved to fly around and play with his friends.
One day, a big gray cloud came in the sky. The cloud looked very angry and made the little birdie scared. The little birdie knew that the cloud might bring rain, so he flew to his nest to stay safe.
But the rain was very heavy and the wind was very strong. The little birdie's nest was not strong enough to protect him. Suddenly, a big bolt of lightning hit the pine tree and made it fall down. The little birdie was trapped under the tree and couldn't fly away. 
The little birdie's friends came to help him, but they couldn't lift the heavy tree. They knew they needed someone strong to deliver the little birdie from under the tree. Sadly, they couldn't find anyone in time and the little birdie couldn't be saved.
