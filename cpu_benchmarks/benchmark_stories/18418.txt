Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore and play outside. One day, she went on a search for her favorite toy, a teddy bear. She looked in her room and in the living room, but she couldn't find it.
Lily's mom asked her what was wrong and Lily told her about her missing teddy bear. Her mom suggested they search the house together. They looked under the bed and in the closet, but still no teddy bear.
Suddenly, Lily pointed to a regular chair in the corner of the room. There was her teddy bear, sitting on the chair! Lily was so happy to have found her favorite toy and gave her mom a big hug for helping her search. From then on, Lily made sure to always keep her teddy bear close by.
