Billy was a three year old boy who loved to dream. He told his mom he wanted to have a pet parrot. She said “oh Billy that’s a lovely idea."
Billy went to the pet shop and saw some friendly parrots. He asked the shopkeeper “Can I have this one?”. The shopkeeper smiled and said “Of course you can!”
Billy was so happy and he took his new parrot home. He named him Max and he was a friendly parrot.
Billy talked to Max every night about all his dreams. He told Max about his dreams of becoming a superhero and travelling to the stars. Max listened and chirped along. 
Billy loved to dream with Max by his side.
