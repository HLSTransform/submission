Once there was a lively little girl called Lola who enjoyed playing in her garden. Every morning, Lola would venture out to discover something new and it made her very happy.
One day when Lola was in her garden she spotted a leaf that had fallen off a tree. It was yellow and orange and so very pretty. Lola decided she wanted to see what would happen if she picked it up.
So she yielded to her curiosity and gently picked up the leaf. She found that when she squeezed it, the leaf crumbled and became smaller. She also noticed that its colour seemed to become brighter and more lively. Lola was so excited she ran around in circles and laughed with delight.
From that day onwards, Lola would often yield to her curiosity and pick up any leaves that had fallen from the trees in the garden. She found it fascinating how the colour of the leaves changed when she squeezed them. It was the most fun that Lola had ever experienced.
