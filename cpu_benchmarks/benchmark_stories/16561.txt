Lily and Max are twins. They like to play with machines. They have cars, trains, robots and planes. They make noises and move them around.
One day, they find a big machine in the garage. It is shiny and has buttons and wheels. They want to play with it.
"Look, Max, a new machine!" Lily says. "Let's see what it does."
"No, Lily, I saw it first. It is mine!" Max says. He pushes Lily away and climbs on the machine.
Lily is sad and angry. She wants to play too. She thinks Max is not fair. She pulls his leg and tries to make him fall.
"Stop, Lily, you are hurting me!" Max shouts. He kicks Lily and holds on to the machine.
They fight and cry. They are very competitive. They do not share.
Dad hears the noise and comes to the garage. He sees Lily and Max on the machine. He is surprised and worried.
"What are you doing, kids?" he asks. "This is not a toy. This is a lawn mower. It is dangerous. You could get hurt."
He lifts them off the machine and hugs them. He explains that the machine is for cutting grass, not for playing. He tells them to be careful and to be nice to each other.
Lily and Max are sorry. They say sorry to Dad and to each other. They hug and make up.
They decide to play with their own machines. They share and take turns. They have fun and laugh. They are happy.
