Once upon a time, there was a bunny who lived in a nice green field. The bunny was very happy living there, but sometimes he got a bit envious of all the other animals. He wished he could be like them and fly, or even better, to climb like a monkey! One day the bunny noticed a huge cliff in the distance. He was so excited about seeing it and his heart skipped a beat. 
He hopped over to the cliff and looked up. It was so high, he could hardly see the top! It was intimidating yet also enticing. He wondered if he could ever climb it. After a short pause he hopped to the edge of the cliff and looked at the bottom. He took a deep breath, it looked quite far down.
The bunny hopped back, took another pause and then decided to go for it. He started hopping along the cliff, looking for rocks and footholds to help him up. After a while, a little bird saw him hopping and stopped to watch. She was envious of the bunny and wished she had the courage to be so brave and explore.
The bunny kept hopping and soon he was near the top. He was thrilled! He had conquered the cliff! He heard the little bird tweeting and cheered proudly that he had made it to the top. The little bird flew away, happy for the bunny but now even more envious of his courage.
