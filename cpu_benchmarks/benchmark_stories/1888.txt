Once upon a time there was a shy king who ruled over a kingdom. In his kingdom he had recorders who wrote down everything the king said and did. One day the king was feeling very shy and he decided to hide. He tried to make sure no one could find him. Suddenly one of the recorders noticed the king had gone missing and he declared an alert. The entire kingdom searched everywhere but they could not find the king. Everyone was getting worried. After days of searching the kingdom finally found the king! He had been hiding in the nearby forest. The recorders were overjoyed and they quickly got to work and recorded all the events of the king's disappearance. The kingdom was relieved and the shy king vowed to never hide again.
