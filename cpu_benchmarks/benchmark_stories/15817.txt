Once upon a time there was an intelligent fox who loved to roam around his forest home. One day he stumbled upon a wide open space in the middle of his home. He noticed the ground was particularly soft and yielding. As he dug and pawed, he found a hidden gem buried just beneath the surface!
He was so excited that he decided to let his friends know about the treasure he had found. The fox immediately ran off to find them.
Not far away, the fox encountered a sly and slyly sly little rabbit. The rabbit asked the fox where he was going in such a hurry. The fox replied with excitement, “I found a secret treasure and I am going to share it with my friends!”
The rabbit appeared interested, so the fox offered to let her come along. The fox and the rabbit quickly ran back to the treasure and the fox began to share it with the others.
The ground yielded so many wonderful gems, enough for everyone to have some. The fox and all of his friends were overjoyed and thanked the rabbit for showing them the way.
From that day forward, the fox and the rabbit became great friends, helping each other whenever they could. They also remembered the importance of sharing and always used their intelligence to do good things for the forest home.
