Sara and Ben are kids who like to play with blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes. They can build towers, houses, cars and animals with their blocks.
One day, they are playing in Sara's room. Sara has a big box of blocks and Ben has a small bag of blocks. Sara says, "Look, Ben, I can make a tall tower with my blocks. How high can you make yours?"
Ben tries to make a tower with his blocks, but he does not have enough. He says, "I only have a few blocks, Sara. I cannot make a high tower like you."
Sara sees that Ben is sad. She is a generous kid. She says, "You can use some of my blocks, Ben. I have many blocks. We can share and make towers together."
Ben smiles and says, "Thank you, Sara. You are very kind. Can I have some red blocks? I like red."
Sara nods and gives Ben some red blocks. They start to build towers with their blocks. They are happy and have fun.
But then, Sara's cat jumps on the bed. The cat sees the towers and thinks they are toys. The cat paws at the towers and makes them fall. The blocks drop on the floor and make a loud noise.
Sara and Ben are surprised and say, "Oh no! The cat dropped our towers!"
They look at the cat and see that it is playing with the blocks. The cat does not know that it did something bad. The cat looks cute and happy.
Sara and Ben are not angry. They are good kids. They say, "It's okay, cat. We can make new towers. But please be careful next time."
They pick up the blocks and start to build again. They share their blocks and help each other. They are generous and friendly kids. They love to play with blocks and with the cat.
