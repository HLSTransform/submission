Once upon a time there was a gloomy town. Everyone in the town did the same trade. They polished rocks.
Every day they woke up early and went to the rock shop. They were very good at their trade. They could make a shiny rock from a dull one.
But one day the townspeople encountered a problem. There were no dull rocks left! All the rocks had been polished so much that they were too shiny.
The townspeople started to worry. What kind of trade could they do if there were no dull rocks?
Then one day a happy little girl came to town. She loved rocks and knew how to make a dull rock from a shiny one. She showed the townspeople how to do it.
Everyone was happy again. They could now do their trade again. The town returned to its former glory with shiny rocks. Everyone was thankful to the girl!
