One day, a little cat named Velvet went to play outside. Velvet was a serious cat who always did the right thing. She loved to take walks in the park and play with her friends.
While walking, Velvet met a big dog named Max. Max said, "Velvet, let's play a game. I will take your toy, and you try to get it back." Velvet thought about it and said, "Okay, Max. But we must play nice and be kind to each other."
They played the game, and Max took Velvet's toy. Velvet tried to get it back, but Max was too fast. Velvet felt sad, but she didn't give up. She asked Max, "Can we play another game where we both have fun?" Max agreed, and they played a new game together.
In the end, Velvet and Max had a great time playing together. They learned that it's important to be kind and play games that everyone can enjoy. And Velvet learned that sometimes, it's okay to ask for a change if something isn't fun for everyone.
