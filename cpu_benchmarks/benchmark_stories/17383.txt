One day, Ben and Lily went to the zoo with their mom. They saw many animals, like monkeys, lions, and elephants. They were very happy and excited.
"Look, mom, a rhinoceros!" Ben shouted, pointing at a big gray animal with a horn on its nose. "It is so big and strong!"
"Yes, it is, Ben. Do you know what it eats?" mom asked.
"Grass?" Lily guessed.
"Good try, Lily, but no. It eats leaves and twigs and fruits. It is a herbivore, like a cow or a deer," mom explained.
"Can we feed it, mom?" Ben asked.
"Sorry, Ben, we can't. The zookeepers feed the animals. We can only watch them from a distance," mom said.
Ben and Lily nodded. They watched the rhinoceros for a while. It was walking around its enclosure, looking for food. Sometimes it made a loud snort.
"Mom, what is that smell?" Lily asked, wrinkling her nose.
"That is the rhinoceros, Lily. It is very smelly. It does not take a bath very often. It likes to roll in the mud and the dirt," mom said.
"Yuck! I don't like smelly animals. I like clean animals, like cats and dogs," Lily said.
"Me too, Lily. But we have to respect the rhinoceros. It is a wild animal. It lives differently than us," mom said.
"OK, mom. I respect the rhinoceros, but I don't want to hug it," Lily said.
"Me neither, Lily. Let's go see the other animals. We have to complete our zoo tour before it gets dark," mom said.
"OK, mom. Let's go!" Ben and Lily said.
They followed their mom to the next exhibit. They had a lot of fun at the zoo. They learned a lot about different animals. They saw a smelly rhinoceros, but they did not hug it.
