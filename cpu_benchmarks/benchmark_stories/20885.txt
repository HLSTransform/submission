Once upon a time there was a little girl called Jane. She was three years old and she loved cocoa. Every morning, she would call out for her mum in a squeaky voice, "Mummy, cocoa please!" And then her mum would make a nice warm cup of cocoa for her.
Today Jane wanted to do something important. She called her mum and said, "Mum, I have something important to do. Can I have some cocoa to help me?" Her mum said yes and made a big cup of cocoa and took it up to Jane's bedroom.
Jane sipped her cocoa slowly, savouring each sip. She felt so special and important drinking it. She was sure that her cocoa would help her to do a really important job.
When Jane had finished her cocoa, she set to work. She worked really hard, and the important job was done. Jane felt so proud of herself. She thanked her mum for helping her with the cocoa. From then on she knew that a cup of cocoa could help her do anything important!
