Lily and Ben are playing with their toys in the living room. Lily has a shiny red car and Ben has a big yellow truck. They like to make noises and pretend they are driving.
"Look at my car, Ben!" Lily says. "It is so shiny and fast!"
"My truck is better, Lily!" Ben says. "It is so big and strong!"
They start to argue about whose toy is better. They do not want to share or play together.
Lily has an idea. She sees a bottle of polish on the table. She thinks it will make her car even shinier and faster. She grabs the bottle and pours some polish on her car.
"Ha ha, Ben!" Lily says. "Now my car is the best!"
But the polish is not for cars. It is for wood. It makes Lily's car sticky and dirty. It does not look shiny or fast anymore. It looks silly and sad.
Lily starts to cry. She ruined her car. She wishes she did not use the polish.
Ben laughs at Lily. He thinks she is silly and mean. He does not want to play with her anymore. He takes his truck and goes to his room.
Lily is alone in the living room. She has no car and no friend. She feels sorry and sad. She wishes she did not have that idea.
