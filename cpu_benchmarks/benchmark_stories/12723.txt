One day, a brave little soldier was walking in the forest. Suddenly, a huge wind came and pushed him over. He felt so guilty for letting the wind push him over. He tried to stand up and keep walking.
Just then, an old man appeared from behind a tree. He said to the soldier, "Why do you feel guilty? We can all be pushed over sometimes - it doesn't mean anything."
The soldier smiled. He appreciated the old man's advice. He said, "Thank you. I'm feeling better now."
But then another strong wind came and pushed the soldier down again. This time he couldn't get up. All his strenght was gone. The old man looked worried. He said, "Little soldier, I think it's time for you to go home." 
The little soldier sadly nodded. He knew his adventure in the forest had come to an end. He slowly turned and walked away.
The old man watched as the little soldier walked away. His heart felt heavy and he felt guilty - he knew he should have done something more to help. But it was too late. The little soldier was gone forever.
