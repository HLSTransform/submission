Once upon a time, there was a friendly cat. The cat liked to play near the hedge. One day, the cat saw a little bird on the ground. The bird could not fly. The cat went to the bird and said, "Do you need help?"
The bird said, "Yes, I need help. I cannot fly." The friendly cat wanted to help the bird. The cat tried to lift the bird with its paws, but it was not strong enough. The cat thought of a plan. The cat would find a big stick for the bird to hold on to. Then, the cat could carry the stick with the bird on it.
The cat looked for a big stick near the hedge. The cat found a big stick and brought it to the bird. The bird held on to the stick. The cat started to carry the stick with the bird on it. But the cat was not careful. The cat tripped on a rock and dropped the stick. The bird fell down and got hurt. The friendly cat felt sad because it could not help the bird. The cat learned to be more careful when helping others.
