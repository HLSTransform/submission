Once upon a time, a bird wanted to fly high in the sky. It had pretty feathers and was very graceful. The bird wanted to show off its beauty to all the other animals. So, it took off and flew higher and higher.
But suddenly, a big wind came and the bird couldn't fly anymore. It started to fall down, down, down. A cat saw the bird falling and quickly ran to take it in its paws.
The bird was hurt and couldn't fly anymore. It was very sad and missed flying high in the sky. From that day on, the bird stayed on the ground and never flew again.
