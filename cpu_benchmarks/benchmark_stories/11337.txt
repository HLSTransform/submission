Once upon a time there was a little boy who loved music. He would take out his music box every day and attach it to his belt with a strong string. He would go around the village, playing his music and people enjoyed the charming sound. 
One day, he came by a little girl's house who was playing all by herself in her garden. The little boy said, "I have something that will make you happy!" He took out his music box and showed it to her. 
The little girl was delighted by the sound and asked, "Can I have it?" 
The little boy thought about it for a moment, but then said, "No, but you can play it every day if you like!" The little girl was very happy and thanked the little boy before he walked away.
