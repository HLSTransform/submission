One day, Luke was walking in the woods. He saw a fire and decided to join it. He was very excited. He watched the flames dance. He clapped his hands with enthusiasm and sang along with the birds. 
Then he saw his friend Alice walking towards him. She saw the fire, too, and decided to join Luke. She was very enthusiastic as she watched the flames. Together, they watched the fire burn. 
They got closer to the fire and felt the heat. They talked about their day, dried wet socks and drank hot cocoa. They stayed with the fire, until it was time to go home. 
The friends said goodbye and thanked the fire for keeping them warm all day. They skipped away through the woods, looking forward to their next adventure together.
