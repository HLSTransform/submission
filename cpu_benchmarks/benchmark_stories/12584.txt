Lily liked to dance. She danced in her room, in the garden, and in the kitchen. She danced with her dolls, her dog, and her mom. She danced when she was happy, when she was sad, and when she was bored.
One day, Lily saw a big ladder in the garage. It was brown and tall and had many steps. Lily wanted to climb the ladder and see what was on top. She thought maybe there was a secret place or a treasure or a new friend.
She asked her mom if she could climb the ladder. Her mom said no. She said the ladder was not for kids. She said it was dangerous and Lily could fall and hurt herself. She said Lily should play with her toys or read a book or dance.
But Lily did not listen. She waited until her mom was busy and sneaked into the garage. She grabbed the ladder and dragged it to the wall. She put one foot on the first step and then the other. She felt brave and curious. She climbed higher and higher.
She reached the top of the ladder and looked around. She saw a big box with a bow. She wondered what was inside. She reached for the box and tried to open it. But the box was heavy and the ladder was shaky. Lily lost her balance and the ladder tipped over. Lily screamed and the box fell on the floor.
Her mom heard the noise and ran to the garage. She saw Lily on the ground and the box next to her. She was scared and angry. She hugged Lily and checked if she was hurt. She was not hurt, but she was scared and sorry.
She said to Lily, "Why did you climb the ladder? I told you not to. You could have been hurt. You were very naughty."
Lily said to her mom, "I'm sorry, mom. I wanted to see what was in the box. I thought it was a surprise for me."
Her mom said to Lily, "The box was a surprise for you. It was a new dress for you to dance in. But you spoiled the surprise and the dress. Now you can't have it."
Lily cried and said to her mom, "I'm sorry, mom. I love you. Can I still dance with you?"
Her mom said to Lily, "I love you too. You can still dance with me. But you have to promise me to never climb the ladder again. And you have to be a good girl and listen to me."
Lily said to her mom, "I promise, mom. I will be a good girl and listen to you. And I will dance with you."
Her mom said to Lily, "Okay, then. Let's go and dance in the kitchen. But first, let's put the ladder away and clean up the mess."
They put the ladder away and cleaned up the mess. Then they went to the kitchen and danced. Lily was happy and her mom was happy. They danced and laughed and hugged. They forgot about the box and the dress. They only cared about each other.
