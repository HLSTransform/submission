Tommy was a smart 3 year old, much smarter than other children his age. He saw the world in his own special way. When his parents asked him to come with them to the park, he said yes. 
As they drove up to the park, Tommy noticed a big camera up in a tree. He asked his parents what it was and why it was there. His dad said, "It's a camera, Tommy. It was put there to take pictures of people in the park." 
When Tommy and his parents reached the park, Tommy spotted the camera again. But this time, he noticed something different. He saw people suffering, carrying heavy bags and struggling up the path. 
Tommy asked his dad what was going on. His dad smiled sadly and explained, "Those people are suffering because they have to carry heavy things. That camera is here to make sure they're following the rules." 
Tommy's dad gave him a hug and said, "You're so smart for understanding this." Tommy realized that the camera was there to help the people in the park, not to make them suffer.
