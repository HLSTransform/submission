Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to travel with her family. One day, they went on a trip to a faraway place. Lily was very excited to see new things.
At night, Lily's mom lit a candle in their room. Lily watched the candle flicker and dance. She wanted to play with the candle, but her mom said no. Lily felt anxious because she really wanted to touch the candle.
The next morning, Lily woke up to a bad smell. The candle had fallen over and started a fire. Everyone had to leave the hotel and go home early. Lily learned that it's important to listen to her mom and not play with dangerous things like candles.
