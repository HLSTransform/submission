Once upon a time there was an elephant. He liked to rock in his favourite chair every day. He thought rocking was fun and it made him feel cozy.
One morning he felt extra hungry. He wanted something yummy to eat. He rocked back and forth in his chair to think about what he wanted. He began to smell something delicious!
He looked around and saw a big bowl of yummy apples. He couldnâ€™t believe his eyes. He got up and hopped over to the apples. He grabbed a few and began to eat. They were so yummy that he ate them all!
He felt happy and full. He went back to his chair, rocked and felt content.
