Once upon a time there was a girl named Daisy. Daisy was three years old and liked to study things. 
One day, Daisy was exploring her neighbourhood when she found a mysterious mall. She couldn't believe her eyes! It seemed like a magical place, full of things to explore and learn.
Daisy was excited and wanted to study the mall. She walked around looking at everything, noticing the colourful lights and wondering what was inside all the shops.
Eventually, she met someone in the mall who showed her how to play a game. Daisy was so excited to play and learn about the mall. She was also learning about colours and shapes and having lots of fun.
Daisy spent the next few days studying the mysterious mall. She made lots of new friends and explored all the different shops. Daisy even learned a few new things like counting and matching.
Daisy had the best time studying the mall and learning lots of new things. She was always so excited to go back and explore more.
