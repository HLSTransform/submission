Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. Jack was very happy and he liked to help his mom and dad.
One day Jack saw a very special season. It was called spring and everything was so colourful. There were flowers growing in the garden and the birds were singing.
Jack wanted to help. He found a fence and he helped to mend it. He helped to pick up the leaves and he helped to plant some new flowers in the garden.
The air was warm and Jack was getting sleepy. He went to bed and had a long, deep sleep.
When Jack woke up he decided to help one more time. He went to the garden with his mom and they planted some new seeds. They said they would grow soon and it would make the garden even more colourful.
Jack was so proud when he saw their work. It was such a nice feeling to help in the garden. He felt so happy and it was a very special spring for him.
