Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to decorate her room with pretty things. One day, Lily wanted to decorate her bed with a new sheet. She looked and looked but couldn't find a sheet that she liked. 
Then, her mommy came to help her. She found a sheet that was very hard and said, "This sheet will be perfect for your bed!" Lily wasn't sure at first, but her mommy said they could decorate it together. 
So, they got some stickers and put them all over the sheet. It was so pretty! Lily was very happy with her new decorated sheet and slept very well that night. From then on, Lily loved to decorate everything with stickers and other pretty things. The end.
