Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Susie who wanted to go on an adventure. So she packed her special bag full of exciting things and set off. On her way, she found a beautiful red flower, a screw and a shiny penny. She put them inside her bag and happily skipped along.
Soon, Susie reached her destination: a beautiful park. It was filled with lots of trees, flowers and birds. She explored the park, collecting more treasures like pebbles and leaves. She also found a hedgehog and helped it back home. 
When it was time to leave, Susie packed her bag with all of her treasures. She took one last look at the beautiful park and smiled, before setting off on her way back home.
