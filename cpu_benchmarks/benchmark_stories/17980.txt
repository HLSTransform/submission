One day, a boy named Tim wanted to play with his long kayak. He went to the big lake near his house. Tim loved to paddle his kayak on the water. He saw his friend, Sue, near the lake too. Sue was sad because she forgot her toy boat at home.
Tim said, "Don't be sad, Sue. You can play with my kayak." Sue smiled and said, "Thank you, Tim!" They both played with the long kayak. They had a lot of fun.
But then, the wind blew the kayak far away. Tim and Sue were sad. They didn't know how to get the kayak back. Tim had an idea. He said, "We can use a long stick to reach the kayak!" They found a long stick and got the kayak back. Tim and Sue were happy again. They played with the kayak all day long, and they never forgot to be careful with it again.
