One day, there was a boy who wanted to write. He went outside and saw a pigeon. The pigeon was very useful. The boy wrote a message on a paper and tied it to the pigeon's foot.
The pigeon took the paper and flew up into the sky. The boy was very happy.
After a while, the pigeon came back with a reply to the boy's message. The boy was even happier. He opened the paper and read the reply.
The pigeon was very useful. The boy was so happy that he wanted to write another message and send it with the pigeon. So he wrote a message and sent it with the pigeon again.
The boy learned that writing is a great way to communicate. He was very happy that the pigeon was so useful, and he thanked the pigeon for its help.
