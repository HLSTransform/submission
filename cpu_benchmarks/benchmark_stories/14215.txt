Once there was a nice lady. She was standing in a park, smiling at the birds and flowers. She wanted to hear them sing, so she started to repeat a song. The birds and flowers listened and they started to sing too.
It was so nice to hear the singing. The lady smiled and clapped her hands. She repeated the song again, and this time the birds and flowers sang even louder. They were so happy.
The nice lady enjoyed the singing. She was so happy that she repeated the song again and again. The birds and flowers kept singing for the lady and it made her feel so good! The lady thanked them for their beautiful singing and asked them to repeat the song again.
