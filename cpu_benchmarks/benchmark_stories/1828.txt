Jonny was very sad. He didn't know why, but he felt down. His mum asked him to come into the living room.
Jonny sat on the sofa and mum sat next to him. She asked him why he was feeling so sad. 
Jonny said he didn't know what to do.
Mum hugged Jonny and said "It's ok, we can spend some time together".
They spent the afternoon in the living room playing and talking about different things.
Jonny soon felt much happier. He gave his mum a big hug and said thank you for the time they spent together in the room.
