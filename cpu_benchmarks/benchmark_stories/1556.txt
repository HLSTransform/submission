Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty dress with buttons on it. One day, she was playing outside and she accidentally lost one of her buttons. She was so careless!
But then, her mommy found the lost button and fixed Lily's dress. Lily was very happy and wanted to celebrate. So, they had a party with cake and balloons. Lily even wore her pretty dress with all the buttons.
From that day on, Lily learned to be more careful and not lose her buttons again. And every time she wore her pretty dress, she remembered the fun party they had to celebrate the fixed button.
