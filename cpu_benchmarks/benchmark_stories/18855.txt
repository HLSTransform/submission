Lily liked to sing. She sang every day at home, at school, and with her friends. She had a nice voice that made people happy. She wanted to be a popular singer when she grew up.
One day, she saw a poster for a talent show. It said, "Do you have a special talent? Come and show it to everyone! You could win a prize!" Lily was excited. She wanted to join the talent show and sing her favorite song.
She told her mom and dad about the talent show. They said, "That's great, Lily! We are proud of you. You can do it!" They helped her practice her song and find a pretty dress to wear.
On the day of the talent show, Lily was nervous. She saw many other kids with different talents. Some could dance, some could play instruments, some could tell jokes. She wondered if anyone would like her singing.
When it was her turn, she walked on the stage and smiled. She saw her mom and dad in the audience. They waved and cheered for her. She felt brave. She took a deep breath and started to sing.
Her voice was clear and sweet. She sang with all her heart. She turned and moved with the music. She looked at the people and saw them smiling and clapping. She felt happy. She finished her song and bowed. The people gave her a big applause. She heard someone say, "Wow, she has a beautiful voice! She is a star!"
Lily ran to her mom and dad and hugged them. They said, "You were amazing, Lily! We are so proud of you! You have a wonderful talent!" Lily said, "Thank you, mom and dad! I love you! I love singing!"
She felt popular and happy. She had a nice voice and a nice dream. She wanted to sing more and more. She wanted to make people happy with her singing. She was a happy singer.
