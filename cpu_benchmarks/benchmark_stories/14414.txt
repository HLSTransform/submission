Once upon a time, there was a little bird who liked to fly high in the sky. One day, he saw a big, scary cat staring at him from below. The bird got scared and tried to fly away, but his wing got stuck in a tight tree branch. 
The cat saw this and slowly walked towards the bird. He tapped his paw on the ground, waiting for the bird to come down. The bird was too scared to move and just stared at the cat. 
Suddenly, the cat pounced on the bird and caught him in his mouth. The bird tried to escape, but it was too late. The cat had caught him and ate him for dinner. The end.
