Tom is a spoiled boy. He has many toys, but he does not share them with anyone. He always wants more and more. He does not know how to be happy.
One day, he sees a new toy in the store. It is a cell phone. It can make sounds and show pictures. Tom wants it very much. He asks his mom to buy it for him.
"Mom, mom, please buy me the cell phone. It is so cool. I need it. I need it."
"No, Tom, you have enough toys. You do not need a cell phone. It is not for little boys like you. It is for grown-ups who have to work and talk to other people."
"But mom, I want it. I want it. Please, please, please."
Tom starts to cry and scream. He throws a tantrum. He kicks and hits his mom. He does not listen to her. He is very rude and mean.
Mom is very angry and sad. She does not like how Tom behaves. She decides to teach him a lesson. She does not buy him the cell phone. She takes him home and puts him in his room. She does not let him play with any of his toys. She tells him to think about what he did.
"Tom, you are a spoiled boy. You do not know how to be grateful and kind. You do not know how to respect me and others. You do not know how to have fun with what you have. You need to learn how to be a good boy. You need to say sorry and change your ways. Until then, you will stay in your room with no toys. Do you understand?"
Tom does not understand. He does not like his mom. He does not like his room. He does not like his life. He still wants the cell phone. He thinks he is right and his mom is wrong. He does not learn anything. He is still a spoiled boy.
