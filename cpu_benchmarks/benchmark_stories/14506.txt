Once upon a time there was a little girl named Susie. She was so excited because today was her birthday party. All her friends were coming to play and eat cake.
Susie's dad wanted to make Susie laugh so he made a joke. Susie laughed and laughed until her tummy hurt. She was so happy!
Suddenly, the room got dark and the lights went out. Susie felt scared and all alone. She started to cry and asked her dad why it was so dark.
Her dad told her not to be frightened. He said that they were playing a game. He said it was a "scare game" and that it would be fun. 
Susie felt more brave and she started to laugh. She knew it was just a joke and it didn't scare her anymore. She was able to play and enjoy her birthday party without being frightened.
