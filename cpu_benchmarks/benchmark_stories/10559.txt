Once there was a farmer who lived in a small village. He was very special and had something very unique. He had a copper cow!
Every day the farmer would take his copper cow out to the fields to graze. One day, a storm arrived, and the farmer and his copper cow got very wet. The farmer began to suffer as he didn't have a way to keep warm.
Luckily, the farmer had an idea. He quickly ran back to his house and he grabbed some blankets to keep him and his copper cow warm and dry. With the blankets around them, they were soon nice and warm.
The farmer and his copper cow were safe. The copper cow was unique and the farmer was very happy to have it. Together they were very happy and didn't suffer at all.
