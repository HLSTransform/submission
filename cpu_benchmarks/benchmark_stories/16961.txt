Tom and Lily were playing with their new toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun with the cars, the dolls and the blocks. They made noises and stories and laughed a lot.
"Mama, we are hungry!" Tom said after a while. "Can we have dinner?"
"Yes, my loves, dinner is ready. Come to the kitchen and wash your hands," Mama said from the other room.
Tom and Lily ran to the kitchen and saw a big pot on the stove. It smelled good and they could see steam coming out of it.
"What is it, Mama?" Lily asked.
"It's soup, my dear. It's very yummy and warm. It has carrots, potatoes, chicken and noodles. Do you want some?" Mama said.
"Yes, please!" Tom and Lily said together.
Mama served them each a bowl of soup and a slice of bread. She also gave them spoons and napkins.
"Be careful, it's hot. Blow on it before you eat. And use your napkins to wipe your mouths," Mama said.
Tom and Lily did as Mama said. They blew on their soup and took small sips. They liked it a lot. It made their tummies happy. They also ate their bread and wiped their mouths with their napkins.
"Thank you, Mama. This is a good dinner," Tom said.
"Yes, thank you, Mama. We love you," Lily said.
"I love you too, my sweeties. You are very good and polite. Now, do you want some dessert?" Mama said.
Tom and Lily smiled and nodded. They wondered what Mama had for dessert. Maybe it was something new and tasty. They couldn't wait to find out.
