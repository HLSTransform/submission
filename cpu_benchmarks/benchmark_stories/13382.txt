Once upon a time, there was a man who was bald. He lived in a big house with his friends. One day, he went to an event where he met a little girl. She asked him if he could lend her his hat because she was feeling cold. The bald man said yes and gave her his hat. The little girl was happy and thanked the bald man. They became friends and had a fun time at the event together. The end.
