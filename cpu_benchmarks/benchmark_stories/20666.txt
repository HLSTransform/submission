Once there was a little girl named Jane. Jane loved to ride her bike. She would ride it around the block and wave to all her friends. On sunny days, Jane would ride her bike to the park and play tag with her friends.
One day when Jane was out riding, she saw two cats in a fight. It was incredible, they were jumping and scratching. Jane stopped and watched them fight.
After a while, the cats stopped and said goodbye. Jane thought it was so incredible that they worked it out without fighting any more. Jane started to ride her bike again. It was great to see how the cats could go from fighting to being friends. Jane smiled and continued to ride her bike.
