Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her backyard. One day, she found a cool hedge that she had never seen before. She wanted to explore it, but her mom said it wasn't safe.
Lily didn't understand why she couldn't play near the hedge. She asked her mom, but her mom just said it was too dangerous. Lily was sad because she really wanted to see what was on the other side.
Later that day, Lily's ball accidentally went over the fence and landed near the hedge. She knew she shouldn't go get it, but she really wanted her ball back. She decided to be brave and go get it.
As she got closer to the hedge, she heard a loud growling noise. She quickly realized that there was a big dog on the other side. She was scared, but she slowly backed away and ran back to her house. She finally understood why her mom said it wasn't safe to play near the hedge.
