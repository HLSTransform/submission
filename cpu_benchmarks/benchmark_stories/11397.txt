Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She went to the park to play. When she arrived, she noticed a goose in the pond. The pond was peaceful and the girl was curious. She walked up to the goose and said "Hello".
The goose did not answer so the girl sat at the edge of the pond. She waited and waited. Then, suddenly, the goose opened its beak and said "Hello". The girl was so excited and they talked and talked.
The girl asked the goose if it wanted to play with her and the goose said "Yes". They had so much fun together, jumping and running around the pond. The girl felt so peaceful, she never wanted it to end.
But the sun was setting and it was getting late. The little girl said goodbye to her friend the goose and returned home. She felt happy, knowing she would soon come back and play with her goose again.
