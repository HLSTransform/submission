Once upon a time there was a little girl called Amy. She loved to swing on her swing set in her garden with the warm sunshine beaming down on her.
One day, Amy asked her mum for some tea. She was feeling tired and wanted something to drink. Her mum said she could have some if she was careful.
Amy was very clever so she carefully poured some tea into her favourite mug. She was so pleased with herself. 
Then something happened. Amy got too excited and accidentally spilt some of the tea onto the floor. She was very sad. 
Amy's mum hugged her and said: "It's alright. Your swing is still here and you can swing again tomorrow! Next time, just try to be a bit more careful, ok?
And so Amy smiled, understanding the moral of the story - be careful, but remember there are always happy things to look forward to!
