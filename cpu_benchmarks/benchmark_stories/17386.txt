Anna loved to draw. She had many colors and papers to make pictures. She liked to draw animals, flowers, and people. She wanted to show her pictures to everyone.
One day, she drew a picture of broccoli. She used green and brown colors. She thought it looked very good. She wanted to display it on the fridge. She ran to the kitchen with her picture.
"Mommy, look what I drew!" she said. "It's broccoli!"
Mommy smiled and took the picture. She looked at it and said, "Wow, Anna, this is a perfect picture of broccoli. You are very good at drawing. I'm proud of you."
She put the picture on the fridge with a magnet. Anna was very happy. She hugged Mommy and said, "Thank you, Mommy. I love you."
Mommy hugged her back and said, "I love you too, Anna. And I have a surprise for you. Guess what we are having for dinner?"
Anna thought for a moment. She looked at her picture and said, "Broccoli?"
Mommy nodded and said, "Yes, broccoli. And you can help me wash it and cut it. How does that sound?"
Anna clapped her hands and said, "Yay, broccoli! I love broccoli. Let's go!"
She took Mommy's hand and they went to the sink. Anna was very excited. She thought her picture and her dinner were perfect.
