Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to run and play outside. One day, she went outside to play and realized she forgot to put on her shoes. She quickly ran back inside to get them. 
When she got inside, she saw that her shoes were not in the right place. She looked and looked until she found them under her bed. She picked them up and saw that they were open. She quickly put them on and ran back outside to play. 
Lily had so much fun running and playing with her friends. She was happy that she found her shoes and could play outside with them on. The end.
