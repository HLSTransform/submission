Lily and Tom went to the park with Mom. They saw a large duck on the pond. Lily wanted to feed the duck some bread. Tom wanted to admire the duck from far away.
"Let's go closer, Tom!" Lily said. She ran to the edge of the pond with her bread.
"No, Lily, wait!" Tom said. He was scared of the large duck. He stayed behind Mom.
The large duck saw Lily and her bread. It swam fast to her. It opened its beak and quacked loud.
Lily was surprised and dropped her bread. She ran back to Mom and Tom. She was crying.
The large duck ate the bread and swam away. It was happy.
Mom hugged Lily and Tom. She said, "It's okay, Lily. The duck was just hungry. It didn't want to hurt you. And it's okay, Tom. The duck was just a duck. It didn't want to scare you."
Lily and Tom nodded. They felt better. They decided to admire the duck from far away. They saw it flap its wings and splash in the water. They smiled.
