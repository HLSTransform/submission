Once upon a time, there lived a leopard in the jungle. He saw a different animal, and he wanted to introduce himself. So, he said,"Hi! I'm the leopard! What is your name?" 
The other animal looked different and said,"Hi! I'm a tiger!" The leopard was so excited to meet a new friend. They began to play together in the jungle. 
The leopard taught the tiger different skills and showed him around the jungle. The tiger showed the leopard how to wrestle and play in the dirt. 
They became best friends and would play in the jungle every day. They were different, but that didn't stop them from being friends. They had lots of fun and laughter. 
The end.
