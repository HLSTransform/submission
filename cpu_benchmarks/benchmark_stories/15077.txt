Sophie and Kara were best friends. They liked to play together in the garden. One day, they found a hedge in the garden and decided to play hide and seek behind it. They giggled as they hid, but soon Sophie began to weep.
Kara looked at her friend in surprise. "Why are you crying?" she asked.
Sophie wiped her eyes and said, "The hedge was too harsh. It scratched me when I hid."
Kara was sad to see her friend so unhappy. She gave Sophie a big hug and said, "Don't weep, we'll find somewhere else to play."
They ran away from the hedge and found a big tree to play around. Even though Sophie's arm was scratched, she had a great time. She stopped weeping and smiled as she stayed out and played with her best friend.
