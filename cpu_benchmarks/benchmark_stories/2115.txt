Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her friends. One day, Lily went to a race with her friends. They all wanted to win the race, but Lily just wanted to have fun.
During the race, Lily saw that her friend was really fast. She wanted to keep up with her, but she couldn't. She started to feel sad, but then she remembered that it's not all about winning. She felt happy just to be there with her friends.
After the race, Lily's friend won the first prize. She was very happy, but Lily wasn't sad. She was happy for her friend and kept a modest smile on her face. She learned that it's not always about winning, but about having fun and being happy for others.
