Timmy was a very obedient boy. He was always doing what his parents asked. One day, his parents asked him to go to the science lab. Timmy was scared but went anyway.
When Timmy got to the science lab he saw a big green laser. "What is that?" he asked his parents. His parents explained that it was a laser and the scientists were going to use it to test things.
Timmy was still scared but his parents reassured him that the laser was safe. They asked him to stand on a chair and put his hand under the laser. Timmy was very obedient, so he did as he was asked.
The laser shone on his hand, but it felt like a tickle. Timmy was relieved and happy. He said to his parents, "This isn't so bad". His parents were very happy that he had been so obedient. They hugged him and told him the laser was all done.
