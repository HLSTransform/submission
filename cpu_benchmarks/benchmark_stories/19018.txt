Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a big truck that he loved to play with. One day, Timmy wanted to load his truck with lots of toys to take to his friend's house.
But when Timmy went to get his toys, he saw that his sister had taken his favorite toy car. Timmy was very sad because he wanted to take that car to his friend's house. He looked at his sister with a bad eye and said, "That's not fair!"
Timmy's sister saw that he was upset and gave him back his toy car. Timmy was happy again and loaded his truck with all of his toys. He went to his friend's house and they had lots of fun playing together. The end.
