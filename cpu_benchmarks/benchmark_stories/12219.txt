Once upon a time, there was a hard cow. The cow lived in a farm and liked to eat grass. His name was Max. 
One day, his farmer had an idea. He thought it would be better if Max helped on the farm, instead of just eating the grass. So he decided to replace Max with a tractor. 
Max was sad. He liked eating grass and didn't want to go. He begged and pleaded with the farmer, saying, "Please don't replace me! I can help you on the farm!" 
But the farmer didn't listen. He said, "I'm sorry, Max. But I need a tractor to help me with the farm more than I need a cow."
Max was angry and he ran away. He ended up in a nearby town, far away from his old farm. Without the farmer and the farm, Max knew he wouldn't survive. 
The moral of the story is that kindness and understanding can be replaced by selfishness and hardness. No matter how much you plead and beg, it won't stop hard people from doing the wrong thing.
