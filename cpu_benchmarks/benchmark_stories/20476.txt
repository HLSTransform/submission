Once upon a time there was an ornament. It was very special to the little girl who owned it. She played with it every day and it made her very happy.
One day, she ran to get her ornament for another game, but it was gone. She looked high and low, but it had vanished! She was very sad and ashamed.
The little girl's mommy saw her and hugged her tight. Together, they made a plan. They would search for the missing ornament and find it before morning.
So they ran to the park, calling out the ornament's name. All of a sudden, they saw the ornament lying in the grass. It had a bit of dirt on it, but was safe and sound.
The girl hugged her ornament tight and declared she would never let it vanish again. Every day, she held it tightly, happy to have her special ornament back.
