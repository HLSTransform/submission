Once upon a time, there was a frog. It was a small frog and it liked to shine. It shined so much that it made everything around it brighter. It even made the smiles of the people it met brighter too.
One day, the frog hopped through a meadow. There, it saw a big, strong tree with many branches. As the frog hopped from branch to branch, the sun shone down through the leaves and made the frog even brighter.
The frog was so happy and it wanted to do something useful. So it hopped down from the tree and started to help the flowers in the meadow. The frog collected twigs and leaves and used them to make homes for the small animals in the meadow.
The frog kept shining and collecting twigs. Every day it worked hard and soon the meadow was full of safe homes. People now visited the meadow and smiled at the happy frog. They knew that it was the shining frog who had made the meadow so useful and special.
