Lily and Tom were playing in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat, a scarf and a carrot nose. They also found a board and used it as a sled. They took turns sliding down the hill, laughing and having fun.
"Look, Lily, the sun is very bright today!" Tom said, pointing at the sky.
"Yes, it is. It makes the snow sparkle. But it also makes the snow melt. See, our snowman is getting smaller!" Lily said, looking at their snowman.
"Oh no, we don't want our snowman to melt. He is our friend. What can we do?" Tom asked, feeling sad.
"Maybe we can move him to a shady place. Or we can cover him with more snow. Or we can give him a hug and say goodbye." Lily suggested, thinking hard.
"I like the last idea. Let's give him a hug and say goodbye. And then we can play with our board some more. Maybe we can make another snowman tomorrow, if there is still snow." Tom said, smiling.
"Okay, let's do that. Bye, snowman. We love you. Thank you for playing with us." Lily said, hugging the snowman.
"Bye, snowman. You are the best. See you soon." Tom said, hugging the snowman too.
Then they took their board and slid down the hill again, enjoying the bright sun and the snow.
