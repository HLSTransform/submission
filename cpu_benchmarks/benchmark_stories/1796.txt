Once upon a time there was a little boy. His name was John and he was three years old.
John was thirsty, so he went looking for something to drink. He walked and walked and eventually he found a pond. He saw the water and went over to drink it.
There was a frog in the pond. The frog said "Do not drink the water! It is not safe for you to drink." John didn't listen, he was too thirsty so he drank the water.
When he got home his mom was very angry. She said "John, why did you drink that water?" John did not understand why she was so angry.
His mom explained, "The pond water is not safe to drink, it could make you sick." John was sad and said he was sorry.
His mom hugged him and said "It is ok, but next time if someone tells you not to do something, please listen. You could have become very sick!"
John nodded his head and promised he would listen next time. He was glad to be home and safe.
