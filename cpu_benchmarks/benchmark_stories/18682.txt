Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Teddy. Teddy was very tired because he had been playing all day long. He wanted to go to sleep, but he couldn't find his favorite page from his bedtime storybook.
Teddy searched and searched, but he couldn't find the page he was looking for. Just then, his friend Bunny came along. Bunny saw that Teddy was tired and asked him what was wrong. Teddy explained that he couldn't find his favorite page.
Bunny knew just what to do. She hugged Teddy and told him that it was okay if he couldn't find the page. She said that what mattered most was that they were together and that they could make up their own story.
Teddy felt much better and hugged Bunny back. They cuddled up together and made up a wonderful story that they both loved. Teddy learned that sometimes it's not about finding the perfect page, but about being with the ones you love.
