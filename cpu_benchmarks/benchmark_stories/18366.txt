Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big worry. She was going to sing in front of many people. She was scared, but she practiced every day.
One day, her friend Tim came over. He saw Lily was sad. "Why are you sad?" Tim asked. "I am scared to sing in front of people," Lily said. Tim had an idea. "Let's practice together. I will help you."
Lily and Tim practiced singing. They sang loud and clear. They sang high and low. Soon, Lily felt glad. She was not scared anymore.
The day of the show came. Lily went on the stage. She sang her song with a big smile. Everyone listened and clapped. They all applauded for Lily. She was so happy, and her worry went away.
