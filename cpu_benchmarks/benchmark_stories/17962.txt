Once upon a time, there was a small tent in a big forest. The tent was home to a nice, kind bunny. The bunny liked to play with his friends, the bird and the squirrel. They would jump, run, and laugh all day long. The sun was warm and the sky was blue.
One day, the weather became harsh. The wind blew hard and the rain fell fast. The bunny, the bird, and the squirrel went inside the tent to stay dry. They could hear the trees shake and the leaves tremble. They were scared, but they knew they were safe in their tent.
After the harsh weather stopped, the sun came out again. The bunny, the bird, and the squirrel went outside to play. They were happy that their tent kept them safe and dry. They knew that even when things were scary, they had each other and their tent to keep them safe.
