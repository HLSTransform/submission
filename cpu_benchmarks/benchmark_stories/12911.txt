Once there was a little girl named Bella. Bella loved to sing. One day, Bella's parents gave her a rake as a present. She was so excited. She ran outside and started raking the leaves.
Bella sang a little song as she worked. "Raking leaves is fun, raking leaves is fun," she sang. Bella was being very modest, since she was doing a great job.
Bella's mother came outside to watch. "That looks like a wonderful job, Bella," she said. 
Bella smiled and nodded. She kept singing and raking. 
Finally, after several hours, her raking job was complete. Bella smiled and looked at the neat pile of leaves in front of her.
"Good job, Bella," said her mother. "You are very modest. You should be proud of how well you did."
Bella smiled and said, "Thank you," before she started singing a happy tune as she went back inside.
