Lilly was walking in a big, beautiful park with her mom. She saw a little bird and wanted to follow it. So she asked, "Mom, can I follow the bird?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, Lilly. Keep your eyes on the bird and follow where it goes."
Lilly did as her mom said and followed the bird. The bird flew up into the sky and Lilly's eyes got big and wide as she looked up into the fancy sky.
The bird flew around and around, and Lilly kept her eyes on it as it flew higher and higher. But then the bird flew away and Lilly had to stop following it.
Lilly was sad and said, "Mom, can I follow the bird again?"
Her mom said, "No, Lilly, the bird has gone now. But we can look for another bird in the park and you can follow it instead."
And so Lilly looked around and eventually found another bird to follow. She followed it around the big, beautiful park with a big smile on her face.
