Lily and Ben are twins. They like to go outside and play. One day, they go with Mom and Dad to a big park. The park has many trees, flowers, and animals. Lily and Ben are happy.
"Look, Lily, look!" Ben says. He points to something far away. "What is that?"
Lily follows his finger. She sees a big, big thing. It is gray and white and very high. It touches the sky. "I don't know, Ben. Maybe it is a giant rock."
Mom hears them. She smiles. She walks over to them. "That is not a rock, my loves. That is a mountain. A mountain is a very big hill. Sometimes, it has snow on top. Do you see the snow?"
Lily and Ben nod. They see the white spots on the mountain. They think it is pretty. "Can we go there, Mom?" Lily asks. "Can we touch the snow?"
Mom shakes her head. "No, my loves. The mountain is too far and too high. It is not safe for us. We have to be careful. The mountain is for looking, not for touching. Maybe when you are older, you can go there. But for now, let's enjoy the park. There are many things to do here. Do you want to swing, or slide, or feed the ducks?"
Lily and Ben think. They like all those things. They decide to do them all. They say thank you to Mom. They hold her hand. They walk to the playground. They notice the mountain again. They wave to it. They say hello. They think the mountain is their friend. They are happy.
