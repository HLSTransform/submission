Once upon a time, there was a family of bears who lived in a big forest. They loved to play and have fun together, but sometimes they would quarrel over toys or food. One winter day, they woke up to a big surprise. Everything outside was covered in white snow! Mama bear said, "Let's go outside and play in the snow!" 
The baby bear was so excited to see the snow. He ran outside and saw that everything was white and cold. He loved it! He made a snowman and threw snowballs at his siblings. They all laughed and played together, forgetting about their quarrel from earlier. 
After playing for a while, they went back inside to warm up. Mama bear made hot cocoa and they all sat by the fire. The baby bear looked outside and saw that the trees were no longer green, but covered in white snow. He was so happy to have played in the winter wonderland with his family.
