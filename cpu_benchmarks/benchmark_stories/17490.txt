Lily and Tom are friends. They live in a big city with many cars and people. They like to play in the park with their toys.
One day, they find a small dog in the park. It has no name and no home. Lily and Tom want to keep the dog. They think of a name for it.
"I want to name it Spot, because it has a black spot on its ear," Lily says.
"No, I want to name it Rex, because it is strong and brave," Tom says.
They argue and shout. They are both stubborn. They do not want to share the dog or the name.
The dog does not like the noise. It runs away from Lily and Tom. It finds another child in the park. The child is kind and gentle. He gives the dog some food and water. He pets the dog and says, "Hello, little dog. What is your name?"
The dog wags its tail and licks the child's face. It likes the child. It likes the name he gives it.
The child calls the dog Lucky.
