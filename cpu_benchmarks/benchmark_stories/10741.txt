Once upon a time, there was a compassionate man named Tom. Tom liked to sell wood. He was very kind to everyone in his town.
One day, a little boy came to Tom's wood shop. The boy wanted to buy some wood to make a toy. Tom saw that the boy did not have much money. So, Tom gave the boy some wood for free.
The boy was very happy and said, "Thank you, Tom!" He went home and made a beautiful toy with the wood. The boy and Tom became good friends. They played with the toy and had lots of fun. And everyone in the town loved Tom because he was so kind.
