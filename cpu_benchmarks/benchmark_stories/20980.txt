Once there was a little boy. His name was Joe. Joe was three years old. He felt proud of himself. Every day he tried to grow taller.
One day, Joe's mommy said to him, "Let's go outside!" So they went outside and Joe ran around, playing and having fun. 
When Joe got too tired, he sat in the grass. He looked up at the sky. It was so blue! Joe smiled and shut his eyes. Suddenly, the sun sent a wink to Joe. Joe felt so happy that he grinned.
The next day, Joe felt ashamed. His big brother had done something bad. Joe wanted to help him. He wanted to make it better. Joe knew that he was too small to do anything. He sadly watched his brother.
But Joe was growing. He tried every day to be a good boy and grow taller. Every day he tried to do something helpful. Maybe soon, he would be big enough to help his brother. He would try and try and soon, he could make it better.
