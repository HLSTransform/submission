Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, they found a big rope with a knot in it. They pulled and pulled, but the knot was too tight. 
Lily had an idea. She said, "Let's plan how to untie the knot!" They all agreed and sat down to think. They came up with a plan to twist the rope and pull it apart. 
As they pulled, the knot got looser and looser until finally, it came undone! They were so happy and shouted "Yay!" very loud. From that day on, they played with the rope every time they went to the park.
