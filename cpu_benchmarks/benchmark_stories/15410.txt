One day, a human went to the park. He was wearing a cool outfit and saw some other people in the park too. He noticed one man who was complaining. He was talking about how hot it was outside. The human thought the man was being silly and didn't understand why he was complaining.
The human walked over to a nearby tree for some shade. He saw some sparrows playing in the branches. They were making lots of noise and seemed very happy. They were chirping away and singing songs.
The human watched them for a while. He smiled and thought that it was cool how the birds were enjoying life and not complaining. He decided to take a page from their book and made a plan to focus on the good things in his life instead of complaining.
