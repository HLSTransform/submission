Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had a big house. She really liked it, and she would often play there by herself. One day, she noticed something strange. Some yummy-looking treats had seemed to appear in the house without the little girl knowing. She quickly ran over to take a closer look. It was a pile of what seemed to be the most tasty treats she'd ever seen! Her tummy grumbled as she looked around. Suddenly, she heard a noise. A mean-looking big cat had sneaked into the house. It was guarding the treats and ready to fight! The little girl didn't know what to do. She knew she wanted the tasty treats, but she was scared of the big cat. The little girl had to make a decision. Would she fight for the treats, or would she let the cat keep them?
