Once there were two friends, Sarah and Lucy, who decided to go for a walk in the woods. As they were walking around, Sarah saw something shiny in the dirt. It was a skull! The two friends stopped to look at it. Lucy asked Sarah, "What could it have been?" Sarah wasn't sure, but she had a feeling the answer was unknown. 
The two friends kept walking around the woods and then they saw a dark figure. It was a man, but they weren't sure who he was. He seemed to be acting strangely. Sarah suggested they should leave quickly, but Lucy thought they should stay to see what the man was doing. 
The man saw that Sarah and Lucy had spotted him, and he began to run away. The two friends decided to follow him as they were curious to see where he was going. The man was leading them further and further away from the woods and into an unknown part of the forest. 
Suddenly, the man stopped and let out a loud laugh. He then disappeared, leaving Sarah and Lucy alone in the dark forest. They had no way to get back home and didn't know what to do. 
The moral of this story is to always be cautious and trust your gut feeling. Sarah had a feeling something wasn't right, but Lucy overruled her and put them in danger.
