Once upon a time there was a little girl. Her name was Sarah. She was very busy. Everyday she went to the market. She loved to go to the market to shop.
At the market, Sarah loved to mark fruits and vegetables. She would scan them and mark them for the store. She was very good at it and it made her happy.
Every day at the market was busy. People were always asking her to do more work. But she kept on marking the fruits and vegetables. She was very good at it!
But sometimes the market was too busy. At the end of the day she had to rush, because she had to get back before her mom did. She had to mark all the fruits and vegetables in just a few minutes. 
But Sarah was a fast worker. She marked everything quickly and made it back in time. She was very proud of herself!
