Alice was walking through the park, looking for something fun to do. She spotted a big cone and she ran over to look at it. The cone was big and painted yellow.
Alice reached out to touch it and she giggled as it wobbled. She then stood back and gazed at the cone, now that she was close, she could see how funny it was. 
Alice wanted to play with the cone, so she looked around and quickly found a stick to use as a bat. She hit the cone and it rolled away, then she chased after it, running giggle and cheering. 
Alice played with the cone for a long time, hitting it and chasing after it until she was tired. She finally stopped and looked back at the cone, which was still wobbly and funny. 
Alice's mom called out to her as it was time to go home. But Alice couldn't help but keep gazing at the cone, so she and her mom quickly took a photo and then she said goodbye to her funny cone friend.
