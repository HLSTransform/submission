Once, there was a little bird. He was so small and his wings so very tiny. He flew around, looking for something to eat. 
One day, a big wind blew and made the little bird scared. He looked around for a place to keep safe. Suddenly, he saw a big tree. He quickly flew to it and nestled into its branches. 
The little bird began to feel safe and snug, so he tucked his tiny wings in and went to sleep. But then, he heard a loud noise. It was a hawk, looking for something to eat! 
The little bird was so frightened and didn't know what to do. He decided to hide inside the tree, deep down in a hollow branch. The hawk swooped around, looking and searching. But it couldn't find the little bird. 
Suddenly, the little bird heard a noise. It was the swish of wings! Another bird had come to protect him. The big bird flew around and around, chasing away the hawk. The little bird was so thankful and happy. 
The big bird had protected him and he was no longer scared. He flew away, back to the sky, feeling warm and safe.
