Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was only three years old. One day, Lucy went to visit her friend, Sam. Sam had a flute. Sam showed Lucy how to make music with the flute.
Lucy was so excited that she wanted to play with it all day. They played together until it was time for Lucy to go home. Before she left, Sam gave Lucy the flute as a present.
Lucy was so happy that she took the flute home with her. She practiced and practiced until she was an organized flutist. Every day she taught herself something new and eventually she was able to play beautiful music.
This new skill changed Lucy's life. She loved playing her flute and was now more confident than ever. Lucy had learned to turn the flute into beautiful music and was now on her way to achieving her dreams.
