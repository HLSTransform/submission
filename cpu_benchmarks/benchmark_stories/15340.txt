John wanted to go to the park. So his mum sent him a ticket. On the ticket, it said to go on the bus. So John and his mum went outside. It was very cold.
The bus came. John and his mum got on the bus. There were lots of people there. John and his mum found a seat to sit on.
The bus ride was long and bumpy. After a while, the bus stopped near the park. John and his mum got up and got off the bus. They could finally see the park!
John was so happy. He ran around the park and had a lot of fun. It was a great day.
