Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jenny. One winter day, Jenny wanted something to eat. She opened the fridge and saw some cheese. It looked so yummy. Jenny grabbed the icy cheese and put it in her mouth. Suddenly, Jenny started to tremble and her mouth felt cold.
Her mum noticed her shaking and asked Jenny, "What is wrong?"
Jenny replied, "The cheese is too icy."
Mum laughed and said, "Let me help you." She put the cheese in the toaster oven and waited. When it was done, Mum gave it to Jenny. Jenny felt warm and happy. She ate the cheese and it tasted delicious.
Jenny's tummy was happy and her mum was happy too. This was a moment of joy and no more trembling.
