Lily and Sam were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big truck. The truck had a lot of popcorn. The popcorn smelled good.
"Can we have some popcorn?" Lily asked the truck man.
"Sure, you can have some popcorn. But you have to help me first. The popcorn bags are very heavy. Can you carry them to the table?" the truck man said.
Lily and Sam nodded. They wanted to help. They each took a popcorn bag. The popcorn bags were very heavy. They walked slowly to the table. They put the popcorn bags on the table.
"Thank you, Lily and Sam. You are very strong and kind. Here, you can have some popcorn. Enjoy!" the truck man said. He gave them each a small bowl of popcorn.
Lily and Sam smiled. They thanked the truck man. They sat on the bench and ate the popcorn. The popcorn was yummy. They shared the popcorn with some birds. They had a fun day.
