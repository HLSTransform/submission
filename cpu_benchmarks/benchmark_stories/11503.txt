Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to dance. She would dance all day long. One day, Lily saw a new friend named Sam. Sam was nervous to dance. He had never danced before.
Lily said, "Sam, let's dance together!" Sam looked at Lily and gave her a little wink. He was still nervous, but he wanted to try. So, they stood up and started to dance.
As they danced, Sam became less nervous. He started to laugh and have fun. Lily and Sam danced and danced until they were tired. They sat down and smiled at each other. From that day on, they loved to dance together.
