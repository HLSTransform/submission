Once upon a time there were two friends. They had to take a long journey, but because of the stubborn car they had to delay the journey. The car kept running out of gas. They had to stop again and again to get more gas. The friends got very frustrated and started to argue with each other.
Finally, they reached a gas station. It had lots of gas with different smells. The friends bought lots of gas and filled the car with it. After that, the car didn't have problems again and they could continue on their journey.
The friends were very relieved and thanked each other for being so stubborn. They made it to their destination, despite all the delays!
