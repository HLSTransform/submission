Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved the color pink and had a dull pencil. One day, she wanted to draw a pretty picture for her mommy. 
Lily went to her art box to prepare her supplies. She found a new pink crayon and sharpened her dull pencil. She was ready to draw! 
Lily drew a pink flower with her new crayon. Her mommy loved the picture and put it on the fridge. Lily was so happy that she had prepared her supplies and made her mommy smile. The end.
