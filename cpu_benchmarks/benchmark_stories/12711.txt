Once upon a time, there was a tiny mouse named Marty. Marty was very shy, he was too scared to speak to anyone. Instead, he liked to stay in his own little corner, away from the world.
One day, Marty was exploring in his favorite spot when he came upon a long line drawn on the ground. He got curious and scurried closer for a better look. But when he got close, he realized the line was fire! It was burning red and orange.
Marty became frightened and he started to back away slowly. He knew if he had been too curious and crossed to the other side of the line, he could have gotten hurt!
The moral of this story is simple: be careful with your curiosity. It's important to remember when something looks like it can be fun, you should always be safe and think before you act. Being curious is okay, but shyness has its advantages too.
