The sun was gloomy outside, so Amy decided to stay inside and unpack her new toy box. She was so excited! She took out the box and opened it up. She dug through the box and pulled out a big toy. It was a doll. She hugged it and said, "Hello dolly!"
She worked quickly and neatly as she unpacked the box, pulling out a jigsaw puzzle and a coloring book. Then she spied something small and blue. She reached in and pulled it out. It was a thumb puppet, shaped like a thumb!
Amy was so delighted! She put the puppet on her left thumb and wiggled it around. The puppet waved its tiny arms and danced. Amy laughed and laughed.
That made her day much bigger and brighter! Even though the sun was gloomy outside, in Amy's house it was full of laughter and joy.
