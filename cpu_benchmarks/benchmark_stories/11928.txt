Once upon a time, there was a man with a big mustache. He was very tall and had a hat that was high up in the sky. One day, a little boy saw the man and said, "Wow, your mustache is so big! Do you think it tickles your nose?" The man laughed and said, "Yes, sometimes it does tickle my nose, but I like it anyway." The little boy thought the man looked very funny with his big mustache and high hat. The man said, "I think you're right, I do look a bit silly, but I like it that way." The little boy smiled and said, "I like it too!"
