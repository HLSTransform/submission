Once upon a time there were two children, Andy and Beth. They were playing outside when they came upon a flower garden.
Andy said, "I want to pick a flower for Mommy!"
Beth said, "We don't have permission to pick flowers from this garden."
But Andy picked the flower anyway. Suddenly, a loud voice came from behind them, "What do you think you are doing?"
Andy and Beth were so embarrassed that they didn't know what to say. Andy put the flower behind his back, but the voice said,
"Give me the flower."
Andy sadly handed the flower to the voice. The voice said, "I'm going to have to give you both a cut for taking something that doesn't belong to you."
Andy and Beth received their cuts and left the garden feeling ashamed. They went home and explained what happened to Mommy. She was disappointed, but also said, "It's important to always remember to respect things that belong to others."
Andy and Beth realized their mistake and made a promise to never take anything without permission again.
