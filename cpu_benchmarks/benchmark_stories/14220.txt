Alice stepped out of her home and walked to the museum. She was excited to learn about new things. Suddenly she noticed a fat cat sitting on the museum steps. It meowed loudly as she approached. Deep inside, Alice knew she wasn't supposed to enter the museum with animals, but she wanted to pet the cat.
So, she stepped closer and the cat jumped on her shoulder. Alice laughed and started to pet the cat. As they reached the entrance, they were stopped by a guard. He said that animals were not allowed inside and asked Alice to leave.
Alice felt so sad and started to cry. Reluctantly, she stepped away from the museum and the fat cat and walked back home. She was disappointed she didn't get to explore the museum, but all she could do was cry. It was a bad ending to her day.
