Once upon a time there was a big pot that was all alone. It wanted to be filled with something, but it didnâ€™t know what. So it sat and waited for something to happen.
One day, a funny little creature appeared and started to move around. It filled the pot with lots of tiny pieces. This made the pot so happy!
But then a mean creature came and did something stupid. It took all the pieces out of the pot and put them back where it had found them. The pot was so sad.
But then the funny creature came back and filled the pot with even more pieces. This time it stayed in the pot and made lots of motion with its funny little hands. The pot was so happy!
And this time, the pieces stayed in the pot forever. So the pot was very, very happy. And it was so happy that whenever it moved, it sang a happy little song. 
The pot was filled with joy and now it will never be alone again.
