Once upon a time, there was a big boat. It had a big port where it would stop. The boat was orange and it would glow in the sun. 
One day, a little girl went on the boat with her mom. She saw the orange glow and said, "Wow, pretty!" 
The boat started to move and the little girl got scared. She asked her mom, "Where are we going?" 
But then, the boat hit a big rock and started to sink. The little girl cried and said, "Help, help!" But nobody came to save them. The boat went down and the little girl and her mom were never seen again.
