Once upon a time, there was a little ant. He was walking along and minding his own business. Suddenly, a bossy duck came flying through the sky and splashed into a puddle. The little ant watched as the duck made a big splash.
"Hey ant, come on in! I'm trying to make the biggest splash I can," the duck said.
The ant was a bit scared, so he shook his head no.
"Oh come on! It'll be so much fun. You won't get wet, I promise!" said the bossy duck.
The ant thought about it, and decided the duck was right. He scurried across the ground and jumped into the puddle. As they both splashed around, they had the best time.
Then the ant realized he was getting soaked. He hurried to get out of the puddle. When he finally escaped, he said goodbye to the duck. The duck waved as the little ant said "Thank you for a great adventure!"
