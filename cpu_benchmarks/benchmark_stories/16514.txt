Once upon a time, there was a big, fat cat. The cat loved to sleep all day in the sun. One day, the cat's owner decided it was time for a haircut. The owner took the cat to the pet salon where they cut the cat's fur with scissors. The cat didn't like the haircut very much, but felt much cooler without all that fur. 
Later that day, the owner decided to paint the walls of their house. The cat watched as the owner dipped the brush into the paint and painted the walls. The cat thought the paint smelled funny and decided to take a nap. When the cat woke up, the walls were a beautiful new color. The cat was happy to have a new view while napping in the sun.
