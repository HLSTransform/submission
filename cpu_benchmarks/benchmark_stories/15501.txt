Once upon a time, there was a gentle reindeer who liked to walk in the forest. He was always looking for someone to play with. One day, he saw a little girl. She had a very kind smile. She asked him if he wanted to play.
The reindeer happily agreed and they ran off into the woods, playing tag and having a great time. They laughed and smiled and enjoyed the day.
After they were tired from playing, the little girl stopped and asked the reindeer if he wanted to try something new. She asked if he wanted to hold her hand. The reindeer was excited. He liked the idea, so he gently held her hand.
The little girl and the reindeer walked around the woods, hand in hand. The reindeer felt so happy. He knew he had made a new friend.
The little girl and the reindeer said goodbye to each other and the reindeer ran off into the woods, happy and excited. He knew he would meet his new friend soon and they would play again.
