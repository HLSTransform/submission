Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a silly cat named Mittens. One day, Lily and Mittens went to the park. At the park, they saw a big slide. Lily wanted to slide down the slide, but Mittens was scared. 
As they walked around, they saw a birdcage with a little bird inside. The bird was very pretty and Lily wanted to pet it. But the bird was in a cage and Lily knew she couldn't touch it. 
Lily and Mittens played at the park for a long time. They went up and down the slide many times and saw many other animals too. They had so much fun that they didn't want to leave. But eventually, it was time to go home. Lily and Mittens said goodbye to the bird and went home, happy and tired from their fun day at the park.
