Once upon a time there was a powerful man who lived in a big house. Every day the man would go to the coal mine and add new coal to his big pile.
One day, the man saw a magical creature flying around the coal mine. The creature told him that if he added the coal together, it would turn into something very powerful. 
The man thought this was a great idea! So, he added all the coal in the mine together, and it formed a giant diamond. 
The man was so happy that he had found something so powerful. From then on, he never had to work in the coal mine again, and could have whatever he wanted. 
The end.
