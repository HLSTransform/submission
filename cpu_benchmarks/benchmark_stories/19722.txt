Once there was a little girl named Mia. She loved to play with her friends, but this day she was alone. She found an old coat hanger in her room and started to play with it. She told her hanger all about her day and all the fun things she wanted to do.
Mia was so excited when she found a fancy dress in her mom's closet. She asked her mom if she could wear it and her mom said yes! Mia put on the dress and stirred around in front of the mirrors. She loved how fancy she looked and couldn't wait to show her friends.
Mia grabbed her hanger and started to tell it all about her dress. She knew her friends would love it when they saw her! She ran outside to go and show them, and when she came back she found her hanger standing in the corner of her room. She knew she had told it all about her dress, and that it would never forget.
