Once upon a time, there was a mama who wanted to bake something special for her kids. She looked in the cupboard for some ingredients but all she had was flour, sugar and eggs. So, mama decided to order some chocolate from the store.
The chocolate arrived quickly and she was excited to start baking. Mama mixed up the ingredients and put the cookie dough in the oven. She sang a happy song while the cookies were baking.
The cookies weren't ready yet when the doorbell rang. It was the mail carrier with a package. Mama opened it up and found a broken toy inside. She was sad, but she still had the cookies to cheer her up.
Finally, the cookies were done. Mama shared them with her family and everyone was happy. The cookies tasted delicious and it was the perfect ending to a fun day of baking!
