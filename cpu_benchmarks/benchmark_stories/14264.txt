Once upon a time, there was a mighty duck. He was swimming away in the lake, when he suddenly got a bad feeling. He stopped, and noticed a dark shadow coming out of the water. It was a big fish with his mouth wide open. The mighty duck did not have time to get away. The fish got him and swallowed him in one bite.
At first, the duck was scared, but he soon realised that this was his chance to escape. He started to flap his wings and peck at the fish's throat. The fish coughed and spluttered but the duck kept pecking and pecking. Finally, the fish coughed up the duck and swam away.
But the mighty duck was too weak. He had used up all of his energy and he started to sink. he tried to flap his wings, but it was too late - he sank down to the bottom of the lake never to be seen again. The mighty duck got eaten.
