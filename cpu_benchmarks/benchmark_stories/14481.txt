Once upon a time there was a pepper who was very troubled. He was feeling very sad and he didn't know why. He went looking for help and he found a friend who said she had a plan.
His friend took out a big knife and she said, "I will cut the pepper into lots of little pieces. This will make you feel much better."
The pepper was very scared but he agreed. The friend carefully cut the pepper into pieces using the sharp knife. When she finished, the pepper really did feel better. His sadness had gone away.
The pepper thanked his friend for helping him. He went away feeling happy and free. The end.
