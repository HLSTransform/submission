Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Billy. He loved football and always wanted to wear a shirt of his favourite team. 
One day, his family took him to a football match. He couldn't believe his eyes. There were thousands of people all wearing their favourite team's shirt and cheering for their team. 
Billy was so excited and finally he got the chance to wear a special football shirt. He was so proud and ran around showing it off! He thought it was incredible. 
When the match was over, Billy had the best day ever. He still wears his special football shirt and it reminds him of that beautiful day at the stadium.
