Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with blocks and cars. One day, they find a big box in the park. It has many colorful papers inside. They are shiny and pretty.
"Wow, look at these!" Anna says. "They are like rainbows!"
"Can we take some?" Ben asks. "They are so cool!"
"Yes, let's take some and make something with them!" Anna says. They take some papers and run to a bench. They start to fold and cut the papers. They make hats and flowers and stars.
"Look, I made a hat!" Anna says. She puts it on her head. It has red and yellow and blue papers.
"I made a flower!" Ben says. He holds it in his hand. It has pink and purple and green papers.
They are happy and proud of their work. They show each other their creations. They smile and laugh.
Suddenly, they hear a loud noise. They look up and see a big firework in the sky. It has many sparks and colors. It is beautiful and bright.
"Wow, look at that!" Anna says. "It is like our papers!"
"Yes, it is!" Ben says. "It is amazing!"
They watch the firework with wonder. They see more fireworks in the sky. They are all different and colorful. They unite and make shapes and patterns.
"Look, that one is like a heart!" Anna says. "And that one is like a star!"
"They are so pretty!" Ben says. "They make me happy!"
They hold hands and watch the fireworks. They feel happy and warm. They are glad they are friends. They are glad they found the papers. They are glad they made something with them. They are glad they saw the fireworks. They are glad they are together.
