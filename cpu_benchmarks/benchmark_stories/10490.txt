Once upon a time, there was a colorful duck. The duck loved to swim in the pond and quack loudly. One day, a young boy came to the pond to visit the duck. He asked the duck why it was so colorful. 
The duck explained that each day it liked to take a long swim in the pond. While it was swimming, some of the colors that were in the pond would stick to its feathers. 
The young boy thought the idea was marvelous and asked the duck to take him for a swim. The boy and the duck jumped into the pond and started to swim around. As they swam around the colors from the pond stuck to the duck's feathers and the boy's clothes. 
The boy was so excited that he asked the duck to do it again the next day. The duck happily agreed and the two were soon back in the pond, splashing around and becoming even more colorful. 
The boy and the duck had so much fun in the colorful pond and became the best of friends.
