Mum and Dad were very worried. Little Jack was very ill and the doctor said he needed to do an operation. It was very dangerous, so the whole family went to the shop to buy everything for it. First, Mum bought a big bed and some pillows, then Dad got a lot of medicine. He was worried too, but he was brave. 
After that, they bought some toys for Little Jack. They wanted to make him smile even if he was feeling poorly. And lastly, Mum and Dad bought something special - a big toy car for Little Jack. They said it was to say thank you for being brave. 
Little Jack smiled when he saw his toy car. Then everyone went to the hospital together and the doctor did the dangerous operation. 
Afterwards, Little Jack was back at home with his family. He was much better and they were very happy.
