Mom and little Jack were out for a walk. They came to a bridge and Jack asked, "What is that, Mom?" Mom replied, "It's a bridge. It helps us go over a big pond."
Jack thought to himself how he would like to be able to cross the bridge. Mom then said, "Let's go and have a closer look!"
They both walked to the bridge and Mom explained that the bridge needed to be clean so it wouldn't become damaged. Jack helped Mom take a bucket of water and a brush and the two of them cleaned the bridge.
When they were finished Jack said, "Mom, now I can become the bridge!" He stood on one side and asked Mom to come stand on the other side. When Mom did he said, "I'm the bridge!"
Mom smiled and said, "Yes you are! You've become the bridge!" Little Jack felt so proud of himself and thought I'm the bridge! over and over again.
