Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, he went to the park with his mommy. They saw a big blue sky and Timmy pointed up to show his mommy.
As they walked, they saw a tree with big green leaves and a palm. Timmy wanted to climb it, but his mommy said it was too tall. They kept walking and saw a little pond with ducks swimming. Suddenly, a frog sprang out of the water and scared Timmy. But his mommy hugged him and said it was okay.
After playing for a while, they went home and Timmy fell asleep with a smile on his face, dreaming of the big blue sky and the frog that sprang out of the pond.
