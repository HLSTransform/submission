Once upon a time, there was a little caterpillar. It was very hungry and wanted to eat a lot of leaves. It crawled on the ground and found a big, green leaf. It ate and ate until it was full.
Suddenly, the weather changed and it became icy. The caterpillar was so cold that it couldn't move anymore. It tried to talk, but it was too cold to make any sounds.
Sadly, the caterpillar froze and couldn't move anymore. The end.
