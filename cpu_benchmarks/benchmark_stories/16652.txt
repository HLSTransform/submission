Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go on adventures with his family. One day, they went to a big lake and Timmy saw a yellow kayak. He wanted to ride in it, but it was too noisy for him. 
Timmy's mom said, "Mind the noise, Timmy. It might scare the fish." So, Timmy decided to watch the kayak instead. He saw how it moved on the water and he thought it was very cool. 
After a while, Timmy's family went back home. Timmy was sad that he didn't get to ride in the kayak, but he was happy that he got to see it. He went to bed that night dreaming of kayaking on the lake, but next time he would be brave enough to ride in it.
