Once upon a time, there was a brave bee called Label. He lived in a beautiful garden with many other insects.
One day, Label went flying around the garden and zoomed over the flowers. He was having so much fun!
Label came upon a big green bush and he decided to buzz around it. As he zoomed closer and closer, he got stuck in the bush!
Label felt very scared, but he was brave. He wiggled and he shook and he eventually freed himself from the bush.
He flew away from the bush and back to the other bees. Label was so happy to be free! He went back to zooming around the garden and had lots more fun. 
That was the brave and adventurous story of Label the bee!
