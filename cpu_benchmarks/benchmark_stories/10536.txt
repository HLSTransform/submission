Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. One day, Lucy went to her mom's office and saw her working with a video. It was a gray video, and Lucy asked if she could help. 
Her mom said yes and she showed Lucy how to play the video on the computer. Lucy was very excited and she tried to help, but it was too hard. So, her mom showed her how to pause and restart the video. This time, Lucy was able to help and it made her very happy. 
Lucy watched the video with her mom, and it was about a friendly dog. It was so funny, and Lucy laughed and laughed. In the end, Lucy was very happy and she gave her mom a big hug. Her mom was so proud of her for helping.
