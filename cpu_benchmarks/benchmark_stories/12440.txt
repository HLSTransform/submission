Tom and Lily were brother and sister. They liked to play with their toys in their room. But sometimes they fought over the toys and made a lot of noise.
One day, their mom came to their room and said, "Tom and Lily, you have to share your toys and be nice to each other. If you fight, you will make me sad and angry. Do you remember what I told you about being kind?"
Tom and Lily nodded, but they did not really listen. They were ignorant. They thought they knew better than their mom. They wanted to have all the toys for themselves.
Later, their mom went out to buy some food. She said, "I will be back soon. Be good and don't fight. I love you." She kissed them and left.
Tom and Lily waited for a while. Then they started to play with their toys again. But soon they began to argue. Tom wanted to play with the truck, but Lily wanted to play with the doll. They pulled and pushed and shouted.
"Give me the truck! It's mine!" Tom said.
"No, it's mine! You had it yesterday!" Lily said.
They did not hear their mom's voice in their heads. They did not remember what she told them. They were ignorant.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise outside. They looked out the window and saw a big fire. The fire was near their house. They saw smoke and flames and people running. They were scared.
They ran to the door, but it was locked. They could not get out. They cried and screamed for their mom. They wished they had listened to her. They wished they had been kind to each other. They were not ignorant anymore. They were sorry.
