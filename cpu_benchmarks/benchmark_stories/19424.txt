Bob was a driver. He loved to drive around. One day, he went for a special drive. On the way, he saw something very useful. When he got close, he recognized it! It was a little puppy. He stopped his car and saw that the puppy needed a home. He wanted to help so he took the puppy in his car. He gave the pup a ride home. 
When they got there, Bob saw the puppy's owner and smiled. The owner thanked Bob for helping the pup. Bob was so happy to be useful to someone! The pup wagged his tail and gave Bob a big hug. Bob and the pup said goodbye and Bob went on his way. 
Back in his car, Bob looked in the rear view mirror and saw the pup happily playing in his new home. He smiled and knew he had done a good thing. Bob felt proud to have recognized the pup in need and he was happy to be so useful.
