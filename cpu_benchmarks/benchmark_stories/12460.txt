Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play outside when the weather is nice. Today, the sun is shining and the sky is blue. They go to the park with their moms.
"Look, Lily, a swing!" Ben says. He runs to the swing and sits on it. He pushes himself with his feet and goes up and down.
"Can I have a turn, Ben?" Lily asks. She likes swings too. She waits for Ben to stop.
Ben smiles and says, "Sure, Lily. You can have a turn. We can share the swing. Sharing is good."
He gets off the swing and helps Lily get on. He pushes her gently and she laughs. They take turns on the swing and have fun.
Their moms watch them and are grateful. They are grateful for the weather, for the park, and for their children. They are grateful for their friendship. They hug each other and say, "We are lucky to have each other."
