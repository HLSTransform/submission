Once upon a time there were two friends, Bob and Jan. They were best friends and loved to play together. One day Jan wanted to organize a game to play but Bob didn't want to join in. He just wanted to sit in the icy park and watch the sparkly stars in the sky all evening.
"Come on, Bob! Let's organize a game!" Jan said, trying to encourage her friend.
But Bob just shook his head, not wanting to play. Jan felt sad and turned away from Bob, making him feel low and lonely. After a while, Bob noticed that he had made Jan sad. He thought about the importance of spending time together and chose to organize a game with Jan.
They had lots of fun playing, catching sparks and ignoring the icy night air. At the end of the evening they hugged each other tight and Jan thanked Bob for organizing the game.
The moral of this story is that we should all take time to share, play and have fun together with our friends and family. There is nothing like a shared experience to bring us closer together.
