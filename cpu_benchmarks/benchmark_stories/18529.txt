Sara and Ben were having lunch with their mom. They liked to eat pasta with cheese and tomato sauce. Mom gave them each a fork and a napkin. "Please use your fork and napkin, not your fingers and shirt," she said.
Sara and Ben nodded and tried to be good. But Ben saw a jolly bird outside the window. It was red and yellow and blue. It sang a happy song. Ben wanted to see it better. He put his fork down and got up from his chair.
"Ben, where are you going?" Mom asked. "Please sit down and finish your lunch."
"But Mom, look at the bird!" Ben said. He pointed at the window. "It is so jolly and pretty. I want to say hello to it."
Sara looked at the bird too. She thought it was nice, but she was hungry. She picked up Ben's fork and ate his pasta. She liked cheese and tomato sauce. She smiled and said, "Yum, yum, yum."
Mom saw what Sara did. She shook her head and sighed. She got up and went to the window. She opened it and said to the bird, "Hello, jolly bird. You have a lovely voice. But please don't distract my son. He needs to eat his lunch."
The bird heard Mom and nodded. It flew away and sang another song. Ben heard it and smiled. He went back to his chair and saw that Sara had eaten his pasta. He was sad and said, "Hey, that was mine!"
Sara giggled and said, "Sorry, Ben. I was hungry. Do you want some of mine?"
Ben looked at Sara's plate. She had some pasta left. He nodded and said, "Yes, please. Thank you, Sara."
Sara and Ben shared their pasta. They used their forks and napkins. They were happy and full. Mom was proud of them. She gave them each a hug and a kiss. She said, "You are good children. I love you very much."
