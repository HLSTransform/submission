Once there was a little girl named Susie. She was 3 years old and loved to explore. One day Susie was walking near the river when she saw something shiny in the sand. She bent down to pick it up and it felt hot in her hands. 
Susie opened her hands and saw a beautiful necklace! She thought it was so pretty and wanted it for herself. But when she looked closer she saw that it was old and cheap. She didn't want it anymore. 
So she stood up and looked around. The sun was very hot and she could feel it on her face. As she walked further, Susie found some ice cream. It was cold and delicious, and it made her feel better. 
Susie enjoyed her day and came home happy. She always remembered the hot, cheap necklace she found.
