Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He had a great idea to play with his toy car. He wanted to push it down the big hill in his backyard. Timmy ran to get his toy car and went outside. He pushed the car and it went really fast down the hill. Suddenly, the car hit a bulb and stopped. Timmy was sad, but he knew he could fix it. He picked up the car and went inside to get a new bulb. Timmy fixed the car and went back outside to play. He was happy because he got to push his car and it worked great again. The end.
