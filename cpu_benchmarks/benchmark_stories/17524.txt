Tom was a painter. He liked to make pictures with colors. He had many brushes and paints. He had a big paper on the wall. He wanted to make a nice picture for his mom.
But Sam was a bad boy. He did not like Tom. He wanted to make Tom sad. He took a brush and some paint. He ran to Tom's paper. He made a big mess on it. He laughed and said, "Your picture is ugly!"
Tom was very sad. He saw his paper. It was ruined. He felt hurt. He wanted to cry. He wanted to hit Sam. But he knew that was wrong. He tried to resist. He said, "Go away, Sam. You are mean. You are not my friend."
But Sam did not go away. He wanted to make more mess. He took another brush and more paint. He threw them at Tom. They hit Tom's face and clothes. They made him dirty and wet. Sam laughed more and said, "You are ugly, too!"
Tom was very angry. He could not resist anymore. He forgot what was right. He grabbed a brush and some paint. He ran to Sam. He hit Sam with the brush. He painted Sam's face and hair. He said, "You are mean, Sam. You are not my friend. You are a bad boy!"
Sam was very scared. He felt hurt. He wanted to cry. He wanted to run away. But he could not. Tom was stronger. Tom was madder. Tom kept hitting and painting him. He said, "This is what you get, Sam. This is what you deserve."
No one saw them. No one heard them. No one helped them. They kept fighting and hurting each other. They made a big mess of themselves and the room. They ruined their paints and brushes. They ruined their friendship. They were not happy. They were not nice. They were not painters. They were just bad boys.
