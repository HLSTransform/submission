Once upon a time there was a little girl named Abby. She was only three years old and loved playing in the snow. One day, Abby was so excited that she forgot to wear her mittens. As she jumped in the snow with her bare hands, she started to suffer from the cold. 
Abby started to shiver and tears rolled down her cheeks. She was so sorry she forgot her mittens.
Then, Abby saw something! A blanket was lying nearby and she quickly wrapped it around her. She stayed warm and her suffering was over. 
The next day Abby put on her mittens and went out to play. From then on, she always remembered to wear them so she would not suffer in the cold again.
