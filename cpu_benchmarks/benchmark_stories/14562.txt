Once there was a lazy bell. It was very happy and it liked to drop. One day it was too lazy to drop. So it stayed on the floor and did nothing. The bell was so bored that it decided to go outside to find something fun to do. 
When the bell went outside it saw a little bird. The bird dropped a branch on top of the bell. The bell got a surprise when that happened. The bell started to drop with excitement! 
The bell enjoyed dropping so much that it decided to chime. It was the happiest bell ever. Whenever it dropped, it made a wonderful noise. 
Everyone in the neighbourhood heard the bell. People started to come and see the bell. They all loved the sound it made. The bell was so happy that it kept dropping. 
The lazy bell never got tired of dropping. It was happy and loved it's life!
