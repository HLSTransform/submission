Sara and her mom went to the shop. They wanted to buy some food for dinner. Sara liked the shop. It had many things to see and touch.
"Can I help you?" a man asked. He worked at the shop. He wore a blue shirt and a name tag.
"Yes, please. We need some milk, eggs, and bread," Sara's mom said. She gave the man a list.
"OK, follow me. I will show you where they are," the man said. He smiled at Sara and her mom.
Sara and her mom followed the man. He took them to a big fridge. It was cold inside. He opened the door and took out a bottle of milk. He gave it to Sara's mom.
"Here you go. This is mild milk. It is good for you," he said.
"Thank you," Sara's mom said. She put the milk in a basket.
Sara looked at the fridge. She saw many other bottles of milk. Some were big, some were small. Some were white, some were pink. Some had pictures of cows, some had pictures of strawberries.
"Mom, can I have some pink milk?" Sara asked. She pointed at a bottle of strawberry milk.
"Maybe another time, Sara. We have to fill our basket with other things first," Sara's mom said. She took Sara's hand and walked to the next aisle.
Sara nodded. She liked pink milk, but she also liked eggs and bread. She wondered what they would make for dinner. She hoped it would be yummy. She was hungry. She liked going to the shop with her mom.
