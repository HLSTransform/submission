Lily and Ben are friends who like to play with their dogs. Lily has a big dog named Spot, and Ben has a small dog named Fluffy. One day, they go to the park with their dogs and see a new slide.
"Let's go on the slide with our dogs!" Lily says. "It will be fun!"
"No, no, no!" Ben says. "That is not a good idea. The slide is too high and too fast for our dogs. They might get hurt or scared."
Lily and Ben disagree. They both think they are right and the other is wrong. They start to argue and get angry.
Spot and Fluffy watch their friends fight. They do not like to see them unhappy. They are clever dogs. They have an idea. They run to the slide and climb up the steps. They wear their collars, which have tags with their names and phone numbers. They slide down together, one after the other. They bark and wag their tails. They have fun.
Lily and Ben see their dogs on the slide. They are surprised and worried. They run to the slide and catch their dogs. They hug them and check if they are okay. They are glad their dogs are safe and happy.
They look at each other and feel sorry. They realize they were silly to disagree and argue. They say sorry and make up. They learn to respect each other's opinions and feelings. They play together with their dogs on the slide and have fun. They are good friends.
