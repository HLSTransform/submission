Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was a bit fearful, so she had to learn how to be brave. One day, she picked up a mug. She liked it a lot, so she decided it would be her special mug. From then on, each day she used her mug to learn something new. She put a little bit of water in it and pretended it was oceans and rivers. She did this to learn about the world. She also took a few small pebbles she had found and pretended they were treasure. She did this to learn about money. All the while, her mug kept her feeling brave. Each day she felt a little more brave and a little less fearful. Soon, she felt as strong and fearless as a lion.
