Once there was a boy named David. He was only three years old and was always in awe when looking at the big world around him. One day he was playing in the park when he found a letter on the ground. He picked it up and read it out loud.
"Dear David,
I have a terrible secret to share. Please, don't get mad at me. I need your help. 
Please, can you yield this mysterious letter to the person I'm talking about? You can find him at the post office.
Thank you for your help. 
Signed,
Anonymous"
"Mysterious!" thought David, as he tucked the letter into his pocket and made his way to the post office. 
When he got there, David saw a big man with a funny hat behind the counter. He took out the letter and said, "I need to yield this letter to you." 
The big man smiled and said, "No problem. You have been very brave. Thank you for yielding this letter to me." 
David smiled and felt a sense of accomplishment. He had done something to help someone else, and it felt great!
