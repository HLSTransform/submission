Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a popular bunny named Bob. Bob had many friends because he was very nice. One day, Bob and his friends went to play hide and seek. Bob was very good at this game, so he always found his friends quickly.
"Ready or not, here I come!" shouted Bob. He looked behind a tree and found his friend, the squirrel. Then, he looked under a bush and found his friend, the mouse. Bob knew his last friend, the bird, was hiding in a high place. He looked up at the sky and saw a big tree. Bob thought the bird was hiding there.
Bob hopped to the big tree and started to climb. As he climbed, he felt something strange in his chest. He didn't know that it was his lung. When he reached the top, he saw his friend, the bird. "I found you!" said Bob. The bird smiled and said, "Good job, Bob! You are the best at this game!"
Bob was very happy. But then, he remembered the strange feeling in his chest. He told his friends about it. They all decided to go see the wise old owl for help. The owl listened to Bob's story and said, "Bob, you have discovered your lung. It helps you breathe when you climb and play."
Bob and his friends were amazed. They thanked the wise old owl and went back to play more games. Now, whenever Bob felt his lung, he knew it was helping him have fun with his friends. And they all lived happily ever after.
