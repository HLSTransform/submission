Once upon a time there was an adventurous little girl named Emma. Every day she would go out to explore and gain new experiences. But one day when Emma went out, everything was very messy. Everywhere she looked there was dirt, leaves and more mess. 
She didn't know what to do. She wanted to tidy it all up, but it was too hard for her. She started to feel defeated, but then she remembered she had a will. She could try her best to make things better! 
So, with a brave heart and a determined will, Emma started tidying. She picked all the leaves off the ground and tidied all the mess she could. It was tiring but she kept going!
Eventually, Emma was able to gain back control of her garden. Everything was neat and tidy, just the way she liked it. She was so proud of her hard work and she decided that no matter the mess she came across, she had the will to make it neat again.
