Once upon a time, there was a bear named Bob. Bob was very brave and strong, but one day he took an ugly fall. He landed on his back and felt very sad. 
Bob didn't know what to do. He wanted to heal, but he had no idea how. Suddenly, he heard a voice that said, "Bob, believe in yourself and you will heal!" 
Bob smiled and believed in himself. With every breath, he felt better and better. Soon, Bob was running and playing, just like before the fall.
The end.
