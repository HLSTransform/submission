Once upon a time, there was a wise old owl who lived in a big tree. The owl was very smart and knew a lot about the forest. One day, the owl saw a little bird fall into a well. The bird was very scared and didn't know what to do.
The owl flew down to the well and tried to help the bird. But when the other animals saw the owl trying to help, they started to laugh and make fun of him. The owl felt embarrassed and sad.
But the owl didn't give up. He used his wise brain to come up with a plan to save the little bird. He called all his friends together and they worked together to rescue the bird from the well.
In the end, the little bird was safe and the owl felt proud of himself for being so wise and helpful. And even though he was embarrassed at first, he learned that it's important to always try to do the right thing, even if others might make fun of you.
