Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily's mommy had to go to the office to work. 
Lily asked, "Mommy, what's an office?"
"It's a place where people go to do their jobs," mommy replied.
"Oh," said Lily. "Will you be gone long?"
"Just for a little while," mommy said.
Lily felt envious that her mommy had to go to work, but she knew that mommy had to do it to make money to buy things they needed. As the day went on, Lily watched the clock and waited for her mommy to come home. When she finally arrived, Lily's happiness increased and they hugged each other tightly.
