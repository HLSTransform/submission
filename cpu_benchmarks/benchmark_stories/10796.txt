Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Benny. Benny loved to play in the forest and climb trees. One day, Benny was very tired and needed to rest. He found a soft spot under a big tree and lay down to take a nap.
While Benny was sleeping, some lumberjacks came into the forest. They were cutting down trees to make houses. Benny woke up and saw the lumberjacks. He was scared because he loved the trees and didn't want them to be cut down. Benny knew he had to be careful and delicate so he wouldn't get hurt.
Benny watched as the lumberjacks worked. He saw how hard they were working and realized that they needed the lumber to make homes for people. Benny decided to help the lumberjacks by bringing them some water to drink. The lumberjacks were very grateful and thanked Benny for his help. From that day on, Benny and the lumberjacks became good friends and Benny knew that sometimes it was important to rest and be delicate.
