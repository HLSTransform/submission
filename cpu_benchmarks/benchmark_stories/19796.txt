Mum and Dad were getting ready for the day. They had been busy, packing and cleaning the house.
Billy watched them and sighed. It was difficult for him to understand why they were doing all this work.
Mum noticed and said, "We're going to the beach, Billy! Do you remember, from our holiday last year?"
Billy remembered all the plastic buckets, spades and toys. He smiled and said, "Yes, I remember. That was fun."
Mum and Dad laughed and hugged him. They said, "We're going to have just as much fun this year. But first, we need to pack the car."
Billy just sighed. He knew it was going to be a difficult day.
