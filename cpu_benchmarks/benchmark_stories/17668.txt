Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sally. She liked to go to the park and play with her friends.
One day, Sally saw a big, red button near the park bench. She liked the way it looked, so she reached out and pushed it.
Suddenly, sirens started going off. Sally felt scared and guilty for pushing the button. She wanted to go home so she ran away.
When Sally got home, her mom asked her why she was so scared. Sally told her mom about the button and how she pushed it. Her mom hugged her and said it was OK.
The next day, Sally went back to the park with her mom. They found the button and her mom showed Sally what the button was for - it was an emergency button. She explained that if anyone ever felt in danger, they could push the button to call for help. 
Sally felt relieved and happy. She was glad that her mom helped her understand that pushing the button was not something to feel guilty about.
