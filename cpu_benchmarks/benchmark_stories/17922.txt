Once upon a time, there was a boy. He had a funny looking notebook. His mom said, "Oh what a sweet notebook you have!"
One day, the boy was playing outside when he saw something sour on the ground. It was a tiny green sour fruit! He said, "Yum!"
He picked it up, put it in his notebook, and took it home.
When he got home, he showed it to his parents. Mom said, "Why did you bring a sour fruit home?"
The boy said, "To remember it. I like sour things!"
His parents laughed and said, "Okay, if you like it, keep it in your notebook!"
So the boy kept the sour fruit in his notebook as a special reminder of his adventure outside.
