The little girl was feeling sad. She wanted to bring a march. She asked her mom to get her one but she said no.
So the little girl was determined and came up with a plan. She marched to the park and asked everyone she saw if they could bring her a march. Everyone said no and the little girl was feeling more and more hopeless.
But then one old man kindly said that he could help. He took the little girl with him and brought her to a place where march was everywhere! It was an amazing sight for the little girl and she was filled with joy.
But as the old man showed her around, the little girl noticed some ignorant people. They were refusing to accept the march that the old man had been trying to bring to them. This made the little girl feel sad again and she wondered if one day people would be more accepting of march.
