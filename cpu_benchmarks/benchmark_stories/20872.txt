Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Jane. She loved to explore everything around her and was very creative. Her mom and dad noticed this and decided to get Jane a rake so she could help them with the garden. 
Now every morning, Jane would go outside with her rake and start helping her parents. She became an expert at it - she knew exactly where the weeds were, where the flowers should go, and which way to rake the soil so the water could trickle in. 
But when winter came, Jane stopped helping with the garden. The cold made raking difficult, so she spent her time playing inside the house. Jane missed her beloved rake and just wished for spring to arrive so she could use it again. 
Finally, when the days grew longer and the sun shined brighter, Jane raced outside with her rake to help with the garden. She worked hard for hours and watched her garden grow. 
The moral of the story is that with patience, hard work and creativity, you can watch your dreams and ideas grow too!
