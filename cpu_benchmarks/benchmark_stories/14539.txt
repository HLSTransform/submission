Once upon a time there was a young girl named Jane who wanted to roll. She was excited but also a little bit scared. She knew that rolling could be dangerous, so she asked her mom if it was ok. Mom said, "Yes, but you must be careful," and she gave Jane a big hug.
So they found a big hill and Jane began to roll. She laughed and she laughed. It was so much fun! She felt brave and powerful and free.
But then, Jane had to go a little too fast and the hill got too steep. Suddenly, she felt a little bit scared of the danger that was coming. She tried to slow down, but it was too late. She rolled down the hill faster and faster.
The rolling was so fast that Jane was scared that she couldn't stop. But just before she reached the bottom, her mom saw her and called out, "It's ok, Jane, you can stop!" And so, Jane safely stopped rolling down the hill. She was relieved, she felt brave and powerful, and she knew that she had conquered a danger.
