Once upon a time, there was a little fork named Freddy. Freddy lived in a big drawer with many other forks, spoons, and knives. Freddy was a very happy fork, but he was also a little ashamed because he had a bend in his handle.
One day, Freddy was talking with his friend, Sally Spoon. Sally said, "Freddy, you should be proud of your bend. It makes you special!" But Freddy disagreed. He thought that his bend made him look silly.
Then, one day, a little girl named Lucy was trying to eat her soup. She tried to use a straight fork, but it did not work. She tried to use a spoon, but it was too big. Then, she saw Freddy with his bent handle. She picked him up and found that his bend was perfect for eating soup. Freddy felt so happy and proud. From that day on, Freddy was no longer ashamed of his bend.
