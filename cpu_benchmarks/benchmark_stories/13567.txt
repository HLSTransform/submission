Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved his green sweater very much. One day, Timmy's mommy washed his sweater and forgot to put it in the dryer. When Timmy went to put on his sweater, he saw that it was still wet and he felt sad. 
Timmy's mommy said, "Don't worry, Timmy. We can manage to dry your sweater quickly." She took the sweater and put it on a hanger. Then, she hung the sweater outside in the sun to dry. 
After a while, Timmy's mommy checked on the sweater and saw that it was still wet. She said, "Oh no, the sweater is still empty of dryness." But then she had an idea. She brought the sweater inside and put it in the dryer. 
When the dryer was finished, Timmy's mommy gave him his sweater and it was warm and cozy. Timmy was happy again and he hugged his mommy. From that day on, Timmy made sure to remind his mommy to put his sweater in the dryer so it wouldn't be empty of dryness again. The end.
