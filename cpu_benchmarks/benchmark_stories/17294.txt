Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color with her pencils every day. One day, she found a pencil that was very sharp. She was so happy and started to draw with it. 
But then, she accidentally poked herself with the sharp pencil. It hurt a lot and made her cry. Her mommy came to her and looked at her pupil, which was red and sore. 
Her mommy told her that she should be careful with sharp things and that they can hurt you. Lily learned that she should always be careful and listen to her mommy. From that day on, she was more careful and never hurt herself again.
