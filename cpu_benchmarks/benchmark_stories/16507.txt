Once upon a time, there was a big gorilla in the jungle. He was very intelligent and knew how to find food and make a home. One day, a little boy came to visit the jungle and saw the gorilla. He stared at the gorilla with big eyes because he had never seen such a big animal before.
The gorilla was not happy that the boy was staring at him. He thought the boy was being mean and started to get angry. Suddenly, the gorilla jumped out of the bushes and chased the boy. The boy ran as fast as he could, but the gorilla was too fast. The gorilla caught the boy and took him away.
The boy's family never saw him again. They searched for him everywhere, but he was gone. They were very sad and missed him very much. They wished they had never let him go to the jungle to see the gorilla.
