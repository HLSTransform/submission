One day, a little girl was very thirsty. She wanted to drink something cold and tasty. She looked around her house and saw an armchair in the living room.
The armchair was big and comfy. She jumped onto it and settled in. The armchair felt so soft! She thought it would be a great place to drink her cold drink.
But the armchair was not so comfortable after all. The floor beneath it was covered with ice! The little girl gasped. She had not expected the armchair to be so harsh!
She was so thirsty, she just had to get her cold drink. So she braved the icy feeling and carefully crawled to the kitchen. She opened the fridge and grabbed her cold drink.
It was so refreshing! The girl drank her cold drink and felt much better. She was so glad she had braved the harsh armchair!
