One day, Billy 's mommy took him to the park. It was a big, sunny place full of fun and games.
As they walked around, they saw some birds flying in the sky, their wings making sharp movements in the air.
Billy then saw some children playing with a map. It looked very interesting. He wanted to play with them but they were too noisy.
"Billy, we need to be quieter," said mommy. "We don't have to shout to have fun. Being quiet can be more enjoyable".
Billy was upset that he couldn't play with the children and their map, but he understood that it was important to be polite and not too loud.
From that day, Billy and his mommy had lots of fun together playing games and exploring without being too noisy. They both learned that being respectful of others is often more fun than being too loud.
