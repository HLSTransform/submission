Once, there was a troubled girl. She was sad all the time, day and night. But she had an idea to make herself feel better. She took a piece of paper and a marker and printed some happy thoughts. She wrote about friends and coffee and fun things. All the happy thoughts made her smile.
Then she turned her paper into something special. She folded it and put it in a box. Inside the box was something even more special. It was a tiny plastic cup full of coffee. She held it close and knew she would always be safe.
When things became difficult, she would open the box. She'd smell the coffee and read all the happy thoughts she printed on her paper. Little by little, she became stronger and happier, and she faced her troubles with courage.
