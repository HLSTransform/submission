Once upon a time, there was a big truck. The truck was red and shiny, with big wheels and a loud horn. The truck was very modern and new. It had a lot of oil inside to make it go fast.
One day, the truck went to a farm. There, it saw a little chicken. The chicken was very small and cute. The truck wanted to say hello to the chicken, so it squeezed its horn. The chicken got scared and ran away.
The truck felt bad that it scared the chicken. So, the truck decided to give the chicken some oil to make it feel better. The chicken drank the oil and felt much better. From that day on, the truck and the chicken became friends and played together every day.
