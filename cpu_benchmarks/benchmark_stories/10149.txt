Once upon a time, a boy named Timmy went to play in the garden. He saw a spade lying on the ground and picked it up. It was a charming spade, with a shiny silver handle and a sharp blade. Timmy held the spade tightly and started digging a hole.
But then, Timmy's little sister came to play with him. She wanted to hold the spade too, but Timmy didn't want to share. He held the spade even tighter and said, "No, it's mine!"
Suddenly, Timmy accidentally hit his sister with the spade. She cried and cried, and Timmy felt very bad. He learned that it's not nice to hold things all to yourself and hurt others. From that day on, Timmy shared his toys and never held onto them too tightly.
