Once upon a time, there was a fisherman named Jack. He went to the lake every day to catch fish. One day, he caught a big fish. He was grateful and said, "Thank you, fish!" The fish said, "You're welcome, fisherman."
The fisherman saw a little girl walking by the lake. She said, "Hi, fisherman! Can I have a fish?" The fisherman said, "No, sorry. I need these fish for my family." The little girl got sad and said, "Why won't you give me a fish?" The fisherman said, "I'm sorry, but I can't give you a fish. Please ignore me and go play with your friends."
The little girl felt sad, but she knew the fisherman needed the fish for his family. She said, "Okay, fisherman. I'll go play with my friends. Thank you anyway." The fisherman smiled and said, "You're welcome, little girl. Have a good day!"
