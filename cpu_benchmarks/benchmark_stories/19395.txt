Once upon a time, there was a mommy, a daddy, and a little girl named Daisy. Daisy was only three years old, but she was always ready to play! One of her favorite things to do was sports.
One day, Daisy's dad said that he had a surprise for her. He took her outside and showed her a new organized sports game. Daisy was so happy! She squeezed her dad's hand and said, "Let's play!"
So, the two of them ran around, playing the game and having lots of fun. Daisy loved squeezing the ball, running around and playing. She was so organized and kept track of it all. It was her favorite new game. 
At the end of the day, Daisy hugged her dad and said, "Thank you for the game. Let's play it again soon!" Daisy's dad smiled and said, "Of course! It was so much fun." 
And so, Daisy and her dad kept playing sports every day. They were so happy together. They were the perfect team!
