Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the park with her mom and dad. One day, they went to a park with a big fountain in the middle. The water shot up high in the sky and then fell down like rain.
Lily watched the water spin around and around in the fountain. It was so fast, she could hardly keep up with it. She laughed and clapped her hands with joy. Suddenly, she wanted to spin around too!
So, she held onto her mom's hand and started to spin around and around. It was so much fun! When they stopped, she felt dizzy but happy. Lily loved the fountain and the way it made her feel. She couldn't wait to come back and spin again another day.
