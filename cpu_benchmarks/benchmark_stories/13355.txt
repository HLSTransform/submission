Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the market with her mommy. They would buy fruits and vegetables, and sometimes even toys.
One day, Lily saw a boy who was selling toys. His toys were very messy and scattered all over the place. Lily wondered why he didn't tidy them up. She asked him if he needed help, and together they tidied up the toys.
The boy was very happy and thanked Lily. Lily learned that it's important to help others and keep things tidy. From that day on, she always made sure to tidy up her toys and help others whenever she could.
