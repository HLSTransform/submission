Once upon a time, there was a large cat named Whiskers. Whiskers loved to wander around the neighborhood, looking for new things to see and smell. One day, while wandering, Whiskers saw a big, shiny bar of soap sitting on the sidewalk. Whiskers was curious, so he went over to sniff the soap.
But as he got closer, Whiskers noticed something strange. There was a tiny mouse hiding behind the soap! The mouse looked scared and Whiskers knew he had to help. So he gently picked up the soap with his paw and moved it aside, revealing the mouse.
The mouse was so grateful that he invited Whiskers to his home for a delicious piece of cheese. Whiskers happily accepted and they became the best of friends. From that day on, Whiskers knew that even when he was wandering, he could always find a new friend.
