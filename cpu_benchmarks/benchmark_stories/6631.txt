Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat beans, especially the green ones. One day, her mom brought home a bag of beans from the store. Lily was so excited and couldn't wait to eat them.
But when she opened the bag, she saw a spider crawling on one of the beans. She got scared and didn't want to eat them anymore. Her mom told her not to be scared and that the spider was just trying to act like a friend.
Lily realized that she shouldn't judge things based on their appearance and that sometimes things that scare us can actually be good for us. From that day on, she ate her beans without fear and even made a new friend in the spider. The end.
