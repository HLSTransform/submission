Once upon a time there was a little girl called Ella. She was very scared and didn’t like being away from her family. She always wanted to stay with them.
One day, Ella’s mum and dad had to go to work. They asked her if she wanted to come with them. But Ella was too scared, so she said no and stayed at home on her own.
Ella felt lonely, until she heard a knock at the door. She opened the door and saw a big, friendly dog. He was wearing a big red collar and was wagging his tail.
“Hi,” said Ella. “Where did you come from?”
“I was sent to bring you some style,” said the dog. “Your parents wanted me to make sure you have fun while they’re away.” The dog gave Ella a funny hat, a kite and a frisbee.
Ella smiled. She and the dog spent the day playing and having fun. Ella wasn’t scared anymore, she had a new friend to keep her company.
