Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books with regular pages. One day, Lily went to the library to borrow a book. She picked a book with a picture of a car on the cover. 
When she opened the book, she saw that the car could zoom very fast. She was so excited and showed the book to her friend, Jack. Jack said, "Wow, that car can zoom really fast!" 
Lily realized that she should not just focus on the pictures and the zooming cars. She should also read the words on the page so that she could learn new things. The moral of the story is that it's important to read the words on the page and not just look at the pictures.
