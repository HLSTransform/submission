Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tom.  He had a sister who was very special to him.  One day, Tom and his sister were playing together when suddenly she got very sick.  Even the doctors couldn't make her better.  She died that night, and Tom was very sad.
He asked his mom what a 'dead' sister means.  She told him that it meant his sister was not alive anymore; she was gone forever.  Tom felt very sad and cried for a long time.
The days went by, and Tom slowly started to feel better.  He remembered his sister and the happy times they shared.  He knew that she was gone, but he held her in his heart forever.  No matter what, he would never forget her.
In time, the sadness ended.  Tom still felt very sad when he thought about his sister, but he knew that he had to be strong.  He carried his sister in his heart and was able to find peace.
