Lila and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and swing. They saw a big tree with many leaves. The leaves were green and yellow and red. They were very pretty.
"Look, Tom, a leaf!" Lila said. She picked up a leaf from the ground. It was red and had a long stem. "I want to put it in my hair. Can you help me?"
"Sure, Lila, I can help you," Tom said. He took the leaf and tried to put it in Lila's hair. But the leaf was too big and the stem was too thick. It did not fit. "Oh, no, Lila, it does not work. The leaf is too big."
Lila was sad. She wanted to have a leaf in her hair. She looked at the tree again. She saw a smaller leaf on a branch. It was yellow and had a thin stem. It was very pretty. "Look, Tom, another leaf!" Lila said. She pointed at the branch. "I want that leaf. Can you help me?"
"Sure, Lila, I can help you," Tom said. He looked at the branch. It was very high. He was not tall enough to reach it. He needed something to stand on. He looked around. He saw a big rock. It was near the tree. "Lila, I have an idea. Come with me."
Tom and Lila ran to the rock. Tom climbed on the rock. He was taller now. He reached for the branch. He got the leaf. He gave it to Lila. "Here, Lila, this leaf is for you. It is smaller and thinner. It will fit in your hair."
Lila was happy. She took the leaf and put it in her hair. It fit perfectly. It looked very pretty. She smiled at Tom. "Thank you, Tom, you are very kind. You helped me get the leaf. You are a good friend."
Tom smiled back at Lila. He was happy too. He helped Lila get what she wanted. He was a good friend. He liked the leaf in her hair. It matched her eyes. "You are welcome, Lila, you are very sweet. You look very pretty with the leaf. You are a good friend."
Lila and Tom hugged. They were happy. They had a leaf and a friend. They played in the park. They liked to run and jump and swing. They saw many more leaves. They were very pretty.
