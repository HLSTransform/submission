Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play with her toys and draw pictures. One day, she saw a newspaper on the ground. She picked it up and looked at the pictures. The pictures made her feel sad.
Lily wanted to do something to help. She decided to lift the newspaper up high and show it to everyone. Maybe they would see the pictures and help the sad people. But when she lifted the newspaper, she accidentally dropped it on her foot. It hurt a lot and she started to cry.
Her mommy came to help her, but she couldn't fix the boo-boo. Lily had to go to the hospital and get a bandage. She felt even more sad because she couldn't help the sad people in the newspaper. From then on, Lily was more careful when she lifted things up.
