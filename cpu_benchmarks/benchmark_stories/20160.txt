Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They had a spade, a bucket and some paint. They wanted to make a big picture on the wall.
"Look, I can paint a sun!" Lily said. She dipped her spade in the yellow paint and made a circle on the wall.
"I can paint a flower!" Ben said. He dipped his spade in the red paint and made a dot in the middle of the circle. Then he used the green paint to make some leaves.
They were having fun, but they did not see the cat sneaking behind them. The cat was curious and wanted to see what they were doing. He jumped on the bucket and knocked it over. The paint spilled on the ground and on the cat.
"Meow!" The cat cried. He was frightened and angry. He ran away, leaving a trail of paint behind him.
Lily and Ben turned around and saw the mess. They were shocked and scared. They did not want to get in trouble.
"Oh no!" Lily said. "What have we done?"
"Mommy will be mad!" Ben said. "We have to clean it up!"
They grabbed some rags and tried to wipe the paint off the wall and the ground. But it was too late. Mommy came out and saw them.
"What is going on here?" Mommy asked. She was not happy. She saw the paint, the bucket, the spade and the cat.
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They did not know what to say. They felt sorry and ashamed.
"We were trying to paint a picture, Mommy," Lily said.
"But the cat made a mess, Mommy," Ben said.
Mommy sighed. She was not very angry, but she was disappointed. She loved her children, but she did not like their painting.
"Come on, let's go inside," Mommy said. "We have to wash the paint off you and the cat. And then we have to talk about what you did."
Lily and Ben followed Mommy. They hoped she would forgive them. They learned a lesson. They would not paint with a spade again.
