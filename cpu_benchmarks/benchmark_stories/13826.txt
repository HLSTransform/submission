Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play outside in nature. They see trees, flowers, birds and bugs. They have fun and laugh.
One day, they see a big hill. They want to climb it and see what is on the other side. They ask their mom if they can go. Mom says no. She says it is too far and too steep. She says they have to stay close to her.
But Lily and Tom are naughty. They wait until mom is busy with the baby. Then they rush to the hill. They run and run. They do not look back. They do not listen to mom calling them.
They reach the top of the hill. They are happy. They see a lake and a bridge. They want to go there. But then they hear a loud roar. They turn around and see a big bear. The bear is angry. It sees them and starts to chase them.
Lily and Tom are scared. They scream and cry. They run back to the hill. They hope mom can help them. They are sorry they were naughty. They wish they listened to mom.
