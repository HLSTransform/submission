Lily liked to play with her toy fireman. He had a red hat, a yellow coat and a big hose. He could put out fires and save people. Lily pretended that her fireman was brave and strong.
One day, Lily's fireman broke. His arm fell off and his hose snapped. Lily was sad and cried. She showed her mom her fireman and said, "Mom, my fireman is broken. He is weak. Can you fix him?"
Mom looked at the fireman and shook her head. "I'm sorry, Lily. I can't fix him. He is too broken. But maybe we can replace him. We can go to the toy store and find a new fireman for you. Would you like that?"
Lily nodded and wiped her tears. She hugged her mom and said, "Thank you, mom. I love you. Can we go now?"
Mom smiled and said, "Yes, we can go now. Come on, let's get your coat and shoes. Maybe we can find a fireman that is even better than the old one."
Lily and mom went to the toy store and looked at all the toys. Lily saw many firemen, but none of them looked like her old one. She was about to give up when she saw a fireman that made her eyes shine. He had a red hat, a yellow coat and a big hose. But he also had a siren, a ladder and a dog. He could make noises and move his arms and legs. He was the best fireman ever.
Lily ran to the fireman and picked him up. She showed him to mom and said, "Mom, look! This is the fireman I want. He is brave and strong. He can put out fires and save people and animals. He is not weak. He is perfect."
Mom agreed and bought the fireman for Lily. Lily was happy and hugged her new fireman. She said, "Hello, fireman. I'm Lily. You are my new friend. I will take good care of you. I will play with you every day. I love you."
The fireman made a beep and said, "Hello, Lily. I'm fireman. You are my new owner. I will protect you and have fun with you. I love you too."
