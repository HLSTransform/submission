Once upon a time, there were two friends, Jack and Jill. 
Jack and Jill loved exploring in the woods. One day, Jack and Jill were walking through the woods when they heard a deep, loud roar. Jill was frightened, so Jack held her hand.
Jill asked, "What was that noise?".
Jack said, "We have to listen carefully to find out".
So they listened really hard. After a minute, they heard another roar and Jack knew what it was. 
He said, "It's a bear! We need to pass him quickly or he might get us!".
Jill was still scared, but they ran past the bear as fast as they could. When they were a safe distance away, they stopped to catch their breath. 
Jack gently squeezed Jill's hand and said, "That was close, huh?".
Jill nodded and said, "Let's never go near that bear again!".
The two friends agreed, and they went back home.
