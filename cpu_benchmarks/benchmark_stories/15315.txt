Once upon a time, there was a fake lotion. It was not a real lotion, but it still smelled nice.
One day, a three year old wanted to try the lotion. She rubbed it all over her hands. It felt funny and slimy.
The little girl put more lotion on her arms. She quickly ended up covered in it!
The little girl laughed and smiled. She loved how her arms felt. She made sure to rub it in really well.
In the end, the little girl was all slimy and smelly from the fake lotion. She loved it and couldn't wait to do it again!
