Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Snowy. Snowy was very white and fluffy. One day, Snowy was hopping through the forest when he saw a zigzag path. Snowy was curious and decided to follow the path. 
As he was hopping along the zigzag path, he saw a group of birds sitting on a branch. Snowy wanted to say hello, so he hopped closer and nodded his head. The birds chirped happily and Snowy felt very pleased. 
After saying goodbye to the birds, Snowy continued on the zigzag path until he reached a big tree. He looked up and saw a squirrel sitting on a branch. Snowy wanted to make friends with the squirrel, so he hopped closer and nodded his head again. The squirrel smiled and chattered happily. Snowy was so happy to have made a new friend!
