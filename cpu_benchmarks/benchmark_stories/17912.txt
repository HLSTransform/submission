Once upon a time there was a boy and he was very enthusiastic. He had a plan to make a very special surprise. He took some glue and a few old bits and pieces of wood from around the house and put them on the kitchen table.
He twisted and turned the wood pieces, adding glue in between until it made something nice. After a few minutes, he had made a beautiful surprise for his mom.
He was so excited. He just had to show her. He ran to find his mother and proudly showed her the special surprise.
His mom was so pleased and gave him a big hug. She said it was very special and thanked him.
The boy was so happy that he had made something so special - just with some glue and a few twists.
