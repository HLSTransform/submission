Sam and Lily were twins who liked to play outside. But today, they were grumpy. They did not want to share their toys or take turns on the swing. They fought and yelled and made a big mess.
"Stop it, you two!" said Mom. "You need to calm down and be nice. Why don't you go for a jog around the park? It will make you feel better."
Sam and Lily did not like this idea. They did not want to jog. They wanted to stay and play. But Mom was firm. She put on their shoes and jackets and told them to go.
Sam and Lily jogged slowly and sulkily. They did not talk to each other or look at the flowers or the birds. They just wanted to go back home. But then, they saw something shiny on the ground. It was a coin. A big, shiny coin.
"Wow, look!" said Sam. "A coin! Maybe we can buy some candy with it!"
"Let me see!" said Lily. "It's mine! I saw it first!"
They started to tug and pull on the coin. They did not notice the big dog that was coming towards them. The dog liked shiny things. He saw the coin and wanted it too. He barked and ran and jumped on Sam and Lily.
"Help!" they screamed. "A dog! A big, scary dog!"
Mom heard their screams and ran to help them. She shooed away the dog and hugged Sam and Lily. They were scared and sorry. They gave Mom the coin and said they were sorry for being grumpy.
"It's okay," said Mom. "I'm glad you're safe. But you see, jogging is not so bad. It can help you find things and make friends. Maybe next time, you can jog with the dog and share the coin."
Sam and Lily nodded. They felt better. They smiled and said they loved Mom. They decided to jog more often and be nice to each other. And they did.
