Lila was a little girl who liked to help her grandma. Her grandma had a cane that she used to walk. Lila wanted to try the cane and see how it felt.
One day, when her grandma was resting on the couch, Lila took the cane and walked around the living room. She pretended to be an old lady and said, "Hello, dear, how are you today?" She thought it was fun to use the cane.
But then, she tripped over a toy and fell down. The cane flew out of her hand and hit the vase on the table. The vase broke and made a loud noise. Lila started to cry.
Her grandma heard the noise and came to see what happened. She saw Lila on the floor, the cane on the carpet, and the vase in pieces. She was not angry, but she was sad.
"Oh, Lila, what did you do?" she asked.
"I'm sorry, grandma, I wanted to try your cane. It looked useful and fun. But I was clumsy and broke your vase. I'm sorry, I'm sorry," Lila sobbed.
Her grandma hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lila, I know you didn't mean to break it. But you have to be careful with my cane. It's not a toy, it's a tool. I need it to walk and balance. It's not for playing. Do you understand?"
Lila nodded and said, "Yes, grandma, I understand. I won't touch your cane again. I love you, grandma."
"I love you too, Lila. Now, let's clean up this mess and find another way to have fun together."
