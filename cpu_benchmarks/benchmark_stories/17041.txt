Once upon a time, in a peaceful land, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to play outside. She liked to run, jump, and laugh with her friends. But there was one thing Sue did not like. Sue did not like the sun. She would say, "I hate the sun."
One day, Sue's mom told her that the sun was important. The sun helped the flowers grow and gave light to the world. Sue thought about this, and she decided to give the sun a chance.
The next day, Sue went outside to play. The sun was shining, and it was a beautiful day. Sue noticed that the sun made her feel warm and happy. She saw that the sun was not so bad after all. From that day on, Sue did not hate the sun anymore.
