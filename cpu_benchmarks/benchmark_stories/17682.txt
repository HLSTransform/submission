Peter and his family went to the opera. It was a jolly evening. Peter was very excited and pulled his dad's hand as they entered the theater.
The opera was full of bright lights, loud music and people clapping. Peter was amazed.
The show was about to begin and the conductor started waving her arms. Suddenly the musicians began playing and the actors started singing. Peter was so excited he could hardly stop jumping and clapping.
After a while, the show ended and their family started to go home. Peter was happy and kept talking about the opera all the way home. His dad had to pull him along so they could reach home in time for dinner. 
They arrived home and the family had a delicious meal together. Peter was so happy that he'd gone to the opera and he already couldn't wait to go to the next one.
