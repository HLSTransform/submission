Ben and Lily are twins. They like to play soccer with their friends. They are on the same team. Their team is called the Tigers. The Tigers are very good at soccer. They can run fast, kick hard, and score goals.
Today, the Tigers have a big game. They have to play against the Lions. The Lions are another team. The Lions are very noisy. They yell and roar and try to scare the Tigers. The Tigers are not scared. They are brave and strong.
Before the game, Ben and Lily pray. They pray to God. They say, "God, please help us play well. Please help us have fun. Please help us be kind to the Lions. And please help us win. Amen."
Then, the game starts. The Tigers and the Lions run and kick and chase the ball. The Lions are still noisy. They say, "We are the best! We will beat you! You are no match for us!" The Tigers are quiet. They say, "We are a team. We work together. We respect you. We will try our best."
The game is very close. Both teams score many goals. But at the end, the Tigers score one more goal than the Lions. The Tigers win! They are very happy. They hug and cheer and thank God. The Lions are sad. They cry and pout and blame each other.
Ben and Lily go to the Lions. They say, "Good game. You played well. You are a good team. Don't be sad. We can be friends." The Lions are surprised. They say, "Really? You are not mad at us? You are not mean to us? You are nice to us?" Ben and Lily say, "Yes. We are nice to you. We are all God's children. We can all pray and play together." The Lions smile. They say, "Thank you. You are right. We are sorry for being noisy. We are sorry for being rude. We can be friends." Then, the Tigers and the Lions hug and cheer and thank God. They are all happy. They are all friends. They are all teams.
