Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play near the river, but his mother always warned him to stay away from the water because of the crocodiles. One day, Timmy saw a cheap toy boat floating in the river and he wanted it so badly. He tried to reach for it, but he fell into the water and started to struggle to stay afloat.
Suddenly, a crocodile appeared and started to swim towards Timmy. Timmy was scared, but he remembered what his mother had told him about staying calm and not moving too much in the water. The crocodile came closer and closer, but Timmy didn't move. The crocodile sniffed around Timmy and then swam away.
Timmy was so happy to be safe, and he realized that his mother was right about the danger of the river. He learned that sometimes things might seem cheap or easy, but they can be very dangerous. From that day on, Timmy never went near the river again without his mother or father by his side.
