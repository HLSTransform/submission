Tom liked to sort his toys. He had a box for cars, a box for blocks, and a box for animals. He put each toy in the right box. He was very good at sorting.
One day, he found a new toy in his room. It was a dragon. It was big and green and had wings and teeth. Tom did not know where to put the dragon. It was not a car, or a block, or an animal. He looked for another box, but there was none.
He decided to make a new box for the dragon. He got some cardboard and tape and scissors. He cut and taped the cardboard until he had a big box. He wrote "dragon" on the side. He was very proud of his box.
He lifted the dragon and tried to put it in the box. But the dragon was too fat. It did not fit in the box. Tom pushed and pulled, but the dragon was stuck. The dragon was not happy. It roared and breathed fire. It burned the box and the tape and the scissors. It freed itself and flew away.
Tom was sad and scared. He had lost his dragon and his box. He ran to his mom and hugged her. He told her what happened. She hugged him back and said, "It's okay, Tom. You did your best. But maybe next time, you should ask me before you play with a dragon."
