Once upon a time there was a rabbit named Ralph. Ralph was very popular with all his friends, but he was very shy. Ralph liked to keep a diary. Every day he wrote down all the things that happened with his friends in his diary.
One day, Ralph and his friends caught a group of birds playing in the garden. They decided to shoot the birds with their toy guns. Poor Ralph didn't want to shoot the birds, but his friends kept encouraging him to join in the fun.
Ralph felt really sad so he ran away. Later that night he wrote in his diary about how bad it felt to shoot the birds. He wrote:" It is never fun to hurt an animal, no matter how popular you are." 
Moral of the story: It is okay to be popular, but it is never okay to hurt animals.
