It was a rainy day. Anna and Ben did not like rainy days. They could not go out and play. They had to stay inside and be bored.
"Mom, can we do something fun?" Anna asked.
"Sure, let me think," Mom said. She looked around the house. She saw some paper, some crayons, and some scissors. "How about we make some suns and stars to shine on the window?"
Anna and Ben liked that idea. They took the paper, the crayons, and the scissors. They cut out some circles and some points. They colored them yellow and orange and red. They made some suns and some stars.
"Look, Mom, we made some suns and some stars!" Ben said. He showed Mom his paper.
"Wow, they are very pretty!" Mom said. She helped them tape them on the window. "Now we have some shine in our house!"
Anna and Ben smiled. They looked at their suns and stars. They saw the rain outside. They did not mind the rain anymore. They had some shine in their house.
