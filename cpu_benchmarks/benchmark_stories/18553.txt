Once upon a time, there was a bird. The bird was gray and it liked to fly. One day, the bird flew too high and hit a tree. Its wing was hurt and it couldn't fly anymore. The bird's friend came to help and said, "I will fix your wing." The friend fixed the bird's wing and soon the bird could fly again. They were happy and flew together in the sky.
