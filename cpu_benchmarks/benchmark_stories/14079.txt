Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to reach a mole in her garden. The mole was digging a very deep tunnel and the little girl wanted to see what was down inside. She was so excited when she saw the mole!
The little girl reached out her hand and was about to grab the mole when it scurried away. The mole was so fast! She was amazed at how quickly it moved.
The little girl followed the mole as it ran around the garden. She chased after it as fast as she could. Finally, she reached the mole just as it was about to go into its hole. She grabbed it with her two hands and gently held it. The mole felt so soft and the little girl thought it was so pretty.
The little girl then gave the mole a kiss on the head and opened her hands to set it free. The mole scampered away and the little girl smiled. She had reached the mole and it was such a wonderful experience.
