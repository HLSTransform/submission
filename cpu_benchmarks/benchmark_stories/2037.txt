Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He was three years old and loved to explore the forest near his house. One day, he decided to go deep into the forest by himself. As he got further and further away from his house, he started to get fearful. 
Suddenly, a loud noise came from behind the trees. Tim was scared and he ran and ran until he came to a door. He stopped and saw a man near the door. The man grabbed something from his pocket, pointed it at the door and shouted, "BANG!"
Tim was very scared and started to cry. He asked the man why he shot the door. The man explained that he was looking for treasure inside and thought the door might be locked. Tim was still very fearful and started to run away. But the man said in a soft voice, "Wait! I won't hurt you."
Tim stopped and slowly turned around. With a sigh of relief, he saw the man smile at him. He smiled back and finally, Tim realised he was no longer scared. The man gave him a hug and they walked back home together.
