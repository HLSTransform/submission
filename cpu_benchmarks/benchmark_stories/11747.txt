Once upon a time there was a little pig who was very excited for sunrise. He was outside his house looking for something to mark. He saw a big rock and decided it was perfect for marking. He picked up a big stick and marked a smiley face on the rock. The pig was so proud of his work.
Just then a bird came flying by and noticed the rock with the smiley face. "That is such an amazing thing to mark. Where did you learn to do it?" asked the bird.
The little pig was so excited to explain. "I learned it all by myself! I just wanted to make something special for the upcoming sunrise," he said.
The bird was very impressed and flew away. The little pig smiled and knew that the smiley face would cheer up the sunrise.
