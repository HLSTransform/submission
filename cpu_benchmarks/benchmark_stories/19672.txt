Once upon a time, there was an ancient brick house. It stood tall and strong for many years.
One day, a family moved into the house. They loved the brick house and were very happy to live there. They decided to make it even better.
So the family gave an order to the brick seller. They asked him to bring many new bricks to the house. The brick seller agreed and brought many colourful bricks to the house.
With the help of their friends, the family put the new bricks around the house. They made an ancient brick house more beautiful than ever before. Everyone agreed it was very nice to look at.
The family stayed in the house for many years and were always happy. They were grateful for the ancient brick house.
