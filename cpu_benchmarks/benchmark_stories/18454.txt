Once upon a time, there was a red ball. It was round and bouncy. A little girl loved to play with it every day. She would throw it up and down and watch it bounce.
One day, the little girl made a wish. She wished that she could play with her ball forever. But then, the ball bounced too high and went over the fence. The little girl was sad because she thought she would never see her ball again.
But then, a kind neighbor saw what happened and helped the little girl get her ball back. The little girl was so happy and grateful. She hugged her ball tightly and promised to never let it bounce away again.
