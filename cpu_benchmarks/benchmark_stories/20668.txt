Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very excited. She loved to roll down hills and around on the floor.
One day, the little girl wanted to show her mother how excited she was. So she ran to her mother, then rolled around the floor, laughing and squealing.
Her mother laughed at how excited the little girl was. She rolled back and forth and around the room. Her mother thought it was the cutest thing ever.
So her mother grabbed both of the little girl's hands and together they started to roll around the room. They laughed and spun around, with the little girl getting more and more excited.
The little girl rolled, laughed, and spun around until she got so dizzy she had to take a rest. She gave her mother a big hug to show her how much she enjoyed playing.
From that day on, whenever she was excited, the little girl would run to her mother and the two would roll around the room.
