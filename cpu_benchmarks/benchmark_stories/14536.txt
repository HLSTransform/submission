Once upon a time there was a perfect cow. She had a big, long horn, like all the other cows. One day, the cow began to feel sad. She didn't know why.
Her owner noticed this and one night decided to take her to a magical field. As they walked through the tall grass, they heard a magical sound. It was getting louder and louder!
Soon enough, the cow realised that her horn was growing! It was getting bigger and bigger. She was so happy and surprised.
The horn kept increasing in size until it was bigger than any other cow's horn. She was the perfect cow with the perfect horn.
The cow finally understood why she felt so sad. It was because she had been waiting for the perfect time to increase her horn!
