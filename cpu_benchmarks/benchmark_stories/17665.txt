Once there was a girl named Daisy. She was 3 years old and wanted to get married. She asked her mom and dad if she could marry.
But her mom and dad said, "No, you are still too young to marry." Daisy was so jealous of all the other grown ups who could marry.
Then Daisy had an idea. She got a special pot and put it on her head and pretended it was a wedding veil. She ran around the house saying, "I'm married! I'm married!"
Her mom and dad watched and laughed. They were happy to see Daisy so happy.
When it was time to go to bed, Daisy went happily to her bed, dreaming of the day when she really could marry.
