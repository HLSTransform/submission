Once upon a time there was a naughty little boy. His parents did not like how rude he was. One day, the boy decided to play near a well in the forest. He thought it would be fun to destroy it.
He quickly found some stones and started throwing them into the well. Splash, splash! He laughed and threw more and more in. Soon, the well was full of stones, and the water had vanished.
The boy's parents were very angry. They scolded him and taught him a lesson. He learned that it was not nice to destroy things. From then on he was a good boy and never destroyed anything again.
