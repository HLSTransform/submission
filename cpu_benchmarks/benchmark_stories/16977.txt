Tom and Lily are twins. They like to read books with Mom and Dad. Every day, they read a book before bed. They have many books, but they have a favorite one. It is about a dog and a cat who are friends.
One day, Mom says, "We need to go to the grocery. We have no milk, no eggs, no bread. Come on, Tom and Lily, put on your shoes and coats." Tom and Lily do not want to go. They want to read their book. They say, "Can we read first, Mom? Please, please, please?"
Mom smiles and says, "No, we have to go now. But you can bring your book and read in the car. How about that?" Tom and Lily think for a moment. They nod and say, "OK, Mom. We will bring our book and read in the car."
They go to the grocery with Mom. They help her put things in the cart. They see apples, bananas, cheese, cookies, and many other things. They also see some books on a shelf. They run to the books and look at them. They see a book about a lion and a mouse who are friends. They say, "Mom, can we have this book? It looks fun. Please, please, please?"
Mom looks at the book and says, "It does look fun, but we have enough books at home. Maybe another time. Come on, we have to pay and go home. It is getting late and you are tired." Tom and Lily are tired. They yawn and say, "OK, Mom. We will read our book in the car."
They go home with Mom. They read their book in the car. They finish it just as they get home. They say, "That was a good book, Mom. We like the dog and the cat. They are nice to each other." Mom says, "I'm glad you like it. Now, let's go inside and have some dinner. Then, you can brush your teeth and go to bed." Tom and Lily say, "OK, Mom. We are hungry and sleepy." They go inside and have some dinner. Then, they brush their teeth and go to bed. They dream of dogs and cats and lions and mice who are friends.
