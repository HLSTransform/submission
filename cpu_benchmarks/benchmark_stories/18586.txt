Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat jam on her toast every morning. One day, she asked her mom if she could help make the jam. Her mom was very helpful and said yes. Lily was so happy to join her mom in the kitchen.
They got all the ingredients they needed and started making the jam. They mashed up the fruit and added sugar. Then they cooked it on the stove until it turned into yummy jam. Lily was so proud of herself for helping her mom and making something so delicious.
From that day on, Lily helped her mom make jam every week. She loved being helpful and spending time with her mom in the kitchen. And of course, she always got to enjoy the yummy jam on her toast. The end.
