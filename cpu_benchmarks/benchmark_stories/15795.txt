Once upon a time, a naughty bear lived in a tree. He liked to eat yummy food, just like everyone else. One day, he had an idea. He suggested to the other animals that they should have a picnic. Everyone said it was a great idea, so they set off to find some food.
The bear found a big melon that he wanted to share out between them all. The other animals thought this was a great idea too.
But then, the naughty bear decided it was too big to carry. So he suggested they all eat it right away. All the animals laughed and started to eat the yummy melon. They enjoyed every bite. 
The bear was so happy that he suggested they do it again the next day!
