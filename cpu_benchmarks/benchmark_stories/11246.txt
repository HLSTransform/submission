Once upon a time there was a little girl named Maggie. She was three years old and always very loyal to her family.
One day, she was out in the park with her mom and dad. They were all walking around together, when suddenly, Maggie saw a bench. She pointed it out to her parents and said, "Mommy, Daddy, seat!"
Her mom and dad smiled and they all sat on the bench together. Maggie said, "Look, I'm so loyal to you both."
Her mom and dad smiled and said, "That's very sweet, Maggie. We're so lucky to have such a loyal daughter." They hugged Maggie and they all enjoyed the rest of their time in the park.
