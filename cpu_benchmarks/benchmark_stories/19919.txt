Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited because her grandma was coming to visit her. Lily loved her grandma very much and couldn't wait to see her. But as the day of the visit came closer, Lily started feeling nervous. She didn't want anything to go wrong and wanted to make sure her grandma had a good time.
When her grandma arrived, Lily hugged her tightly and showed her around her room. They played games and had snacks together. But then, when it was time for her grandma to leave, Lily started feeling sad. She didn't want her grandma to go.
As her grandma hugged her goodbye, Lily sighed and said, "I wish you could stay forever." Her grandma smiled and said, "I wish I could too, but I'll always be in your heart. Remember to cherish the time you have with the people you love."
From that day on, Lily learned to enjoy the visits with her grandma and other loved ones, and to always make the most of the time they spent together.
