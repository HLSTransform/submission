Once upon a time, there were two friends named Tom and Sue. Tom wanted to go on a tour, but Sue was being stubborn. Tom kept trying to talk to Sue about why he wanted to go on a tour. But Sue still didn't want to go. Even though she wasn't sure why, Sue just didn't want to go.
Finally, Tom said to Sue, "Come on, let's go for a tour and have lots of fun!" Tom's words were so persuasive that Sue agreed to go on the tour.
They ended up having a wonderful day seeing lots of new places and meeting lots of new people. Sue was so glad that she chose to follow Tom's suggestion and go on the tour.
