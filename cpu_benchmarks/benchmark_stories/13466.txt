Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily had a computer. She loved to play games on it every day. One day, while playing her favorite game, she accidentally knocked over her glass of juice onto the computer. The computer stopped working, and Lily was very sad.
Lily's mom tried to fix the computer, but she was clumsy and couldn't do it. Lily's dad came home and saw what happened. He said, "Don't worry, Lily. I'll pick up the computer and take it to the store to get fixed."
Lily was happy that her dad was going to help her. She said, "Thank you, Daddy!" Her dad replied, "No problem, sweetie. I'll make sure your computer is fixed soon."
