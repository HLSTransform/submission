Once upon a time there was a beautiful pine tree in the woods. It was tall, strong and thick. One day a little girl came up to it and said, "I want to play with the pine tree."
The little girl pushed and pushed and pushed the pine tree. She didn't know how thick the tree was and she couldn't push it down. She started getting frustrated and shouted, "I need help!"
Just then a big strong man came walking by and saw what the little girl was trying to do. The man said, "Let me give it a try!" He pushed and pushed and finally, the pine tree started to fall.
The little girl was so happy and thanked the man. She said, "Thank you for helping me push the thick pine tree!" 
The man smiled and said, "It was no problem! You can always come back and play with the pine tree anytime."
The little girl thanked the man again, waved goodbye and ran off to play with the pine tree.
