Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park, but one day she fell down and hurt her knee. It was very uncomfortable and she started to cry. Her mom came to help her and gave her a bandaid to make it feel better.
Lily was sad because she didn't want to fall again and get hurt. Her mom told her that it's okay to fall sometimes, but we need to learn from our mistakes and be careful next time. Lily didn't understand what her mom meant, but she listened carefully.
Later that day, Lily was looking at some pictures with her mom. They were memories of when she was a baby. Lily was happy looking at the pictures and remembering all the fun times she had. Her mom told her that memories are like treasures that we keep in our hearts forever.
Lily realized that even though falling down was uncomfortable, it was a memory that she could learn from. She promised herself to be more careful next time and to make more happy memories. From that day on, Lily was more careful when playing outside and always remembered to treasure her memories.
