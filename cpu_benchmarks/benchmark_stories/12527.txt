Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with her pencil. One day, Lily went to the park to draw some pictures. She was having so much fun that she didn't notice a dog coming towards her. The dog was hungry and wanted to bite Lily's pencil. Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. But then, the dog just licked her hand and walked away. From that day on, Lily always made sure to keep her pencil close to her.
