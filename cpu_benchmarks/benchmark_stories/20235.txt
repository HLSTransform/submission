Sara was a big girl who liked to teach her little brother Tom. She taught him how to count, how to draw, and how to play games. She was very proud of him and gave him hugs and kisses.
One day, Sara and Tom went to the park with their mom. They saw a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. Sara wanted to teach Tom how to slide, how to swing, and how to make sandcastles. But Tom was scared of the slide, he did not like the swing, and he hated the sand. He cried and said he wanted to go home.
Sara was angry and said, "Tom, you are a baby. You don't want to learn anything. You don't know how to have fun. You are missing out on a luxury. I don't want to teach you anymore."
Mom heard Sara and said, "Sara, that is not nice. Tom is your brother and he loves you. He is not a baby, he is just different from you. He likes other things, like books, puzzles, and music. You should respect his choices and not force him to do what you like. Maybe you can learn something from him too. Teaching is not only about telling, it is also about listening and understanding."
Sara felt sorry and said, "You are right, mom. I was mean to Tom. I should be more kind and patient. I want to learn from him too. I love him very much."
She hugged Tom and said, "I'm sorry, Tom. I didn't mean to hurt you. You are not a baby, you are a smart boy. You can teach me something too. What do you want to do?"
Tom smiled and said, "I want to read a book with you. It is cold outside, let's go home and cuddle on the couch."
Sara agreed and said, "That sounds like a luxury to me. Let's go home and read a book together."
They held hands and walked home with mom. They learned that teaching and learning are not only about skills, but also about love and respect.
