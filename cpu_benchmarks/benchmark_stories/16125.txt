Timmy and his mommy were walking in a park. It was a nice day but suddenly, a man came from the bushes with a gun. His clothes were filthy and Timmy was scared. His mommy was scared, too.
"I'm sorry," the man said. "I just need some money to buy food."
Timmy's mommy didn't have any money but she said, "I hope there's another way for you to get food other than this."
The man seemed to consider her words for a minute and then he said, "I hope so too." He put the gun away and he walked away.
Timmy and his mommy were relieved. They hugged each other, thankful to have avoided a terrible situation. They looked around to make sure the man was gone and then they continued their walk.
It was a much nicer afternoon after this. Timmy and his mommy looked forward to many more nice days spent together in the park.
