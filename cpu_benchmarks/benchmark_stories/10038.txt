Once upon a time, there was a farmer who grew lots of corn. He was a very helpful man and loved to share his corn with his friends. One day, his friend who was a girl told him that she wanted to marry him. The farmer was surprised but happy. He said yes and they got married. They had a big feast with lots of corn and everyone had a great time. From that day on, they worked together on the farm and grew lots of corn. They were very happy together.
