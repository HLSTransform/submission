Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch his favorite TV show, but one day his cable stopped working. Timmy was sad and asked his mom why the TV wasn't working. 
Mom said, "The cable is broken, Timmy. We need to call someone to fix it." 
Timmy asked, "Why does the cable suffer?" 
Mom explained, "Sometimes things break and suffer, but we can fix them." 
Timmy thought for a moment and said, "I don't like stupid broken cables. I want to watch my show." 
Mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, Timmy. We'll fix it soon and you can watch your show again." 
Timmy felt better knowing that the cable would be fixed and he could watch his favorite show again.
