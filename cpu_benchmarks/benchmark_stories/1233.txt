Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a tutor named Mr. Smith who came to her house every day to teach her new things. One day, Lily decided to play a joke on Mr. Smith. She put a toy spider in his bag and waited for him to find it.
When Mr. Smith arrived, he put his bag down and started to teach Lily. Suddenly, he saw the toy spider and jumped up in fright. Lily laughed and said, "I made a joke on you, Mr. Smith!" Mr. Smith smiled and said, "That was a terrible joke, Lily. But it's okay, we can still learn."
After their lesson, Mr. Smith packed up his things and said goodbye to Lily. As he was walking down the street, he tripped and fell. He hit his head on the pavement and was hurt very badly. Lily's joke had distracted him and caused the accident. Lily felt very sad and wished she had never played that terrible joke.
