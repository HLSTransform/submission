Once upon a time, Lilly the crocodile went for a walk in the park. While she was walking, she saw a small pond and she decided to take a closer look.
When she reached the pond, she was amazed by what she saw - a lot of green frogs were jumping around. 
Lilly smiled and said: "Hello, frogs! What are you doing?" 
The frogs replied: "We are having fun playing and displaying our green colours!"
So Lilly joined in and displayed her green colours too. She laughed and jumped around with the frogs. They had so much fun!
When it was time to go home, Lilly waved goodbye to her new friends. She was so happy that she had gotten to display her green colours and make some new friends.
