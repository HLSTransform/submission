Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go on adventures with his mommy and daddy. One day, they decided to go to the museum. Timmy was so excited to see all the cool things at the museum.
When they got to the museum, Timmy's mommy told him to hold her hand so they wouldn't get lost. Timmy understood and held on tight. They walked around and saw lots of interesting things. Timmy's favorite exhibit was the dinosaur exhibit. He thought the bones were so cool!
After they finished looking at everything, Timmy's daddy said it was time to go. Timmy's mommy made sure they didn't leave anything behind and they left the museum. Timmy was sad to leave, but he was happy that he got to see all the cool things.
