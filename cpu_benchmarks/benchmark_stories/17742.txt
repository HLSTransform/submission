Once upon a time, there was a girl called Sarah. Sarah liked to find things. One day she went to the park and found a tape measure. She was so excited and she said “This is perfect for me!” She had lots of fun using it to measure things.
First, she measured the big tree in the park. She found that it was very tall. Then she measured the slide and it was just right for her. She measured lots of other things and was very happy with all her measurements.
At the end of the day, Sarah was tired but very proud of her perfect measuring. She put her tape measure away in her pocket and made a promise to measure lots more things in the future!
