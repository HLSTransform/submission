Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mary. She loved to explore and was always looking for new and exciting places to play. One day she found a creek near her home and she was so excited. She raced home to grab a bucket and some friends and went to the creek and played in the water.
Mary noticed the water had an orange tint to it. She wondered why it was that color and went to ask her dad.
He said, "the orange in the water comes from the factories upstream. They use too much of the chemicals and it pollutes the creek."
Mary felt bad for the creek and decided to help. She told her friends and they all worked together to help keep the creek clean. They would pick up the trash and make sure the factories were following the rules.
Maryâ€™s dad was very proud of her and said, "you have served the creek well by helping to keep it clean and healthy."
The moral of the story is; when you help take care of the environment you are helping to serve your community.
