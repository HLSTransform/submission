Tommy was very excited as he climbed the steps to the cabin. It was a special place, full of furry animals and special treasures. As he stepped through the door, he saw something hairy hanging from the wall. He walked up to it and realized it was a towel. He took it down and wiped his hands on it.
Tommy gazed around the cabin, amazed by the treasures inside. He found shiny rocks and furry dolls, colorful books and fun toys. But he was most interested in the furry animals. He saw a rabbit and a dog, a bear and a giant hairy spider. Tommy was so excited he couldn't help but smile.
He saw that the furry spider was covered in sticky webs and he wanted to help it. So he grabbed the towel and wiped away all the webs. When he finished, the spider was so happy, it jumped onto his shoulder and hugged him. Tommy laughed and thanked the spider for the special hug.
Tommy couldn't believe all the fun he had in the cabin, and he knew he'd always remember the time spent there.
