Once upon a time, there were two friends, Lily and Lucy. Lily was very excited because she was about to take a special trip. She said to Lucy: "I am going to travel to Grandma's house! She is going to give me a gift."
Lucy was surprised. She asked Lily, "What gift will you get?"
Lily smiled. "I don't know," she replied. "It's a surprise!"
So, Lily packed her bag and set off. She took an ordinary train and an ordinary bus, and when she arrived at Grandma's house, it was waiting for her.
Grandma hugged her and said, "I have a special gift for you!" She handed Lily a beautifully wrapped box. Lily quickly opened it and found a beautiful doll inside.
Lily was so excited. She thanked Grandma for the wonderful gift and said, "This is the best trip I've ever taken!"
