Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl named Amy. She lived on a farm with her mom, dad, and her dog, Spot. They grew wheat on their farm. Wheat is a plant that people use to make bread.
One day, Amy's mom and dad had to go to the town. They needed to pack the wheat in big bags to sell it. Amy wanted to help them. She put on her hat, grabbed a big bag, and went to the wheat field. Spot, her dog, went with her.
Amy and Spot worked hard to pack the wheat into the big bags. They filled one bag, then two, then three! When they were done, they were very tired but happy. Amy was proud to be a brave helper on the farm. And her mom and dad were proud of her too.
