Once upon a time, there was a fireman named Jack. Jack was a brave man who liked to help people. One day, Jack heard a loud noise coming from a house. He ran to the house and saw that it was on fire. The fire was big and hot, and Jack could feel the heat on his face. 
Jack quickly got his hose and sprayed water on the fire. The fire was very wet, and it started to go out. But then, Jack heard a scream. It was a little girl who was trapped inside the house. Jack tried to save her, but the fire was too strong. 
In the end, the little girl was not able to be saved. Jack was sad and wet from the water. He knew that he did his best, but he still felt bad. From that day on, Jack always remembered the little girl and how he could not save her from the fire.
