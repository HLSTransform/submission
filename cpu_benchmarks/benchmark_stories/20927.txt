Jack was a three year old boy who was feeling very guilty. He had broken his mum's favourite vase. He knew he should not have done it and he knew it was wrong.
Jack's mum came into the room and saw the vase on the floor.
"Oh, Jack," she exclaimed sadly, "what have you done?"
Jack cowered and couldn't look at his parent. "I'm sorry," he whispered.
Jack's mum sighed and lifted him into her arms. Despite her disappointment, Jack could see the love in her eyes.
"It's okay, Jack. I know it was an accident. But you should always think before you act," she said.
Jack hugged his mum tightly. He was relieved and vowed never to do it again.
From that moment on, Jack was very careful whenever he was around anything fragile. He was determined to not make his parent disappointed again.
