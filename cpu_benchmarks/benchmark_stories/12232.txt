One morning, Jack's mother was making toast for breakfast. She put the pieces of bread in the toaster. Suddenly, the toaster made a loud noise. Jack's mom said, "Oh no! The toaster needs to be replaced!"
Jack was sad. He said, "What? I like toast for breakfast. It's so nice!"
His mom said, "I'm sorry, honey. We need a new toaster."
Jack was frustrated. He looked around the kitchen for something to replace the toaster. He asked, "Can I try replacing it with this blender?"
His mom said, "No, that won't work. We need to get a new toaster."
Jack pouted but he eventually agreed. The next day, Jack's mom came home with the new toaster and Jack was excited! He said, "It's so nice and shiny! Let's make toast!" They both made nice, warm toast and shared it for breakfast. Jack was happy to replace the old toaster.
