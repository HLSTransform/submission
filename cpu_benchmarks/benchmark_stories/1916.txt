The little boy's eyes lit up with surprise when he saw the tall building. It seemed to be glowing in the sunlight. He wanted to go closer and explore it. 
So, the little boy started to walk towards the building. He was so excited! But when he got close to the building, something strange happened. He felt a vast, empty feeling inside. He tried to understand why he felt this way.
Suddenly, he heard a loud sound. Then he felt a big gust of wind. The tall building was starting to shake and crumble. He was scared and ran away from the building, but it was too late. The building crashed down and the little boy was sadly trapped beneath it. He cried for help, but no one heard him. 
The little boy will never forget that tall glowing building and the immense feeling of surprise he felt that day. Sadly, the surprise had a bad ending.
