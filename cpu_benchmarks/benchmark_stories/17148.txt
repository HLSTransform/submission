Once upon a time, there was a young squirrel named Sammy. Sammy loved to run around and collect nuts to eat. One day, Sammy was running so fast that he almost crashed into his friend, Benny the bunny.
Benny said, "Hey Sammy, why are you in such a hurry?"
Sammy replied, "I need to get to the nut tree before the other animals do. I want to collect as many nuts as I can."
Benny said, "Well, be careful not to trip and fall. You don't want to lose all your nuts."
Sammy thanked Benny for the advice and continued to speed towards the nut tree. When he got there, he saw that all the nuts were gone. He was sad and disappointed. But then he remembered what Benny said and realized he still had the nut he had in his pocket. He was happy to have at least one nut to eat. From then on, Sammy learned to slow down and enjoy the journey, not just the destination.
