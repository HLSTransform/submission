Once upon a time, there was a pretty birdie named Tweety. Tweety was very graceful and flew high in the sky. One day, Tweety saw a little boy peeking through the bushes. The boy was curious about the birdie and wanted to be friends with Tweety. 
Tweety decided to teach the boy some math. They counted the flowers and the trees in the garden. The boy was very happy to learn and thanked Tweety for being a good teacher. 
As the sun started to set, Tweety said goodbye to the boy and flew away. The boy waved goodbye and promised to visit Tweety again. From that day on, the boy loved math and always remembered Tweety's graceful flight.
