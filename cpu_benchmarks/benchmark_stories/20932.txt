Once upon a time, two friends named Ned and Chris wanted to go on an adventure. They looked around and saw a team of horses and men. The horses were big, but Ned and Chris made them feel brave.
The team marched to a big, scary cave. They looked all around, but they didn't see anything. That's when they heard a spooky noise. It was so loud and scary, they were scared.
Ned and Chris didn't want to go in the cave, but they had to. They held hands so they wouldn't be scared. Finally, they went inside.
It was dark and cold, but underneath it all, there was something magical about the cave. The friends looked around and to their amazement, the cave was filled with candy and toys! Ned and Chris had a wonderful time.
They left the cave feeling happy and safe. They said goodbye to the team and decided to go back to their adventure another day.
