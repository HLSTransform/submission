Max was excited. He was going to go outside and see the unusual sky. He looked up and saw the dark clouds and wondered what form the clouds would take. He began to run towards them, but was stopped by his mom. 
"No, Max," she said. "It's not safe outside. It's starting to lock."
Max didn't understand what she meant, but he knew she was serious. He saw that his mom had a worried look on her face. He was beginning to understand why he couldn't go outside.
The clouds were now darkening, and the wind was getting stronger. Max knew something bad was coming, and then it happened. Lightning struck and thunder roared. In an instant, the sky had turned from beautiful and unusual to menacing. Max was scared and ran back into the house, but it was too late. The sky had locked them inside. 
Max's mom held him tightly, telling him that everything would be alright. But Max knew that nothing would ever be the same.
