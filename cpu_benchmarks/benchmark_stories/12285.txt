Billy and his best friend Susan were playing in their backyard. Billy said, "Let's sort the rocks". Susan said, "No, let's get some oil and play with it instead". Billy said, "No, I want to sort the rocks". Then Susan said, "That's a crazy idea. We should play with the oil instead!".
Billy crossed his arms and said, "No, I want to sort the rocks". Susan looks confused, then she said, "Why is sorting the rocks so important?". Billy said, "I just think it'll be fun". Susan said, "OK, let's try it then!".
So they both started to sort the rocks into different piles. But then, when they were almost done, the wind blew and scattered all the rocks everywhere. Billy and Susan both groaned in frustration.
Billy said, "That's so annoying! Now we have to start all over again". Susan said, "It's ok, it was fun while it lasted". Then she said, "Let's go get that oil and play with it". Billy smiled and said, "Alright, let's do it!". And so they played with the oil and had lots of fun!
