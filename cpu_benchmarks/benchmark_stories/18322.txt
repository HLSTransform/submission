Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color with her crayons. One day, she wanted to draw a picture of her family, but she couldn't find her favorite crayon. She looked everywhere, but it was nowhere to be found.
Lily started to get upset and cried. Her mom came over and asked what was wrong. Lily told her that she couldn't find her favorite crayon. Her mom told her to open her folder where she kept all her art supplies. Lily opened her folder and there it was, her favorite crayon!
Lily realized that sometimes things are right in front of us, but we just need to look for them. She felt foolish for getting upset and crying. From that day on, Lily always checked her folder first before getting upset. The moral of the story is to always look for things before getting upset and to keep things organized in a folder.
