Once upon a time, there was a rabbit named Benny. Benny was very generous and loved to share his carrots with his friends.
One day, Benny went to the river to drink some water. While he was there, he accidentally fell in the water and got all wet. He wanted to go home but he didn't want to be wet. So, he asked his friend, a little bird, "Can you help me dry off?"
The little bird replied, "Sure, I can help you dry off. Let me flap my wings and make you dry." The little bird flapped his wings and Benny became dry. Benny was very happy and thanked his friend for being so helpful. From that day on, Benny and the little bird were the best of friends.
