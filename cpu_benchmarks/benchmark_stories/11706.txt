Once upon a time, there was a bunny. The bunny liked to hop under a tree in the meadow. One day, the bunny was hopping around and he found a box. What could be inside? He hopped closer to take a look. In the box, the bunny saw something shiny and green. He went to take it, but just then, the shiny green thing vanished! The bunny was so surprised, he hopped away fast. The bunny never saw that shiny, green thing again. 
The next day, the bunny wanted to know what happened. He found the box was still there, but there was something else in it now. He hopped closer and saw that the box was filled with dead bugs! Sometimes things can vanish and then appear somewhere else. The bunny hopped away, never to go under that tree again.
