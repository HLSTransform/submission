Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a new path in the park. It is brown and twisty.
"Let's go there!" Lily says. She is curious.
"OK!" Ben says. He is brave.
They hold hands and step on the path. They see flowers and bugs and birds. They are happy.
But then, they see a big dog. It is black and furry and loud. It barks at them. They are scared.
"Go away!" Lily says. She is angry.
"Shoo!" Ben says. He is nervous.
But the dog does not go away. It comes closer and closer. They are very scared.
Then, they see a clever cat. It is white and fluffy and quiet. It jumps on the dog. It scratches and bites. It makes the dog run away. They are relieved.
"Thank you!" Lily says. She is grateful.
"Wow!" Ben says. He is amazed.
The cat purrs and rubs against them. It is friendly.
"Can we keep it?" Lily asks. She is hopeful.
"Please?" Ben asks. He is eager.
They hug the cat and smile. They are happy.
