Lily was out at the park with her parents on a sunny day. Her daddy was throwing a frisbee for her to catch. Suddenly, he shouted "Lily, look up!" She looked up, and saw a large bird with a gray body flying above her. It had a big heart on its chest.
Lily exclaimed "Look, Mommy! What is it?" Her mother replied "It is a lovebird. It is very rare!" Lily said "I want it!"
Lily's father then said "Don't worry, I won't let it get away. Get ready!" He took out a gun and shot the air. The lovebird flew away, scared.
Lily was sad and started to cry. She said "I wanted the bird! I wanted to keep it!" Her mother said "Sometimes, it is better to let things go. It is for their own good"
Lily understood and said "I won't make the same mistake again. I know now the best thing to do is to help my friends fly!" Lily's happy parents hugged her in joy. They were happy that Lily had learned a valuable lesson.
