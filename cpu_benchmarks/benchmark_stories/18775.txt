Lily liked to watch her favorite show on the screen. It was about a cheerful dog who had many friends and went on adventures. Lily knew all the songs and words and liked to repeat them with the dog.
One day, Lily's mom said they had to go to the store and could not watch the screen. Lily was sad and did not want to go. She wanted to stay and watch the dog. She cried and said "No, no, no!"
But mom said they had to go and they would be back soon. She said Lily could watch the screen later and maybe see something new. She said the dog would be happy to see Lily again. She gave Lily a hug and a kiss and took her hand.
Lily and mom went to the store and saw many things. They saw fruits and vegetables and bread and cheese. They saw toys and books and clothes and shoes. Lily saw a stuffed dog that looked like the one on the screen. She smiled and asked mom if she could have it.
Mom said yes and bought the dog for Lily. Lily was very happy and hugged the dog. She said "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" She named the dog Spot and said he was her new friend. She sang the songs and said the words with Spot.
Lily and mom went back home and watched the screen. Lily saw the dog on the screen and said "Look, Spot, it's you!" She repeated the songs and words with Spot and the dog on the screen. They had fun and laughed and learned. Lily was cheerful and so was mom. They loved each other and the dog. The end.
