Once upon a time there lived a sweet little girl called Jane.
Every day Jane would dream of becoming a tiger. She imagined what it would feel like to be a tiger and how she could roar like a wild animal.
One morning, as Jane was walking in the park, she saw a tiger in the distance. Jane ran up to the tiger and said, “Wow, you are so big and strong! Can I become a tiger too?”
The tiger smiled at Jane and said, “Yes, you can be a tiger too if you believe in yourself. Just be brave and show others how brave you can be.”
Jane shouted, “Yes! I can do it! I am a brave tiger!” She ran around roaring with joy, feeling so happy and strong.
From that day on, Jane turned into a tiger every day, becoming brave and strong and showing others that she could be sweet and wild at the same time.
