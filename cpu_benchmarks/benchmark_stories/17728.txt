Once there was a little girl named Sarah. She was very curious and liked to explore. One day Sarah was feeling hungry and she looked around her house for something to eat. Then she saw a piece of paper on the counter.
Sarah picked up the paper and looked at it. She became very curious about it and started to play with it. She held it up in the air and watched it flutter like a butterfly. She giggled and kept playing.
Suddenly Sarah's tummy began to rumble. She realized that she was still very hungry. Sarah crumpled up the paper and took a bite. It tasted terrible, but it filled her hungry tummy.
From that day onwards she became more careful what she ate. She even learned how to make paper airplanes and flew them around her room when she was feeling hungry. So whenever Sarah got a craving for something, she always reached for some paper instead!
