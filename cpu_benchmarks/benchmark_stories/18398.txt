Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her blocks and build towers. One day, she went outside to play and saw her friend, Timmy. 
"Hi Timmy!" said Lily. "Do you want to build a tower with me?"
"Yes, I do!" said Timmy. "But first we have to clean up this mess."
Timmy grabbed a mop and together they cleaned up the toys. After they were done, they started building their tower. It was a modest tower, not too big or too small. 
"Wow, we did it!" said Lily. "Our tower is so pretty."
"I know," said Timmy. "We make a great team."
