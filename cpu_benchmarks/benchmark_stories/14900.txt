The octopus felt so busy. He swam around in the ocean looking for food and shelter. He smiled when he saw a ship in the distance. 
He thought that maybe the people on the ship could help. He swam closer, shouting 'HELP!'. But the people on the ship were too busy to hear him. 
He shouted again, but still no response. Frustrated, the octopus swam away. He swam far away from the ship, feeling so sad. 
But then he heard a voice in the water. He looked around and saw a shark looking at him. The shark said 'I will help you. Follow me'. 
The octopus followed the shark, smiling. But then the shark attacked and ate the octopus. The octopus didnâ€™t make it. 
And that was the end of the octopus' story.
