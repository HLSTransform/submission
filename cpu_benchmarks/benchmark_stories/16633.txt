Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big hill of dirt. They want to act like they are on the moon.
"Let's go to the moon!" Tom says. He runs to the hill. He jumps and lands on the dirt. He pretends to be an astronaut.
Sue follows him. She jumps and lands on the dirt too. She pretends to be an astronaut too. They have fun.
But then they see a big dog. The dog is barking. The dog runs to the hill. The dog wants to play.
"Look, a moon dog!" Tom says. He is not scared. He likes dogs.
But Sue is scared. She does not like dogs. She thinks the dog is angry.
"Help, help!" Sue says. She runs away from the dog. She runs to the slide. She slides down fast.
Tom sees Sue. He wants to help her. He runs after her. He calls the dog.
"Here, boy, here!" Tom says. He tries to be nice to the dog. He hopes the dog will stop barking.
The dog hears Tom. The dog stops running. The dog looks at Tom. The dog wags his tail. The dog is not angry. The dog is friendly.
Tom pets the dog. The dog licks Tom. Tom smiles.
"Sue, it's okay!" Tom says. "The dog is nice. He just wants to play."
Sue hears Tom. She sees the dog. She sees the dog is nice. She is not scared anymore.
She comes back to the hill. She pets the dog too. The dog licks Sue. Sue smiles.
They all play together. They act like they are on the moon. They have more fun.
The end.
