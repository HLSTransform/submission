Once upon a time, there was a lazy cat named Tom. Tom liked to sleep all day and didn't like to play with his friends. One day, Tom's friend, a curious mouse named Max, went on an adventure to discover new things.
Max found a big box with a ruler inside. He didn't know what it was, but he wanted to measure things with it. So, he took the ruler and went back to Tom's house.
When Max got to Tom's house, he saw Tom sleeping on the couch. Max wanted to measure how long Tom was, so he used the ruler to measure Tom's body. To his surprise, Tom was longer than he thought!
Tom woke up and saw Max measuring him. He was surprised too! Tom realized that he had been lazy and wanted to discover new things too. From that day on, Tom and Max went on many adventures together, measuring and discovering new things.
