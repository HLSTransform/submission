Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a big birthday party coming up and his mom had an important job for him. She asked him to cut the cake and put candles on it. Timmy was so excited to help his mom. 
He got a big knife and started to cut the cake. It was a big cake, but Timmy was strong. He cut it into many pieces. After that, he put candles on the cake. There were ten candles, one for each year of his age. 
When the party started, Timmy's mom brought out the cake. Everyone sang "Happy Birthday" and Timmy blew out the candles. He was so happy that he could help his mom. From that day on, Timmy knew that he was an important part of his family.
