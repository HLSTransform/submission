Sam was a brave little boy who liked to explore. One day he found a fierce beehive. He wanted to take a look inside, but soon he was stung by the bees and he started to cry. 
His dad gave him a bandage and some medicine to make it feel better. Sam decided that he was going to be brave and he was going to think of something clever. 
He made a clever plan with a stick and the bandage. He tied the bandage around the stick and then opened the beehive. The bees stayed safe inside. 
Sam was so happy that he was able to make the bees feel safe. He learned that it's important to think before he acts.
