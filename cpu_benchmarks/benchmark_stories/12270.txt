One day, a girl was in a car with her mom and dad. She saw lots of cars driving on the road. She thought it was fun. Her mom promised to take her for a drive. 
The next day, they got in the car and drove for a long time. At last, they stopped by a pond. The girl saw a swan swimming in the pond. She gasped with delight. She wanted to go near the swan, but her dad reminded her that it was not a good idea. 
The girl felt foolish. She stayed in the car and watched the swan for a few minutes. She thought about her dad's words and decided to respect the majestic bird. 
Afterwards, the girl thought she wasn't so foolish after all. She had learned an important lesson: Always respect nature and the creatures in it.
