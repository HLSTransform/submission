Tom liked to record his voice with his toy. It was a red toy with a button and a speaker. He could press the button and say something, then press it again and hear his voice. He thought it was very funny.
One day, he took his toy to his room. He wanted to record some stories for his teddy bear. He put his teddy on his bed and said, "Hello, teddy. I will tell you some stories. Listen well." He pressed the button and started to talk.
He told teddy about the time he went to the park with his mom and saw a big dog. He told teddy about the time he made a cake with his dad and ate some icing. He told teddy about the time he played with his friends and made a fort. He was very jolly and laughed a lot.
When he finished, he pressed the button again and listened to his stories. He smiled and said, "Did you like my stories, teddy? I think they are very good." He hugged his teddy and played the stories again.
He did not know that his mom was outside his room. She heard his voice and his stories. She thought he was very clever and sweet. She opened the door and said, "Tom, I heard your stories. They are wonderful. Can I listen with you and teddy?" Tom was happy and said, "Yes, mom. Come in. I will play them for you." He pressed the button and shared his stories with his mom and teddy. They were all very jolly.
