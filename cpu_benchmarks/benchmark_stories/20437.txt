Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved her red jacket very much because it kept her warm when it was cold outside. One day, Lily and her mom went for a walk in the park. Suddenly, Lily saw a mysterious object on the ground.
"What's that?" asked Lily.
"I don't know, let's go take a look," said her mom.
They walked over to the object and saw that it was an old apple. The apple was starting to rot and had become very soft. Lily and her mom decided to leave the mysterious apple on the ground and continue their walk in the park. As they walked, Lily felt very happy and safe in her red jacket.
