Once upon a time, there was a man who lived in a little hut. The man was very sad and unhappy. His hut was old and miserable, and he didn't have any friends to play with. 
One day, the man decided to work hard and fix his hut. He went outside and collected wood, nails, and a hammer. He worked all day long, and when he was finished, his hut looked beautiful! 
The man was very happy and proud of his hard work. He sat outside his hut and smiled at the sun. Suddenly, a little bird flew down and perched on his shoulder. The man was so surprised and happy that he started to cry. From that day on, the man had a new friend to play with and his hut was no longer miserable.
