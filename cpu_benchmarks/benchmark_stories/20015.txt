Tom and Lily were playing in the living room. They liked to pretend they were in a castle, and they used the sofa and the pillows as their fort. They also used a big curtain that Mom had bought for the window. It was a very expensive curtain, with shiny gold and red patterns. Mom said they had to be careful with it, and not make it dirty or tear it.
But Tom and Lily did not listen. They wanted to make the curtain their flag, and hang it from the sofa. They pulled and tugged at the curtain, trying to make it reach the top. They did not see that the curtain was getting loose from the rod.
"Look, Lily, we did it!" Tom said, as he hung the curtain over the sofa. "We have the best flag ever!"
But then, they heard a loud snap. The curtain rod broke, and the curtain fell down with a thud. The gold and red patterns were covered with dust and stains. Tom and Lily gasped. They knew they were in trouble.
Mom came running from the kitchen. She saw the mess and the broken rod. She was very angry.
"Tom! Lily! What have you done?" she shouted. "This was a very expensive curtain! How could you be so careless and naughty?"
Tom and Lily felt sorry. They knew they had made a big mistake. They hung their heads and said in a small voice:
"We're sorry, Mom. We just wanted to play."
Mom sighed. She was still angry, but she also loved her children. She knew they did not mean to ruin the curtain. She decided to teach them a lesson.
"Tom, Lily, you have to learn to respect other people's things. This curtain was not a toy. It was a gift from Grandma. You have to pay for the damage you caused. You will have to do extra chores for a week, and use your allowance to buy a new rod. Do you understand?"
Tom and Lily nodded. They felt ashamed. They said:
"Yes, Mom. We understand. We will do better next time."
Mom hugged them and said:
"I hope so. I love you, but I also want you to be responsible. Now, help me clean up this mess."
Tom and Lily helped Mom pick up the curtain and the rod. They hoped Grandma would not be too upset when she saw the curtain. They learned their lesson. They never played with the curtain again.
