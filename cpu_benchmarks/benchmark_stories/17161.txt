Once upon a time, there was a chubby bunny named Benny. Benny loved to eat melons all day long! One day, Benny's friend Timmy came over to play. Timmy saw Benny munching on a juicy melon and requested if he could have a bite. Benny happily shared his melon with Timmy. 
Later that day, Benny and Timmy went for a walk in the forest. They saw a big tree with lots of branches. Timmy requested if they could climb the tree. Benny was a bit scared, but he agreed to climb with Timmy. They climbed and climbed until they reached the top of the tree. From there, they could see the whole forest! 
As the sun began to set, Benny and Timmy climbed back down the tree and said their goodbyes. Benny went to bed with a happy tummy from eating his melon and a happy heart from sharing with his friend.
