Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cup that she loved to drink juice from every day. The cup was dependable and never spilled.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and brought her cup with her. She played on the swings and the slide, but then she noticed her cup was missing. She asked her mom if she had seen it, but her mom questioned her and said she didn't know.
Lily looked everywhere for her cup, but she couldn't find it. She felt sad and didn't want to play anymore. When it was time to go home, Lily still didn't have her cup. She cried all the way home. It was a bad ending to a fun day at the park.
