Anna and Ben like to play with sand. They have a big bucket and a small shovel. They want to make a castle with sand. They find a good spot near the water. They start to fill the bucket with sand.
"Look, Anna, I have a lot of sand in my bucket!" Ben says.
"Good, Ben, you are helpful. I have some sand too. Let's dump it here and make a big pile." Anna says.
They dump their sand and pat it with their hands. They make a big pile of sand. They want to make it look like a castle. They use their shovel to make walls and towers. They use shells and stones to decorate their castle.
"Wow, Anna, our castle is beautiful!" Ben says.
"Yes, Ben, it is. We worked hard and supported each other. We are a good team." Anna says.
They are proud of their castle. They sit and look at it. They see the water coming closer. They see a big wave. They are scared. The wave hits their castle. Their castle is gone.
"Oh, no, Anna, our castle is gone!" Ben says.
"I know, Ben, it is. I am sad. We worked hard and supported each other. We are a good team." Anna says.
They hug each other. They are sad, but they are not alone. They have each other. They are helpful and supportive. They decide to make another castle. They have fun with sand.
