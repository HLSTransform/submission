Tom and Lily liked to play in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. But one day, the park was closed. A big storm had broken the swings, the slide and the fence. Tom and Lily were sad. They wanted to play in the park again.
The next day, they saw some people with tools and trucks. They were fixing the park. They were restoring the swings, the slide and the fence. Tom and Lily were happy. They wanted to help. They asked the people if they could help. The people said yes. They gave Tom and Lily some paint and brushes. Tom and Lily painted the fence with bright colors.
While they were painting, they heard a loud noise. It was thunder. The sky was dark and angry. It was going to rain. The people said they had to stop working and go home. They said they would come back tomorrow and finish the job. Tom and Lily were sad. They wanted to play in the park now.
But then, they saw something in the sky. It was a rainbow. It was big and bright and beautiful. It had many colors, like the fence. Tom and Lily smiled. They thought the rainbow was a sign. They thought it was saying that the park would be ready soon. They thought it was saying that the storm was over. They thought it was saying that the park was mighty. Tom and Lily thanked the people and went home. They hoped to play in the park tomorrow.
