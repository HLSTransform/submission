One day, a little boy named Tim was playing in the park. He saw a big girl named Sue with a cup. Sue was very alert, always watching her cup. Tim wanted to play with Sue, so he asked, "Can I play with you?"
Sue said, "Yes, but we need to pass the cup without dropping it." They started to pass the cup back and forth. They were having fun, but then Tim dropped the cup. Sue was upset. She said, "You dropped the cup! Now it's dirty!"
Tim felt bad and said, "I'm sorry, Sue. I didn't mean to drop it." Sue thought for a moment and said, "It's okay, Tim. We can clean the cup and play again." They cleaned the cup and continued to pass it. They played together and became good friends.
The moral of the story is that it's important to forgive others when they make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's better to learn from them and move on than to stay upset.
