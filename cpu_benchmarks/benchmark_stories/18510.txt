Ben and Mia liked to play in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. But their favorite thing was to climb the big oak tree. The oak tree had many branches and leaves. It was fun to go up and down.
One day, they saw a bird's nest on a high branch. The nest had three eggs inside. Ben and Mia wanted to see the eggs closer. They climbed the branch and reached for the nest. But the bird's nest was not strong. It broke and the eggs fell down.
"Oh no!" Ben and Mia cried. They heard the mother bird chirp loudly. She was angry and scared. She flew to the branch and saw her eggs on the ground. She was very sad.
Ben and Mia felt sorry for the bird. They climbed down and picked up the eggs. They were not broken, but they were cold. They tried to put them back in the nest, but it was too high. They did not know what to do.
"Please, help us!" they called. A man heard them and came to see. He saw the bird, the nest and the eggs. He understood what happened. He took a scarf from his pocket and wrapped the eggs. He climbed the tree and fixed the nest. He put the eggs back and covered them with leaves. He climbed down and gave the scarf to Ben and Mia.
"Thank you, mister!" they said. The man smiled and said, "You're welcome. But next time, don't touch the bird's nest. It is their home and they need it to be safe. Do you understand?"
Ben and Mia nodded. They said, "We understand. We are sorry. We won't do it again." They looked at the bird. She was calm and happy. She thanked them with a soft chirp. Ben and Mia smiled and waved. They learned a lesson that day. They learned to respect the bird's home and to release their curiosity.
