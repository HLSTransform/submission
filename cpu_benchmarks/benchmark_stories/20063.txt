Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily wanted a kitten very much. She asked her mommy, "Mommy, can I have a kitten, please?"
Mommy said, "Yes, Lily, you can have a kitten." So, they went to the pet store and found a cute little kitten. Lily was very happy and she hugged the kitten tightly. The kitten purred and licked her face.
But then, something bad happened. The kitten got sick and became very miserable. Lily tried to take care of it, but it was too late. The kitten died and Lily was very sad. She cried and cried, and her mommy hugged her tightly. "I'm sorry, Lily," said her mommy. "Sometimes, bad things happen."
