Maggie the girl went out to the garden with her dad. She was so excited because there were so many strawberries. Her dad told her, "Maggie, take your basket and mark the large strawberries". Maggie was delighted as she had never seen so many strawberries before. She started running around the garden and happily placed large strawberries in her basket.
Suddenly, Maggie heard her dad say, "Look, there is an even bigger strawberry than the ones you are marking. Would you like to pick it up?" 
Maggie ran to the spot her dad called out from, and lo and behold, there was an extra-large strawberry waiting for her! She carefully picked it up, and put it into her basket, as she started to fill it up with all the large, juicy strawberries.
Afterwards, Maggie said to her dad, "I marked so many strawberries, Dad!"
Her dad smiled and said, "You sure did, sweetheart. Let's go home to have some strawberry pies!"
Maggie was thrilled and couldn't have been happier.
