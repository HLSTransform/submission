Lily was sleepy. She wanted to go to bed, but she had to brush her teeth first. She went to the bathroom and saw her big brother, Tom, in front of the mirror. He was wearing a nice shirt and a tie.
"Tom, can you help me?" Lily asked. "I don't know how to brush my teeth."
"Sure, Lily, I can help you," Tom said. He smiled and put down his comb. He picked up Lily's toothbrush and toothpaste. He showed her how to squeeze a little bit of toothpaste on the brush and how to scrub her teeth gently.
"Like this, Lily. Up and down, and side to side. Don't forget the back teeth and the tongue," Tom said.
Lily followed Tom's instructions. She brushed her teeth until they were shiny and clean. She spat out the toothpaste and rinsed her mouth with water.
"Good job, Lily. You did it!" Tom said. He gave her a hug and a kiss. "Now, let's go to your room and tuck you in."
Lily nodded. She was very sleepy. She yawned and rubbed her eyes. She took Tom's hand and walked to her room. Tom helped her put on her pajamas and get into her bed. He pulled the blanket over her and tucked it under her chin.
"Good night, Lily. I love you," Tom said.
"Good night, Tom. I love you too," Lily said. She smiled and closed her eyes. She felt warm and cozy. She was happy that Tom helped her.
Tom turned off the light and left the room. He went back to the bathroom and finished fixing his tie. He was going to a party with his friends. He was excited, but he also felt proud of his little sister. He was happy that he helped her.
