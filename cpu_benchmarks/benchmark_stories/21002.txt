Once there was a sad little boy named John. Every day he would try to balance on one leg while waiting at the bus stop.
One day, John's parents took him to the bathroom. John didn't want to go, so he kept trying to balance on one leg while in the bathroom.
John's parents were sad to see him so sad. They tried to get John to come out of the bathroom, but he wouldn't listen.
So John's mom picked him up and gave him a hug. She told him that it was OK to be sad and that she was always there for him.
John's mom hugged him until he stopped being so sad. Then she helped him balance on one leg until he was ready to leave the bathroom. 
John felt much better after getting the hug from his mom and he was proud that he had balanced so well.
