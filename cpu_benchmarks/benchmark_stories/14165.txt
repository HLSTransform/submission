Once upon a time, there was a small king. He wanted to see the world, so he travelled to a big city. As he walked around, he stopped and stared at all the wonderful things he saw. He saw tall buildings, people walking around and lots of cars.
The small king noticed a little girl who was also looking around. He walked up to her and said hello. She looked surprised but she smiled at him. The two of them played together for hours. They laughed and smiled, and the small king taught the little girl some of his games. 
It was getting late, and the small king knew he had to go back home. He said goodbye to the little girl and she waved sadly at him. As the small king walked away, he turned around and stared at the little girl one last time. 
The small king had a wonderful time in the city and he decided he was going to come back and visit again soon.
