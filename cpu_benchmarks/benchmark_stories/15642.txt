The train rumbled loudly into the station. Little Suzie watched from the platform as people scurried off the train and others jumped on board. It was a modern train with shiny silver sides and bright yellow windows. Suzie could see drivers inside the train cabins, steering the train.
The most exciting part of seeing the train arrive was the piercing blast of its horn. Suzie was mesmerized by the sound, so much so that she didn't notice her mom arriving at the platform.
"Suzie, let's go!" Her mom said.
Suzie looked up and smiled. "Can I observe the train a little longer mommy?"
Her Mom nodded and they watched together until the train left the station, turning the corner in a big cloud of smoke.
"Bye bye train," Suzie waved as the train disappeared from view.
Suzie and her Mom swapped stories on the way home about all the new and modern things Suzie had observed.
