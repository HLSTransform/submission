Lily and Tom were friends. They liked to play in the field near their house. The field had many flowers and bugs and birds. Lily and Tom liked to run and jump and laugh in the field.
One day, they saw a big kite in the sky. The kite was red and blue and yellow. It looked like a bird with a long tail. Lily and Tom wanted to see the kite up close. They ran after the kite, following the string.
But the string was broken. The kite was flying away from the field. Lily and Tom ran faster and faster, but they could not catch the kite. The kite went over the trees and the hills and the clouds. Lily and Tom stopped and looked at the sky. They were sad.
Then, Tom had an idea. He said to Lily, "Let's believe that we can fly too. Let's pretend that we are birds and we can follow the kite. Maybe we can find it again." Lily liked Tom's idea. She said, "Yes, let's believe that we can fly. Let's flap our arms and make bird sounds. Maybe the kite will hear us and come back."
So, Lily and Tom flapped their arms and made bird sounds. They believed that they could fly. They felt the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They saw the kite in the sky. The kite looked like it was smiling at them. Lily and Tom smiled back. They were happy. They played in the field until it was time to go home. They thanked the kite for the fun. They hoped to see it again. They believed that they could.
