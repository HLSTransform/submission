Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was three years old. She decided to go on an adventure. She grabbed her hat, put it on her head, and started to jog. 
She jogged and jogged and then she stopped by a drain. She peeked down the drain and what do you think she saw? A delicious strawberry pie! 
The little girl was so excited! She forgot all about her adventure and climbed right down the drain to get the pie. She grabbed the pie, held it tight and then climbed back out of the drain.
She quickly opened the box and bit into the delicious pie. It was so sweet and yummy! She gobbled it all up and felt happy and full. 
The little girl was glad she had gone on her adventure, but she was even happier that it had ended with such a delicious treat.
