Once upon a time there was a reliable picture. The picture had a number on it - the number was 4. Every day the number 4 would go on a special adventure.
One day the number 4 went on an adventure to the forest. He was so excited! He saw so many animals, birds and trees. He tried to count all the trees - 1, 2, 3, 4. He was doing so well, but it was getting dark so he had to go home.
The next day the number 4 went to the beach. The sea was so big and he could see the waves. He wanted to count them too! 1, 2, 3, 4. He saw some shells and sandcastle, but he was getting tired, so he went back home.
The number 4 had so much fun every day. He kept going on adventures, but always made sure to be reliable and come back home safely. He was so excited to see the picture with the number 4 and would smile every time.
