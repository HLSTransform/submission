Once upon a time, there was a beautiful rod. It had sparkles and glitters that shone brightly when the sun was out. 
One day, a small child went outside and saw the rod. She ran up to it and said, "I want to play with this! Can I play with it?"
The child's mom said, "No, dear. The rod is too special. If you play with it, you might burn it". 
The child thought for a moment and then said, “But it's so beautiful.” 
The mom smiled and said, “Yes, it is beautiful. That's why we need to take extra care of it. We don't want to burn it, so it can stay beautiful for a long time.”
The child nodded and went off to play with other things.
The moral of this story is that it's important to take care of valuable things so that we can enjoy their beauty for a long time.
