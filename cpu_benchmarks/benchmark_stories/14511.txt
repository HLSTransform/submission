Once there was a boy named Rob. He was a curious little boy who loved exploring. He was always asking his mom and dad questions.
One day, while exploring in his backyard, Rob heard a strange noise. He followed the noise until he found a big pile of waste. Rob was sad to see so much waste, he wanted to make it original again.
He thought and thought, until he had an idea. Rob found some boxes and started making something. With lots of hard work and creativity, Rob made an interesting toy out of the waste. He was very proud of himself.
Now, every time he hears the strange noise in the backyard, he remembers his original creation made from waste.
