Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was only three years old, but she was very brave. She was determined to climb up a tall hill near the park.
"I'm going to climb the hill," she said to her Mommy.
"No, Lucy," said Mommy. "It's too steep and dangerous."
Lucy was not deterred and she started making her way up the hill. As she walked, it started to get thin and she had to help her feet find the right places to step. Soon, she was at the top and she saw a big, tall spike in the ground.
"What's that?" asked Lucy.
"That's a spike," said Mommy. "It's a thin pole that rises from the ground."
Lucy looked around and saw the beautiful view from the top of the hill. She felt very proud of herself for making it all the way up.
"We made it!" said Lucy.
Mommy smiled and said, "Yes, we did."
