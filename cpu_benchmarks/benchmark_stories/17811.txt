Once there was a little kitten who loved to play. One day, it sprung into the air and landed in a tree. It meowed and meowed, but it couldn't get down.
So its mommy called the veterinarians to come help. They were so kind and lovely. They brought a ladder and climbed up the tree to get the little kitten.
The veterinarians said the kitten was okay. And the little kitten was so happy to be safe on the ground again.
The veterinarians petted the kitten, and it purred happily. Its mommy thanked the veterinarians for all their help.
The kitten and its mommy were so grateful for the veterinarians' help. They would always love and remember the lovely veterinarians!
