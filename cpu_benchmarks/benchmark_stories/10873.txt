Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and run around with her friends. One day, Lily fell down and hurt her knee. It hurt a lot and she started to cry.
Lily's mom took her to the doctor. The doctor was a nice lady who wore a white coat. She looked at Lily's knee and said it was just a little scrape. Then the doctor put some good medicine on it and gave Lily a band-aid.
Lily felt much better and stopped crying. She thanked the doctor and went home. When she got home, she showed her band-aid to her dad and rubbed her knee. Her knee felt much better and she was happy again. The end.
