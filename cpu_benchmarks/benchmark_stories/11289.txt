Once upon a time, there were two best friends. They played and laughed together every day.
One day, the two friends had an argument. It was so bad that they did not want to be friends anymore. It was like a war!
They stopped speaking to each other. The days were so dry without their friendship.
The two friends were very sad. They missed their friendship, but they did not know how to fix it.
But with the help of their families, they found a way to finish the war. They worked together to put their friendship back together.
They finally finished! Their friendship was even better then before. They played and laughed together every day and were happy once again.
