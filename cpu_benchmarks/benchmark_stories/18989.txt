One day, a little girl named Daisy went to the park with her mom. The sun was shining, and the sky was blue. Daisy liked to run and play in the park. She saw a lot of pretty flowers and wanted to pick them.
Daisy saw a dull flower next to a bright flower. She asked her mom, "Mom, why is this flower dull and not pretty like the others?" Her mom said, "Some flowers just need more love and care to be pretty. Why don't you pick it and give it some love?"
Daisy picked the dull flower and held it in her hand. She gave it a little hug and said, "I love you, flower." The dull flower started to become bright and pretty, just like the other flowers. Daisy was happy, and she learned that love can make things beautiful.
