Once upon a time, there was a hunter named Jack. He was very angry because he couldn't find any animals to hunt. He walked through the forest and looked for animals, but he couldn't find any.
Suddenly, he saw a little bunny hopping around. Jack got very excited and started chasing the bunny. The bunny was scared and ran away as fast as it could.
The bunny said, "Please, Mr. Hunter, quit chasing me! I'm just a little bunny and I don't want to be hurt." Jack felt bad and realized that he shouldn't be hunting animals anymore. From that day on, Jack quit being a hunter and became a nature photographer instead.
