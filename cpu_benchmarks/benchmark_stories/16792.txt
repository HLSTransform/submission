One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mommy. She saw a puppy playing by itself. Lily went over to the puppy and said, "Hi there! Do you want to play with me?"
The puppy wagged its tail and barked happily. Lily played with the puppy for a while, but then it started to rain. Lily said, "Oh no! We have to find a case for the puppy so it doesn't get wet."
Lily and her mommy looked around and found a big box. They put the puppy inside and carried it home. Lily said, "I care about the puppy. I don't want it to be wet and cold." Her mommy said, "That's very kind of you, Lily. You have a kind heart even though the weather can be harsh sometimes."
