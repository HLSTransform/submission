Once upon a time, there was a little spider named Spidey. Spidey lived in a big tree in the forest. One day, Spidey's friend, a little ladybug named Lucy, came to visit him.
Lucy said, "Spidey, why don't you clean up your cobweb? It's not looking very nice."
Spidey replied, "I like my cobweb. It's interesting and I don't want to change it."
Lucy suggested, "But if you don't clean it up, it might get too big and catch you in it."
Spidey didn't listen to Lucy and kept his cobweb as it was. Unfortunately, one day, Spidey got stuck in his own cobweb and couldn't get out. He was very sad and wished he had listened to Lucy's suggestion to clean up his cobweb.
