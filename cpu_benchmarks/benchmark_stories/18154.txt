Once upon a time, there was a silly pirate named Bob. Bob liked to play with his friends on his big ship. They would laugh and have fun all day long.
One day, Bob met a new friend named Tim. Tim was a little boy who wanted to be a pirate too. Bob said, "Do you want to play with us?" Tim said, "Yes, I want to be a pirate like you!" So, they played together and had lots of fun.
But then, it started to rain. The sky seemed very dark and the wind blew hard. The pirates and Tim went inside the ship to stay dry. They played games and told stories until the rain stopped. When the sun came out again, they went back outside and played some more. They were all happy to be pirates together.
