Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a boy named Tim. Tim was a happy boy who loved to play with his friends. He liked to learn new things but sometimes he was ignorant about the truth.
One day, Tim's mom told him that he would receive a gift from his grandma. Tim was very excited and could not wait for his gift. He told all his friends about the gift and they were happy for him.
When the gift came, Tim opened it and found a book. The book taught him about the truth of the world and how to be kind to others. Tim learned many things from the book and was no longer ignorant. He shared the truth with his friends and they all became better people. And they all lived happily ever after.
