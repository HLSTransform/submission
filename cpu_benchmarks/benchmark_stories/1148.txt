Once upon a time, there was a horse named Dull. Dull lived in a stable. He was not very happy because he had a bad leg. Dull's leg made him suffer a lot.
One day, a girl named Sue came to see Dull. She said, "Hi, Dull! Why are you sad?" Dull told her about his bad leg. Sue wanted to help Dull feel better.
Sue brought Dull a soft blanket to put on his leg. She said, "This will help your leg feel better, Dull." Dull felt happy that Sue cared about him. Soon, Dull's leg did not hurt as much. Dull and Sue became good friends and played every day.
