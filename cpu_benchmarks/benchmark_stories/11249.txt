Once upon a time, there was a nice little girl named Emma. Her family drove her to the beach to have some fun! At the beach, Emma ran around, playing in the sand, picking up shells and splashing in the water. 
But then it started to rain. Emma’s mom called for her to come back to the car but Emma grabbed something from the sand - it was a shell shaped like an angel. Her mom yelled, “Emma, come now, it’s wet outside!” 
The entire drive home, Emma held the angel tight. When they got home, the sky opened up with rain and Emma’s mom said, “Emma, did you know that angels are protectors? I’m glad you found it. It was a sign that your angel was watching over you and kept you safe at the beach.” 
Emma smiled, feeling very lucky. She knew she had found her very own angel.
