One day, Sara decided to spend a peaceful day in the park. She grabbed her favorite toy, Spike, and went outside.
When Sara arrived, she was amazed to see that the park was so quiet. She couldn't hear any cars, only a few birds peacefully chirping. Sara went for a walk and saw some friends playing on the swing set.
Sara asked her friends, "Can I play with you?"
They were happy to have her join them. They all took turns pushing each other on the swing set. Whenever it was Sara's turn, Spike got to come along too!
After the fun was over, Sara thanked her friends and said goodbye. She waved to them as they left while she stayed behind and enjoyed the peaceful park. Sara spent the rest of her day exploring and playing with Spike. 
By the end of the day, Sara was feeling very happy and content. She smiled and began heading home, Spike still in her hand.
