Mama had a jug. It was big, round and blue. Mama put it away on a shelf and locked it with a key. Mama said: "This is very serious, no one is to touch it." 
Little Sally wanted to see what was in the jug. She asked: "What is it Mama? What is in the jug?"
Mama said: "It is nothing that you need to know about. Now, be a good girl and don't touch it."
Sally was very curious. She wanted to find out what was in the jug. When Mama was not looking, Sally went over to the shelf. She found the key and unlocked the jug. She opened it and saw a surprise inside! 
But then something bad happened. Sally reached inside and started pulling things out. Suddenly, the lid closed and locked. Sally was stuck inside. Mama heard a scream and came running. Mama was so sad. She had to break the jug to get Sally out. 
Mama was very serious. She said: "This is why we lock things up. You must always listen to Mama. Now go to your room and think about what you have done."
