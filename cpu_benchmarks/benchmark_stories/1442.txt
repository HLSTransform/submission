One morning, Jane woke up and smiled. She saw a big, hairy dog running down the road. She watched it blink as it ran. Jane wanted to follow the dog, so she put on her shoes and ran after it. She called out to the dog, but it was too far away. She was about to give up, when she saw the hairy dog turn down a side street. Jane ran faster and followed the dog. When she got closer, she could see that the dog had stopped. Jane smiled and blinked. The dog was just waiting for her! She petted the dog and it licked her. Then, they both ran down the road together and played until it was time for Jane to go home. And they had the most wonderful adventure!
