Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the park with her mommy and daddy. One day, they went to the park and Lily was very tired. She kept yawning and yawning. 
Her mommy asked, "Are you tired, sweetie?" 
Lily replied, "Yes, I am." 
Her daddy said, "Maybe we should go home so you can take a nap." 
But Lily was persistent. She wanted to play at the park a little longer. So, her mommy and daddy let her play on the swings and slide for a little while longer. 
Eventually, Lily's yawning got even bigger and she knew it was time to go home. She hugged her mommy and daddy and said, "Thank you for the fun day at the park!" And off they went, with Lily yawning all the way home.
