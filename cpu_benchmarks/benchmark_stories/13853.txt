One day, a busy ant named Tim was walking in the park. He saw a big bag of oats. Tim wanted to take the oats to his ant home. But, there was a big bird named Bob who also wanted the oats.
Tim said, "I must prevent Bob from taking the oats." Tim thought of a plan. He called his ant friends to help him.
The ants made a line and started to carry the oats home. Bob saw the ants and said, "I want the oats too!" The ants worked together to prevent Bob from getting the oats. They moved fast and hid the oats in their home.
In the end, Tim and his ant friends were happy. They had the oats and Bob could not find them. The busy ants had a big oat party and shared with all their friends.
