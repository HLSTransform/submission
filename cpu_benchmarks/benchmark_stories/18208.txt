Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a small house near a big, ancient tree. In the spring, the tree had many flowers and birds that sang beautiful songs.
One day, Lily saw a tiny bird near the tree. The bird could not fly. "Oh no!" said Lily. "I will help you, little bird!" She carried the bird to her house and gave it food and water.
After a few days, the bird felt better. It said, "Thank you, Lily! Now I can fly again!" The bird flew back to the ancient tree. Every spring, Lily would visit the tree and listen to the bird's sweet song.
