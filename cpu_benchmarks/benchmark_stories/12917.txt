Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sabrina who loved to play in the park. One day Sabrina and her friend Lisa were in the park playing catch with a soft ball. Sabrina threw the ball to Lisa, but the wind blew it away.
So, Sabrina and Lisa went to look for the ball and soon they found it. But it was stuck on a branch and Sabrina couldn't reach it.
"What can we do?" asked Sabrina.
"I know!" Lisa said. "We can pinch it!" She showed Sabrina how to pinch the ball with her fingers and it worked!
Sabrina felt so happy and was so quick to jump up and down. With one big pinch the ball was back in their hands.
The girls ran around the park, chasing each other and laughing. Then they decided to play catch one more time. They surrounded the ball with their hands and threw it back and forth. It felt so soft and made them both smile.
The end.
