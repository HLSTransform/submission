Once upon a time, there was a hunter named Tom. He loved to dress in his green clothes and big boots. Every day, he went to the woods to find animals.
One rainy day, the woods were very wet. Tom walked and walked, but he didn't see any animals. He felt sad. Then, he saw a little bunny hiding under a bush.
Tom said, "Hello, little bunny! Why are you hiding?" The bunny replied, "I am hiding because I don't want to get wet in the rain." Tom smiled and said, "Don't worry, I will help you."
Tom took off his big hat and put it over the bunny so it wouldn't get wet. They became friends and played together in the woods. From that day on, the hunter and the bunny were the best of friends, and they always helped each other.
