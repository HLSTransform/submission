Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside all day. But when evening came, he would go inside to rest.
One evening, Tim felt sad. He missed his friend, who moved away. His mom saw him and wanted to comfort him. She gave him a big hug and made him feel better.
They went outside together to enjoy the cool air. They played catch and laughed a lot. Tim felt happy again. From that day on, they spent many cool evenings playing and laughing together.
