Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to ride the subway with her mom. One day, Mia's mom said, "Mia, are you ready to learn how to ride the subway by yourself?" Mia was very excited and said, "Yes, Mom, I am ready!"
Mia's mom began to teach her how to ride the subway. They practiced getting on and off the subway. Mia's mom also taught her to look at the signs to know where to go. Mia learned quickly and was soon ready to try it by herself.
The next day, Mia and her mom went to the subway. Mia's mom said, "Remember what I taught you, and you'll do great!" Mia got on the subway and found her way to her grandma's house all by herself. When she arrived, her grandma was so proud of her. Mia was happy that she learned to ride the subway and couldn't wait to do it again.
