They started to organize. Susan chose pink balloons. Her friends kept an eye out for orange decorations. They found orange streamers, plates, and hats. Susan even found an orange and pink cake!
The day of the party arrived. Everyone was ready with their orange and pink outfits. Susan opened the door and everyone cheered! Inside was a big room filled with pink and orange decorations. Everything was so colorful.
They had a lot of fun at the party. They ate the orange and pink cake and danced the night away. It was an unforgettable party, thanks to Susan's hard work!
