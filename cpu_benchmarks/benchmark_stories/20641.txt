Once upon a time there was a loyal dog called Spot. Every day, Spot liked to go for a walk and play with his friends. Every morning, his owner would give him a tasty treat and call his name.
The friendly dog knew his name as soon as his owner said it. When his owner clapped, he would come running. He was always so loyal.
One day, Spot heard something he had never heard before. It was faint and tuneful, but he couldn't work out where it was coming from. Then he realised it was coming from a bell. It was a bell, ringing. It was the most beautiful sound he had ever heard!
Spot wanted to find where the ringing was coming from, so he searched and searched. He followed the sound until he arrived at a big house. He saw a bell in the garden and he knew that was where the sound had been coming from. It was ringing his name!
Spot was so excited and his tail was wagging like mad. He knew that somebody special had been calling him and he wanted to say hello. So he ran up to the house, happy and loyal as always.
And that was the story of Spot and the ringing bell. He found out that it was his loyal owner who had been ringing the bell and calling his name, and Spot was happy.
