Once upon a time there was a little girl named Amy. She was three years old and very polite. Every day she liked to go to the park to play.
One day, when she was at the park, she saw a bright purple balloon. It was so beautiful! As she watched, a little wind came along and floated the balloon over to her. 
The balloon said hello to her in a friendly voice and introduced himself as Purple. He said he wanted to be her friend and asked if she wanted to go on an adventure. 
Amy was so excited! She said yes, and before she knew it, the two of them were flying all around the park. Together they spun around the trees, splashed in the river and danced in the flowers. 
At the end of the day, Purple thanked Amy for the wonderful adventure and promised to return soon. She waved goodbye as Purple floated away, saying goodbye in her polite little voice. Amy couldn't wait to see him again.
