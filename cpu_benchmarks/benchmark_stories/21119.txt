Once upon a time, there was a mighty bird named Bob. Bob had a best friend named Tim, who was a little mouse. They lived in a big tree with many other animals. One day, Bob and Tim found a long cord hanging from a branch. They did not know what it was for, but they wanted to play with it.
Bob said to Tim, "Let's pull the cord and see what happens!" Tim was a bit scared but decided to try. They both pulled the cord together. Suddenly, a big box fell from the sky and landed near them. The other animals heard the noise and came to see what was going on.
The big box had a lock on it, and all the animals tried to open it. They pushed and pulled but could not open it. Tim had an idea and said, "Let's use the cord to open the lock!" They tied the cord around the lock and pulled with all their might. The lock broke, and the box opened. Inside the box, there were toys for all the animals to play with. But then, the animals started fighting over the toys. Bob saw this and screamed, "Stop! We must share the toys and play together." All the animals listened to Bob and started to share the toys. They had a great time playing together, and they all became good friends.
