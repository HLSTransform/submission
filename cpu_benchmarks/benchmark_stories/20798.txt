Jimmy was a silly three-year-old. He really loved pizza! On this day, his mom was working late and so she told him to not lay on the floor while she was away. But Jimmy wanted to be bossy so he laid down and he ate a delicious pizza. 
Suddenly, there was a loud boom! Startled, Jimmy jumped up. The window was broken and there was a monster standing outside! The monster growled and said, "You were not supposed to lay down while your mom was away. I warned you!" It was too late, Jimmy had been naughty.
Mom came home and she was very angry. She scolded Jimmy for disobediently laying down. He had to clean up the broken glass as punishment. Jimmy learnt his lesson and promised to never lay down when his mom wasn't home again.
