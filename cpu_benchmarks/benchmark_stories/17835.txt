Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was trying to find her way. She was walking along the path and she had a hard time because it was so tricky. She kept getting lost, so she had to struggle to try and find her way.
Suddenly, she came across a big sign with a label on it. The label said “Home”. The little girl was so happy to see it! She started running towards the sign as fast as she could, but it was a long way away so she had to struggle to get there.
When the little girl was almost there, she heard a loud noise. It was a clown! The clown was very loud, and it made the little girl a bit scared. But she was brave and kept going.
Finally, after a lot of struggling, the little girl made it to the sign. When she read the label, she realized that the sign was telling her she was home. She felt so relieved that she was safe and in the right place!
