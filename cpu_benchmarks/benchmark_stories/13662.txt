Lily and Sam like to create things with paper and glue. They cut and stick and make animals and flowers and cars. They have fun and talk and laugh.
But one day, it rains a lot. The rain makes the paper wet and the glue runny. Lily and Sam's creations get ruined. They feel sad and worry.
"What can we do?" Lily asks Sam. "Our things are all wet and bad."
Sam thinks for a moment. He has an idea. He smiles and says, "We can create something new. Something that likes the rain."
"What is it?" Lily asks.
Sam shows her a paper boat. He folds and sticks and makes a boat. He gives it to Lily. "We can make more boats and sail them in the water. The rain will not hurt them. It will make them go fast."
Lily likes the idea. She makes a paper boat too. They go outside and find a puddle. They put their boats in the puddle and watch them float and move. They have fun and talk and laugh again.
They do not worry about the rain anymore. They create something new and enjoy the wet.
