Once upon a time there was a swing in the backyard. It was an important swing for a little girl named Bella. Every day Bella would come outside and run to the swing. She would laugh and giggle as she flew high in the sky.  
One day, Bella was extra high in the sky when something went wrong. The swing stopped and Bella fell off. She was scared at first, but then she realized she was okay. She brushed off her dress and stood up. 
Then she remembered why the swing stopped. It was because there was a loud noise from around the corner. She went over to investigate and soon saw her mom holding her brother. He was too young to play on the swing, so Bella knew it was important for her mom to stop her brother from going near the swing.
Bella smiled, happy that her mom was being protective. She walked back over to the swing, gave it a gentle push, and off she flew again. She laughed and giggled and flew as high as she could, knowing her mom was keeping her brother safe. 
And they all lived happily ever after!
