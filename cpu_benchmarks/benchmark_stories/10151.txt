Once upon a time, there was a little duck named Ducky. Ducky loved to play in the pond with his friends. One day, Ducky was walking by the pond when he saw a big frog. The frog was green and slimy and had big eyes. Ducky was a little scared of the frog, but he wanted to say hello.
"Hi there, Mr. Frog," said Ducky in a gentle voice.
The frog didn't say anything. He just looked at Ducky with his big eyes. Suddenly, the frog jumped out of the pond and onto the shore. Ducky was so shocked that he stepped back and fell into the pond. Ducky's friends came over to help him out of the water.
"Don't worry, Ducky," said his friend Quackers. "We'll help you get out of the pond."
Ducky was grateful for his friends' help. He learned that sometimes things can be scary, but with the help of friends, everything will be okay.
