Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big grill. The grill is for cooking food. Tom and Sam are hungry.
"Let's make some food on the grill," Tom says.
"OK, but we need to be careful. The grill is hot," Sam says.
They find some bread and cheese in a bag. They put the bread and cheese on the grill. They wait for a few minutes. The bread and cheese become warm and melty.
"Yum, this looks good," Tom says.
He takes a bite of the bread and cheese. He makes a funny face. He spits out the food.
"Yuck, this is bad. This is not cheese. This is soap," he says.
Sam laughs. He jokes with Tom.
"Ha ha, I tricked you. I put soap on the bread. It was a joke," he says.
Tom is not happy. He is angry. He throws the soap at Sam. The soap hits Sam in the face. Sam makes a funny face. He spits out the soap.
"Yuck, this is bad. This is not food. This is soap," he says.
Tom laughs. He jokes with Sam.
"Ha ha, I tricked you back. I threw soap at you. It was a joke," he says.
Sam is not happy. He is angry. He chases Tom around the park. They run and shout. They forget about the grill.
The end.
