Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the world around her. One day, while playing in the park, she discovered a shiny battery on the ground. It was so nice and new-looking that she decided to pick it up and take it home with her.
When she got home, Lily showed her mommy the battery she found. Her mommy was happy and proud of her for discovering something so interesting. They talked about how batteries make things work, like toys and flashlights.
Lily was so excited about her discovery that she decided to put the battery in her toy car. She wanted to see how fast it would go with the new battery. And sure enough, her car went faster than ever before! Lily was so happy and proud of herself for finding such a nice battery.
