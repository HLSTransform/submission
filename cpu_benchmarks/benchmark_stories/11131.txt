One day, a little dog named Max went for a jog. He liked to run and play outside. As he jogged, he saw a pen with a big, worried-looking pig inside. The pig was sad because he lost his friend, a small bird.
Max wanted to help the worried pig find his friend. So, Max asked the pig, "What does your bird friend look like?" The pig said, "My bird friend is blue and small."
Max jogged around looking for the small blue bird. He looked in trees and on the ground. Finally, he found the small blue bird near a big tree. Max said, "I found you! Your pig friend is worried and misses you."
The small blue bird was happy Max found her. They jogged back to the pen together. The worried pig saw his friend and was very happy. Max, the pig, and the small blue bird played together all day.
