One day, a shy little squirrel was out looking for something to eat in his favourite square. As he looked for food, he noticed a giant tree. He felt an urge to climb up the tall tree, but he was too scared.
He saw a friendly bear looking up at the tree and said, "Hey, why do you look so sad?"
The bear replied, "I can't climb the tree, it's too big."
The squirrel thought for a moment, then said, "I can help you. Come on, I'll give you a push."
The bear was hesitant at first, but the squirrel kept urging him on and eventually the bear agreed. The squirrel started pushing the bear up the tree, higher and higher until the bear reached the top. The bear thanked the squirrel and scurried off happily. 
The shy little squirrel was proud of himself. He felt brave and happy at the same time, and he knew he would always remember this moment.
