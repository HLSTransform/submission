Once upon a time, there was a big, strong horse named Max. He used to carry heavy things for his owner, but one day he got sick and lost a lot of weight. His owner was sad because Max wasn't reliable anymore.
The owner took Max to the vet who gave him medicine and food to restore his health. Max started eating and playing again and soon he was back to his normal weight. His owner was happy because Max was reliable once more.
Max and his owner went on many adventures together, carrying heavy things and having fun. Max was happy to be strong and healthy again, and his owner was happy to have his reliable horse back. The end.
