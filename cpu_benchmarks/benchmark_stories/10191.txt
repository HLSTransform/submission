One day, on a Tuesday, the sun began to rise. It was a very bright and happy day. The birds were singing loud songs, and the big yellow sun made the sky very pretty.
In a small house, a little boy named Tim woke up. He heard the loud birds and saw the sun rise. He was excited to play outside with his friends. Tim put on his shoes and went out to have fun.
Tim and his friends played all day on Tuesday. They laughed and ran under the big, bright sun. They had so much fun. When the sun started to go down, they said bye to each other. Tim went back to his house, tired but happy. He couldn't wait for the next day to play again.
