Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to school because he got to see his friends and play with toys. One day, when Timmy got to the classroom, he saw that all the seats were taken. He felt sad because he couldn't find an available seat to sit in. 
But then, his teacher saw him standing and said, "Timmy, come sit next to me!" Timmy was happy because he found an available seat next to his teacher. He sat down and started to color a picture of a dinosaur. 
After class, Timmy went home and told his mom about his day. He said, "Mom, I sat next to my teacher today because there were no available seats in the classroom. It was fun!" His mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you had a good day at school, Timmy." And Timmy went to bed, dreaming about playing with his friends and finding an available seat in the classroom tomorrow.
