Tom was a brave boy who liked to play with his toys. He had a big bed with a blue cover and a soft pillow. He also had a lamp that made light when it was dark.
One night, Tom was ready to sleep. He lay on his bed and hugged his teddy bear. He said good night to his toys and turned off the lamp. He closed his eyes and tried to dream.
But then he heard a noise under his bed. It was a loud and scary noise. It sounded like a monster. Tom was afraid. He opened his eyes and looked under his bed. He saw a big and hairy monster with sharp teeth and red eyes. The monster growled and tried to grab Tom.
Tom screamed and jumped out of his bed. He ran to the door and opened it. He called for his mom and dad. He hoped they would come and help him.
Mom and dad heard Tom and came to his room. They saw Tom crying and shaking. They also saw the monster under the bed. They were surprised and angry. They grabbed a broom and a shoe and chased the monster away. The monster was weak and afraid. It ran out of the window and disappeared.
Mom and dad hugged Tom and comforted him. They told him that the monster was gone and that he was safe. They checked under the bed and in the closet and found no more monsters. They turned on the lamp and gave Tom a glass of water. They sang him a song and kissed him good night.
Tom felt better and thanked his mom and dad. He lay on his bed and hugged his teddy bear. He said good night to his toys and turned off the lamp. He closed his eyes and dreamed of happy things. He was a brave boy who liked to play with his toys.
