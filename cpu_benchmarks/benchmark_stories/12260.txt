Once there was an ancient candle. Everyone said this candle was very special. One day, a young boy wanted to see the candle. He said to his mom, "can I see the candle?". His mother said "yes, but be careful".
The boy went to the ancient candle and he looked at it. He reached out and tried to touch it. Suddenly, the candle started to get brighter and brighter. The little boy stepped back in surprise.
Suddenly, the ancient candle exploded! It was very loud and the little boy was scared. He ran back to his mom and said, "Mommy, the candle exploded!" His mother was sad and said, "I told you to be careful."
The little boy was very upset and he cried. Everyone knew that the ancient candle was very special and now it was gone. They all said it was a bad ending.
