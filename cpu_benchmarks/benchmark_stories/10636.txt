Once upon a time there was a young figure that needed polishing. She had been sitting there for a long time gathering dust, so she needed a lot of attention. 
One day a lucky young child found her. The child had such big dreams, but she knew that the figure needed to be polished. So, with determination and enthusiasm she began to give the figure some much-needed TLC. 
Every day the child would spend many hours polishing the figure and eventually, the old figure began to look like new once more. The child was happy and knew that something magical would happen if she kept polishing and dreaming. 
Sure enough, one day the figure came to life. The figure was now a princess and she thanked the young child for all the hard work she had put into polishing her. Together, they celebrated in joy and the princess rewarded the child with a special gift in return.
