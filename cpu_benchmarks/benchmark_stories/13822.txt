Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a bike and a scooter. They share them and take turns.
One day, they see a new trail in the park. It has a gate with a lock. They want to go on the trail and see what is there. They look for the key. They do not find it.
They are sad. They want to unlock the gate. They ask a man who works in the park. He says he has the key. He says he will give it to them if they do something nice for him. He says he needs help to pick up some trash.
Lily and Ben agree. They help the man to pick up the trash. They put it in a big bag. The man is happy. He says they are nice kids. He gives them the key.
Lily and Ben unlock the gate. They go on the trail. They see flowers and birds and a pond. They have fun. They are glad they did something nice for the man. They say thank you and give him back the key. They go home and tell their moms about their adventure.
