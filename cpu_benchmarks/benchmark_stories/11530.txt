Once upon a time, there was a little, adventurous bird named Bobo. Bobo loved to fly high in the sky and explore new places. One day, he saw a big, black rock on the ground. It was a piece of coal.
Bobo decided to pick up the coal and settle it in his nest. He flew back to his nest and showed the coal to his friend, Lulu, the squirrel. "Look, Lulu! I found a big black rock! It's called coal!" said Bobo.
Lulu was curious and asked, "What does coal do, Bobo?" Bobo didn't know, so they decided to find out. They played with the coal, rolled it around, and even tried to eat it, but it didn't taste good. In the end, they decided to keep the coal as a fun toy to play with. And so, Bobo and Lulu had many more adventurous days playing with their new coal toy.
