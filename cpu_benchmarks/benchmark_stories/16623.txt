Tim and Tom were two otters who liked to play in the river. They had a lot of fun swimming, diving and sliding on the rocks. They were best friends and always stayed together.
One day, they saw a big boat on the water. It was loud and fast and made big waves. Tim and Tom were curious and wanted to see it closer. They swam towards the boat, but they did not see the net that was hanging from it.
"Look, Tim, look at the boat!" Tom said. "It is so big and shiny!"
"Yes, Tom, it is!" Tim said. "But be careful, it might be dangerous!"
They did not hear the men on the boat who were fishing for otters. The men saw Tim and Tom and pulled the net up. Tim and Tom felt something wrap around them and drag them out of the water. They were scared and tried to get free, but the net was too tight.
"Help, help!" Tim cried. "We are stuck in the net!"
"Help, help!" Tom cried. "We can't breathe!"
The men laughed and threw the net into the boat. They did not care about Tim and Tom. They only wanted their fur. They took a knife and cut the net. They separated Tim and Tom and threw them into different boxes. Tim and Tom could not see each other or the clear water anymore. They only saw darkness and felt pain.
"Tim, Tim, where are you?" Tom called. "I miss you, I want to be with you!"
"Tom, Tom, where are you?" Tim called. "I miss you, I want to be with you!"
But they could not hear each other. They could not escape. They could not play. They could not live. They were alone and sad. The end.
