Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys. One day, he was playing with his toy car in the hall. The hall was big and cool. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise. His mom came running and asked, "What happened, Timmy? Did you break something?" Timmy looked sad and said, "Yes, Mommy. I broke my toy car." His mom hugged him and said, "Don't worry, Timmy. We can fix it together." Timmy smiled and felt happy.
