Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She was walking in the park, looking for pretty flowers to pick. Suddenly, she stumbled on a big rock and fell down. Ouch! She hurt her knee and it started to bleed. 
Lily saw a button on the ground and picked it up. It was an ordinary button, just like the ones on her shirt. She wondered where it came from and decided to keep it as a treasure. 
After a while, Lily's knee felt better and she continued her walk. She found lots of beautiful flowers and picked them carefully. When she got home, she showed her mom the button and told her about her adventure in the park. Her mom was proud of her for being brave and curious. From that day on, Lily kept the button in her pocket and remembered her fun day in the park.
