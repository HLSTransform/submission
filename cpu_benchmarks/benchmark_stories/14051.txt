Once upon a time there was a bird named Joe. He loved to sing and talk to the other animals in the forest. Unfortunately, Joe was deaf. He could not hear his own singing or talking.
One day, Joe decided to take a walk. As he was strolling, he saw a beautiful stream of water. Joe parted the tall grass and stepped closer to take a better look. Suddenly, he felt something grab tightly around his neck. Joe was scared!
It was a large snake with squinty eyes. "Let me go!", Joe shouted. The snake spoke back in a very low and calm voice. "I only grabbed you because I need help. I can't hear, can you?". Joe was shocked. Here was a snake that was just as deaf as him! The snake asked Joe if he could part through the tall grass and help him find his way back home.
Joe agreed to help and although it was a scary situation, it ended up being a great experience for them both. From then on, Joe and the snake were great friends and they taught each other how to hop around and navigate their deafness together.
