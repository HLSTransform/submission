One day in the park there was an open shelf with something on it. A little girl wanted to borrow it, so she asked her mom. Her mom said, "Yes, but you have to promise to bring it back. Can you do that?" The little girl smiled and said, "Yes, I can!"
The little girl was very excited to have the shelf, so she ran over to it. She put her toys on it and arranged them carefully on the shelf. She was so proud of her collection!
The next day when the little girl went to the park she found the shelf was gone. She looked all over but could not find it anywhere. She started to cry.
Suddenly, the girl heard a voice. It was her mom. She said, "Remember when you borrowed the shelf? You promised me that you would bring it back. We are going to do just that!"
The little girl understood that her mom had gone and grabbed the shelf from somewhere else. She smiled, knowing that her mom had kept her promise and the shelf was back where it belonged.
