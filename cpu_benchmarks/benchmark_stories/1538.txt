Once upon a time there was a girl named Lola. Lola was three years old and liked to share her toys with her friends. One day, Lola was playing her favourite game, but when her friend Sarah arrived, something weird happened.
Sarah was surprised to see that Lola was not sharing the game with her like she always did. This was very strange! Lola smiled and said, "I have a surprise! I am going to share it with you!" 
Lola gave Sarah a shock. She had something special up her sleeve, and it was a surprise. Sarah was thrilled! She said, "It's so weird! Is it really a surprise?"
Lola smiled and said, "Yes! Let's share it together." Lola and Sarah opened the box and saw something wonderful inside! It was a beautiful, sparkly toy. 
Both girls were overjoyed and shared the toy together. They laughed and hugged each other, celebrating their amazing discovery. From then on, Lola and Sarah shared many more surprises!
