Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a lion. The lion was big and strong. He loved to help his friends. One day, it was very cold and icy outside. The little animals in the forest were hungry and cold.
The lion wanted to provide food and warmth to his friends. He found a cave and invited all the little animals inside. The lion went out and found food for everyone. He brought back fruits and nuts for the little animals to eat.
The little animals were very happy and thanked the lion. They all ate and stayed warm in the cave together. The lion felt good about helping his friends. The little animals learned that it is good to help others when they need it. And they all lived happily together in the big forest.
