Once upon a time, there were two little girls, Jemma and Nessa. Both of them were very excited, because today was their birthday!
"Look!" said Jemma to Nessa, pointing to the table. There was a large violet cake on the table, lit up by a candle. "It's a birthday cake, just for you and me!"
Nessa was so excited, she squealed with delight. She wanted to blow out the candle, but Jemma was being very thoughtful.
"Let's do something special," she said. "Let's make a wish with the candle. We can make one wish each!"
Jemma and Nessa each made their own special wish and then they blew out the candle. They hugged each other, and they knew that their wishes had come true!
