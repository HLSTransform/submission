One day, a little girl was out for a walk. She saw a big circle on the ground and when she walked closer, it was empty. She asked her mom what it was and she said it was a playground. The little girl was so happy that she ran inside and started to spin around and around in the circle. She decided to hold her hands up so she could go even faster and faster. When she was tired, she stopped and started to laugh. She was so excited to find the empty circle that was now her playground.
