Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to bake cookies. One day, she wanted to make the biggest cookie ever. She asked her mom, "Mommy, can you measure the flour for me?"
Her mom replied, "Sure, but be careful not to be careless with the ingredients."
Lily's mom helped her measure the flour and other ingredients. As they mixed everything together, Lily's tutor came over to visit. The tutor saw Lily and her mom baking and asked, "What are you making?"
Lily replied, "We're making a big cookie! We measured everything carefully."
The tutor smiled and said, "That's great! I can't wait to try it." After the cookie was done, they all sat down and enjoyed it together. It was the best cookie they ever had!
