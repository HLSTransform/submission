Once upon a time, there was a man who liked to jog. He would run on the sidewalk every day. One day, he saw a big lawn and decided to jog on it. The grass was green and soft. He jogged and jogged until he got tired. Then he sat on the lawn and felt very sleepy. He took a nap and woke up feeling refreshed. From that day on, he jogged on the lawn every day and took naps when he got sleepy. The end.
