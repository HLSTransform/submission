Mommy and Jimmy went to the fancy mall. Jimmy was three years old, so he was very excited. Everywhere he looked he could see something amazing.
 
Mommy said, “Do you think you can find something here that will fit you?”
Jimmy said, “Yes, I can do that, mommy.”
 
They went to the toy store at the mall. Jimmy looked around and found something that was so fancy. He saw a shiny red race car and said, “I want this one!”
 
Mommy said, “Let’s see if it fits.”
Jimmy held up the car and it fit perfectly in his hands. He was so happy. He looked up to his mommy and said “Mommy, I found something that fits!” 
 
Mommy smiled and said, “That’s great. Now let’s go see if we can find something that fits me!”
