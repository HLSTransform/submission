Once upon a time a little girl lived in a house with a pretty purple rug. She loved the rug and spent lots of time playing on it. Every morning she would wake up and jump on the rug right away.
One day her mom had to go away, so the little girl had to go stay with her grandpa. She was so sad to leave her rug behind and she missed it so much. She asked her grandpa if she could bring it with her, but he said
no.
The little girl was so sad. She tried to play with her grandpa's rug but it wasn't the same. She just wanted her purple rug back. 
Finally her mom came home and the little girl was so excited! She ran right to the rug and hugged it tight. She was never going to miss it ever again!
