Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big tree with many fruits. The fruits are red and round. They look yummy.
"Let's pick some fruits!" Ben says. He runs to the tree and climbs up. Lily follows him.
They pick some fruits and put them in a basket. They are happy. They want to eat the fruits.
But then, they hear a loud voice. It is the farmer. He is angry.
"Hey, you! Stop stealing my fruits!" he shouts. He runs to the tree with a stick.
Lily and Ben are scared. They drop the basket and the fruits. The fruits are broken. They fall from the tree and run away.
The farmer is sad. He worked hard to grow the fruits. He wanted to sell them at the market. Now, he has no fruits.
Lily and Ben feel bad. They know they did wrong. They should not take what is not theirs. They should ask before they touch.
They go back to the park. They say sorry to the farmer. They help him pick up the fruits. They give him some money.
The farmer is happy. He forgives them. He gives them some fruits. He tells them to be honest and respectful.
Lily and Ben are happy. They learned a lesson. They thank the farmer. They share the fruits with their friends. They promise to be good.
