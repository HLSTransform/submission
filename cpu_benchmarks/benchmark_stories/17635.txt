Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to cook with her mom in the kitchen. One day, Lily's mom taught her how to make cookies. Lily was so happy that she could cook her own cookies now.
After they finished baking, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to go to the theater. Lily was so excited and said yes. They got dressed up and went to the theater. The theater was big and beautiful.
During the play, Lily whispered to her mom, "Mommy, the actors are so humble." Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, they are very talented and kind." After the play, they went home and ate their cookies. Lily was so proud that she could cook her own cookies and go to the theater with her mom.
