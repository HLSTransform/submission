Sara and Ben liked to play on the beach. They liked to make sand castles and look for shells. One day, they saw something shiny in the water. It was a huge anchor. It was bigger than their dad.
"Wow, look at that!" Sara said. "Can we go and touch it?"
Ben shook his head. "No, we can't. Mom said we have to stay on the sand. The water is too deep and cold."
"But I want to see it closer. Maybe it has treasure on it. Maybe it belongs to a pirate ship." Sara said. She took a step towards the water.
Ben grabbed her hand. "No, Sara, don't. It's not safe. The anchor is too heavy and sharp. It could hurt you. And the waves could pull you away. We have to stay here."
Sara looked at the anchor again. It was very shiny and pretty. But she also saw the water was moving fast and making loud noises. She felt scared. She squeezed Ben's hand.
"Okay, Ben, you're right. We'll stay here. But can we draw the anchor on the sand? Then we can pretend we are pirates."
Ben smiled. "Sure, Sara, we can do that. That sounds like fun. Come on, let's find some sticks and stones to make our anchor."
They ran back to the sand and started to draw. They had fun making their own anchor and pirate ship. They forgot about the real anchor in the water. They were happy to stay on the beach.
