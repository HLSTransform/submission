Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to class, but sometimes it was tough for her to understand everything. One day, her teacher explained to her how to add two numbers together. Lily was so happy and understood it! She went home and explained it to her mommy and daddy. They were so proud of her! From then on, Lily loved going to class even more because she knew she could understand anything if someone explained it to her.
