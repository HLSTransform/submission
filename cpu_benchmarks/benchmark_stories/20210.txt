Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their mom. They liked to swing, slide and run. They saw a big tree with many leaves. They wanted to see what was under the tree.
"Can we go there, mom?" Ben asked.
"Sure, but be careful. Don't go too far," mom said.
Ben and Lily ran to the tree. They found a hole under the tree. They looked inside the hole. They saw something shiny.
"What is that?" Lily said.
"It is a wallet," Ben said. "Someone left it here."
Ben took the wallet out of the hole. He opened it. He saw some cards and some money.
"Wow, look at this!" Ben said.
"Maybe we can buy some candy with this money," Lily said.
"No, we can't. This is not our money. This is someone else's money. We have to give it back," Ben said.
"But how can we find who it belongs to?" Lily said.
"Maybe we can ask mom. She will understand," Ben said.
Ben and Lily ran back to their mom. They showed her the wallet.
"Mom, look what we found under the tree. It is a wallet. It is not ours. Who does it belong to?" Ben said.
Mom looked at the wallet. She saw a name and a phone number on one of the cards.
"Good job, Ben and Lily. You did the right thing. This wallet belongs to Mr. Jones. He is a friend of mine. He must have dropped it when he was here yesterday. He will be very happy to get it back. I will call him and tell him you found his wallet. He will thank you very much," mom said.
Ben and Lily smiled. They were glad they helped Mr. Jones. They learned that it is not good to take what is not yours. They learned that mom always understands.
