Bubbles sat in her backyard and sighed. She had been so looking forward to having a picnic today, but it had started to rain. She felt sad. 
Suddenly, she heard a strange noise. It sounded like water dripping. She looked around to see where the noise was coming from and saw that the old statue in the corner was soaking! 
Bubbles ran over to it, and noticed that the statue was broken. She asked it, "What happened?" 
The statue said sadly, "I was never as strong as the other statues, so the heavy rain has made me crack." 
Bubbles felt very sorry for the broken statue. She took it inside and said, "Don't worry - I will keep you safe and dry." 
And so Bubbles found a way to enjoy the rainy day after all!
