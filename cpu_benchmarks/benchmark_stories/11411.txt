Once upon a time there was a kind princess who loved beautiful jewelry. Every day she wore her favorite pink necklace to make her feel special.
One day, the princess went on a magical adventure to the forest. As she walked, she noticed a sparkly jewel hidden in the forest. When she got closer, she saw it was a pink necklace that was even more beautiful than her own.
The princess was about to take it, when a friendly bunny hopped up to her. “This pink necklace is mine!” exclaimed the bunny. “I found it first, so it should be mine!”
The kind princess listened to the bunny’s request. She thought for a moment, then smiled. “I will not take your necklace, but I will ask you a favor instead,” said the princess. “Will you lead me to even more beautiful jewels in the forest?”
The bunny agreed and the two set off. The bunny found many beautiful jewels with the princess. The princess thanked the bunny and they agreed to keep their adventure a secret. The princess was so happy to find beautiful jewelry in the forest. 
The end.
