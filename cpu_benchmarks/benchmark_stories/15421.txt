One day, John saw a peanut. He was so excited! He wanted to eat it, but first he had to ask for permission. His mom said it was ok, but she said the peanut was very spicy. John didn't know what that meant, but he decided to try it. 
John grabbed the peanut and put it in his mouth. Right away, he knew it was spicy! His eyes started to tear up and his mouth began to burn. He coughed and sputtered, but eventually he finished the peanut. 
When John was done, he ran to his mom and told her how spicy it was. His mom smiled and said, "That's why you always have to ask permission before you eat anything!" 
John nodded, excited to learn a new lesson. From then on, he always asked permission before trying something new.
