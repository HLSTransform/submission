Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his toy cars. One day, Timmy's little sister Sally came into his room and wanted to play with his toy cars too. But Timmy didn't want to share his toys with her, so he ignored her and kept playing with his cars.
Sally felt sad and left the room. She went to the kitchen and found some glue. She thought it would be fun to put glue on Timmy's toy cars so he couldn't play with them anymore. Sally was too weak to open the glue bottle, so she asked her mommy for help.
When Timmy went back to his room, he saw that his toy cars were all stuck together with glue. He felt angry and sad at the same time. But then he remembered how he ignored Sally earlier and realized that he shouldn't have done that. He apologized to Sally and they both worked together to clean up the glue mess. From then on, Timmy and Sally played together and shared their toys.
