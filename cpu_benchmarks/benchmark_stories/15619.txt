Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and balls. One day, Tom gets a new car. It is red and shiny and fast. Tom is very happy. He shows his new car to Sam.
"Look, Sam, this is my new car. I got it for my week-day. It is the best car ever. Do you want to play with it?" Tom says.
Sam looks at the car. He likes it too. He wants to play with it. But he is also a little sad. He does not have a new car. He only has an old car. It is blue and dull and slow. He wishes he had a new car like Tom.
"Your car is very nice, Tom. But I do not have a new car. I only have this old car. It is not fun to play with. Can I own your car?" Sam says.
Tom thinks for a moment. He likes his new car. He does not want to give it away. But he also likes Sam. He does not want to make him sad. He remembers that Sam shared his ball with him last week. He decides to be kind.
"OK, Sam, you can own my car. But only for a little time. Then you have to give it back to me. And you have to be careful with it. Do not break it or lose it. OK?" Tom says.
Sam smiles. He is very happy. He thanks Tom and takes the car. He and Tom play with the cars and the balls. They have a lot of fun. They are good friends.
