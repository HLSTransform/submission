Sara and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big gate with a lock. They want to know what is behind the gate. They look for a key to unlock the gate.
They find a key on the ground. It is shiny and silver. Sara picks it up and says, "This is mine. I found it." Ben says, "No, it is mine. I saw it first." They start to fight over the key.
A dog comes to the park. It is big and brown. It sees the key in Sara's hand. It wants the key. It runs to Sara and Ben and barks. Sara and Ben are scared. They drop the key. The dog grabs the key and runs away.
Sara and Ben are sad. They lost the key. They cannot unlock the gate. They do not know what to do. They hear a voice behind the gate. It says, "Hello, children. Do you want to see what is behind the gate?"
Sara and Ben are alert. They look at the gate. They see a man with a beard and a hat. He is smiling. He says, "I am the gardener. I work here. I have another key. Do you want to come in and see the flowers?"
Sara and Ben nod. They are curious. They want to see the flowers. The man unlocks the gate and opens it. He invites Sara and Ben to come in. He says, "Welcome to the secret garden. It is very beautiful. Come and see."
