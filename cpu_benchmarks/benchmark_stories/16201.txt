"Where are we going?" asked Jane. She was a three year old girl with bright eyes and a big smile.
"We are going to the park," said her mom. "It's a lovely place."
Jane was excited. She loved going to the park. She watched out the window of the car as the driver took them there.
When they arrived, Jane and her mom took a seat on a bench. It was a sunny day and the park was full of life. Jane saw a family playing together, and she smiled.
"What do you value most in life?" asked her mom.
"Love," Jane said. She paused for a moment before continuing, "It's the most lovely thing to give and to receive."
Her mom smiled. "You're right, my darling. That's why it's important to value love every day." She hugged Jane tight.
Jane smiled and hugged her mom back. It was a lovely moment that she would always value.
