Once upon a time, a police lady lifted up a big wet ball. The police lady was very strong and the ball was very heavy. She wanted to take the ball to her friend's house, so she held it tight and started to walk. After a few minutes, she got very tired so she stopped and looked for help.
Then, she saw a small car and asked the driver if he could help her. The driver said yes, so she quickly put the wet ball in the car. 
The driver drove the car to her friend's house. When they got there, the police lady thanked the driver and lifted the wet ball out of the car. Her friend was so happy to see the ball, and they both laughed and smiled.
The End.
