Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the rain. One day, she slipped and fell down. Her knee was hurt and it was bleeding. Her mom quickly got a bandage and put it on her knee. 
Lily felt much better with the bandage on her knee. She admired her mom for always taking care of her. After a few days, the bandage came off and Lily's knee was all better. She went outside to play again, but this time she was careful not to slip and fall. She didn't want to get wet or hurt again.
