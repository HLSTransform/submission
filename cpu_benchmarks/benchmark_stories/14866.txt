Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the rain. He would jump in puddles and splash around, getting very wet. But one day, Timmy's mom said he couldn't go outside because it was too serious of a storm.
Timmy was sad and didn't know what to do. He decided to spend his time playing with his toys inside. But he quickly got bored and missed being outside in the wet rain. He thought about sneaking out, but he knew it was too serious of a storm.
Suddenly, Timmy had an idea. He asked his mom if they could make paper boats and sail them in the puddles outside. His mom thought it was a great idea, and they spent the rest of the day making boats and having fun in the rain. Timmy was no longer sad, and he learned that even when things seem serious, there's always a way to have fun. The end.
