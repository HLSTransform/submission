One day, a big automobile went down the road. It was very fast. A little boy named Tim saw the automobile and wanted to play with it.
Tim had a toy gun that could shoot soft balls. He wanted to shoot the balls at the automobile. He thought it would be fun. But he felt guilty because he knew it was not nice to do that.
In the end, Tim decided not to shoot the automobile. He knew it was better to be kind. The automobile went away, and Tim went to play with his friends. They all had fun together, and Tim was happy he did the right thing.
