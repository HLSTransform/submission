Once upon a time, there were two friends, a boy and a girl. They loved to play together in the park, but one day they had a fight because the boy took the girl's toy. The girl felt hurt and sad, and the boy didn't know what to do.
Later that day, they found a mystery box in the park. They were curious and opened it together. Inside, they found a puzzle with many pieces. They decided to unite and solve the puzzle together. They worked hard and finally finished it.
But when they tried to close the box, they realized that they couldn't. The box was cursed and they were trapped inside forever. They cried and wished they had never fought. The end.
