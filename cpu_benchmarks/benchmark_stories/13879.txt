Once upon a time, there was a little house with a big chimney. In this house lived a stubborn cat named Fluffy. Fluffy liked to play and jump all day long.
One day, Fluffy met a new friend, a tiny bird named Chirpy. Fluffy wanted to introduce Chirpy to the big chimney. They went inside the house and looked at the chimney together.
Chirpy was scared of the big chimney, but Fluffy was stubborn and wanted to play there. So, they played near the chimney and had lots of fun. Soon, Chirpy liked the chimney too. Fluffy and Chirpy became best friends and played near the chimney every day.
