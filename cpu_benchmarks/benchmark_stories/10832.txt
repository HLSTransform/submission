Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a chubby cat named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to sleep on Lily's rug all day long. 
One day, Lily decided to name her rug "Rainbow". Fluffy didn't mind the new name and continued to nap on the Rainbow rug. 
But one day, Lily spilled some juice on the Rainbow rug. She was sad because she thought it was ruined. But Fluffy helped her clean it up with his chubby paws. 
From that day on, Lily loved her Rainbow rug even more because it reminded her of the time Fluffy helped her clean up the juice.
