Ella was a little bird who loved to fly. She liked to soar high in the sky and feel the wind on her wings. She had many friends who flew with her, like Tom the sparrow and Lily the dove. They played games and sang songs in the air.
One day, Ella saw a big tree with a long trunk. She was curious and wanted to see what was inside. She flew closer and saw a hole in the trunk. She heard a deep voice say, "Who is there?" Ella was scared and flew away.
"Who was that?" Tom asked her.
"I don't know. It sounded like a big animal," Ella said.
"Maybe it was a bear or a lion," Lily said.
"Or maybe it was a wise owl," Tom said. "They live in trees and know many things."
Ella wondered if Tom was right. She wanted to meet a wise owl and learn from him. She decided to go back to the tree and say hello. She flew to the hole and said, "Hello, I'm Ella. Are you a wise owl?"
There was silence for a moment. Then the voice said, "No, I'm not a wise owl. I'm a hungry snake. And you are my lunch."
Ella was shocked and frightened. She tried to fly away, but the snake was faster. He stretched out his head and grabbed Ella with his teeth. He pulled her into the trunk and swallowed her whole.
Tom and Lily saw what happened and cried. They flew away and told the other birds to stay away from the tree. They learned a sad lesson: not everyone who lives in a tree is wise or friendly. Some are mean and dangerous.
