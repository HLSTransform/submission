Mommy said, "It's time to measure the grass!" So Daddy, Mommy, and Anna went outside to measure the grass. Daddy took out the ruler and showed it to Anna. She held on to it and it felt big and strong. 
Mommy said, "Let's organize this measurement." So they got to work. Daddy held the ruler straight and Mommy held the end of the ruler with one hand and placed her other hand at the other end of the ruler. 
Anna said, "Mommy, I want to help!" So Mommy and Daddy both held the ruler and Anna moved her hands under the ruler. She was so excited to measure the grass like a grown-up! 
Mommy said, "We did it! We measured the grass." Anna smiled and said, "Yay! I did it!" Daddy gave her a hug and they all went back inside.
