Tom liked to bounce his ball. He bounced it high and low, fast and slow, near and far. He bounced it on the grass, on the path, on the wall. He bounced it all day long.
One day, he bounced his ball too hard. It flew over the fence and into the road. Tom ran after it, but he could not catch it. The ball bounced and bounced and bounced, until it was out of sight.
Tom was sad. He lost his ball. He did not have another one. He sat on the grass and cried.
A girl saw him crying. She was walking with her mom. She had a ball too. It was red and shiny. She liked to bounce it too.
She went to Tom and said, "Hi, I am Sue. Why are you sad?"
Tom said, "I lost my ball. It bounced away to the east. I can't find it."
Sue said, "That's too bad. Do you want to play with my ball? We can share it."
Tom looked at her ball. It was very nice. He said, "Thank you, Sue. You are very kind. You have a nice ball."
Sue said, "You're welcome, Tom. You are very modest. You don't need a fancy ball to have fun."
They smiled at each other. They bounced the ball together. They had fun. They became friends.
