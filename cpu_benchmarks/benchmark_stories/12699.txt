Once upon a time, there was a couple who lived together. The husband was called Bob, and his wife's name was Sue.
They were happy together until one day Bob had an idea to do something different. He asked his wife, "Sue, what if we were to separate for a while?"
At first Sue wasn't sure, but she thought that it might be a good idea. So Bob and Sue decided to separate, and they said goodbye to each other.
Bob found an original house to live in, and Sue stayed in hers. Every few weeks they would meet up, and they would talk and laugh and enjoy being with each other again, even though they were now living separately.
After several months of living this way, Bob and Sue realized that being apart made them appreciate each other even more. They decided that it would be better to stay together, and so they became husband and wife again.
And they lived happily ever after.
