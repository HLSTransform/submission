One day, a brown dog named Max saw a kayak by the river. He thought it was a toy and wanted to play with it. Max tried to push the kayak into the water, but it was too heavy for him. He felt sad because he could not play with the kayak.
A little boy named Tim saw Max and said, "Why are you sad, Max?" Max barked and showed Tim the kayak. Tim smiled and said, "I can help you!" Tim pushed the kayak into the water for Max. Max wagged his tail and jumped into the kayak.
They started to paddle down the river. Max barked and Tim laughed. Tim said, "Max, do you want to hear a joke?" Max barked again. Tim told the joke, "Why did the dog sit in the shade? Because he did not want to be a hot dog!" Max barked and wagged his tail because he liked the joke. They had fun in the kayak and forgot about their troubles.
