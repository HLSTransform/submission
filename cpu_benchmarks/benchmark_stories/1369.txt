Once upon a time, there was a girl called Sue. She was three years old, and very curious. One day, she wanted to explore something new, so she asked her mom if she could go for a walk. Her mom said yes, so off she went.
As Sue explored, she saw lots of interesting things. She saw big trees, tall buildings and bright flowers. Everything was so unique! Sue couldn't believe her eyes.
Soon Sue came to a hill. She wanted to see what was on the other side, but she couldn't see very far. She tried to find a way to manage. She looked and looked until she found a nice tall tree.
Sue climbed up the tree, and when she reached the top, she looked around. From up there, Sue could see everything! The view was so much better! She was so happy!
Sue smiled to herself, proud that she was able to manage. She waved from the top of the tree, and shuffled down. Then she went back home and told her mom about all the unique things she saw.
