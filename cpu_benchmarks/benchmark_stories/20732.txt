Josh was three years old and very excited. He was going to see a motorcycle! He was so helpless that his mom and dad had to help him dress. Finally he was ready; his dad took his hand and they headed outside.
Josh saw the motorcycle and gasped. The shiny machine with bright colors welcomed him. He reached out to touch it and his dad said, 'not yet, Josh'. 
Josh asked if he could go for a ride and the man nodded. Josh felt so much joy that he wanted to scream! He was carefully put on the motorcycle and his dad gave him a helmet. Josh felt so safe and happy.
The man started the motorcycle and Josh felt the vibrations. He waved to his mom and dad as they drove away. Josh was having the time of his life!
Soon they were back and Josh thanked the man. He couldn't believe he had been on a motorcycle. He couldn't wait to tell his friends. His parents welcomed him with a hug and he ran inside to tell them everything!
