Jane was a persistent girl. She loved to watch the Earth from her bedroom window. Every day, she thought about the Earth and all of its mysteries. She wanted to find out more about it.
One day, Jane had a plan. She asked her mom if she could go outside and explore the Earth even more. Her mom said "yes" and helped her get dressed.
Jane walked and walked until she came to a meadow. She found a pond and noticed some ducks swimming in it. She sat down and watched them for awhile.
Jane stared up at the sky and noticed some clouds in the sky. She was so amazed by the shapes that they made.
She explored the Earth all day and when it was time to go home, she was sad. But she had a plan to come back soon. Jane was excited and full of energy as she walked back home. She knew she could explore the wonders of Earth with her persistent spirit.
