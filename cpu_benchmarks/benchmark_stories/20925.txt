Once upon a time, there lived a big pig. The pig was very proud and always thought he was the best. One day, the pig went to a market and saw a little pig.
The big pig laughed and said: "Look at that small pig, how silly he is".
The little pig heard it and said: "I may be small, but I also have something to offer". 
The big pig was so surprised, he asked: "What can you offer?".
The little pig replied: "I may be small but I can offer friendship and kindness".
The big pig realised he had been mean and said sorry. From that day on, the two pigs became friends. They worked together and split the work down each side.
The moral of the story is that no matter how big or small you are, you can always offer friendship and kindness.
