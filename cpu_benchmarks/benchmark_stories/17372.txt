Sara and Tom were playing in the kitchen. They liked to pretend they were chefs and make yummy food. They used pots and pans and spoons and cups. They also used a teaspoon to measure salt and sugar.
"Tom, can you pass me the teaspoon?" Sara asked. "I need it for the cake."
"Here you go, Sara." Tom said. He gave her the teaspoon. He was very careful not to spill anything.
Sara smiled and took the teaspoon. She added some sugar to the bowl. She stirred the batter with a big spoon. She was very fast.
"Wow, Sara, you are so fast!" Tom said. He watched her with big eyes. He wanted to help too.
"Thank you, Tom. Do you want to help me put the cake in the oven?" Sara asked.
"Yes, please!" Tom said. He was very excited. He loved cake.
Sara and Tom carried the bowl to the oven. They opened the door and slid the cake inside. They closed the door and turned the knob.
"Be careful, the oven is very hot!" Sara warned.
"I know, I know." Tom said. He nodded.
They waited for the cake to bake. They smelled the sweet aroma. They heard the timer beep.
"The cake is ready!" Sara said.
"Yay!" Tom said.
They opened the oven door and took out the cake. They put it on a rack to cool.
"Can we eat it now?" Tom asked.
"Not yet, we have to wait a little bit." Sara said.
"Okay, okay." Tom said. He was very hungry.
They waited for the cake to cool. They cut a slice for each of them. They ate the cake with big bites. They smiled and licked their lips.
"Mmm, this is the best cake ever!" Sara said.
"I agree, you are a great chef, Sara!" Tom said.
"Thank you, Tom. You are a great helper, Tom!" Sara said.
They hugged and laughed. They were very happy. They cleaned up the kitchen and shut the door. They went to play some more.
