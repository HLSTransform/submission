Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to ride her bike in the park. One day, she met a boy named Timmy who was also riding his bike. They started talking and became friends.
Lily invited Timmy to her house for some cookies. Her mom was baking cookies in the oven and the whole house smelled delicious. Timmy said, "Mmm, it smells so good in here!"
Lily's mom offered them both cookies, but they were too hot to eat. Timmy said, "These cookies are too tight, we have to wait for them to cool down." So, they waited patiently and then enjoyed the delicious cookies together.
