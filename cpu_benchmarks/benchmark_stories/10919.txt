Once upon a time, there was a big tree with deep roots. The tree was very happy because it had many friends. One day, a big storm came and the wind blew very hard. Some of the tree's friends fell down, but the tree remained strong because of its deep roots. 
The tree was very sad that its friends were gone, but it knew that they were still there in the ground. The tree's roots went deep into the dirt to find its friends' roots. The tree was happy to find that its friends' roots were still there and they were still alive. 
From that day on, the tree and its friends remained together and grew even stronger. The tree was very proud of its deep roots because they helped it to stay strong and keep its friends safe. The end.
