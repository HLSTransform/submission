Once upon a time there was a little girl called Mia. She loved looking up at the night sky and imagining all the things she could do in space.
One day, Mia decided to go on an adventure. She grabbed her space rocket and flew up into the sky.
At first, she was excited but then Mia started to get scared. She saw lots of stars in the darkness and some of them seemed so far away.
So she decided to grab the nearest star and take it with her. She held it tight and the star made her feel safer.
Mia flew back down to Earth and was so happy with her new star. She liked to think of it as her friend and every night she would look up to the sky and think of all the possibilities in outer space.
