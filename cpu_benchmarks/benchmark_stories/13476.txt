Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside, but it was very cold outside. Her mom told her to put on her gloves so she wouldn't get cold. 
Lily looked for her gloves, but she couldn't find them. She asked her mom where they were. "I don't know," her mom said. "Did you put them away?" 
Lily felt ashamed because she forgot to put them away after playing outside the day before. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'll put them away next time." 
Her mom smiled and gave her a warm hug. "It's okay," she said. "Let's go find your gloves together." They searched the house and finally found the gloves under the couch. Lily put them on and happily went outside to play.
