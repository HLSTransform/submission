Anna and Ben are playing with their toys in the living room. They hear a loud noise outside. They look out the window and see a big truck. The truck has a sign that says "order". The truck stops in front of their house.
"Look, Ben, the truck is here!" Anna says. "Maybe it has something for us!"
They run to the door and wait for the truck driver. The truck driver gets out and opens the back of the truck. He takes out a big box. The box has a sticker that says "fragile". He carries the box to the door.
"Hello, kids, I have a delivery for you," the truck driver says. "Is your mom or dad home?"
"Yes, they are in the kitchen," Ben says. "We will call them."
They run to the kitchen and tell their mom and dad that the truck driver has a box for them. Their mom and dad come to the door and sign for the box. They thank the truck driver and take the box inside.
"What is in the box, mom?" Anna asks.
"It's a surprise, honey," mom says. "We will open it together."
They go to the living room and put the box on the floor. They carefully cut the tape and open the box. Inside, they find a beautiful dollhouse. The dollhouse has many rooms, furniture, and dolls. It is very colorful and detailed.
"Wow, it's amazing!" Anna says. "Is it for me?"
"Yes, it is, sweetie," dad says. "It's a gift from your grandma. She made it for you with love."
Anna hugs her mom and dad and thanks them. She is very happy. She loves her grandma and her new dollhouse.
"Can I play with it, too?" Ben asks.
"Of course, you can, brother," Anna says. "But we have to be gentle. It's fragile."
They start to play with the dollhouse. They make up stories and have fun. They forget about the noise outside. They don't notice that it starts to rain. They are too busy with their new toy. They are very happy.
