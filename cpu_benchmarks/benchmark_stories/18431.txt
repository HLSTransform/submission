Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her room. Lily didn't want to stop playing, so she put her toys in her sock drawer.
Later that day, Lily's friend came over to play. She saw all the toys in the sock drawer and felt envious. "Wow, you have so many toys!" Lily's friend said. "Can we play with them?"
Lily felt happy to share her toys with her friend. They played together until it was time for her friend to go home. Lily felt proud that she could make her friend happy by sharing her toys. From then on, Lily always remembered to share her toys and play nicely with her friends.
