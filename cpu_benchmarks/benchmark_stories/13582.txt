Once upon a time, there was a little brown bear named Bubba. Bubba loved to play with his friends in the forest. One day, Bubba and his friends were having fun when they saw a big band of bees. The bees were flying towards them, and Bubba knew they needed to prevent getting stung.
Bubba had an idea. He told his friends to run to the river and jump in. The bees wouldn't follow them in the water. Bubba led the way, and they all jumped in the river. The bees flew away, and Bubba and his friends were safe.
From that day on, Bubba knew that he could prevent bad things from happening if he thought quickly and used his brain. He was a smart little brown bear.
