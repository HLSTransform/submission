Once upon a time, there was a little girl named May who loved to walk in the forest. On her way, she found an acorn. May thought it was very cute and she was so happy. She picked it up and said happily "I will take care of you."
May took it home with her and kept it safe. Every day, she gave it a healthy snack and lots of kisses, so it could grow.
One day, May came back home and couldn't find her acorn. She knew he must have gone for a walk. She walked around looking for him and came across a big old tree. And from the tree, she heard a voice saying "Come and kiss me!"
May looked up, and there was her acorn, above the tree and smiling. May was so excited and she ran up to him and kissed him.
From that day, they went on adventures every day. May took care of her acorn with healthy snacks and lots of kisses. They were always very happy and had lots of fun. 
The End.
