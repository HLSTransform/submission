Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big trophy that she won at a dance competition. One day, her little brother Billy accidentally broke the trophy while playing with his toy car.
Lily was sad and cried a lot. Billy felt bad and wanted to make her happy again. He said, "Don't cry, Lily. I will replace your trophy with a new one."
Lily was surprised and asked, "Really? But where will you get a new trophy from?"
Billy replied, "I will ask mommy to buy one for you. And this time, it won't be smelly like the old one."
Lily smiled and hugged her brother. She was so happy to have such a kind and thoughtful brother.
