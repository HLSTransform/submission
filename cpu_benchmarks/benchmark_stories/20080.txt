One sunny day, Timmy went to the mailbox to check if he got any mail. He saw a red flag on the mailbox and got excited. "Mommy, look! The flag is up! That means we got mail!" Timmy said. 
Mommy walked over to the mailbox and opened it. She pulled out a letter and read it. "Timmy, this letter says that we need to be alert for a big storm coming," Mommy said. 
Timmy looked up at the sky and saw dark clouds. "Mommy, what's a storm?" Timmy asked. 
"A storm is when it rains really hard and the wind blows really strong," Mommy explained. "We need to stay inside and be safe." 
Timmy nodded his head and went back inside with Mommy. He was happy they got mail, but also a little scared of the storm.
