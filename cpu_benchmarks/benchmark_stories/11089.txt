One day, a little girl named Mia went to the park. She saw a big tree with a trunk. She wanted to discover what was hiding behind it. Mia walked around the tree and found a cute bunny.
"Hello, bunny," said Mia. The bunny looked at her and said, "Hello, Mia. I am envious of your pretty dress." Mia smiled and thanked the bunny.
Mia and the bunny played together all day. They were very happy. When it was time to go home, Mia said goodbye to the bunny and went back to her house.
