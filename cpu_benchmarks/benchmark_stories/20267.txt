Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He was very independent and liked to do things by himself. One day, Tim went to the kitchen to find something to eat. He saw an avocado on the table.
Tim's mom saw him and warned, "Be careful, Tim. The avocado is not ready to eat." But Tim didn't listen. He wanted to eat the avocado all by himself.
Tim tried to open the avocado, but it was too hard. He got upset and started to cry. His mom came over and said, "I told you to be careful. Let me help you with the avocado." Tim learned to listen to warnings and that it's okay to ask for help sometimes.
