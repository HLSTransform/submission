Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a big field. In the field, there was some hay. The hay was yellow and smelled nice. One day, the farmer saw a bird sitting on the hay. The bird was fragile and looked scared. The farmer tried to catch the bird, but it flew away. The farmer just shrugged and went back to work. The end.
