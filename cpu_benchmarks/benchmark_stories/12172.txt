Maggie and her mom were out at the store shopping. Maggie’s mom was looking at some fancy dresses. She pointed to one, saying, “Look at this one, Maggie. Isn’t it nice?”
“Yes, Mommy, it’s pretty,” Maggie said. “It’s got a zip, too. I like it.”
Her mom smiled and said, “Why don’t we get it for you?”
Maggie was very excited and jumped up and down. But then her mom noticed a sign that said “No Loads”. Maggie saw the sign too and asked, “Mommy, why can’t we load the dress?”
“It means, Maggie,” her mom said gently, “that we can’t take it home with us. We’ll have to leave it here today. Maybe next time we can get it.”
Maggie was sad but she promised she wouldn’t forget the fancy dress and the zip. She knew she would have to come back to the store soon so she could get the dress she wanted.
