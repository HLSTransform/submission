Once upon a time, there was a clown who loved to make people laugh. He would juggle balls and make silly faces, but he was always alone. He felt very lonely.
One day, the clown went to the circus and saw a big bag of candy. He wanted it so badly, but he didn't have any money. Suddenly, he saw a man with a hat sneaking around. The man was trying to steal the candy!
The clown knew he had to stop the man. He ran up to him and said, "Hey! That candy is not yours to take!" The man was surprised and dropped the bag. The clown picked it up and gave it to the circus owner. The owner was very happy and said, "Thank you, clown! You saved the day!" From that day on, the clown was never lonely again.
