Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweet. Tweet loved to fly and soar high in the sky. One day, as Tweet was flying, she found a twig on the ground. The twig was small and brown, but Tweet thought it was perfect to add to her nest.
As she was carrying the twig, Tweet saw her friend Bunny hopping by. "Hi Bunny!" said Tweet. "Look at the twig I found. It's perfect for my nest!"
Bunny looked at the twig and said, "That's a nice twig, Tweet. But be careful, it's warm outside and you don't want to get too tired from carrying it."
Tweet nodded and thanked Bunny for the advice. She flew back to her nest and added the twig to it. As she rested, she thought about how much fun it was to soar through the sky and find new things to add to her nest.
