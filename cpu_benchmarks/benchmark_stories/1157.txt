Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a big factory. The factory made toys for kids. One day, a toy named Tim wanted to be independent. He did not want to stay in the factory anymore.
Tim said to his friend, Tom, "Let's split from the factory and go on an adventure!" Tom was scared but agreed to go with Tim. So, they left the factory when no one was looking and started their adventure outside.
As they walked, they saw many new things. They saw trees, flowers, and even a big hill. Tim and Tom were happy to be independent and have fun together. They played and laughed all day. And from that day on, they were the best of friends.
