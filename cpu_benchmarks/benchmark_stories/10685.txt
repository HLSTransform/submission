Once upon a time there was a clumsy crane. She made mistakes all the time and acted stupidly. One day, she thought she could fly. So, she threw herself off the top of a tall tree. But, she did not fly--she hit the ground with a thump!
The crane was so embarrassed that she could not move. She felt so dizzy, like her entire world was spinning around! Luckily, some kind animals saw what happened, and they tried to help her.
But, it was too late! The clumsy crane had hurt herself badly. She was sad and hurt, but had to stay still for the rest of her life. And so, the clumsy crane never flew again.
