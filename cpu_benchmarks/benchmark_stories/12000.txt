Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was a nice dog who loved to play with his toys. One day, Max's owner decided to invite Max's friend, Bella, over to play. Max was so happy! 
Max's owner put on Max's leash and they went for a walk to Bella's house. When they got there, Bella's owner opened the door and Max and Bella started to play. They ran around and played with their toys. 
After a while, it was time for Max to go home. Max's owner put on his leash and they said goodbye to Bella and her owner. Max was tired, but he was so happy that he got to play with his friend.
