Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends and ride her bike. One day, she went inside to get a popsicle from the freezer. But the freezer was tough to open! She tried and tried, but it wouldn't budge.
Lily's mom came in and saw her struggling. "Let me help you, sweetie," she said. She opened the freezer and gave Lily a popsicle. "Thank you, Mommy," Lily said.
Later that day, Lily and her friends were playing tag. Lily's friend fell down and hurt her knee. Lily asked her friend if she was okay and told her to mind her knee. They sat down and had some popsicles from the freezer. It was a fun day!
