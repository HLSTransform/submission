Once upon a time, there was a little seed in the soil. The seed was obedient and waited patiently for the sun to rise. Every day, the sun would shine down on the soil and give the seed warmth and light.
One day, a big storm came and the wind blew the soil around. The little seed was scared and didn't know what to do. But it stayed obedient and held on tight to the soil.
After the storm passed, the sun rose again and the little seed began to grow. It grew and grew until it became a beautiful flower. The flower was happy that it had stayed obedient and didn't give up during the storm. And every day, it would look up to the sky and thank the sun for rising and giving it life.
