Pete was a little boy who was very curious. He wanted to explore the chimney in his house. He asked his dad if he could go inside, but dad said it was too dangerous. Undaunted, Pete decided to go in anyway.
He climbed onto the roof and reached up towards the chimney. But he was too small to reach it! He tried and tried, but it was no use.
Just then, he had an idea. He gathered some rocks and stacked them up against the chimney. It was a risky plan, but he wanted to see what was inside.
He started to climb the rocks, but his feet slipped and he tumbled down. He was very scared! But luckily, he wasn't hurt. Dad was right - it had been a very stupid idea. He decided it was better to leave the chimney alone and find something else to explore.
