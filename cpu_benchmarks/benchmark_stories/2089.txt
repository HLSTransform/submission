Once upon a time, there was a little bunny. He loved to hop and play in the fields of wheat. One day, he saw a furry caterpillar crawling on a leaf. He wanted to touch it, but his mother told him not to. She said, "It's not nice to touch things without asking." 
The bunny didn't listen and touched the caterpillar anyway. It made the caterpillar scared and it curled up into a ball. The bunny felt bad for making the caterpillar scared. 
From that day on, the bunny learned to always ask before touching things. He also learned that just because something looks different, doesn't mean it's not important. The caterpillar may have been furry, but it was still special and deserved to be treated with kindness.
