Once upon a time, there was a friendly cow named Betsy. Betsy loved to eat oats. She would eat them all day long. One day, Betsy met a little girl named Lily. Lily said, "Hi Betsy, can I be your friend?" Betsy replied, "Of course, I love making new friends!"
Lily and Betsy played together all day. They ran and jumped and had so much fun. When the day started to end, Lily said, "I have to go home now, Betsy. But I had so much fun playing with you!" Betsy replied, "Me too, Lily. Let's play again soon!"
Betsy went back to eating her oats and thought about how much fun she had with her new friend. She was happy that Lily was friendly and kind. Betsy knew that their friendship would never end.
