Once there was a little boy named Luke. He was scared to go to school every day, but he wanted to be brave. One day, he got so scared that he decided to hide in his room. He looked around and saw a big, big frame.
He decided to count all of the tiny pieces in the frame. He started counting. "One, two, three...." He kept counting until he couldn't count any more. Then he saw something scary - someone was in the frame with him!
Luke was so scared that he screamed and tried to run away. But the frame was too tight. All he could do was sit and cry. In the end, Luke was stuck in the frame forever.
