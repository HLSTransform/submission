Once upon a time there was a pig who lived in a big red barn. He loved to sleep in the hay and eat apples all day. One day, the pig was feeling quite confused. He didn't know why he had to be in the barn or why he couldn't run and play like the other animals. 
The pig asked the farmer, "Why must I stay in the barn, Farmer?"
The farmer replied, "The sun and rain can rot the hay and your food, pig. That's why you have to stay inside."
The pig felt even more confused, but he thanked the farmer for trying to help. Later that day, the farmer brought him a juicy red apple and said, "Here, pig. I hope this makes you feel better."
The pig was so happy! He grabbed the apple and ran around the barn. Now he knew what the farmer meant and why it was important to stay inside. He smiled and said, "Thank you, Farmer!" 
And from that day onwards, the pig stayed safe and warm inside the red barn, never feeling confused again.
