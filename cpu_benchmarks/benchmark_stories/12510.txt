Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweety. Tweety lived on a branch high up in a tree. One day, Tweety saw a flower start to bloom on a nearby branch. "Look, look!" Tweety chirped to his friend, a squirrel. "Pretty flower!"
The squirrel scampered over to the branch and looked at the flower. "Wow!" said the squirrel. "That's a beautiful flower. It's so quiet up here. I can hear the wind blowing through the leaves."
Tweety nodded his head in agreement. "Yes, it's very quiet. I like it up here on our branch. It's our special place."
The squirrel smiled. "Yes, it is. And now we have a pretty flower to enjoy too!" The two friends sat on the branch and watched the flower bloom, enjoying the peacefulness of their special spot in the tree.
