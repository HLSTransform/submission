Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go to the beach with her family. One day, they went to the beach and her mom gave her a bucket to collect seashells. Lily was so excited to find a lot of seashells.
While she was walking along the shore, she saw a little shrimp. "Oh, you are so cute!" she said. She picked up the shrimp and put it in her bucket with the seashells. But soon, Lily noticed a smelly odor coming from her bucket.
"What is that smell?" her brother asked.
"I don't know," Lily said, "but it's coming from my bucket."
Suddenly, Lily's brother saw the shrimp in the bucket. "I think that shrimp is making the smell," he said.
Lily realized that the shrimp was not a good thing to keep in her bucket. She took it out and put it back in the ocean. From that day on, Lily never lost a shrimp in her bucket again.
