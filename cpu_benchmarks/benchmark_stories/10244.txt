Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and watch cartoons on her computer. One day, Lily's nosy little brother, Max, wanted to play with her toys too. Lily didn't want to share, so she told Max to go away.
Max didn't like being told what to do, so he decided to spy on Lily with his toy binoculars. He watched Lily play with her toys and use her computer to record a video of herself singing. Max thought it was funny and decided to show their parents.
When Lily found out, she was very upset. She didn't want anyone to see her video. She told Max that it wasn't nice to be nosy and record her without permission. Max felt bad and apologized to Lily. From then on, they learned to play together and share their toys.
