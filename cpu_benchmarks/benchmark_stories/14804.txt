Tom and Mia were best friends. They liked to play outside in the sun. One day, they saw a big puddle on the grass. They ran to the puddle and jumped in it. They splashed and laughed and had fun.
But then, a tall boy came to the puddle. He was mean and rude. He said, "This is my puddle. Go away, you little kids." He pushed Tom and Mia out of the puddle. He made them fall on the ground. He laughed at them.
Tom and Mia were sad and angry. They wanted to play in the puddle. They did not like the tall boy. They said, "You are not nice. You are a bully. We don't like you." They tried to get up and go back to the puddle.
But the tall boy was stronger and faster. He kicked the puddle and made a big wave. The water hit Tom and Mia and made them wet and cold. They cried and cried. They were very unhappy.
But then, they heard a loud bark. It was Rex, the big dog. Rex was Tom's pet. He loved Tom and Mia. He saw the tall boy being mean to them. He did not like that. He ran to the tall boy and growled. He showed his teeth and his claws. He scared the tall boy.
The tall boy was afraid of Rex. He said, "Sorry, sorry, please don't hurt me." He ran away from the puddle. He did not laugh anymore.
Tom and Mia smiled and hugged Rex. They said, "Thank you, Rex. You are a good dog. You are our hero." They played with Rex in the puddle. They splashed and laughed and had fun. They were happy again.
