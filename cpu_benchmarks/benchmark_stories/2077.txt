Once upon a time, there was a chubby bunny named Betsy. Betsy loved to eat pastries, especially ones with sprinkles on top. One day, Betsy saw a little bird trying to build a nest in a tree. 
But Betsy didn't like the bird because it made too much noise. She decided to ignore the bird and keep eating her pastry. But the bird didn't give up and kept chirping louder and louder. 
Betsy got angry and tried to scare the bird away, but it wouldn't budge. She realized that ignoring the bird wasn't the right thing to do. So, she decided to share her pastry with the bird as a peace offering. 
The bird happily accepted the pastry and Betsy learned that sometimes it's better to be kind and not ignore others. From that day on, Betsy and the bird became good friends and Betsy even helped the bird build its nest. The end.
