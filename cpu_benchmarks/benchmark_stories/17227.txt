Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside, especially when it rained. He put on his raincoat and boots and went outside to jump in puddles. He loved the way the water splashed all around him.
One day, Timmy's mom asked him if he wanted to order a pizza for dinner. Timmy was so excited because he loved pizza. He told his mom that he wanted a pizza with lots of cheese and pepperoni. His mom ordered the pizza and it arrived in just 30 minutes.
After dinner, Timmy went back outside to play. The sun had come out after the rain and he saw a brilliant rainbow in the sky. He jumped in a puddle and looked up at the rainbow. He felt so happy and grateful for his wonderful day.
