Once upon a time, there was a young girl who really wanted to go outside and play. She asked her mom, but her mom disagreed. She thought the young girl was too small and the sun was too bright.
The young girl was sad. She wanted to go outside and have fun, like all of the other kids. She wanted to show her mom that she could do it, so instead of giving up she came up with a plan.
The young girl made a big, deep hole in her garden. Then, she decided to fill up the hole with water from her toilet, even though her mom disagreed. After all the water was in the hole, the young girl had made a really deep muddy puddle in her garden.
The young girl was so excited that she brought all of the neighborhood kids to come and play in it. All of the kids had so much fun in the deep muddy puddle, splashing around and being silly. The young girl was proud of herself for making such a fun place for everyone to play.
The moral of the story is that if you put your mind to it, you can achieve a lot, even if you disagree with the people around you.
