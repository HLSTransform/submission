Lily and Ben went to camp with Mom and Dad. They liked to play in the tent, look at the stars, and make fire with sticks. But they had to be careful, because the camp was near a big forest with many animals.
One night, Lily and Ben heard a loud noise outside the tent. They peeked out and saw a big bear looking for food. The bear smelled their sandwiches and came closer. Lily and Ben were scared and ran to Mom and Dad.
"Mom, Dad, there is a bear!" they shouted.
Mom and Dad woke up and saw the bear too. They grabbed a flashlight and a horn and made a lot of noise. The bear was scared of the noise and ran away.
"Are you okay, Lily and Ben?" Mom asked.
"Yes, Mom, we are okay," they said.
"You were very brave, but also very careless," Dad said. "You left your sandwiches outside the tent. That is why the bear came. You have to repeat after me: we always put our food away at night."
"We always put our food away at night," Lily and Ben repeated.
"Good. Now let's go back to sleep and have a nice dream," Dad said.
Lily and Ben hugged Mom and Dad and went back to the tent. They learned their lesson and never left their food outside again. They had a lot of fun at camp, but they also remembered to be careful.
