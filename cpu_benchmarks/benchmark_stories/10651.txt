Once there was a tiny fox called John. John was very intelligent and always had big hopes. One day he found a mysterious cave and he wanted to explore it.
John's friends were worried and said, "It's too dark, John! We are scared!"
But John assured them, "Everything's going to be alright. Have hope!"
So, the foxes mustered the courage to go in and soon found a sparkly golden treasure. They were so happy and celebrated for their whole day.
The moral of the story is to never give up hope. With hope, everything is possible and we can achieve more than we think. No matter how difficult the situation, hope is always there and we should never stop believing.
