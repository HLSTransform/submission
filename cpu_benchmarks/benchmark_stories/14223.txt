Once upon a time, there was a boy. He was very excited to try something new. He wanted to ride something for the first time.
The boy found a green piece. He thought he could ride on it. He grabbed it tight and jumped on top.
But the piece was too slippery. He couldn't balance. The boy fell off and hurt his arm. He started to cry.
The boy realized that he couldn't ride the green piece. He was so disappointed. He was sad that he couldn't do something new.
The end.
