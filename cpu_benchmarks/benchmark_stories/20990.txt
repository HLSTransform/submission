Once there was a little girl who was very persistent. She was always asking her mum why she couldn't do something. Her mum would say that she didn't understand, and the girl said she wanted to. One day, her mum said she wanted to show the girl something special. Together they went to the fish market.
The girl saw lots of different fish but her favourite was the tuna. She asked if she could have some. Her mum said no, but that she wanted to explain why.
Mum said that the tuna had lots of bones and it can be dangerous for a little girl who doesn't understand. Even though the girl was very persistent, her mum was sure that the girl couldn't understand and so she said no.
Dejected, the girl went home with her mum. They never ate tuna ever again.
