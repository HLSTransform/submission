Once there was a boy called Ryan who was three years old. Ryan had a pet bunny called Flopsy. 
Every day they went to the park together. Ryan liked to pick fruit from the trees. Apples, oranges and plums were Ryan's favourites. 
One day, Ryan saw a bird in the tree. It was a pretty pink bird with a little beak. Ryan wanted to make a new friend, so he reached up to take the fruit from the tree. 
But Flopsy was very helpful and warned Ryan that he could fall from the tree if he went up too high. Ryan listened carefully and decided to hope for the best. He asked the bird if he could have the fruit and it said yes!
So Ryan and Flopsy went home with lots of fruit. Ryan was so happy that he shared the fruit with all his friends. 
Then, every day they all went to the park together to pick more fruit. The bird also came down from the tree to join them, and it became Ryan's new friend. Ryan was very happy and he always hoped for the best!
