Lily was a girl who liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Ann. Ann had long hair and a pretty dress. Lily took Ann everywhere with her.
One day, Lily went to visit her grandpa. He was bald and had a big smile. He liked to read books and tell stories. Lily loved her grandpa very much.
"Hello, Lily," he said. "Do you want to hear a story?"
"Yes, please, grandpa," Lily said. "Can Ann hear it too?"
"Of course, she can," he said. "Come, sit on my lap."
He picked up a book and opened it. It was a story about a princess and a dragon. Lily and Ann listened carefully.
But then, something bad happened. Lily's little brother, Tom, came into the room. He was naughty and liked to spoil things. He saw Ann and grabbed her.
"Give me the doll," he said. "I want to play with it."
"No, Tom, no," Lily said. "She is mine. Give her back."
But Tom did not listen. He pulled Ann's hair and tore her dress. He laughed and ran away.
Lily was very sad. She cried and hugged her grandpa.
"Tom spoiled Ann," she said. "He is mean."
"I'm sorry, Lily," he said. "He should not have done that. Let me see if I can fix her."
He took Ann and looked at her. He found some scissors and a needle and some thread. He cut off the rest of Ann's hair and sewed her dress. He made a little hat and a scarf for her.
"There," he said. "She is not spoiled anymore. She is just different. She is bald, like me."
He gave Ann back to Lily. Lily looked at her. She was not the same as before. But she was still her doll. She smiled and hugged her.
"Thank you, grandpa," she said. "You are very kind. I still love Ann. And I love you too."
"I love you too, Lily," he said. "And I love Ann. She is a brave and beautiful doll. Just like you."
