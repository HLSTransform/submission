Anna and Ben are friends. They like to draw with crayons. Anna has many crayons. She has red, blue, yellow, green, and purple. Ben has only one crayon. He has brown.
One day, they are drawing in the park. Anna draws a flower. She uses red, yellow, and green. Ben draws a tree. He uses brown. He wants to draw some apples on the tree, but he has no red.
"Can I have a red crayon, please?" Ben asks Anna.
Anna looks at her crayons. She likes red. It is her favorite color. She thinks for a moment. She sees Ben's sad face. She feels sorry for him. She is compassionate.
"Okay, you can have a red crayon," Anna says. She gives Ben a red crayon. "But you have to give it back when we are done."
"Thank you, Anna!" Ben says. He smiles. He draws some apples on the tree. He is happy.
Anna and Ben draw together. They share their crayons. They have fun. They are good friends.
