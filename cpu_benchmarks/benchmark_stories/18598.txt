Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved drinking juice. His mommy would always add some water to make it not too sweet. One day, Timmy went to the fair with his mommy. He saw lots of rides and games. Timmy wanted to play a game where he could win a big teddy bear. His mommy gave him some money to play. Timmy played and played, but he didn't win. He was sad and cried a lot. When they got home, Timmy asked his mommy for some juice. She added water to make it not too sweet. But Timmy didn't want it. He threw the cup on the floor and it broke. His mommy was very angry and didn't give him any more juice. Timmy went to bed without any juice and felt very sad.
