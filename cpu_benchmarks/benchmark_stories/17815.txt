Once upon a time, there was a tiny root. It lived in the ground, just below the surface. One day something amazing happened. It began to grow and grow.
It felt tight, like it was pinched. But it only kept growing and soon broke out of the ground. The root was free!
It had never seen the sunlight before and it was so bright that the root had to cover its eyes. But it soon adjusted and began exploring.
The root saw beautiful trees, calm rivers and a clear blue sky. It was so much different than the tiny place it used to live.
It was a new and exciting adventure. The root was now free and ready to grow big and strong in its new home.
