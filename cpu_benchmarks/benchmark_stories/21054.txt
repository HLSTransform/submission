Tommy likes to taste new things. He likes to taste sweet things, like cake and candy. He likes to taste salty things, like chips and cheese. He likes to taste sour things, like lemon and pickle. But he does not like to taste bitter things, like coffee and broccoli.
One day, Tommy sees a big circle on the table. It is brown and shiny. He thinks it is a cookie. He wants to taste it. He takes a bite. But it is not a cookie. It is a coin. It tastes very bad. It tastes bitter and metal. Tommy spits it out. He makes a face. He says, "Yuck!"
Mommy sees Tommy. She sees the coin. She is not happy. She says, "Tommy, that is not a cookie. That is a coin. You should not taste coins. They are not food. They are money. You could get sick. You are very silly."
Tommy feels sorry. He says, "I'm sorry, Mommy. I thought it was a cookie. It looked like a cookie. I wanted to taste it. I did not know it was a coin. I will not taste coins again. I will only taste food."
Mommy hugs Tommy. She says, "It's okay, Tommy. I know you were curious. But you have to be careful. Not everything that looks like food is food. Some things are not for tasting. They are for other things. Like coins are for buying things. And circles are for drawing and playing. Here, I have a real cookie for you. It is sweet and yummy. You can taste it."
Tommy smiles. He says, "Thank you, Mommy. I like cookies. They taste good. They are my favorite food. I will not be silly again. I will only taste cookies and other food. And I will play with circles and other toys." He takes the cookie. He bites it. He says, "Mmm!"
