Once upon a time, there was a pig named Pat. He lived in the biggest pan in the backyard. Pat was very enthusiastic and loved eating apples. One day, he gathered a lot of apples and decided to escape the pan. He ran away with the apples and started to explore the world outside.
Pat travelled through meadows, fields and woods. He loved the adventure but was getting tired. Pat was looking for somewhere he could rest and enjoy the apples. He finally found a big, beautiful tree. Pat quickly put the apples down and started eating.
But little did he know, there was an animal living in the tree. It was an owl, who was very angry to see Pat eating his apples. Suddenly, the owl started flying towards Pat!
Secretly, Pat prepared for the owl's arrival. He had been collecting leaves throughout his journey, and was ready to make a surprise escape. When the owl got close, Pat threw the leaves up in the air â€“ and the owl was distracted! Pat quickly ran away, safe and sound.
His adventure was back to normal, but Pat never forgot his enthusiastic escape!
