Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play at the beach. One day, he saw a dolphin swimming in the ocean. The dolphin was very cool. Timmy wanted to play with the dolphin, so he said, "Hi dolphin, do you want to play with me?"
The dolphin replied, "Yes, I would love to play with you, Timmy!" Suddenly, a big wave came and pushed Timmy into the water. Timmy was scared, but the dolphin quickly swam over to him and pushed him back to the shore.
"Thank you, dolphin! You saved me!" Timmy said.
The dolphin smiled and said, "No problem, Timmy. I always look out for my friends." From that day on, Timmy and the dolphin played together every time they went to the beach.
