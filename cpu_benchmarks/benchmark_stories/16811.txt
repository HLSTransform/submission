One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mommy. They saw a man with a big mustache. Lily asked, "Mommy, why does that man have a big mustache?" Mommy said, "Some people like to grow big mustaches because it makes them look cool." Lily thought the man's mustache looked delicate.
Then, Lily saw her friend Tommy playing on the monkey bars. She said, "Mommy, I want to play too!" Mommy said, "Let's see if you can fit on the monkey bars." Lily tried to climb up, but she was too small. She said, "I can't fit, mommy." 
Tommy came over and said, "Don't worry, Lily. I'll help you." Tommy lifted Lily up so she could reach the monkey bars. Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you, Tommy! You're my best friend!" They played together all afternoon and Lily forgot all about the man's mustache.
