Tom and Mia were playing with their toys in the living room. Tom had a rare car that his dad gave him for his birthday. It was shiny and fast and had a big sticker on the door. Mia had a doll that could sing and dance and had a pretty dress. They were having fun making noises and stories with their toys.
Suddenly, they heard a loud knock on the door. They ran to see who it was. It was a man with a big bag and a mask. He looked mean and scary. He pushed the door open and ran inside. He was a thief!
"Give me your toys!" he shouted. "They are mine now!"
Tom and Mia were scared and angry. They did not want to give their toys to the thief. They loved their toys. They worked together to stop him.
Tom grabbed his car and threw it at the thief's head. It hit him hard and made him dizzy. Mia took her doll and attached it to the thief's leg. It sang and danced and made him trip. The thief fell to the floor and dropped his bag.
Tom and Mia ran to the bag and saw that it was full of other toys. They were toys that the thief had stolen from other kids. They felt sorry for the other kids.
They heard sirens outside. They looked out the window and saw a police car. The police came in and saw the thief on the floor and the bag of toys. They were happy and proud of Tom and Mia.
"You are very brave and smart," they said. "You stopped the thief and saved the toys. You are heroes!"
Tom and Mia smiled and hugged each other. They were happy and proud too. They gave their toys to the police and asked them to return them to the other kids. They hoped that the other kids would be happy and grateful too. They learned that sharing is better than stealing.
