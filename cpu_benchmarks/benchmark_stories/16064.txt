Sammy was looking for something. He thought, "What could it be?". He looked all around, but he still couldn't find it.
He heard his mommy in the kitchen singing, so he ran inside. She was holding a needle and thread. Sammy asked, "Mommy, are you sewing?".
His mom smiled and said, "Yes! I need to sew your blanket that's getting a bit torn. Do you know what a needle is?".
Sammy nodded, "Yes. It's the thing that looks like an arrow." 
Mommy smiled, "Yes, that's right. You're so smart!" 
Sammy smiled and said, "I'm not lazy like the bear!" 
Mommy hugged Sammy and said, "That's right. We all need to work hard to do what we need to do."
