Once upon a time there was a battery. It was very hungry, but had no one to help it. So it decided to marry the first person it saw.
Along came a 3-year-old and the battery thought he would be perfect to marry. It asked him "Will you marry me?" and the 3-year-old said yes! So they had a nice ceremony and they were married.
After they were married, the battery was no longer hungry! The 3-year-old gave it lots of food and the battery was happy. They lived happily ever after!
