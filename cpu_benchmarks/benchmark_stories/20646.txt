One day, a little girl was feeling sad. Her aunt saw this and wanted to help her. She scooped her up into her arms and gave her a big hug. It felt warm and comforting. 
The aunt said kind words and explained to the little girl that bad things can happen but it's ok to feel sad. But she also said that she was there to help her through it. 
The little girl felt a lot better after that. Her aunt was so caring and understanding. Even though she had been feeling sad, she was now smiling. 
The aunt had been so patient and kind, even though her little niece had been acting rude. She had been acting out and throwing a tantrum, but the aunt had stayed calm and comforted her. 
The little girl was glad that she had someone like her aunt to help her when she was feeling sad. She was very thankful for her loving and kind aunt.
