Once upon a time, there was a kind lady named Mrs. Smith. She lived in a cozy house with her cat, Mittens. One day, Mrs. Smith wanted to display her favorite teapot on the shelf. She looked for a teaspoon to make some tea, but she couldn't find one. Mittens came to help and found the teaspoon under the sofa.
Mrs. Smith was very grateful and thanked Mittens with a humble heart. She made some tea and they both enjoyed it together. Mittens purred happily and Mrs. Smith smiled. From that day on, Mrs. Smith always made sure to display her teapot and keep her teaspoons in a safe place.
