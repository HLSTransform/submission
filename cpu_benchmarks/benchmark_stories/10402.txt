Once upon a time there was a little girl called Daisy and a little boy called Tom. Daisy and Tom went to the park together. As they walked around they saw lots of different animals. Tom was so excited to see all the animals and shouted out with joy. 
Daisy saw a beautiful bird and when she pointed it out to Tom he said, "That's mine!" Daisy was jealous, but kept quiet. Then they saw a group of rabbits. Daisy said, "Let's sort the animals together!" So they worked together and grouped the animals into fours.
Tom said, "I want to keep all the animals, let's take them home!" Daisy said, "But we can't do that. We need to sort them out." 
Tom was sad, but Daisy convinced him to leave the animals in the park. She said, "We can come back and see them soon". Tom agreed and the two ran off to find something else to do.
