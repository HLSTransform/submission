Once there was a little boy who was very excited. He wanted to count something. So he went outside and saw a mosquito. The little boy was so excited he couldn't wait to count the mosquito. He clapped his hands and said, "One!" As he said each number, the mosquito flew away. But the little boy was determined. He said, "Two! Three! Four!" When he got to ten, the mosquito was out of sight. The little boy felt proud of himself for counting all the way up to ten. He smiled and hopped around, excited because he had counted the mosquito.
