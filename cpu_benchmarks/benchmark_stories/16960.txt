Ben and Lily like to play music with their toys. They have a drum, a guitar, a flute and a bell. They take turns to make sounds and guess what toy the other is using.
"Your turn, Lily," Ben says. He picks up a toy and hides it behind his back. He makes a sound with it. Ding ding ding!
Lily listens carefully. She thinks hard. "Is it the bell?" she guesses.
"Yes, you are right!" Ben says. He shows her the bell and gives it to her. "You are good at guessing."
"Thank you, Ben," Lily says. She smiles and picks up another toy. She makes a sound with it. Toot toot toot!
Ben listens carefully. He thinks hard. "Is it the flute?" he guesses.
"No, you are wrong!" Lily says. She shows him the toy. It is a horn. "It is a horn. It makes a loud sound."
"Oh, I see," Ben says. He laughs and takes the horn. "It is a fun toy."
They play some more and make different sounds. They try to guess what toy the other is using. They have fun and laugh a lot.
After a while, they are tired. They put their toys away and sit on the couch. They cuddle with their blankets and pillows.
"Ben, do you like music?" Lily asks.
"Yes, I do," Ben says. "Music is nice. It has rhythm. Rhythm is when sounds go fast or slow, loud or soft."
"I like rhythm too," Lily says. "It makes me happy. It makes me want to dance and sing."
"Me too," Ben says. "Maybe we can make a song together."
"Okay," Lily says. "What should we sing about?"
They think for a moment. Then they start to sing a silly song about their toys and their sounds. They use their voices and their hands to make rhythm. They giggle and have fun. They are happy. They are friends.
