One day, a playful cat named Kitty saw a big leaf on the ground. Kitty wanted to open the leaf and see what was under it. She tried to open the leaf with her paws, but it was too hard.
A small dog named Spot saw Kitty trying to open the leaf. Spot wanted to help, but Kitty did not want help. Kitty and Spot started to fight over the leaf. They both wanted to open it alone.
Then, a big bird named Sky flew down and saw Kitty and Spot fighting. Sky said, "Stop fighting! You can both open the leaf together." Kitty and Spot stopped fighting and worked together to open the leaf. Under the leaf, they found a big, yummy treat. They shared the treat and became friends.
