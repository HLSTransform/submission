Once there was a beautiful blueberry bush. Every day different kinds of animals would come to visit the bush.
One day, a rabbit hopped over to the bush. The rabbit was feeling very thirsty. He spotted a big, juicy blueberry and quickly ate it.
 
Suddenly, the blueberry started to shrink! The rabbit was very confused.
The rabbit hopped over to a nearby fox. "What can you tell me about this blueberry?" the rabbit asked. 
The fox replied, "That blueberry is very different, it shrinks when you eat it!"
