Once upon a time, there was a small bunny named Peter. Peter loved hopping around the garden and exploring. One day, Peter saw a wooden board in the bushes. He got closer to inspect it and noticed it was extra long, shiny and polished. He decided he wanted to hop on it so he hopped on it.
"This board is comfortable," he thought to himself, feeling the wood on his little feet. But then, Peter noticed something. The board was actually quite slippery!
He hopped off and there, Peter could see the board was actually placed over a stream. Peter was scared to hop back on the board, but then he noticed the stream was so sparkly and pretty that he decided to give it a go.
He took one big hop and before he knew it, he was making it across the stream and onto the other side. 
"That wasn't so uncomfortable after all!" he said happily.
Since then, Peter had made it his mission to hop on every shiny board he could find, learning to always be brave and never give up.
