It was a beautiful summer day, and Bob was out in his yard playing. He loved playing in the grass and chasing around the garden gnomes.
Suddenly, Bob heard a strange sound coming from his neighbor's backyard. He ran over to take a look and saw his neighbor Bill cooking on a huge grill. The smell of the grilled food was mouthwatering, and Bob's mouth started to water. 
He asked Bill, "What are you cooking?" but Bill didn't answer him. He looked at Bob with a stern look and said, "Go away!" Bob felt so sad and he started to cry.
Then, Bill softened his face and said, "I'm sorry I was so rude. I'm cooking some hot dogs and hamburgers for a party and I'm worried about spilling the secret ingredient. Can you keep a secret?"
Bob nodded and said, "I promise I won't tell anyone - I'll trust you." Bill thanked Bob and said, "The secret ingredient is a bit of bitter chili sauce. Just a pinch of this sauce can turn burgers into something delicious!" 
Bob grinned and said, "Thanks, Bill. I'll never forget your secret ingredient! I can trust you with this information". 
Bill smiled, proud of having taught Bob a lesson in trust. He handed Bob a hamburger and said, "Here, enjoy this! Remember, friends can always trust each other."
