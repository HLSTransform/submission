Once upon a time, there was a prince who lived in a wide castle. One day, he went to the forest to pick some berries. While he was walking, he saw a rabbit shiver in fear. 
The prince asked the rabbit, "Why are you shivering?" 
The rabbit replied, "I am scared of the big, bad wolf. He is coming to eat me!" 
The prince told the rabbit not to worry and said, "I will protect you from the wolf." 
As they continued to walk, they saw the wolf hiding behind a tree. The prince bravely fought the wolf and saved the rabbit. From that day on, the rabbit and the prince became good friends and the rabbit never had to shiver in fear again.
