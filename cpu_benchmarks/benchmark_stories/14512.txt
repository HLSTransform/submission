Once there was a white rabbit. It was very special because it was deaf. Every morning it would go to the park and look around. It couldn’t hear the birds singing, but it enjoyed watching them fly. 
One day the rabbit saw a tall white bird standing in the grass. The rabbit got closer and realized the bird was deaf too. The bird was looking around and the rabbit hopped over to it. The two animals talked with their eyes and became friends.
The rabbit and the bird spent a lot of time together from then on. They would eat dinner together and take walks around the park. The bird liked to show the rabbit its trick, where it would jump up in the air and flap its wings. The rabbit thought the bird’s tricks were amazing!
The rabbit and the bird were very happy together. Even though neither of them could hear the other, they could still understand each other. The deaf white rabbit and the deaf white bird were the best of friends.
