Sam and Mia liked to play with their toys. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big penguin. The penguin was soft and black and white. It had a red bow on its neck. The penguin could make noises when they pressed its belly.
One day, Sam and Mia were playing with the penguin in the garden. They pretended the penguin was a pirate and they were looking for treasure. They dug a hole and buried the penguin. Then they drew a map and went to find it again.
But when they dug up the penguin, they saw that it was dirty and smelly. The penguin had mud and grass on its fur. It also had a hole in its belly. The penguin did not make noises anymore.
"Oh no, our penguin is broken!" Mia cried.
"Don't cry, Mia. We can fix it," Sam said.
"How?" Mia asked.
Sam thought for a moment. He remembered that his mom had a sewing kit in her room. He also remembered that his dad had a spray bottle in the bathroom. He had an idea.
"Come on, Mia. Let's go to the house. I know what to do," Sam said.
He took Mia's hand and they ran to the house. They sneaked into their mom's room and took the sewing kit. They found a needle and a thread that matched the penguin's fur. They sneaked into the bathroom and took the spray bottle. They filled it with water and soap.
They went back to the garden and put the penguin on a blanket. Sam sewed the hole in the penguin's belly. Mia sprayed the penguin with the water and soap. They rubbed the penguin with a towel until it was clean and dry.
They pressed the penguin's belly and heard a noise. The penguin said, "Quack, quack, I'm a pirate!"
Sam and Mia smiled and hugged the penguin. They had fixed it.
"Thank you, Sam. You are a good brother," Mia said.
"You are welcome, Mia. You are a good sister," Sam said.
They played with the penguin until it was time for dinner. They were happy. The penguin was happy too.
