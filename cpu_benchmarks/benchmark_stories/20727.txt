Once upon a time, there was an elderly gorilla. He liked to take walks and count things. One day, he went for a walk in the jungle and he started to count all the animals he saw. He counted two tigers, three lions and four monkeys.
Suddenly, he heard a sound coming from behind a bush. He stopped counting and went to investigate. When he looked behind the bush, he saw a cute baby gorilla! He was so happy that he started counting the baby gorilla, too.
The elderly gorilla was delighted to have a new friend. He was so happy that he decided to take the baby gorilla home with him. They both went home, and from that day onwards, the elderly gorilla and the baby gorilla were the best of friends. They would always go on walks together and count all the animals they saw.
