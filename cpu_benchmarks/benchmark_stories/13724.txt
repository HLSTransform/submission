Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived on a farm with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily went outside to play and saw some sheep in the field. She counted them one by one, "One sheep, two sheep, three sheep!" 
Lily loved the sheep because they were so fluffy and cute. She wanted to hug them, but her mommy said it wasn't safe. Lily was sad, but she was grateful that she got to see the sheep from far away. 
Later that day, Lily's mommy made her favorite meal for dinner. Lily was so happy and grateful for her mommy's cooking. She ate all of her food and even asked for seconds! After dinner, Lily went to bed and counted sheep in her head until she fell asleep.
