Once upon a time there was a baby bear who was looking for the perfect wood to make a birthday present. He scoured the forest trying to find the right piece.
After a while the little baby bear found three pieces of wood that looked perfect for the present. But he wasn't sure which one to choose.
He heard a voice behind him. It was a wise owl who said, “Baby bear, if you don't know which to choose why don't you wave at each piece of wood and see which one gives you the warmest feeling.”
The baby bear followed the owl's advice and waved his little paw at each piece of wood. One of the pieces made him feel a special warmth and he knew this was the perfect piece for the present.
He carefully picked it up and thanked the owl for his help. Then the bear took the piece of wood home and started to work on the present. All the animals in the forest were excited to receive their birthday surprise!
