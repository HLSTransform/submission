Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and slide and swing. They saw many things in the park: trees, flowers, birds, dogs, and people.
One day, they saw a big green truck in the park. It had a loud horn and a shiny ladder. Lily and Ben ran to the truck. They wanted to see it up close.
"Hello, kids," said a man in a yellow hat. He was sitting in the truck. "Do you like my truck?"
"Yes, we do," said Lily and Ben. "It is very green and big. What do you do with it?"
"I am a firefighter," said the man. "I use my truck to put out fires and help people. Sometimes I have to go very fast and far. Do you know where I go?"
Lily and Ben shook their heads. They did not know.
"I go where the fire is," said the man. "Sometimes it is in the east, sometimes it is in the west, sometimes it is in the north, and sometimes it is in the south. Do you know what these words mean?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They knew. They learned them in school.
"East is where the sun comes up," said Lily.
"West is where the sun goes down," said Ben.
"North is where it is cold," said Lily.
"South is where it is warm," said Ben.
"Very good," said the man. "You are smart kids. Do you want to see the inside of my truck?"
"Yes, please," said Lily and Ben.
The man smiled and opened the door. He let Lily and Ben sit in the truck. They saw many buttons and levers and screens. They felt very happy and excited.
They thanked the man and said goodbye. They ran back to their parents. They told them about the green truck and the firefighter. They said they learned new words and saw new things.
They recognized the truck when they saw it again. They waved to the man and he waved back. They felt proud and brave. They wanted to be firefighters when they grew up.
