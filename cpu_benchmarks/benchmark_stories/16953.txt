Anna and Ben were playing in the basement. They liked to pretend they were explorers in a dark cave. They had a flashlight to see the way.
"Look, Ben, there is a split in the wall!" Anna said. She pointed to a crack that was big enough to crawl through. "Maybe there is a secret tunnel behind it!"
"Let's go and find out!" Ben said. He was not afraid of anything. He followed Anna as she squeezed through the split.
They found themselves in a huge room that was full of old boxes and toys. They shone the flashlight around and saw many things they liked.
"Wow, look at this!" Anna said. She picked up a doll that had long hair and a pretty dress. "She is so beautiful!"
"And look at this!" Ben said. He found a toy car that had wheels and lights. "It can go fast and make noises!"
They played with their new treasures for a long time. They forgot about the time and the basement. They were happy and curious.
But then they heard a loud noise. It was their mom calling them for dinner.
"Anna! Ben! Where are you?" Mom shouted. She sounded worried and angry.
"Oh no, we have to go back!" Anna said. She dropped the doll and grabbed the flashlight. "Come on, Ben, hurry!"
They ran back to the split and crawled through it. They hoped Mom would not find out about their secret room. They did not want to get in trouble.
They reached the basement and saw Mom waiting for them. She looked relieved and stern.
"Where have you been?" Mom asked. "I've been looking for you everywhere!"
"We were just playing, Mom," Anna said. She tried to sound innocent.
"With the flashlight?" Mom asked. She saw the flashlight in Anna's hand. "Did you go somewhere you shouldn't?"
Anna and Ben looked at each other. They did not know what to say. They knew Mom would not like their secret room. They wished they could go back and play some more.
