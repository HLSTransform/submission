Tom and Mia went to the zoo with Mom and Dad. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and giraffes. They liked the animals, but they wanted to see the rhinoceros. The rhinoceros was big and gray, with a horn on its nose.
They walked to the rhinoceros pen, where they saw a sign that said "Do not spray the rhinoceros". Tom and Mia did not know what spray meant. They saw a hose near the fence, and they had an idea. They picked up the hose and turned on the water. They thought it would be fun to spray the rhinoceros.
The rhinoceros did not like the water. It got angry and ran towards the fence. It made a loud noise and shook its horn. Tom and Mia got scared and dropped the hose. The water kept spraying, and it hit the rhinoceros in the face. The rhinoceros sneezed and backed away.
Mom and Dad saw what Tom and Mia did. They were not happy. They ran to the hose and turned off the water. They told Tom and Mia that they were naughty and that they should not spray the rhinoceros. They said that the rhinoceros was weak and sick, and that the water could hurt it. They said that they had to say sorry to the rhinoceros and the zookeeper.
Tom and Mia felt bad. They did not mean to make the rhinoceros angry or sad. They said sorry to the rhinoceros and the zookeeper. The zookeeper was nice and said that it was okay, but that they should be careful and follow the signs. He said that the rhinoceros was getting better, and that he hoped they would come back and see him again. Tom and Mia nodded and smiled. They learned a new word, and they learned to be kind to the animals.
