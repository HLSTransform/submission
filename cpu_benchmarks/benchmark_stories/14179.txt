Once there was an ordinary cricket. He wanted to go on an adventure. He looked around and found a park nearby. He hopped toward the park, and when he arrived, he saw lots of things to explore. He looked around and wanted to play on the swings. So he hopped right up and before long, he was zooming up and down, back and forth. He had lots of fun. After, he wanted to climb the big slide. He slowly started to climb up, and when he reached the top, he slid all the way down. He wanted to do it again and again, over and over. Finally, he was tired, but he had a great time and was ready to go home.
