Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but one day she broke her favorite toy car. She was very sad and didn't know what to do.
Her friend, Max, saw her sad face and asked what happened. Lily told Max about her broken toy car. Max said, "Don't worry, I have a toy car that looks just like yours. I can lend it to you until your toy car is fixed."
Lily was so happy and thanked Max. She played with the toy car Max lent her, but she knew it wasn't hers. She promised to take good care of it and return it to Max when her toy car was fixed.
From that day on, Lily learned that it's okay to ask for help and to lend things to others. She also learned that having a kind spirit like Max's is important. Max's silly jokes and cheerful spirit made her happy, and she realized that being silly and happy is a good way to make others feel better too.
