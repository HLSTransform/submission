Once upon a time, there was a pretty fish named Goldie. Goldie lived in a big blue ocean and loved to swim all day long. One day, Goldie met a crab named Pinchy. Pinchy had big claws and was not very attractive, but Goldie didn't mind. 
"Hello, Goldie! Want to play?" said Pinchy.
"Sure!" said Goldie. "Let's play hide-and-seek."
Pinchy agreed and they started to play. Goldie was very good at hiding, but Pinchy found her every time. They played until the sun went down and the stars came out. 
"I had so much fun with you, Pinchy. You're a great friend," said Goldie.
"You're a great friend too, Goldie. Let's play again tomorrow!" said Pinchy.
Goldie smiled and they swam away, rocking back and forth in the waves. They couldn't wait to play together again.
