Once upon a time, there was a little bird who lived in a tree. The bird was happy and sang songs all day long. One day, a big storm came and the wind blew so hard that it knocked the bird's tree down. The bird was scared and didn't know what to do. 
The bird saw a man walking by and asked for help, but the man just laughed and said he couldn't do anything. The bird felt helpless and didn't know where to go. 
Then, a fox came by and offered to help the bird. The fox said he could order his friends to build a new tree for the bird to live in. The bird was happy and thanked the fox. 
But the fox had other plans. He ordered his friends to build a trap instead of a tree. When the bird went in the trap, the fox ate him for dinner. The end.
