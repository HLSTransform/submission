Once upon a time, there was a big, generous dog named Max. Max had a pretty bow on his neck. He liked to play and share with his friends. One day, Max and his friends wanted to celebrate because it was his birthday.
Max said, "Let's have a party!" His friends were happy and said, "Yes, let's celebrate!" They played games and ate yummy food. Max shared his toys with everyone. They were all having a good time.
But then, Max saw a big cake. He wanted to eat it all by himself. He forgot to share with his friends. Max ate the whole cake very fast. After eating the cake, Max felt sick. His friends were sad because they didn't get any cake. Max learned that it is important to share with friends, even on his birthday.
