Lila and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park. They see a big bell on a tower. The bell is shiny and loud.
"Let's go and poke the bell!" Ben says. He runs to the tower.
"No, Ben, wait!" Lila says. She is modest and shy. She does not want to bother the bell. "Maybe the bell does not like to be poked."
But Ben does not listen. He climbs the tower and reaches the bell. He pokes it with his finger. The bell makes a loud ding!
Lila covers her ears. She is scared. The bell is angry. She hears people shouting.
"Who poked the bell?" a man says. He is the keeper of the bell. He is mad.
Ben sees the man. He is scared too. He tries to hide behind the bell.
"Ben, come down!" Lila says. She wants to help her brother. "Say sorry to the bell and the man."
Ben feels bad. He knows he did wrong. He comes down from the tower. He says sorry to the bell and the man.
The man is still mad, but he sees that Ben is sorry. He is kind. He tells Ben and Lila not to poke the bell again. He says the bell is for special times, not for fun.
Ben and Lila nod. They understand. They thank the man and the bell. They go back to the park. They play with other things. They do not poke the bell anymore. They are good twins.
