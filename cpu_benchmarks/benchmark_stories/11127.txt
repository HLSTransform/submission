Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was a troubled boy. He did not like to play with other kids. He was always sad.
One day, Tom went to the big gate near his house. He sat down and began to weep. He wished he could be happy like the other kids.
A friendly dog came up to Tom. The dog licked Tom's face and wagged its tail. Tom stopped weeping and smiled. The dog and Tom played together all day. From that day on, Tom was not troubled anymore. He had found a friend in the dog, and the two were always happy together.
