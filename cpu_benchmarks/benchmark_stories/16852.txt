Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. One day, she saw a butterfly that was purple. She wanted to catch it, but it flew away. 
Lily then saw her mom cleaning the glass window with a spray bottle. She asked her mom if she could help. Her mom said yes, and gave her a cloth to wipe the glass. Lily sprayed the glass with the spray bottle and wiped it with the cloth. 
After cleaning the glass, Lily went back outside to play. She saw the purple butterfly again and tried to catch it. But it flew away again. Lily was sad, but she remembered how fun it was to help her mom clean the glass.
