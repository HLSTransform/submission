Lily was a chubby girl who liked to eat cake. She always asked her mom to make cake for her. One day, her mom said, "Lily, you need to eat some fruits and vegetables too. Cake is not good for you all the time."
Lily did not like fruits and vegetables. She said, "No, mom, I only want cake. Cake is yummy and sweet. Fruits and vegetables are yucky and bitter."
Her mom said, "Lily, if you don't eat some fruits and vegetables, you will not get any cake today. You have to try new things and be healthy."
Lily was angry and sad. She said, "Fine, mom, I will quit cake. I will never eat cake again. I don't need cake. I don't need you."
She ran to her room and slammed the door. She cried on her bed. She felt hungry and lonely.
She heard a noise from the kitchen. She smelled something delicious. She got up and peeked through the door. She saw her mom taking a big pan out of the oven. It was a chocolate cake with frosting and sprinkles. Her mom smiled and said, "Lily, I made this cake for you. I know you love cake. But I also love you, and I want you to be happy and healthy. So I made this cake with some fruits and vegetables in it. You can't even taste them, but they are good for you. Do you want to try a slice?"
Lily's eyes widened. She felt curious and sorry. She said, "Mom, I'm sorry I was mean to you. I do love you. And I do love cake. Can I have a slice, please?"
Her mom said, "Of course, Lily. Come here and give me a hug. You can have a slice of cake, and some milk, and some more fruits and vegetables later. How does that sound?"
Lily ran to her mom and hugged her. She said, "That sounds great, mom. Thank you for the cake. And thank you for caring about me."
They both smiled and cut a slice of cake. They ate it together and talked. Lily liked the cake. She did not know it had fruits and vegetables in it. She felt happy and full. She did not quit cake. She quit being stubborn.
