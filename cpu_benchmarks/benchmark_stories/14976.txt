Once upon a time, a little rabbit was walking through a forest looking for food. He wanted to find something to eat, but nothing seemed suitable. Then, the rabbit saw a huge black log and wanted to try it.
As the hungry rabbit approached the log, he heard a voice. "Please don't eat me," said the log. The rabbit stopped in his tracks and answered, "I won't, I promise!"
The log explained that it was a witch in disguise. "If you eat me, I will curse you," warned the log. The rabbit shivered and backed away.
The next day, the same rabbit heard a different voice coming from the same black log. This time, it was the voice of a friendly tiger. "Go ahead and eat me," he said.
The rabbit was relieved, but he hesitated before taking a bite. He remembered the witch's warning and paused to think. After considering his options, the rabbit decided he should listen to the kind tiger and enjoy the delicious log.
It turns out, the black log was actually full of honey and the magical tiger had wanted to share it all along. The rabbit was so delighted.
The moral of the story is that it pays to be kind and considerate. If you are generous and open to new possibilities, you never know what rewards may come your way.
