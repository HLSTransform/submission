One day, Mummy decided to go on an adventure with her little 3 year old daughter, Emma. 
They were going to explore the woods and all the creatures that live there. 
Mummy asked Emma if she was ready, but Emma said she was too tired. 
Mummy said, "It's okay, we don't have to go if you're too tired." But Emma wanted to go anyway, so she agreed. 
Mummy allowed Emma to go, but only if she listened carefully to Mummy's instructions. 
Off they went on their adventure. They looked for different creatures, but all Emma could see were trees and bushes. 
But then Emma spotted a rabbit! It hopped away, too fast for Emma to catch it. 
Mummy said, "Okay, now let's go back. We have to go home soon". 
Emma started to get upset, and suddenly she had an idea. 
She said, "I know a way we can catch the rabbit!" 
Mummy replied, "Sure, if you're not too tired, let's give it a try!" 
Together they carefully set up a trail of carrots, leading all the way to their home. 
The next morning they returned to the woods and, sure enough, the rabbit was there munching away on the carrots.
