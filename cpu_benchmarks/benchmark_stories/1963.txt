Once upon a time, there was a girl. She had lots of stuff. Every day she would get new things, and she loved to count them. She counted everyday things like spoons and books, but also strange, special things like feathers from a bird and a shell from the beach.
One day, her mommy decided it was time to go on an adventure. They went deep into the woods. Everywhere they looked, they saw new things. The girl was so excited to count all the new stuff that she found. She found bugs, leaves and twigs...she counted and counted and counted! 
They got deeper and deeper into the woods. The girl was having a great time, so she kept counting until...she reached the deepest part of the woods. There, they discovered something really special - a beautiful lake full of fish. The girl was amazed. She loved counting all the fish swimming around. 
When it was time to go home, the girl said goodbye to the lake with a heavy heart. She knew she'd be back soon. After all, she still had lots of stuff to count!
