Once upon a time, there was a small mouse named Mimi. Mimi lived in a tiny house near a big tree. One day, Mimi found a piece of iron. She did not know what it was, but she thought it was very special.
Mimi had a friend named Tom, who was a cat. Tom was very wise and knew many things. Mimi went to Tom and showed him the iron. "Tom, what is this?" she asked. Tom looked at it and said, "This is iron, Mimi. It is strong and can be used to make many things."
One day, Mimi met a kind mouse named Max. They liked to play and laugh together. Mimi and Max decided they wanted to marry and be together forever. They used the iron to make a beautiful ring for Mimi. When they were married, they promised to always be kind and share with each other.
Mimi and Max lived happily in their tiny house. They always remembered to be kind and share everything they had. And they never forgot the special iron that brought them together.
The moral of the story is to always be kind and share with others, and good things will come to you.
