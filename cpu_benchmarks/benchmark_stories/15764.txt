Once there was a clever monkey called Mandy. She loved to play and explore. One day she came across a red brick and started to chew it. She liked the crunchy sound and the taste. 
Suddenly, a voice called out from behind her. It was a rabbit, hopping around happily. Mandy held up the brick to show the rabbit and said, "What is this?"
 
The rabbit replied, "That's a brick. It's too hard for you to chew. Let me show you something better to chew." The rabbit hopped off and came back with a piece of carrot. The carrot was juicy and sweet - much better than the brick!
Mandy was very pleased with her new snack. She ate the carrot and thanked the rabbit for being so clever. The two friends laughed together and went off to look for new things to do.
