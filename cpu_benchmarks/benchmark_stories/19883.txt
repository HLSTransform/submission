Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play basketball in his backyard. One day, his friend Billy came over to play too. Billy had an adorable puppy with him.
Timmy said, "Wow, your puppy is so cute! Can we play with him too?"
Billy replied, "Sure, but he's not very good at basketball."
Timmy smiled and said, "That's okay, we can teach him!"
So, they all played basketball together and even though the puppy wasn't very good, they had a lot of fun. At the end of the day, Timmy said, "Thanks for bringing your puppy over, Billy. He may not be good at basketball, but he sure is adorable!"
