Once upon a time, there was a stubborn little rabbit who lived close to the shore. The rabbit loved to explore, but his parents were always warning him to be careful. "If you go close to the water, you will get in trouble!” they said.
One beautiful morning, the rabbit was looking at the shore and saw something very exciting - a pile of big rocks! He decided it would be fun to build something with them, so he started gathering rocks and piling them up.
Just then, his parents came running up to him. “What do you think you're doing?” they shouted. "You could get hurt if you play so close to the water!”
The rabbit didn't give in. He was being stubborn and kept on building. Suddenly, the ground beneath him started to shake and he started to fall into the icy water! The rabbit’s parents were very scared and grabbed him before he got hurt.
The moral of the story is to always listen to your parents and be careful when you are playing near the water!
