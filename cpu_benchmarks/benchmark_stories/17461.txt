Ben is a dog. He likes to run and play with his owner, Sam. Sam is a boy. He loves Ben very much. He gives Ben food and water and hugs.
One day, Sam and Ben go to the park. There are many other dogs and people there. Ben sees a big, black dog. He wants to talk to him. He runs to the big, black dog and barks.
"Hello, I am Ben. Do you want to play with me?" Ben asks.
The big, black dog growls. He does not want to talk to Ben. He does not like Ben. He thinks Ben is too small and dirty. He is a mean dog.
"Go away, you dirty little dog. You are not welcome here. This is my park. I am the boss here." The big, black dog says.
Ben is scared. He does not understand why the big, black dog is so angry. He tries to run back to Sam, but the big, black dog is faster. He bites Ben hard on his neck. Ben cries out in pain.
Sam hears Ben's cry. He runs to Ben and tries to help him. He shouts at the big, black dog to leave Ben alone. He is very angry and sad.
"Stop it, you bad dog. Let go of Ben. He is my friend. You are hurting him." Sam says.
But the big, black dog does not listen. He shakes Ben like a toy. He does not care about Sam or Ben. He is a cruel dog.
Ben is hurt. He is bleeding. He is dying. He looks at Sam with his sad eyes. He wants to say goodbye. He loves Sam very much. He is a good dog.
But he cannot talk. He cannot move. He cannot breathe. He closes his eyes. He is gone.
Sam is heartbroken. He cries and cries. He holds Ben in his arms. He does not want to let go. He loves Ben very much. He is a good boy.
But he cannot bring Ben back. He cannot save him. He cannot talk to him. He is alone.
The end.
