Once there was a girl called Lisa. She was 3 years old and liked to play. Today, Lisa's mum said, "Let's go to the park."
Lisa said, "Yay!" She was so excited. They got to the park and saw a big, red grill.
Lisa said, "What's that?" Her mum said, "That's a grill. It's used to cook food."
Lisa said, "Can we eat here?" Her mum said, "No, this is too boring. Let's go play on the swings!" 
So that's what they did. They played for a long time and had lots of fun!
