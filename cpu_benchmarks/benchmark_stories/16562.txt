Lily and Max are best friends. They like to play in the park every day. They have a lot of fun on the swings, the slide and the seesaw. But their favorite thing is the big rock.
The big rock is incredible. It is very big and very smooth. It has many colors and shapes on it. Lily and Max like to climb on it, sit on it and pretend it is a spaceship, a castle or a dragon.
One day, they find a new game. They sit on the rock and hold hands. Then they lean back and forth, making the rock move a little. They giggle and shout, "We are rocking the rock! We are rocking the rock!"
They rock the rock faster and faster, feeling the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They are very happy and their smiles are very big.
"Look at us!" Lily says. "We are the best rockers in the park!"
"Yes, we are!" Max says. "We are the best friends in the world!"
They rock the rock until they are tired. Then they hug each other and say, "Thank you for rocking with me. You are incredible!"
They get off the rock and run to their moms, who are waiting for them with juice and cookies. They tell them about their game and how much fun they had. Their moms smile and say, "We are glad you had a good time. You are incredible, too!"
