Once upon a time, there was a family who lived in a fancy house. They had a big kitchen that was full of sweet treats.
One day, the family had a visitor come over to their house. When the visitor arrived, they all went to the kitchen to examine all of the different goodies.
The little girl in the family asked, "What can I have?" 
The visitor said, "Let's look and find something yummy." Everyone in the family went around the kitchen and examined all of the fun treats. 
After a few minutes, the little girl decided on a yummy cookie. Everyone was happy and chatted until it was time for the visitor to go home. 
The little girl hugged the visitor and said, "Come back soon!" 
The visitor said, "I will be sure to come back and examine all of the tasty treats in your fancy kitchen again. Bye-bye now!" 
So the family said goodbye and the visitor went home. The little girl was so excited to have a guest in the house, and they all had fun examining all the sweet treats in the kitchen.
