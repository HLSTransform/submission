Once upon a time, there was a kind and generous girl named Lily. She loved to sing and make others happy. One day, she went to the store with her mom and saw a long line of people waiting to buy food. 
Lily noticed that some people looked sad and hungry. She decided to sing a song to make them feel better. As she sang, the line started to move faster and people began to smile. 
When it was finally her turn to buy food, the store owner was so grateful for her kindness that he gave her extra food for free. Lily learned that being generous and kind can make a big difference in someone's day.
