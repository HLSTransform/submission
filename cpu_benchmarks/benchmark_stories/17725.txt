Once there was a curious frog called Fred. He wanted to go out and explore the world. He hopped around looking for a place to go. He soon came to a busy street full of traffic. Everywhere he looked he saw colorful cars and buses. They were zooming and zipping by. Fred hopped a bit faster to keep up. He hopped right across the street. It was an exciting adventure! He hopped back and forth again and again. He had so much fun in the traffic it made him very happy.
