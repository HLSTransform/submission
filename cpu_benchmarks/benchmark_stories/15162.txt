Bertie and Ellie were best friends. They lived next door to each other and were the same age of three. Every day they would talk and play together. Bertie loved to race around the garden. He often told Ellie about how fast he could run.
One day, when Bertie and Ellie were outside playing with each other, a huge truck drove by. The truck was going so fast it sounded like a roar!
"Oh wow," Bertie said. "That truck was going so fast!"
"That was so cool!" Ellie said. "It was really huge!"
Bertie and Ellie laughed and kept talking about the truck for the rest of the day. They thought it was so amazing and so fun to see. Their friendship was so strong, they could talk about anything together!
