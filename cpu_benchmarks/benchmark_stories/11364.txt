Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Molly. Everyone loved Molly, because she was very kind.
One day, Molly went to an office. It was a very unusual place, with lots of big people. Molly was nervous, but her mother encouraged her to go inside.
Molly and her mother met with a nice lady. She asked Molly some questions, and Molly tried hard to answer them. After the questions, the lady smiled and said she was very proud of Molly. She encouraged Molly to keep doing her best.
Before they left, the lady gave Molly a special present. Molly was so excited, and she thanked the lady for being so kind. Molly went home with a smile on her face, thinking about the unusual office visit.
