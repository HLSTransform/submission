Anna loved to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Lily. Lily had long hair, a pink dress, and a beautiful smile. Anna took Lily everywhere she went. She liked to brush her hair, dress her up, and talk to her.
One day, Anna and Lily went to the park with Mommy. They saw a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. Anna wanted to try them all. She put Lily on a bench and told her to wait. She said, "I will be back soon, Lily. Don't go anywhere. I love you." She gave Lily a hug and a kiss, and ran to the slide.
Anna had fun on the slide, but she wanted to try the swing next. She looked at the bench, but she did not see Lily. She felt scared. She ran to the bench and looked around. She saw a boy holding Lily. He was pulling her hair and making her dirty. He said, "This is my doll now. She is ugly and old. I will throw her away."
Anna felt angry. She shouted, "No! That is my Lily! Give her back to me! She is not ugly and old. She is beautiful and new. She is my best friend." She ran to the boy and tried to grab Lily. The boy pushed her away and ran to the sandbox. He said, "You can't have her. She is mine. I will lock her in the sand and bury her."
Anna felt sad. She cried and followed the boy. She saw him dig a hole in the sand and put Lily inside. He covered her with sand and patted it down. He said, "There. Now she is gone. You can't find her. You can't have her." He laughed and ran away.
Anna felt hopeless. She knelt down and dug in the sand. She searched and searched, but she could not find Lily. She sobbed and called her name. She said, "Lily, where are you? Please come back to me. I miss you. I need you." She felt a hand on her shoulder. She looked up and saw Mommy. Mommy said, "What's wrong, Anna? Why are you crying?"
Anna told Mommy what happened. She said, "A bad boy took Lily and locked her in the sand. He said she is ugly and old. He said I can't have her. He said she is gone. I can't find her, Mommy. I can't find her." Mommy hugged Anna and said, "Don't worry, Anna. We will find Lily. She is not ugly and old. She is beautiful and new. She is your best friend. She is not gone. She is here." Mommy reached into her pocket and pulled out Lily. She said, "Look, Anna. I saw the bad boy take Lily and I followed him. I saw him lock her in the sand and I waited for him to leave. Then I dug her out and put her in my pocket. I wanted to surprise you. Here she is, Anna. Here is your Lily."
Anna felt happy. She took Lily and hugged her. She said, "Lily, you are here. You are not gone. You are beautiful and new. You are my best friend. I love you." She kissed Lily and brushed her hair. She said, "Thank you, Mommy. Thank you for finding Lily. Thank you for saving her. You are the best Mommy ever." Mommy smiled and said, "You're welcome, Anna. I love you and Lily. You are my beautiful girls. Come on, let's go home and clean Lily up. She needs a bath and a new dress. And maybe a lock for her hair, so no one can pull it again." Anna nodded and said, "Yes, Mommy. Let's go home. Let's go home with Lily." They held hands and walked to the car. Anna held Lily in her palm and felt her beautiful smile. She felt happy and safe. She knew that Mommy and Lily would always be with her. She knew that they would always love her.
