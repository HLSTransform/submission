Tommy was an enthusiastic little boy and always loved to play outside. One day he saw a big pipe in the garden rolling around. He thought it looked fun and wanted to play with it.
He talked to his mom and she said he could roll the pipe around the garden if he was careful. So Tommy excitedly grabbed the pipe and started pushing it around. He rolled it over the grass and through the flowers.
He kept rolling the pipe all around the garden until he got tired. So he took the pipe back to where he found it and said goodbye. 
Tommy had such a great time playing with the pipe and he was already looking forward to the next time he could roll it around the garden.
