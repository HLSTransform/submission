Bella was a dog who loved to chew. She chewed on bones, toys, shoes, and sometimes things she should not chew. One day, when her family was out, she saw a big, soft armchair in the living room. She thought it looked like a good thing to chew. She jumped on the armchair and started to bite and tear the fabric. She made a big hole and pulled out the stuffing. She felt happy and proud of her work.
But when her family came back, they were not happy. They saw the mess and the ruined armchair. They knew it was Bella who did it. They scolded her and said, "Bad dog! You should not chew on the armchair! That was very naughty and expensive! Now we have to buy a new one!" They pointed at the hole and the stuffing. Bella felt ashamed and guilty. She lowered her head and tucked her tail. She knew she had done something wrong.
She wanted to say sorry, but she could not speak. She only whimpered and licked her family's hands. They saw that she was sorry and forgave her. They hugged her and said, "We love you, Bella, but you have to learn to chew on the right things. Here, have this chew toy. It is yours and you can chew on it as much as you want. But please, leave the armchair alone." They gave her a chew toy and a treat. Bella was happy and grateful. She learned her lesson and never chewed on the armchair again.
The moral of the story is: Do not chew on things that are not yours or that can be damaged. Chew on things that are meant for chewing. Say sorry when you make a mistake and try to do better.
