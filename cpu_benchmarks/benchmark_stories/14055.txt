Once upon a time, there was a restless little bird living in his birdcage. All he did was complain, complain, complain at all hours of the day. He was very unhappy because he was so cooped up in the cage and couldn't fly around like his friends.
One day, a kind old man heard the little bird's complaining. He felt so sorry for the little bird, so he decided to help him find some freedom.
The old man opened the birdcage and carefully lifted the bird out. He said, "There you go, little one - now you are free!" The little bird fluttered his wings and soared through the sky towards a large tree in the distance.
The little bird was so excited to be free, he chirped with joy! He thanked the kind old man before finding a nice spot to rest in the tree. From then on, the bird never had to complain ever again!
