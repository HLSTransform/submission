Once there was an adorable girl named Daisy. Daisy liked to count numbers and play with them. 
One day, Daisy was playing with her numbers on the floor when her little brother, John, came over. He wanted to play with her things, but Daisy said no. 
John said, "I just want to touch the numbers!" 
But Daisy said, "No John, they're mine. You can't touch them!" 
John looked very sad, so Daisy felt sorry and said, "Okay, you can touch one number. But that's it!" 
John smiled and carefully touched one number. He was so happy and thanked Daisy for sharing her toys. 
Daisy smiled and hugged John. She was glad that she let her brother touch her numbers. 
The end.
