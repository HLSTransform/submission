Once there was a monster. It stomped around the forest, hungry and roaring. The animals were afraid and stayed away. One night, a foolish little bird thought it could make an escape. It flapped its wings and flew as fast as it could away from the monster. But the monster was too quick. With one giant strike it knocked the bird out of the sky! The bird fell to the ground, no longer foolish, and was never seen again. The monster roared a final time and the animals of the forest were safe once again.
