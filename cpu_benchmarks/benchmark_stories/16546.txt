Lila and Ben were playing in the yard. They saw a big pile of coal near the fence. They wanted to touch it and see what it was.
"Let's go and see the coal," Lila said. "Maybe we can make something with it."
"OK," Ben said. "But be careful. It is dirty and hard."
They ran to the pile of coal and picked up some pieces. They tried to break them and shape them, but they could not. They were too hard and sharp.
"Look, I found a knife," Ben said. He saw a shiny metal thing on the ground. He picked it up and waved it in the air.
"Ben, no!" Lila said. "That is not a toy. That is a cut thing. It can hurt you and me. Put it down."
But Ben did not listen. He wanted to cut the coal and make it smaller. He tried to cut a big piece of coal, but he slipped and cut his finger. He cried out loud.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Ben said. "It hurts, it hurts!"
Lila ran to him and saw the blood on his finger. She was scared and sorry. She hugged him and said, "I'm sorry, Ben. I'm sorry. Let me help you."
She took him to the house and called their mom. Their mom came and saw what happened. She was angry and worried. She took the knife and the coal and threw them away. She cleaned and bandaged Ben's finger. She gave him a hug and a kiss.
"Ben, you were very naughty," she said. "You should not play with cut things. They are dangerous. You could have hurt yourself or Lila. You are lucky it is not worse. Do you understand?"
"Yes, mom," Ben said. "I'm sorry, mom. I won't do it again."
"Good," she said. "Now, go and play with something else. Something safe and fun. And stay away from the coal. It is not for playing. It is for making fire when it is cold."
"OK, mom," Ben said. He looked at Lila and said, "I'm sorry, Lila. I'm sorry I scared you. Do you want to play with me?"
"Yes, Ben," Lila said. "I'm sorry, too. I'm glad you are OK. Let's play with something else. Something soft and nice. Like our teddy bears."
They smiled and hugged. They took their teddy bears and went to their room. They played and laughed. They forgot about the coal and the knife. They were happy.
