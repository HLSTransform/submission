Once upon a time, there was a little girl that lived in a small house. Every day she would help her mommy feed the animals. She especially liked feeding the chickens because they followed her around the yard and ate from her hand. 
One day, the girl saw something weird. She saw an ashtray sitting in the grass. She had never seen an ashtray before, and she was very curious. She walked over to it, and her mommy told her it was not a toy and she should not touch it. 
The girl asked her mommy what it was, and her mommy said it was something very grown-ups use for special purposes. The little girl thought the ashtray was very weird, but she didn't really understand what it was for. 
But one thing she did understand was that it was important not to feed the ashtray. Even if it looked kind of weird and special, it wasn't something that wanted to be fed like the chickens did.
