Once upon a time, there was a girl named Katrina. She loved fashion and always wore clothes with lots of color. She wanted to look like all the other kids, but her clothes were too expensive.
One day, Katrina was playing outside and saw a strange man. He had a big box and he said he could help her with her fashion problem. Katrina opened the box, and inside she found lots of colorful things.
The man told Katrina that he could twist the colorful things together and make beautiful fashion. She was very excited and they twisted the pieces together with some pretty ribbons to make some amazing clothes.
Katrina looked amazing with her new twisty clothes on. From then on, she would wear her twisty fashion whenever she went. Katrina was very happy, and everyone said she was the most fashionable girl ever!
