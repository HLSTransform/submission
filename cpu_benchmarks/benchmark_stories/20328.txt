Anna liked to number her toes. She would sit on the floor and point to each toe and say its number. One, two, three, four, five. She did the same with her other foot. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. She was very proud of knowing her numbers.
One day, she saw a big cake on the table. It looked delicious. It had pink frosting and sprinkles and candles. Anna wanted to taste the cake. She climbed on a chair and reached for the cake. But she was too small. She could not reach the cake.
She had an idea. She took off her shoes and socks. She used her toes to grab the cake. She pulled the cake closer to her. She smiled. She had the cake. She took a big bite with her mouth. It was delicious. She liked the cake.
But then she heard a loud noise. It was her mom. She was angry. She saw Anna with the cake. She saw the mess on the table and the floor. She saw Anna's toes covered in frosting and sprinkles. She said, "Anna, what did you do? You ruined the cake! That was for your brother's birthday!"
Anna felt bad. She did not know it was for her brother. She liked her brother. She wanted to make him happy. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I was hungry. I used my toes to get the cake. It was delicious. Can I share it with my brother?"
Mom sighed. She was not happy. But she loved Anna. She said, "You should not use your toes to get cake. That is not nice. That is not clean. You should ask me first. But I forgive you. You can share the cake with your brother. But first, you have to wash your toes. And say sorry to your brother. And help me clean the mess."
Anna nodded. She said, "OK, mom. I'm sorry. I love you. I love my brother. I love cake. And I love my toes. They are very smart. They can number and grab cake. But I will not use them for cake again. I promise."
