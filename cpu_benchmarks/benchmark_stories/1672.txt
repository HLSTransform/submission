Once upon a time, there was a clever bunny named Benny. Benny loved to peek out of his hole to see what was happening outside. One day, he saw a beautiful rose growing in the garden. Benny wanted to pick the rose, but he knew he couldn't reach it. 
So, Benny had an idea. He asked his friend, a bird, to help him. The bird flew down and picked the rose for Benny. Benny was so happy and he thanked his friend for being so helpful. From then on, Benny would peek out of his hole every day to see the beautiful rose that his friend had picked for him.
