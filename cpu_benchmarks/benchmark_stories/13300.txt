Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Tim. Tim liked to play and move all day. One day, while playing in his room, he saw a switch on the wall. He had never seen this switch before. Tim was curious.
Tim asked his mom, "What does this switch do?" His mom said, "It makes the room bright when it is dark. You can try it when the sun goes down."
That night, when the sun went down, Tim went to his room. He remembered the switch on the wall. He moved his hand up and touched the switch. The room became bright! Tim was happy and showed his mom. They both smiled and played in the bright room.
