One day, a little boy named Tim went outside to play. He wanted to get his ball from the tree. It was cold outside, but Tim did not care. He was too excited to play.
Tim tried to reach the ball, but he was too small. He felt impatient. He called his friend, Sam. "Sam, can you help me get my ball?" Tim asked. Sam came running over to help.
Sam was taller than Tim, so he could reach the ball. He got the ball for Tim, and they both played together. They laughed and had fun, even though it was cold. Soon, they went inside to warm up and have some hot cocoa.
