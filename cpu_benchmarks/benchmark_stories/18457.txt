Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mom gave her a tray of cookies. The cookies were so yummy, but Lily accidentally spilled her juice on the tray. The tray became wet and the cookies got soggy.
Lily's mom said, "Oh no, the cookies are wet now. Let's try to dry them off." So, Lily and her mom took the cookies off the tray and put them on a paper towel to dry. They waited and waited, but the cookies were still wet.
Lily said, "Mommy, I'm sorry I made the cookies wet. Can we try to make new ones?" Her mom smiled and said, "Of course, let's make new cookies together." And so, they made a new batch of cookies that were even better than the first. The end.
