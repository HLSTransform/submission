Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to explore and go on adventures. One day, he went on a hike with his mom and dad. They came across a big cave. Timmy was so excited to discover what was inside. 
As they walked through the cave, they heard a loud growling noise. Timmy's heart started to beat really fast. They soon discovered that there was a big, tough bear inside the cave! Timmy's mom and dad knew they had to keep him safe, so they quickly turned around and left the cave. 
Timmy was disappointed that they couldn't explore the whole cave, but he was happy that they were all safe. He knew that there would be more adventures to discover in the future.
