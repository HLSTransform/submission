Once upon a time, there was a little flower. The flower was very small and it was sad because it wanted to grow fast like its friends. One day, the sun shone very bright and the flower felt warm. It drank some water and then it started to bloom! The flower was so happy and it looked very pretty.
The flower wanted to learn more about itself, so it asked its friend, the bee, if it had a dictionary. The bee said yes and brought the flower a small book. The flower looked at the pictures and learned that it was a daisy. The daisy was very proud of itself and it continued to bloom every day, even faster than before!
