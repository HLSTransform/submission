Tim and Kim were twins who liked to play with kites. They had many kites of different colors and shapes. One day, they saw a fancy kite in the store. It was big and shiny and had a long tail. They wanted to buy it, but it was too expensive.
They asked their mom and dad to buy them the fancy kite, but they said no. They said they already had enough kites and they should be happy with what they had. Tim and Kim were sad and angry. They thought their mom and dad were mean and unfair.
The next day, they decided to sneak out of their room and go to the store. They took some money from their piggy bank and ran to the store. They bought the fancy kite and hid it in their backpack. They were very happy and excited. They wanted to fly the fancy kite in the park.
But when they got to the park, they saw a big problem. The wind was too strong and the fancy kite was too heavy. They tried to fly the fancy kite, but it kept falling and crashing. They tried to fix it, but it was too hard. They started to cry and regret.
Then they saw their mom and dad coming. They had followed them to the park. They were very worried and angry. They scolded Tim and Kim for being dishonest and disobedient. They took the fancy kite and the money and said they would return them to the store. They said they were very disappointed and sad.
Tim and Kim felt very sorry and ashamed. They realized they had made a big mistake. They hugged their mom and dad and said they were sorry. They said they learned their lesson. They said they didn't need the fancy kite. They said they loved their mom and dad and their other kites.
Their mom and dad forgave them and hugged them back. They said they loved them too and they were proud of them for being sorry. They said they could still play with their other kites, but they had to be careful and respectful. They said they hoped they would be more grateful and happy with what they had.
The moral of the story is: Be honest and obedient, and be happy with what you have.
