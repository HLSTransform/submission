Mom was making something delicious in the kitchen. She was wrapping an object with paper.
"What are you making, Mom?" said Tom, who was three years old.
"I'm making a surprise, Tom," Mom said. "It's going to be delicious."
Tom was excited. He wanted to know what the surprise was. He watched as Mom finished wrapping the object. 
When she was done, she put the package on a shelf.
"Can I have it now?" asked Tom.
"Not yet," Mom said with a smile. "You can have it when the surprise is ready."
Tom was confused, but he trusted Mom. He knew the surprise would be something delicious.
