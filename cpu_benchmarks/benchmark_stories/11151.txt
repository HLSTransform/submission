Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a swing in her backyard that she loved to play on every day. One day, Lily's friend Sally came over to play. 
"Hi Lily, can we swing together?" Sally asked cheerfully. 
"Of course!" replied Lily with a big smile. "I promise we'll have fun!" 
The two girls took turns swinging back and forth, laughing and giggling. After a while, Sally said, "Lily, I have to go home now. Can we swing again tomorrow?" 
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, let's swing together again tomorrow! I promise it will be just as fun!" 
Sally waved goodbye and ran home, already looking forward to swinging with Lily again the next day.
