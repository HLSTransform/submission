Paul was an adventurous three year old. He loved to explore new places and try new things. One day he decided he wanted to visit the library. He wanted to see all the fancy books on the shelves. 
When they arrived at the library, Paul was so excited that he ran through the library. He was so eager to look at all the books that he wasn't careful. He ended up knocking over some of the shelves of books and making a big mess.
The librarian came and scolded Paul. She told him that he doesn't have enough respect for books and needs to be careful. Paul felt so bad about what he had done that he started to cry. 
The librarian was very kind and hugged Paul. She told him that it was ok and gently showed him how to handle books with care.
Paul was so sorry for making such a mess. He promised himself he would never do it again and he would listen to the librarian from then on. He regretted not being more careful and knew he should always show respect to the books.
