Bob and Sue were together on an adventure. They were on a journey to discover something new and exciting. Sue was so excited to explore and find out what was around the corner.
Bob was the leader of the journey and he tried his best to stay organized. He made sure that all the items they needed were packed and ready. 
However, just as they were about to get started, Bob suddenly began to feel overwhelmed by the task in front of him. He started to feel very nervous and unsure.
Sue noticed this and try to encourage him. She said, “It’s okay Bob! We can do this! Let’s just stay organized and have fun!”
Bob smiled and nodded. He took a deep breath and yelled “Let’s go!”
The two friends smiled and began their journey. They had a wonderful time discovering new things and learning about the world around them.
