One day, there was a girl who wanted to pour something onto her garden. She grabbed a bucket and filled it with water. She was a bit nervous because she had never done this before.
She asked her mom for help. Her mom said, "Let's do it together!"
The girl and her mom walked to the garden. They slowly poured the water, making sure it covered all of the plants. When they were finished, the girl was relieved. She said, "I was so nervous!"
Her mom smiled and said, "You did a great job. Now, let's go inside and have a snack."
They went back to the house and ate a yummy snack. The girl was happy that she was brave enough to do something new. She was proud of her garden, and knew it would stay nice and healthy.
