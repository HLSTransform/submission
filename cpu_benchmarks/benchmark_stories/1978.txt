The little girl was so excited! She had been waiting all day. It was finally time to go outside and see the moon. She put on her pink dress and quickly ran outside. The moon was so big and so bright! It shone pink in the sky and the little girl was amazed. She stared at it for a long time and felt so happy and excited. Then she ran back inside, full of excitement and joy.
