Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a new pair of sparkly shoes that she loved to wear every day. One morning, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to go to the park. Lily was so excited and said "Yes, please!"
But when she looked down at her shoes, she noticed that one of them was untied. "Mommy, my shoe is untied," Lily said. Her mom replied, "Don't worry, I'll tie it for you." 
After her mom tied her shoe, Lily was ready to go. When they got to the park, Lily saw a big slide and ran towards it. But when she got there, she saw that there were already a lot of kids playing on it. "Mommy, is the slide available?" Lily asked. "No, sweetie, it's too crowded right now. But we can find something else to play on," her mom said. 
Lily and her mom found a swing that was available and they had so much fun swinging together. When it was time to go home, Lily's mom helped her take off her sparkly shoes and put them away until they could wear them again.
