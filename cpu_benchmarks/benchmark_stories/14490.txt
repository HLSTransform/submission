One day, Mommy and Daddy took Susie on a safari. Susie was so excited! They showed her lots of animals that lived in the wild. Mommy and Daddy pointed to a beautiful elephant. Susie saw its long trunk and why it was so tall. 
Then they showed Susie a giraffe. Its legs were long and its neck even longer! She couldn't believe it. They watched it calmly eating leaves in the tree.
The safari was full of other animals. They saw lions, tigers, and rhinos too. Susie was amazed by all the animals. It was one of the best days of her life!
