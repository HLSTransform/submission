One day, Jake and his mom went to the movies. Jake was excited because he loves popcorn! As they entered the theater, Jake saw a popcorn machine. He decided he wanted some. His mom agreed that it would be a good idea and they bought a big bag of popcorn.
Once they found their seats, Jake started eating the popcorn. It was so crunchy and delicious. As he ate, he noticed that some of the kernels had fallen on the floor. He decided to pick them up and put them back in the bag. His mom thought that was very useful!
Jake ate all of the popcorn. He had so much fun eating it, he decided to get more. He asked his mom and she said yes. With a big smile, Jake ran to get more popcorn. He was so excited! He couldn't wait to eat it!
