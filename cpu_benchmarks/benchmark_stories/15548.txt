Lila and Ben were playing with marbles in the garden. They had many marbles of different colors and sizes. They liked to roll them on the grass and see how far they could go. Sometimes they made patterns with them or tried to hit each other's marbles.
One day, they found a spray bottle near the hose. It was full of water. They wondered what it was for. They decided to try it out. They took turns to spray the water on the marbles and watch them shine in the sun. They laughed when the water made the marbles slippery and hard to catch.
"Look, Lila, I can make a rainbow with the spray!" Ben said. He held the bottle up to the light and sprayed a fine mist in the air. Lila saw the colors and clapped her hands.
"That's so pretty, Ben! Can I try?" she asked.
"Sure, here you go!" Ben said. He gave her the bottle and watched her spray the water.
They had so much fun with the spray and the marbles that they forgot about the time. They did not hear their mom calling them for lunch. They only stopped when they heard a loud noise.
"What's that?" Lila asked.
"It's the dog!" Ben said. He looked and saw their big, jolly dog running towards them. He had seen the water and wanted to join the game. He barked and wagged his tail.
"Uh-oh, he's going to get us wet!" Lila said.
They grabbed their marbles and ran to the porch. The dog followed them and tried to lick their faces. They giggled and hugged him.
"Sorry, mom, we were playing with the spray and the marbles!" they said.
"That's okay, my loves, but it's time for lunch now. Come on, let's go inside and dry off. You can play with the spray and the marbles later." Mom said.
She smiled and took them by the hand. They left the spray bottle on the grass. They hoped the dog would not find it and make a mess. They were hungry and happy. They had a jolly day.
