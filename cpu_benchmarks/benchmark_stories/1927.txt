Once upon a time there was an old, fancy house. It was very true and strong. Everyone who saw it was amazed.
One day a little mouse wanted to repair the house. He worked hard, but the house was too old to repair. He kept trying but it didn't work. The mouse was very sad.
The mouse told True, who owned the house, his bad news. True was so sad that the house couldn't be repaired. For the rest of his days, True never had a fancy house.
