Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a gray cat named Mittens. One day, Lily and Mittens went to a party. It was a contest to see who could decorate the best cake.
Lily said to Mittens, "I hope we win the contest. I want to decorate a cake with lots of frosting and sprinkles." Mittens meowed in agreement.
Lily and Mittens worked hard to decorate their cake. They put frosting all over it and sprinkled it with colorful candy. When the judges tasted their cake, they said, "You win the contest! Your cake is the best!"
Lily and Mittens were so happy that they won. They celebrated by eating lots of cake and sharing it with their friends. From that day on, Lily and Mittens always loved to decorate cakes together.
