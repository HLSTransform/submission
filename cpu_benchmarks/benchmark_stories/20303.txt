Sam loves baseball. He likes to watch it on TV and play with his dad. He has a baseball bat, a glove and a ball. He also has a camera. He likes to record himself hitting the ball.
One day, Sam and his dad go to the park. They find a big field with a fence. Sam says, "Dad, can we play baseball here?" Dad says, "Sure, son. Let me set up the camera. You can record your swings."
Dad puts the camera on a tripod. He turns it on and points it at Sam. He says, "Are you ready, Sam?" Sam says, "Yes, Dad. I'm ready." He holds his bat and stands near the fence.
Dad throws the ball to Sam. Sam swings his bat hard. He hits the ball. The ball flies over the fence. Sam says, "Wow! I hit a home run!" Dad says, "That was amazing, Sam. You are very lucky. You recorded your first home run."
Sam runs to the fence. He looks for the ball. He sees it on the other side. He says, "Dad, can I get the ball?" Dad says, "Of course, son. Let me help you." They climb over the fence and get the ball.
Sam is very happy. He hugs his dad and his ball. He says, "Thank you, Dad. This is the best day ever. I love baseball." Dad says, "I love you, Sam. You are my lucky star." They smile and go back to the camera. They watch the video of Sam's home run. They are very proud.
