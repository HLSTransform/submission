Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his toys in the sand at the beach. One day, Timmy's mom took him on a boat ride to an island. The island was very big and had lots of trees and sand.
As they explored the island, Timmy saw an old and broken boat. "Mommy, can we make that boat work again?" Timmy asked. "I don't know Timmy, it looks very ancient," replied his mom.
But Timmy was determined to fix the boat. He searched the island for tools and materials. After a lot of hard work, he fixed the boat and they sailed back home. Timmy was very proud of himself and his mom was proud of him too. From that day on, Timmy knew that he could make anything happen if he tried hard enough.
