One day, there was a little girl that named Mary. Mary had a dream to explore in an island. She was so excited about her dream that she could not sleep but stayed awake. 
One day, Mary had a chance to visit the island. She was so happy. She put on her nice dress and ran to island. 
She met a lot of interesting animals in the island. She wanted to hug them and touch their fur. But the animals said no and ran away. 
Mary was so sad. She wanted to explore on the island but she couldn't. Suddenly, the sky started to get dark. Rain started to fall and thunder sound filled the air. Mary got scared and wanted to go back home. 
When Mary was walking back home,she suddenly heard a voice. It said,"you should stay with us in the island". Mary was so scared and ran away. Finally she reached home safely but she felt so unhappy.
