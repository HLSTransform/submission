Suddenly, he came across a large chair. But it was empty. Then, he heard a voice behind him. It was a giant! The giant said, "Do you want to explore my jungle?" Bob nodded with excitement.
The giant laughed and said, "If you want, I can give you an elephant ride!" Bob's eyes widened with joy. He said, "Yes please! That would be awesome!"
The giant bent down and scooped Bob onto the elephant. Bob and the elephant rode through the jungle. Bob was excited to explore further. The giant gave him a magical map to guide his journey.
