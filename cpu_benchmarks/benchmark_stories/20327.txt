Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play with their toy guns. They pretended to be soldiers and shoot at each other in the forest behind their house. They made loud noises and ran around the trees.
One day, they saw a big deer in the forest. It had brown fur and long horns. Tim and Sam wanted to shoot it with their toy guns. They thought it would be fun. They ran after the deer and pointed their guns at it.
But the deer was not a toy. It was a real animal. It was scared and angry. It did not like the boys who chased it and made noises. It turned around and ran towards them. It used its horns to hit them. It hurt them very much.
Tim and Sam cried and screamed. They dropped their toy guns and tried to run away. But the deer was faster and stronger. It hit them again and again. It made them bleed and fall down.
The boys' mom heard their cries. She ran to the forest to help them. But it was too late. She saw the deer and the boys. The boys were not moving. They were dead. The mom was very sad and angry. She wished the boys had never played with their toy guns. She wished they had never seen the deer. She wished they had stayed at home. It was a terrible day.
