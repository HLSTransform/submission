Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the park. She saw a big dog and stared at it. The dog was very fast and ran around the park. Lily's mom gave her a file to play with in the sand. Lily made a sandcastle and put the file on top of it. Suddenly, the wind blew and the file fell off the castle. Lily picked it up and stared at it. She wondered what she could do with it now.
