Little Daisy and her dad were walking through the woods one day. They were looking for pine cones to take home. Daisy was looking around and pointing at the different trees, pointing out all the different shapes. Suddenly, she spotted a pine. It was very tall and bright green.
"Dad! Look, a pine!" Daisy said. 
"That's great Daisy," Dad said. "But we should be careful, some pines can be dangerous."
Little Daisy was so excited that she wanted to touch the pine. She could see the big needles and its big trunk. But Dad warned her not to. He said that the needles might be sharp. 
But Daisy kept complaining, asking if she could just touch it. Dad tried to explain to her that it was too dangerous. But Daisy was determined, so Dad finally let her go up to the pine and touched it. Daisy was so happy that she hugged it. 
Just then, Dad warned her not to touch it again. "Wait until I take a picture of you with the pine," said Dad. 
"Okay," Daisy said as she stepped back carefully. She smiled big as Dad took her picture with the pine.
