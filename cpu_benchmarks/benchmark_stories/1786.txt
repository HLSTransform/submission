There was a shy kitten who lived in a garage. Every day the kitten would go out on an adventure. One day, as the kitten ventured outside, she dropped her favorite toy. She looked around for it but could not find it. The kitten grew sad and shy.
Just then, a friendly dog came into the garage. He saw the sad kitten and said he could help. Together, the kitten and the dog searched the garage until they finally found the kitten's toy.
The kitten was no longer shy or sad. She thanked the dog and they played together all afternoon. From then on, the kitten and the dog were good friends. They often went on adventures together, never dropping their favorite toys again.
