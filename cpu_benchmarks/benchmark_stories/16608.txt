Lila and Sam liked to play with their toy cars. They had many cars of different colors and sizes. They made zoom sounds as they moved the cars on the floor. Sometimes they had races to see which car was faster.
One day, they found a big box in the garage. It was heavy and had a picture of a train on it. They asked their mom if they could open it. She said yes, but they had to be careful. Inside the box, there was a train set with tracks, a locomotive, and some cars. Lila and Sam were very happy. They wanted to try the train set right away.
They cleared some space on the floor and started to put the tracks together. They followed the instructions and made a circle with a bridge and a tunnel. Then they attached the locomotive and the cars to the tracks. They plugged in the power cord and turned on the switch. The train started to move. It made a chug-chug sound and a whistle. Lila and Sam watched the train go around the circle. They saw it cross the bridge and disappear into the tunnel. They clapped and cheered.
They played with the train set for a long time. They took turns to control the speed and direction of the train. They pretended to be the conductor and the passengers. They had fun making stories about the train and its adventures. They forgot about their toy cars.
When it was time for dinner, their mom called them. They turned off the switch and unplugged the power cord. They picked up the tracks and the train and put them back in the box. They lifted the box and carried it to the corner. It was still heavy. They settled the box on the floor and closed the lid. They said goodbye to the train and thanked their mom for the gift. They ran to the kitchen to wash their hands and eat. They decided to play with the train set again tomorrow.
