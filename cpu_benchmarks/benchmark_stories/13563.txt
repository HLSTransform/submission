Once upon a time, there was a chubby bunny named Bun Bun. Bun Bun loved to eat carrots and hop around in the grass. One day, Bun Bun went to a picnic with all of his animal friends. They had sandwiches and cookies on a big tray. 
Bun Bun was very hungry and ate a lot of sandwiches. His tummy was so full! After they ate, their friend, a singing bird, sang a beautiful song. All of the animals applauded and Bun Bun clapped his paws together too. 
The picnic was so much fun! Bun Bun was very happy and felt so full and content. He couldn't wait for the next picnic with his friends. The end.
