Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a piggy bank where she saved her money. One day, she went to the store with her mom and saw an incredible toy that she really wanted. She asked her mom if she could buy it, but her mom said she didn't have enough money.
On the way home, Lily started to feel very sleepy. She tried to stay awake, but she couldn't help but yawn. When they got home, Lily went straight to bed and fell asleep. The next day, she woke up and remembered the toy she wanted. She decided to save her money until she had enough to buy it.
Every day, Lily would put some of her money into her piggy bank. It took a long time, but eventually she had enough money to buy the incredible toy. She was so happy and couldn't wait to play with it. From that day on, Lily learned the importance of saving her money and how incredible it feels to finally buy something she really wanted.
