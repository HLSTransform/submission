Once upon a time, there was a gentle girl named Lucy. She loved to create things. One day, she wanted to make a special gift for her mom. Lucy thought and thought. Then, she had an idea. She would create a perfume!
Lucy went to the garden to find flowers. She picked roses, daisies, and more. Lucy put the flowers in a big bowl. She used her hands to make the flowers into a soft, sweet smell. Lucy was very happy with her perfume.
Lucy gave the perfume to her mom. Her mom smelled it and said, "Oh, Lucy! This perfume is so gentle and nice. Thank you for creating it for me!" Lucy smiled and hugged her mom. They both knew that the perfume was made with love.
