Anna and Ben went to Grandma's house for a sleepover. They were very happy to see Grandma and gave her big hugs. Grandma said, "Come on, let's unpack your bags and then we can have a snack."
Anna and Ben followed Grandma to the guest room. They opened their bags and took out their clothes, toys and books. They put them in the drawers and on the shelves. Grandma said, "You have so many things! You must like to play and read a lot."
Anna and Ben nodded. They liked to play and read a lot. They also liked to eat a lot. They asked Grandma, "What is the snack, Grandma? We are hungry."
Grandma smiled and said, "I have a surprise for you. Come to the kitchen and see." Anna and Ben ran to the kitchen. They saw a big plate of sandwiches on the table. The sandwiches had jelly and peanut butter on them. They also saw a bowl of fruit and a jug of milk.
Anna and Ben said, "Wow, thank you, Grandma! We love jelly and peanut butter sandwiches. They are our favorite." They sat down and took a sandwich each. They bit into them and made yummy noises. They also ate some fruit and drank some milk.
Grandma watched them and said, "You are welcome, my dears. I'm glad you like them. But don't eat too much, or you will get fat like me." She patted her belly and laughed.
Anna and Ben laughed too. They said, "You are not fat, Grandma. You are soft and cuddly. We love you, Grandma." They gave her more hugs and kisses. Grandma said, "I love you too, Anna and Ben. You are the best grandchildren ever." They finished their snack and then went to play and read with their toys and books. They had a lot of fun at Grandma's house.
