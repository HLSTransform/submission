Once upon a time, there lived a friendly old oak tree. Every day, the old tree would listen quietly to the children play nearby. One day, a little girl named Joy walked up to the old tree and asked it a question.
"What can I do to help you, old tree?" said Joy.
"Well, you can create something for me," said the old tree. 
"What can I create?" asked Joy. 
"You can create an acorn for me," said the old tree.
So Joy went to find some things to make an acorn. She gathered some clay, some glue and some autumn leaves. Then she started shaping the clay into the shape of an acorn. She added some glue and stuck the leaves onto the clay. Finally, Joy took the acorn to the old tree and presented it to him.
The old tree was delighted. 
"Thank you, dear Joy. You have created something very special. It is both beautiful and friendly," said the old tree as it thanked Joy with a friendly nod.
