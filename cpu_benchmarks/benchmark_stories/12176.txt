Once upon a time, there was a wealthy girl named Donna who liked to ride on her bike. She wanted to go to the movies but she had no money. 
One day, Donna saw a pretty penny on the ground. She picked it up and shouted with joy. She decided to use her lucky penny to go to the movies. 
Donna hopped on her bike and started riding to the movies. She could hardly wait to watch the movie. When she arrived, she saw a poster for a new movie about a wealthy family. She thought it looked interesting and went inside. 
Donna saw an old lady at the ticket counter. She waved her penny and asked, "Could I ride the movie with this penny?" 
The old lady smiled. She said, "Of course you can, my dear." 
Donna was so happy she hugged the old lady. She rode the movie with her penny and enjoyed the film about the wealthy family.
