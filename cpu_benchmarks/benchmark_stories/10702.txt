Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint and draw pictures. One day, she went to the park and saw a boy painting too. She whispered to him, "You are gifted at painting!" 
The boy smiled and said, "Thank you, Lily. What are you painting?" 
Lily showed him her picture of a rainbow and a butterfly. The boy said, "Wow, that's beautiful! It's a great gift to be able to paint." 
Lily felt happy that the boy liked her painting. They sat together and painted pictures of flowers and animals. They whispered about their favorite colors and talked about their families. When it was time to go home, Lily and the boy exchanged their paintings as gifts. They promised to meet again and paint more pictures together.
