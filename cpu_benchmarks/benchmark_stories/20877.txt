Once, there was a small girl named Sue. She wanted to learn a new trick. Every day, she watched the birds fly outside her window. She wanted to fly, too. 
So Sue decided to find a way to fly. She looked around and saw a wall. It was very thick and tall. Sue wanted to learn to fly over it.
She asked her parents to help her. They showed her how to use her arms and legs. She put her hands against the wall and tried to jump. She pushed off the wall and jumped higher and higher. Soon, she was flying over the wall! 
Sue was so excited. She had learned how to fly! Every day, she practiced and got better and better. Sue was so proud of herself. She was flying!
