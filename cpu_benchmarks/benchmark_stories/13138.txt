One day, a large lemon rolled down a hill. As it went, it shouted its name. It said: "I'm a lemon!"
The lemon rolled all the way to a house. It saw a young girl in the garden. She said: "Good morning, lemon!"
The lemon was surprised. It had never been talked to before. It said, "My name is Lemon."
The girl smiled. She said: "That is a very nice name."
Then the girl gave Lemon some sugar. She said: "This will make you very happy!"
The lemon was so happy. It said: "Thank you very much. I am a large and happy lemon now!"
