Rex was a healthy little dog. He loved to play in the garden and he was always happy. One day, Rex started to feel worried. He noticed a new sign outside his garden that said he was not allowed to play. Rex was very upset, but he was determined to do something about it.
He started to think about how he could fix the problem. He decided that he would try to get all of the other animals in the neighbourhood to help him, so he set off on a journey.
 
Rex was friendly and was able to persuade many of the animals to join his cause. Together, they all marched to the house of the person who put up the sign and told them why they were unhappy.
The person was so moved by their story that they agreed to take down the sign. Everyone was so happy and they all celebrated by having a healthy snack together. From then on, Rex and the animals were allowed to play in the garden whenever they wanted.
