Once upon a time, there was a clever boy named Tom. He lived with his parents in a big house. Every day, Tom would take a walk around his neighborhood.
On one special day, he saw a piece of paper lying on the ground. He picked it up and started to read. It was a note from a friendly bear! The note said: "Come to my cave on the other side of the forest. I have something special to show you. Signed, bear".
Tom ran home to his parents. He told them all about the note. Tom's parents were worried - it was dangerous to go alone! However, Tom was clever and decided to take the bear up on his offer. He asked his parents if he could go and promised to be very careful.
Tom set off into the woods, stopping every once in a while to take in the beauty of the forest. At last he found the bear's cave. Inside, Tom saw a strange sight - the bear had set up a secret paper factory! Everywhere around the cave were huge stacks of paper. 
The bear saw the surprised look on Tom's face and said, "Welcome, Tom! I was hoping you would come. I was planning to make a special paper, but I needed a clever boy like you to help me!"
Tom was excited. He and the bear worked together to create something amazing - a beautiful paper house!
