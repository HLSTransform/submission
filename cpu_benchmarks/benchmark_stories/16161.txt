Molly was playing in the park. She had on her furry coat. All of a sudden she knocked over a bucket that had been left next to a bench. It spilled all over the ground and one of the items inside was a shiny tie. Molly could see it sparkling in the sun and she brightened. She picked it up and ran over to her Dad.
"Daddy, look! I found this shiny tie!"
Her dad smiled, "That is a very nice tie. Let's take it home and we can polish it together."
At home, Molly and her Dad polished the tie until it was super shiny. Molly was so happy, she wanted to wear it every day! She put it around her neck and was content.
Her Dad said, "Molly, that looks so nice on you. You look like a princess with your furry coat and shiny tie!"
Molly beamed with pride. She was very happy that she had found her very own shiny tie.
