Nina was a brave little girl. She loved exploring and finding new things. One day, she was playing in the woods when she came across a swamp.
At first, Nina was very curious. She wanted to know what was inside the swamp. But then she felt a little bit frightened. She took a few steps back and hesitated.
Finally, Nina made a decision and grabbed hold of a nearby tree branch. She began to move closer and closer to the swamp until she was right on the edge.
Nina took a deep breath and then she opened the swamp. Inside, she found a treasure! There were all kinds of shiny gems and valuable items lying around. Nina was so happy that she had been brave enough to overcome her fear.
