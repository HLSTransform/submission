Once upon a time there was a girl called Daisy. Daisy was very busy everyday. She loved to play with her friends and do lots of funny things.
Today, Daisy was playing with her friends and he saw a big ball f thread. She thought it was very pretty and picked it up. It was very long and thin and she held onto it tightly.
Daisy saw a bird flying above her in the sky. She was so excited and quickly called out to it. But the bird flew away. Daisy was so sad.
Just then, Daisy's mom called to her. She was very busy so she had to go. Daisy put the thread in her pocket and ran over to see what her mom needed. The end.
