Once upon a time, there was a little plane named Tom. Tom was ready for his first flight. He was so excited to explore the skies.
Tom's Mum was a big plane and she watched as Tom struggled to take off. Tom flew up and down, trying to get the height he needed. He was getting frustrated and was almost ready to give up.
"Just keep trying, Tom," mum plane said. "You can do it!"
Tom kept trying and finally he soared up into the sky. He was so happy and excited. Mum plane was beaming with pride.
Tom flew higher and higher in the sky, with a smile on his face. He did it - he had struggled and overcame his challenge!
