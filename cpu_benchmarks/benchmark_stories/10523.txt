One day, the little boy was excited because there was a festival. He put on his best clothes and went to the festival. He was so happy with the pretty sights and sounds. The music was very impressive and everyone was having a great time.
The little boy had a great time playing. He made some new friends and played some fun games. Suddenly, he started to sneeze! He covered his nose with a tissue and asked his new friends for some water. They rushed over to get him some water and he thanked them. 
The little boy's friends were so impressed. They thought it was very kind of him to clean his nose before carrying on with the festival. He was glad that he still had friends to play with and thanked them again. 
The little boy had a great day at the festival, and was so happy to make new friends!
