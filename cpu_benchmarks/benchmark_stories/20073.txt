Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to help her mom cook. One day, they were making soup for dinner. Lily's mom told her to add some salt to the soup, but Lily accidentally added too much.
"Oh no! The soup is too salty," Lily's mom said.
"I can help!" Lily said. She knew that they needed to remove some of the salt to make the soup taste better.
But when Lily tried to remove the salt, she accidentally spilled the whole pot of soup on the floor. Her mom was upset, but Lily knew how to make things right. She quickly got a mop and cleaned up the mess.
"Good job, Lily. You fit the situation perfectly," her mom said.
From then on, Lily always measured the salt carefully and never spilled anything again. And she and her mom enjoyed a delicious bowl of soup together.
