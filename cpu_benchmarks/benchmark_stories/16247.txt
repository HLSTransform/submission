Mommy was in the kitchen making lunch. The kid was sitting in the living room playing. He was starting to feel a little hungry.
"Mommy," he said. "I'm hungry."
Mommy turned around and smiled. "It's time for lunch," she said. "Come in here, and I'll give you something to eat."
The kid was excited. He ran into the kitchen and sat at the table. Mommy served the kid a plate of mac and cheese. The kid took a big bite of the mac and cheese and smiled. 
"Remember to eat your vegetables," Mommy said. She put some broccoli on the plate. The kid frowned, but Mommy reminded him that it was important to always eat his vegetables. The kid nodded and started to eat the broccoli.
Mommy sat down with the kid and watched him eat. She was happy that he was enjoying his meal and she was proud that he was eating his vegetables. The kid finished the meal feeling full and happy.
