Tim and Jen were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to pretend they were superheroes and villains. Tim was the good guy and Jen was the bad guy. They made loud noises and threw pillows at each other.
"Stop, evil Jen! You can't take over the world!" Tim shouted, holding a plastic sword.
"Ha ha, you can't stop me, silly Tim! I have a secret weapon!" Jen replied, holding a glass bottle.
Tim did not like the glass bottle. He knew it was not a toy. He knew it could break and hurt them. He told Jen to put it down.
"Jen, that's not a toy. That's a glass. It can break and cut you. Put it down, please."
"No, I won't! It's my weapon. You can't tell me what to do!" Jen said, shaking the bottle.
Tim got scared. He did not want Jen to get hurt. He did not want to get hurt. He tried to be gentle and take the bottle from Jen.
"Jen, give me the bottle. It's not safe. I don't want to fight with you. I want to play with you."
But Jen did not listen. She did not want to give up her weapon. She did not want to lose the game. She pulled the bottle away from Tim and swung it at him.
"Take that, Tim! You can't stop me!"
But she swung too hard. The bottle hit the wall and broke. The glass flew everywhere. Tim and Jen screamed. They felt the glass cut their skin. They saw the blood. They cried.
Mom and Dad heard the noise and ran to the living room. They saw Tim and Jen on the floor, covered in glass and blood. They were shocked and angry. They picked up Tim and Jen and took them to the bathroom. They cleaned their wounds and put bandages on them. They scolded them for playing with the glass bottle. They took away their toys and sent them to their rooms.
Tim and Jen were sorry. They did not mean to break the glass. They did not mean to hurt each other. They wished they had listened to Tim. They wished they had played with something else. They learned their lesson. They never played with glass again.
