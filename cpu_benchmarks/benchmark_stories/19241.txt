Once upon a time there was a car. It had an engine. The engine made the car go. One day, the car got very tired. The engine was so tired it stopped working. The people in the car started to worry. They were sorry that the car stopped.
Suddenly, a truck came by. The truck was big and strong. It had a strong engine. It stopped and the people asked for help. The driver of the truck said he could help them.
He hooked up his truck to the car. Then he said to relax. He started his engine and pulled the car. He pulled the car until it was working again. Then the people said thank you to the driver and waved goodbye.
The car was happy again. It drove off and the people inside were very happy. They drove away and said thank you again!
