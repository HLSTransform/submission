Once upon a time, there was a big, hairy bear named Bobo. Bobo lived in a nice, green land. The land was called the nation. All the animals in the nation were happy and played together.
One day, a big storm came to the nation. The storm broke many trees and homes. All the animals were sad. They wanted to fix their homes and make the nation nice again.
Bobo the bear had an idea. He wanted to help restore the nation. So, Bobo and all his friends worked together. They fixed the trees and the homes. Soon, the nation was nice and green again. All the animals were happy and played together once more.
