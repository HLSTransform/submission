Once upon a time there was a sailor. He was a very selfish person. He never thought about anyone else, only himself. 
One day he realized he was lonely, so he decided to go on an adventure. He sailed away, hoping to find someone to talk to.
But luck was not on the sailor's side. Everywhere he went, he couldn't find anyone to be friends with. He started to get sad, but then he heard something.
Someone was having a celebration! He followed the noise, and when he arrived at the party, he saw lots of people, laughing and smiling and having a good time. Everyone was so happy! The sailor decided to stay and join in the fun. 
Everyone was so nice to him, and the sailor felt like he belonged. He stayed at the party until it was over, and he made lots of friends. He even shared some of his selfish things with them. 
The sailor learned that celebrating was the best way to make friends. He never felt lonely again!
