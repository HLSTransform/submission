Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear her favorite pink coat everywhere she went. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. While playing, she saw a big, disgusting bug crawling on the ground. 
"Eww, that bug is so gross!" Lily exclaimed. 
Her friend Timmy replied, "Don't worry, I'll follow it and make sure it doesn't come near you." 
Lily felt relieved and thanked Timmy for being such a good friend. They continued to play and have fun at the park, with Lily feeling safe and happy in her cozy coat. The end.
