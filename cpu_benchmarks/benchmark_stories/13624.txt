Sara and Tom are playing in the kitchen. They see a big yellow box on the floor. It is a new freezer for Mom and Dad. Sara and Tom want to help. They open the box and find the freezer inside.
"Let's load the freezer with food!" Sara says. She runs to the fridge and takes out some cheese and eggs. Tom follows her and grabs some milk and juice.
They carry the food to the freezer and put it inside. They are happy. They think they are doing a good job.
But then Mom comes in. She sees the food in the freezer and gasps. "Oh no! What have you done?" she says. "This food is not for the freezer. It will go bad. You have to take it out right now!"
Sara and Tom are confused. They do not understand. They thought they were helping. They look at Mom with sad eyes.
"Sorry, Mom," Sara says. "We wanted to load the freezer for you."
Mom sighs. She is not angry, but she is worried. She hugs Sara and Tom. "I know you wanted to help, but you have to ask me first. Some food can go in the freezer, but some food cannot. Come, I will show you."
She takes Sara and Tom to the fridge and the freezer. She explains what food can go where. She lets them help her put the food back in the right place. She thanks them for their help.
Sara and Tom are glad. They learned something new. They still like the yellow freezer. They hope Mom and Dad will like it too.
