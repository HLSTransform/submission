Once upon a time there was a clever mouse. The mouse wanted to build something special and it had a plan. It gathered a piece of wood and some tools to start building.
The mouse was very excited and unpacked all of the pieces. It spent a long time thinking about how to arrange them exactly as it wanted.
After a few hours, the mouse managed to put together the pieces and it had created something amazing. Everyone was amazed when they saw it and congratulated the mouse for its work.
The mouse smiled and proudly accepted the praise. It was happy to see that its hard work had paid off and it had come up with a clever plan.
