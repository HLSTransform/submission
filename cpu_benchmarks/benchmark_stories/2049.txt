Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with bubbles. She would blow them and watch them float in the air. One day, she blew a big bubble and it popped on her face. She got mad and started crying.
Her mommy came and hugged her tightly. She wiped away her tears and said, "Don't worry, Lily. It's okay. Let's make some more bubbles." Lily smiled and they started blowing bubbles again. They even added some delicious bubble solution to make them taste good.
Lily was so happy and forgot all about her bubble popping on her face. She hugged her mommy and said, "Thank you for making me feel better." Her mommy hugged her back and said, "I love you, Lily." They continued to blow bubbles and have fun together.
