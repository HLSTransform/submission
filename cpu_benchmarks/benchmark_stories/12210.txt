Once upon a time, there was a small girl called Daisy who lived in a big town. Daisy was three years old, and loved to explore. She was walking home from the park one day, when she heard a strange noise. Daisy looked around, but couldn't see anything. Suddenly, a big shadow appeared in the sky, making Daisy tremble. 
"What is that?" Daisy asked in a worried voice. 
Just then, Daisy's mom appeared.
"It's OK, Daisy," her mom said with a smile. "That's just a cloud. It won't hurt you." 
Daisy was still a little worried, but she wasn't trembling anymore. She smiled at her mom and they held hands as they continued walking home. 
The End.
