Once upon a time, there was a tall train. It had many colors and made loud noises. A boy loved to watch it pass by every day. He would wave and smile at the train.
One day, the boy saw a group of people discussing something near the train tracks. He went to see what was happening. They were talking about building a new road, and the train tracks would have to be removed.
The boy was sad because he loved the train. He went home and drew pictures of the train to remember it. But soon, the train stopped coming. The boy never saw it again. He was very sad and missed the train very much.
