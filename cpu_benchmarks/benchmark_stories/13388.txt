Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He liked to play with his toys in his room, but his mom said it was too loud. So, Timmy went outside to play. He saw a big building with lots of toys in the window. He wanted to go inside and see the toys. 
Timmy asked his mom if they could go inside the building. His mom said yes, but they had to buy something first. Timmy was excited! They went inside and saw lots of toys. Timmy picked out a toy car and his mom bought it for him. They went back outside and Timmy played with his new toy car. He was happy and his mom was happy too. The end.
