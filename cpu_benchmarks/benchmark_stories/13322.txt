Once upon a time, in a big nation, there lived a kind and compassionate king. The king loved his people very much. He always wanted to make sure everyone had enough to eat.
One day, the king went to visit the people in his nation. He saw a little boy who looked very sad. The king asked the boy, "Why are you so sad, little one?" The boy said, "I am hungry, and I have no food."
The compassionate king felt sad for the boy. He decided to feed the hungry boy and all the other people in the nation. He called all his helpers and said, "Let's feed everyone who is hungry."
The king and his helpers went around the nation, giving food to everyone who needed it. The people were very happy, and the little boy said, "Thank you, kind king, for feeding us."
From that day on, the compassionate king made sure that no one in his nation went hungry. Everyone lived happily ever after, and they always remembered the day the king fed them all.
