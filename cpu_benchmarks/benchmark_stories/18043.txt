Once upon a time, there was a kind king who loved his staff very much. His staff were the people who helped him do his work. The king was very happy with his staff, but one of them was envious of the others. This means that she wanted what they had, and she wasn't happy with what she had.
One day, the king went on a long journey to a faraway land. He left his staff in charge of the kingdom while he was gone. The envious staff member saw this as her chance to take over the kingdom. She made a plan to get rid of the other staff members so that she could be in charge.
But when the king returned, he found out what had happened. He was very angry with the envious staff member and sent her away. He realized that he should have paid more attention to her feelings before he left. From then on, he made sure to listen to all of his staff's concerns and make them feel valued.
