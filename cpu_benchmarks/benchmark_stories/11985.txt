Once upon a time, there was a kind and polite bunny named Benny. Benny loved to hop around in the grass and eat carrots all day. One day, Benny found a shiny penny on the ground. He picked it up and made a wish. He wished that he could spin around and around like a top.
Benny closed his eyes and made his wish. Suddenly, he felt himself spinning and spinning. He spun so fast that he felt like he was flying. When he opened his eyes, he saw that he was in a magical forest. The trees were tall and the flowers were bright colors.
Benny hopped around the forest, feeling happy and free. He spun in circles and laughed with joy. Finally, it was time for Benny to go back home. He closed his eyes and made another wish. This time, he wished to go back to his cozy burrow. When he opened his eyes, he was back home. Benny was so happy that he hopped and spun around in circles all night long.
