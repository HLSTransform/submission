One day, a young boy named Tim found a dull, round rock. He picked it up and looked at it. He thought it was not very fun, but he took it with him to the park.
At the park, Tim saw a girl named Sue. She had a big, red ball. "Want to play?" Sue asked. Tim said, "Yes, but all I have is this dull rock." Sue said, "Let's try to roll it."
They tried to roll the rock, but it was not easy. They pushed it and pushed it, but it would not go far. They were sad, but they did not give up.
Then, they had an idea. They put the rock on a hill and let it go. The rock rolled down the hill very fast. Tim and Sue laughed and clapped their hands. They found out that even a dull rock can be fun when you roll it down a hill.
