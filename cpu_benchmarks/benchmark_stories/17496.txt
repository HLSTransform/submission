Tom and Anna were twins who liked to play with toys and books. One day, they found a big book in their dad's office. It had many words and letters, but no pictures or colors. Tom opened the book and tried to read it.
"What is this book?" he asked Anna.
Anna looked at the book and saw the word "dictionary" on the cover. She remembered that their dad had told them that a dictionary was a book that helped people learn new words.
"It is a dictionary," she said. "It can teach us many things."
Tom did not like the dictionary. He thought it was boring and hard. He shrugged and said, "I don't want to learn new words. I want to play with something fun. Let's find another book."
He closed the dictionary and put it back on the shelf. He looked for a book with pictures and stories. He found one about a dragon and a knight. He took it and said, "This is a good book. It has a dragon and a knight. They are brave and strong. Let's read this one."
Anna did not want to read the book about the dragon and the knight. She thought it was silly and scary. She shrugged and said, "I don't want to read this book. I want to learn new words. Let's read the dictionary."
She took the dictionary and opened it. She looked for a word that she did not know. She found one that said "shrug". She read the definition and learned that it meant to raise and lower your shoulders to show that you do not care or know something.
"Look, Tom, I learned a new word. It is shrug. Do you know what it means?" she asked Tom.
Tom did not look at the dictionary. He was busy reading the book about the dragon and the knight. He shrugged and said, "I don't know and I don't care. I am reading a good book. It is not boring like your book."
Anna felt sad and angry. She did not like that Tom did not care about her book or her word. She closed the dictionary and put it back on the shelf. She looked for another book that she liked. She found one about a princess and a fairy. She took it and said, "This is a good book. It has a princess and a fairy. They are kind and smart. Let's read this one."
Tom did not want to read the book about the princess and the fairy. He thought it was boring and girly. He shrugged and said, "I don't want to read this book. I want to read something fun. Let's read the book about the dragon and the knight."
He took the book and opened it. He looked for a page that he liked. He found one that said "The End". He read the last sentence and learned that the dragon and the knight became friends and lived happily ever after.
"Look, Anna, I finished the book. It was a good book. It had a happy ending. Do you want to know what happened?" he asked Anna.
Anna did not look at the book about the dragon and the knight. She was busy reading the book about the princess and the fairy. She shrugged and said, "I don't know and I don't care. I am reading a good book. It is not silly like your book."
Tom felt sad and angry. He did not like that Anna did not care about his book or his ending. He closed the book and put it back on the shelf. He looked for another book that he liked. He could not find one. He felt bored and lonely.
He looked at Anna. She was still reading the book about the princess and the fairy. She looked happy and interested. He felt curious and sorry.
He walked to Anna and said, "Anna, I am sorry. I was rude to you. I should have listened to you and learned your word. I should have tried to read your book. Can you forgive me?"
Anna looked at Tom. She saw that he was sorry. She felt happy and sorry.
She closed the book and said, "Tom, I am sorry. I was rude to you. I should have listened to you and learned your ending. I should have tried to read your book. I forgive you."
They hugged and smiled. They decided to share their books and their words. They learned that the dictionary was not boring and the dragon and the knight were not silly. They learned that the princess and the fairy were not girly and the shrug was not rude. They learned that reading different books could make them smarter and happier. They learned that being kind and caring could make them better and closer. They learned a lot from each other. They had fun. They were happy.
The moral of the story is: Don't judge a book by its cover. Be open to
