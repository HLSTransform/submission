Once upon a time, there was a little boat named Bobo. Bobo lived in a harbor. He liked to play with his friends, the fish and the birds.
One day, it was very icy in the harbor. Bobo and his friends were cold. They wanted to find a warm place to play. They saw a big cave near the water. "Let's go inside," said Bobo. The fish and the birds agreed.
In the cave, it was dark and quiet. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It scared Bobo and his friends. They swam and flew fast out of the cave. They were happy to be back in the icy harbor. They all laughed and played together, even if it was cold. They knew they were safe at home.
