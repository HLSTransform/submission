Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot liked to play outside on the ground. He loved to run and jump all day long.
One day, Spot saw a big hole in the ground. He started to worry. He thought it was a very serious problem. He did not want anyone to fall in the hole.
Spot ran to his friend, a little girl named Sally. He barked loudly to tell her about the hole. Sally saw the hole and understood that it was serious. She put a big rock by the hole so no one would fall in. Spot was happy and stopped worrying. They played together and had lots of fun.
