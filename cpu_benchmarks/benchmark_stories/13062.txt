Once there was a pretty girl named Jill. One day she went out to play at night with her friends. She was having a lot of fun. 
Suddenly, there was a bright light from the sky. It lit up the whole place. Jill and her friends were so amazed and excited. 
When they looked closer, they realized it was a switch. It was shiny and fit perfectly into the ground. Jill turned on the switch and out popped a rainbow of colors. It was so beautiful! 
Jill and her friends laughed and danced around in the bright light. They even made up a new game to play. They called it the "switch game". 
The switch made everything oh so pretty. Jill and her friends will remember that night forever.
