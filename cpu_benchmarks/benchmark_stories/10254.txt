Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help wash the dishes. Lily was happy to help and went to the kitchen. She turned on the faucet and held the dishes under the water. 
Suddenly, Lily's mom noticed that the water was not coming out of the faucet. "Lily, can you hold the faucet while I fix it?" she asked. Lily nodded and held the faucet while her mom fixed it. 
After the faucet was fixed, Lily's mom said, "You did a perfect job holding the faucet, Lily! Now we can finish washing the dishes together." Lily smiled and felt proud of herself for helping her mom.
