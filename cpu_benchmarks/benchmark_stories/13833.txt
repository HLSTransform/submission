Tom and Lily were going to church with their mom and dad. They liked church because they could sing and pray and see their friends. They also liked the big church building, with its tall tower and colorful windows.
When they got to the church, they saw a big crowd of people outside. They heard loud noises and saw smoke and fire. Tom and Lily were scared and held their mom and dad's hands. "What is happening?" Tom asked.
Mom and dad looked sad and worried. "There was a powerful storm last night, and it hit the church with lightning. The lightning made a big hole in the tower and started a fire. The firemen are trying to put out the fire and save the church," dad explained.
Tom and Lily felt sad too. They loved their church and did not want it to be hurt. They wanted to help, but they knew they were too small and the fire was too dangerous. They prayed to God to protect the church and the firemen.
Then they saw a fireman come out of the church, carrying something in his arms. He walked towards them and smiled. He had a black and white cat in his arms. It was their church cat, Mr. Whiskers. He was dirty and wet, but he was alive and purring.
"Look, kids, I found your cat. He was hiding under a pew. He's a brave cat, and he's lucky to be alive. Do you want to hold him?" the fireman asked.
Tom and Lily nodded and smiled. They thanked the fireman and took turns holding Mr. Whiskers. They hugged him and kissed him and told him they were happy he was safe. They felt a little better, knowing that God had saved their cat and was watching over their church. They hoped their church would be fixed soon, so they could go back and sing and pray and see their friends. And their cat.
