Lily was a curious girl. She liked to look at everything and ask questions. One day, she saw a big jar of honey on the table. She wanted to taste it. She climbed on a chair and reached for the jar.
But the jar was too heavy for Lily. She lost her balance and fell off the chair. The jar fell with her and broke on the floor. The honey spilled everywhere and made a sticky mess. Lily was hurt and scared. She started to cry.
Mama heard Lily's cry and ran to the kitchen. She saw Lily on the floor with honey and glass around her. She was very angry and worried. She picked up Lily and checked her for cuts. She said, "Lily, what did you do? You were very naughty and foolish. You could have hurt yourself badly. You are not allowed to touch the honey. It is not for you. It is for the bread. Now you have to seat in the corner and think about what you did. And you have to help me clean up this mess later."
Lily felt very sorry and sad. She did not mean to make Mama angry and worried. She just wanted to taste the honey. She did not know it was so heavy and dangerous. She said, "I'm sorry, Mama. I was curious. I won't touch the honey again. Please don't be mad at me."
Mama hugged Lily and said, "I'm not mad at you, Lily. I love you. But you have to listen to me and be careful. Honey is good, but it is not worth getting hurt. Now go and seat in the corner and think about what you did. And then we will clean up together."
Lily went and sat in the corner. She felt very bad. She wished she had not touched the honey. She wished she had a happy ending.
