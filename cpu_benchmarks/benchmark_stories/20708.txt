Once there was a man. He was very careful with his things. He wanted to make sure he held on to them for a long time. So he took good care of them. 
Every day he would always take a walk. He would pass by lots of houses. One day, he saw a little girl sitting outside her house. She was playing with her dolls by herself.
The man stopped and said hello to the girl. He asked if he could play too. She smiled and said yes. The man and the little girl played together for a long time.
After a while, it was time for the man to go. As he was about to leave, the little girl said she wanted to do something special for him. She asked if she could serve him a snack. He thought this was very nice and agreed. 
The little girl went into the kitchen and came back with something delicious to eat. She told the man he was special and she wanted to be careful to serve him the best. 
The man was so proud of the little girl and thanked her for serving him. Every time he passes her house, he remembers her kindness and how careful she was to serve him.
