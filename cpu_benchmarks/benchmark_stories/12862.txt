Once upon a time there was an olive who wanted to explore the world. He wanted to see what was out there. So one day, he decided to part from his family's olive tree.
"Olive, where are you going?" asked Mama Olive.
"I'm going to explore the world!" he replied excitedly.
Mama Olive was a bit worried. "Be sure to stay safe," she said.
"Don't worry, Mama, I'll be ok!" Olive said.
So Olive ventured out and was amazed at all he saw. He explored mountains, valleys, and fields. He met many new, friendly creatures along the way. But after all this adventuring, he eventually figured it was time to go back home.
When Olive returned, Mama Olive hugged him tight. "Oh, Olive, I'm so glad you are safe."
She smiled and hugged him again. 
The two were happy to be reunited and Olive learned so much on his journey. He knew that being safe was the best way to explore and that Mama Olive would always be there for him.
