Mia likes to match things. She has a box of cards with pictures of animals and things. She likes to find two cards that are the same and put them together. She thinks it is fun and easy.
One day, Mia sees a birdcage in the living room. It is big and shiny and has a door. Inside the birdcage, there is a bird. The bird is pale and has a long tail. It makes a loud noise. Mia thinks the bird is pretty and wants to play with it.
She goes to her box of cards and looks for a card that matches the bird. She finds one that has a pale bird with a long tail. She is happy and runs to the birdcage. She shows the card to the bird and says, "Look, bird, I have a card that matches you. Do you want to be my friend?"
The bird looks at the card and at Mia. It does not like the card. It thinks the card is not a real bird. It does not want to be Mia's friend. It makes a louder noise and flaps its wings. It tries to bite the card and Mia's fingers.
Mia is scared and sad. She drops the card and runs away. She cries and says, "The bird does not like me. The bird does not want to match. The bird is mean."
Mia's mom hears Mia crying and comes to see what is wrong. She sees the birdcage and the card on the floor. She hugs Mia and says, "I'm sorry, Mia. The bird is not a toy. The bird is a pet. The bird does not understand cards. The bird needs a different kind of friend. Maybe you can find another card that matches something else. Or maybe you can draw a picture of the bird and give it to the bird. Maybe then the bird will like you."
Mia stops crying and thinks. She says, "Okay, mom. I will try. I still like the bird. I want the bird to like me too." She goes to her box of cards and looks for another match. She hopes the bird will be nice.
