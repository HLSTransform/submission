Lisa and Tom were twins who liked to help their mom with the housework. They liked to put the dirty plates and cups in the dishwasher and press the button to make it start. They thought it was fun to watch the water and soap clean the dishes.
One day, the dishwasher made a loud noise and stopped working. Mom looked worried and said, "Oh no, the dishwasher is broken. We have to call someone to fix it. It might cost a lot of money."
Lisa and Tom felt sad and scared. They did not want their mom to be worried or spend a lot of money. They wanted the dishwasher to work again. They decided to do something to help.
They went to their room and knelt on their bed. They folded their hands and closed their eyes. They prayed to God and asked him to help their mom and the dishwasher. They said, "Dear God, please help our mom and the dishwasher. Please make the dishwasher work again and make our mom happy. Thank you for everything you give us. Amen."
They felt more comfortable and hopeful after they prayed. They hugged each other and went back to the kitchen. They saw their mom smiling and the dishwasher running. She said, "Guess what, kids? The dishwasher is working again. It was just a loose wire. I fixed it myself. Isn't that great?"
Lisa and Tom were amazed and happy. They thanked God and their mom. They helped their mom put away the clean dishes. They felt proud and grateful. They learned that praying can make a difference.
