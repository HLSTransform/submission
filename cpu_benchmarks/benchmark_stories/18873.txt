Sam liked to climb. He climbed on chairs, on tables, on beds, on sofas. He climbed everywhere he could. He wanted to see what was up high. He wanted to touch everything.
One day, he saw a big pan on the stove. It was shiny and round. He wanted to see what was inside. He climbed on a chair and reached for the pan. But the pan was hot. It burned his hand. He cried out loud.
Mom heard him and ran to the kitchen. She saw Sam on the chair and the pan on the stove. She was scared and angry. She took Sam off the chair and hugged him. She put some cold water on his hand. She said, "Sam, you are strong, but you are not smart. You should not climb on the stove. The stove is hot. The pan is hot. You could get hurt. You could make a mess. You should listen to Mom. Mom knows what is safe and what is not."
Sam felt sorry and sad. He said, "I'm sorry, Mom. I just wanted to see the pan. I didn't know it was hot. I won't climb on the stove again. I love you, Mom."
Mom smiled and kissed him. She said, "I love you too, Sam. You are my brave and curious boy. But you have to be careful and follow the rules. There are many things you can climb and see and touch. But not the stove and the pan. They are not for you. They are for Mom. Do you understand?"
Sam nodded and said, "I understand, Mom. I will be good. I will be smart. I will climb on other things. Like the slide and the tree and the ladder. But not the stove and the pan. They are hot. They are not fun. They are for Mom."
