Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a gray stone on the ground. It was very pretty, so she picked it up and held it in her hand.
Lily showed the gray stone to her mommy and daddy. She told them how she found it outside. They thought it was very nice, too. They all went outside to look for more stones.
Lily and her family found many more stones. Some were big and some were small. They were all different colors, but Lily's favorite was still the gray one she found first. She loved to hold it and tell stories about it.
