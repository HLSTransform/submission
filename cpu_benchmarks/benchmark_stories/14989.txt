Once, there was a little girl who had lots of wild ideas. People around her thought her ideas were silly, but she knew they had the potential to become something great.
One day, she decided to explore a nearby forest and find out what's hidden in there. She was told by her friends not to go, but she didn't listen. After all, she wanted to increase her wisdom.
So, the little girl went into the woods. At first, she was scared of all the wild animals but soon she noticed they weren't scared of her, so she felt better. 
But, when it got dark the little girl suddenly felt really scared. She started to cry, and the wild animals began to howl. In fear, she ran out of the forest as fast as she could.
The little girl never went back to the woods again. She learnt her lesson - whilst it's good to want to increase your wisdom, it's also important to be careful and listen to you parents.
