Once there was a little girl who was scared of the dark. Every night, she heard an alarm that made her trembling in her bed. As she was getting older, she wanted to be brave and not be scared anymore. 
One night, she asked her mom if she could turn off the alarm. She trusted her mom, so she knew it was okay. She jumped out of bed and carefully tiptoed over to the alarm. She was so brave! She slowly put her hand over the alarm and with a deep breath, she turned it off. 
There was no noise - just peaceful silence! She smiled, feeling proud that she was brave enough to do this all by herself. Before she went back to bed, she saw a nasty, dirty sock under her bed. She quickly put it in the laundry and went back to bed with a feeling of trust in herself.
