Once upon a time, there was a jolly hive in the forest. Inside, was a big family made up of hundreds and hundreds of busy bees. They all belonged in the hive, and each had a special job to do. 
One day, little Mary asked her mama bee, "Where do we belong?" 
Mama bee looked at Mary with a smile and said, "We belong in the hive, sweetheart. Our hive is a safe place full of happiness. Everyone here belongs and is taken care of." 
"So, I don't go to school here?" asked Mary. 
Mama bee said, "No, there is no school here, but you can learn all you need to know from me, and the other bees!" 
Mary was so happy to know that the hive was her home, and she belonged. She jumped and ran around with joy, and the other bees laughed cheerfully. 
 
From that day on, Mary knew she belonged in the jolly hive with her family, and was content.
