Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Maria. She wanted to find something special. One day she went walking in the park and she found a screw. It was shiny and sparkly. She was so happy she put it in her pocket.
On the way back home, she saw a dog playing with a bone. Everyone was watching the dog and Maria was very envious. She wished she could have something special, like the bone. Suddenly, an idea popped into her head. Maybe she could make something out of the screw. 
So, she went back home and grabbed a few tools from the garage. She was so excited when she was able to put the screw to good use. She built a colorful box out of the screw. Everyone was so impressed and Maria was very happy.
