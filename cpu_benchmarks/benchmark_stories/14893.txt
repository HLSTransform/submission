Mama and her little girl were walking in the park on a sunny day. Little girl wanted to take a nap. Mama saw a butterfly in the sky and said, “Let’s watch the butterfly for a bit and then you can take a nap.” Little girl was excited. She said, “Yes Mama, let’s watch!”
They watched the butterfly for a few minutes and then Mama told a joke to make her little girl happy. Little girl laughed and said, “Mama, tell me another joke!” Mama smiled and said, “No, I think this is enough. We should let the butterfly be now.”
Mama’s words made Little Girl feel guilty. She said, “Mama, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked for another joke. I should have let the butterfly be.” Mama hugged her and said, “It’s ok, my love. It’s important to remember to be respectful and show kindness to all living things, even if it’s just a butterfly.”
Little Girl nodded in agreement. She was happy that she had learned something important that day. She smiled at Mama and they started to walk away. They knew they had shared a special moment together.
