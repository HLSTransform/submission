Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Kim. She was very brave and loved to explore the world around her.
One sunny afternoon, Kim went for a walk in the park. As she was walking through the grass, she saw something huge. It was a giant! Kim was so surprised, she stopped walking and started to panic. 
The giant saw Kim and started to walk toward her. Kim looked up at him, and realized he wasn't happy. His face was angry, and he was shaking his fists at her!
Kim was scared, so she ran away from the giant as fast as she could. She ran up a small hill and hid behind a big tree. 
The giant couldn't see her, so he eventually left the park. Kim was so relieved, she could finally take a deep breath. 
From that day on, Kim learned to always stay out of the giant's way.
