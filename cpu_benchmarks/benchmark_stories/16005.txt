Once upon a time, there was a popular man. He was always very happy and laughed a lot. One night, he saw a big cloud with lightning inside it. He thought it was magical and wanted to give it to his friends.
So he put it in a box and gave it to the people in his village. Everyone was so excited! They brought the box out into the town square. 
When they opened it, a big spark of lightning flew out and lit up the sky! Everyone cheered with surprise and joy. The man was so happy to see that he had given them such a beautiful gift. 
The whole village celebrated that night and the man was even more popular. He gave the people happiness and joy with his lightning!
