Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there was a small brown rabbit. The rabbit had big ears. One day, the rabbit found a big red apple. The rabbit thought the apple looked delicious.
The rabbit wanted to share the apple with his friend, the squirrel. So, he went to find the squirrel. He used his big ears to listen for his friend. The rabbit could hear the squirrel in a tree. The rabbit called out, "Hey, squirrel! I have a surprise for you. Can you guess what it is?"
The squirrel came down from the tree and saw the big red apple. The squirrel was very happy. The rabbit and the squirrel sat down and ate the delicious apple together. They were very happy and had a great day in the big green forest.
