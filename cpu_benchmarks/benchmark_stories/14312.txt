Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Joe. Joe loved to go for adventures and explore new places.
One day, he was playing in the woods when he saw something hidden in the trees. He came closer to take a look and saw a skull! He was scared at first, but then he realised the skull wasn't real. Joe gave the skull a big hug and decided to keep it.
Joe knew he had to keep the skull a secret, so he decided to hide it in the garden. As he buried the skull, he felt happy knowing he had something special to keep secret and no one else knew about it.
The skull stayed hidden in the garden for many months until one day, Joe wanted to play with it again. He ran to the garden, smiling and excited to see the skull. He dug it out from the ground and looked at it close up. Joe knew only he knew about the hidden skull and he gave it a big hug. And then he ran off to play with it again.
