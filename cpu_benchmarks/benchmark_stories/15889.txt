The sun was out and the sky a bright blue. Little Jimmy could feel the warmth of the sun on his back as he peeked out of the window of the train. Everywhere he looked, he saw life.
The train went faster and faster, but Jimmy wasn't scared. He was looking forward to his new home.
As the train slowed down and came to a stop, Jimmy took a deep breath and looked at his mum. She smiled and said "Come on, let's go Jimmy!"
Jimmy got off the train, feeling a little afraid. He wasn't sure what to expect, but his mum held his hand tightly and told him that everything was going to be ok.
They got to their new home, and Jimmy peeked in through the window. It was a small but cozy place, and suddenly Jimmy wasn't so fearful anymore. He knew that this was the beginning of a new and exciting life. He smiled and squeezed his mum's hand tight, with happiness in his heart.
