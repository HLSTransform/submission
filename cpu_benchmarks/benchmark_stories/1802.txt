There once was a little boy called Thomas. He was just three years old and loved playing outside in the garden. 
Today, he was extra muddy, so his mum said it was time to bathe. Thomas went upstairs and put on his large, yellow vest and stepped into the warm bath. He splashed around and had a lot of fun.
Afterwards, Thomas got out and wrapped himself in a towel. He was all clean but not ready for bed yet â€“ he still had some time to play. 
So Thomas ran outside to the garden and had a wonderful time playing in the afternoon sunshine.
