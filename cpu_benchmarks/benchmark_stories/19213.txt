Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go to the park and play on the swings. One day, she went to the park with her mommy and daddy. When they got there, they saw that the gate was closed. 
Lily demanded that the gate be open so she could go play on the swings. Her parents tried to explain that the gate was closed for a reason, but Lily was very insistent. Finally, her parents gave in and opened the gate. 
Lily ran to the swings and had a lot of fun. But when it was time to go home, she realized that the gate was closed again. She asked her parents to open it, but they told her that it was time to go home. Lily was sad, but she knew that she could come back another day and play on the swings again.
