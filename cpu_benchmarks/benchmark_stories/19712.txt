Once upon a time, there was a brave girl named Jane. Jane wanted to climb the very tall tree in her garden. She had to be brave and strong in order to do it. 
But the tree had a tall trunk and many thick branches and Jane didn't know where to start. Then she got an idea. She took a cord and tied it around a strong branch. Then she used it to climb up the tree.
The cord was heavy, but she was determined. With lots of effort, Jane managed to pull herself up the cord until she was very high in the tree. She had done it! She had managed to succeed!
Jane had a big smile on her face. She was brave and determined, even if she had used a big, heavy cord to help her get to the top.
