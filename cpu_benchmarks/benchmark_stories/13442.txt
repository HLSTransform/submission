Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars and trucks. One day, he found a shiny red car on top of a shelf. He was so excited to play with it.
Timmy took the car down from the shelf and started to rub it gently. The car was so smooth and pretty. But then, Timmy accidentally dropped the car and it broke into many pieces. Timmy was very sad because he loved that car so much.
From that day on, Timmy learned to be more careful with his toys. He never played with his toys on top of a shelf again. Even though he was sad about the broken car, he knew that he could always find new toys to play with.
