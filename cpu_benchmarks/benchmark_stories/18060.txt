Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat spicy food. One day, her mom made her some spicy noodles for lunch. Lily ate them all up and her mouth started to shake because they were so spicy! She was surprised by the shock of the spice.
Later that day, Lily and her mom went for a walk in the park. They saw a squirrel in a tree and Lily wanted to say hello. She shook the tree and the squirrel fell out! Lily was shocked but the squirrel was okay. They gave him some nuts to eat and he ran away happily.
After their adventure in the park, Lily and her mom went home. Lily was still feeling the shock of the spicy noodles in her mouth. She asked her mom for some milk to drink. The milk helped to cool down her mouth and she felt much better. From then on, Lily learned not to shake the trees and to be careful with spicy food. The end.
