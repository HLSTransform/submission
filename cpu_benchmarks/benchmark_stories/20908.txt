Once upon a time, there was a wave in the ocean. The wave was made from water and it was so big that it bounced really high.
The wave looked for something to latch onto so it could stay safe, and it found an anchor. The anchor was made from metal and it was very strong, so it kept the wave from bouncing too much.
The wave was feeling happy and secure, but then something strange happened - the wave started to turn pale! It was strange because usually waves are blue but this one was turning white.
The wave asked the anchor what had happened, and the anchor said that the wave had used up all of its energy - so it had to take a nap. So the wave rested until it had enough energy to bounce again.
The end.
