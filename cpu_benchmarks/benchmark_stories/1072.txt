Once upon a time, there was a hairy monster who lived in the sand. He was very lonely, so he decided to rise up out of the ground to look for a friend.
The monster rose up higher and higher out of the sand, until he stopped at the top of a hill. From there, he could see the whole beach. He saw a child playing in the sand and it made him very happy.
The monster waved his hands and he smiled his monster smile, but the child was too scared to come near him. He kept running away but he kept looking back at the monster.
Finally, the monster was so happy, he flew up and up in the sky. With a big smile on his face, he waved goodbye to the child and flew away to find new friends.
