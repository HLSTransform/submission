Once upon a time there was a huge bear. His name was Billy. He was not just a big bear, he was also a strong bear. 
One day, Billy was taking a nap in his treehouse when he heard a noise nearby. He opened his eyes and saw a little girl. She was just about three years old. She was carrying something in her hand.
Billy climbed down from his treehouse to find out what the little girl was carrying. It was soap. She smiled and said, “Hi bear!” 
Billy recognized the little girl as his neighbor. He was so happy to see her that he said, “Hello, friend. What do you have there?” 
The little girl showed him the soap she had found in her house. Billy was amazed by how huge it was! He had never seen such a giant bar of soap before. 
The little girl asked Billy if he wanted it and without hesitating, he said yes. 
Billy and the little girl said hello again before she went back home with a big smile on her face. 
From that day onwards, Billy was always excited to go outside to recognize his friend, the little girl with the huge bar of soap.
