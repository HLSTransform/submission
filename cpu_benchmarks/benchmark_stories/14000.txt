Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a gloomy day. The sky was gray, and the trees were sad. In this town, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to play with blocks. He made many patterns with his blocks. One day, he saw that his patterns were always the same. Tim wanted to change them.
He asked his mom, "How can I change my patterns?" His mom said, "You can try new things and learn from others." So Tim went to his friend, Lily. Lily showed him new ways to make patterns with the blocks. They made patterns with colors, shapes, and sizes. Tim was happy because he learned to change his patterns.
From that day on, Tim and Lily played together and shared their ideas. They made many new patterns with their blocks. The town became less gloomy because the children were happy and learning from each other. The moral of the story is that when we try new things and learn from others, we can change and grow.
