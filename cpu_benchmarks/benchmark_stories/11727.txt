One day, Steve was playing in his room when he saw a switch on the floor. He immediately got very curious and asked his mother what it was.
"It's a switch, sweetheart," his mother said. "Now why don't you go play with the other toys in your room."
Steve didn't listen and kept looking at the switch. He wanted to know what it did.
His mother smiled and said, "Let's gather some other toys, and you can use the switch to turn them on and off. That way, you can practice being patient until the toys do what you want them to do."
Steve was very excited. He grabbed some of his favorite toys, like his car and stuffed animal, and waited for the switch to work. He pressed the switch and watched as the car started to move.
"Yay," Steve shouted. He was so pleased that he wanted to keep pressing the switch, so he started to turn each toy on and off.
The switch made Steve happy, and he was so patient while he waited for the toys to do what he wanted them to. He just kept pressing the switch until it was time for bed.
