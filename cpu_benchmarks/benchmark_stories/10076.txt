Mark was a boy who liked to draw. He had many crayons and papers. He drew cars, animals, flowers and stars. He was happy when he drew.
One day, he went to the shop with his mom. He saw a big book with many pictures. He wanted the book very much. He asked his mom, "Can I have the book, please?"
His mom looked at the book. It was very expensive. She said, "I'm sorry, Mark, but we don't have enough money to buy the book. Maybe another time."
Mark was sad. He really liked the book. He put the book back on the shelf. He followed his mom to the counter. His mom paid for some bread and milk.
As they were leaving, a man stopped them. He was the owner of the shop. He had a smile on his face. He said, "Hello, Mark. I saw you looking at the book. I have a gift for you."
He handed Mark the book. Mark was surprised. He couldn't believe it. He said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
The man said, "You're welcome, Mark. I like your drawings. You are very talented. I have some of them on my wall. They make me happy. This is my way of saying thank you."
Mark was grateful. He hugged the man. He hugged his mom. He was very happy. He had the book and a new friend. He couldn't wait to go home and draw more.
