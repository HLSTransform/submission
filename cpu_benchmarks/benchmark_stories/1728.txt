Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play by the river. She liked to watch the water flow and listen to the birds sing. One day, Lily's mommy asked her if she wanted to go on a boat ride down the river. Lily was very excited and said yes.
But mommy wanted to make sure they were safe on the boat, so she asked her friend who knows a lot about boats to recommend a reliable one. Her friend said she knew just the right boat and they set off down the river. Lily had so much fun waving at the ducks and feeling the wind in her hair. She was so happy mommy found a reliable boat.
