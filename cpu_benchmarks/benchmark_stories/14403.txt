Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she was running and spinning around so much that she got very dizzy. She fell down and hurt her knee. It caused her a lot of pain and she started to cry.
Her mom came to her and asked, "Lily, where does it hurt?" Lily pointed to her knee and said, "It hurts here." Her mom took out a little ruler and said, "Let me measure how big the boo-boo is." She measured the cut and put a band-aid on it. Lily felt much better and was happy to go back to playing outside again.
