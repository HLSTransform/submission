Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. She was three years old and wanted to be a princess on Halloween.
Sue's mommy took her to the store to buy a princess costume. She looked at all the costumes and decided on a pink dress with a pretty tiara. Sue's mommy paid for the costume and brought it home.
When the night of Halloween came, Sue put on her costume. She was so happy that she didn't pay attention to where she was going. Suddenly, Sue tripped and fell over! Her mommy ran over to help, but the costume was all torn.
Sue was so sad and started to cry. Her mommy hugged her and promised that she would buy her another costume. Even though it was careless of Sue, her mommy still loved her and they found the perfect costume. 
The day was saved and Sue had a great Halloween. She was careful but still enjoyed being a princess. Lesson learned, always pay attention when wearing a costume!
