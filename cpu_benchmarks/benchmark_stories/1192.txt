Once upon a time, there was a baby named Lily. She loved to play in her wide crib. One day, her mommy came in and said, "Lily, it's time to cut your hair." 
Lily didn't like the sound of that. She said, "No, mommy! I don't want to cut my hair!" 
But her mommy said, "Don't worry, it won't hurt. I'll just use these scissors to cut a little bit off." 
Lily watched as her mommy carefully cut her hair. When she was done, Lily looked in the mirror and saw that her hair looked nice and neat. She smiled and said, "Thank you, mommy!"
