Lila and Ben are twins. They like to play outside in the garden. One day, they discover a big hole in the ground. They wonder what is inside.
"Let's go and see!" says Lila. She is brave and curious.
"OK, but be careful!" says Ben. He is cautious and careful.
They crawl into the hole and see many things. They see rocks and roots and worms and bugs. They see shiny things and soft things and hard things. They see earth.
"Wow, look at this!" says Lila. She picks up a round thing that is red and green and yellow. It is smooth and shiny. It is attractive.
"What is it?" asks Ben. He picks up a similar thing that is blue and white and brown. It is also smooth and shiny. It is attractive.
"I don't know," says Lila. "But they are pretty. Maybe they are jewels or treasures."
"Maybe," says Ben. "Or maybe they are planets. Like the ones we see in the sky at night."
They hold the things in their hands and pretend they are astronauts. They explore the hole and find more things. They have fun and learn new things. They discover earth.
