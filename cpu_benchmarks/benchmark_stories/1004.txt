Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was only three years old. But the girl was very helpful. Every day, she found ways to provide help to her family.
One day, the girl got an exciting idea. She wanted to provide a special surprise for her family. So every day, she worked very hard. She made little gifts and put them aside.
When the end of the year arrived, the girl was ready. She gave all the gifts to her family. They were so happy! From then on, the little girl was always looking for ways to provide kindness and happiness to the people she loved.
