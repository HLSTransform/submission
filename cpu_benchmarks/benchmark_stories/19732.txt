Once upon a time, there were two friends called John and Lucy. They liked playing together all day. One day after they had finished playing, they decided to discuss what they wanted to have for lunch. 
John wanted to have soup, but Lucy thought that it sounded too hot for lunch. Instead, she suggested to have a salad. John thought about it for a minute and then agreed. 
While they were discussing, Lucy began to feel a bit dizzy. She looked very pale, so John said that she should sit down for a moment and have some water. Once Lucy had a drink of water, she felt much better and was ready to eat lunch. 
John and Lucy sat down together and enjoyed their salad. They had so much fun as they chatted and ate lunch together. It was a delicious lunch and when they were done, they were feeling happy and much less dizzy.
