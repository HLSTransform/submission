Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to make pictures with his crayons. He would draw animals, trees, and even his family.
One day, Timmy was drawing a picture of his mom when his little sister came in. She wanted to play with Timmy's crayons, but he said no. "Please be gentle with my crayons," Timmy said.
But his sister didn't listen. She grabbed the crayons and started scribbling all over Timmy's picture. Timmy was very upset. "Why did you do that?" he asked.
His sister just laughed and ran away. Timmy was so sad that he tore up his picture. He didn't want to draw anymore. From that day on, Timmy's sister always made him feel bad about his drawings.
