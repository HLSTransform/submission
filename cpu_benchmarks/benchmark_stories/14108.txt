Once there was a clever turtle named Tate. Tate wanted to find a place to heal his wounds. 
He looked everywhere and he couldn't find the perfect spot. Finally, he found the perfect place under a giant tree. The tree had lots of leaves and branches. Tate curled up and began to heal. 
The sun shone brightly and Tate quickly began to feel better. He felt the warm sun healing his wounds and making him strong. Soon, Tate was back to his old self and felt happy. 
The clever turtle was glad he found a place to heal. It was just perfect for him. Tate thanked the tree for giving him a place to heal and he promised to come back soon.
