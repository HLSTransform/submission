Once upon a time there was a little boy who loved to play outside when it rained. One day, it was raining outside, so the little boy put on his raincoat and set out to go play. He saw a friend who was standing next to a big bag. 
"What have you got in your bag?" asked the little boy.
"Some delicious apples!" smiled the friend. 
The little boy was so excited he grabbed the bag and started running around, playing with the apples. But the rain started pouring heavier and the bag started to tear. 
The little boy's friend became very sad and shouted at him, "You should share the apples with everyone, not just keep them for yourself!"
The little boy learnt that if he wants to keep his things safe he must share them with others and not take things that don't belong to him. 
The end.
