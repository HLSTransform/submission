Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack. Jack had a wife named Jill. Jill was a very nice wife. One day, Jack went to the store and bought a big marker. He wanted to mark his things so no one would take them. 
When Jack came back home, he saw that his wife had been very naughty. She had taken his favorite toy and hidden it. Jack was very upset and asked his wife, "Why did you take my toy? That was very naughty of you." 
Jill felt bad and said, "I'm sorry, Jack. I just wanted to play a game with you." Jack forgave his wife and they played together with the toy. Jack marked the toy with his new marker so they would always know it was theirs. And they lived happily ever after. The end.
