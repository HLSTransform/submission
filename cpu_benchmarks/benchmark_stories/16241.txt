Billy was three years old and he loved to pretend. He was pretending to be a pirate and he had a tough sword made of cardboard. Suddenly, he saw something shiny on the ground. It was a grape! He bent down and picked it up. "Ahoy, me hearties! I found me booty," he said excitedly.
Billy ran over to his friend Annie and threw the grape to her. "Let's pretend to split it," he said.
Annie smiled and nodded. She picked up the grape and pretended to break it in half. Billy pretended to do the same. Then, they both pretended to chew on their half of the grape.
"This pretend grape tastes so yummy," said Annie.
"It sure does," said Billy.
They both smiled and hugged each other. Then, they both continued their pretend pirate adventures.
