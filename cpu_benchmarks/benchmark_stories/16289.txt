Once upon a time, there was a lazy little dog. His name was Bob. Bob was very friendly, but he was so lazy he never wanted to do anything.
One day, Bob wanted to watch his favorite cartoon. He grabbed the remote and turned on the television.
Bob laid down on the couch and said, "This is going to be great!" Then he started to watch the cartoon.
Suddenly, Bob heard a voice behind him. It was his mom. She said, "Bob, why are you being so lazy?"
Bob answered with a grin, "Mom, I am just watching my cartoon. It's really fun!"
His mom smiled and said, "Well, I guess it's ok if you want to watch cartoons, but don't be too lazy, ok?"
Bob replied, "Ok mom, I won't be lazy! I promise!" And he continued to watch his favorite cartoon.
