Once upon a time, there was a little tree with deep roots. The tree lived in a forest with many other trees. One day, a big storm came and the wind was very strong. The little tree tried to resist the wind, but it was too strong. The wind blew and blew, and the little tree started to shake. But the little tree had deep roots, so it did not fall down like some of the other trees. When the storm was over, the little tree was still standing tall and strong, thanks to its deep roots.
