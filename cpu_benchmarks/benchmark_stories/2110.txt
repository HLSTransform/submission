Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park to play. While she was there, she saw a brown dog. The dog looked very friendly, so Lily went to meet him. 
But then, out of nowhere, a big, mean cat appeared! The cat didn't like the dog and started to chase him around. Lily didn't want the dog to get hurt, so she picked up a prune from the ground and threw it at the cat. The cat got scared and ran away.
Lily and the brown dog became friends and played together all day. They had so much fun that Lily forgot about the mean cat. From that day on, Lily would often go to the park to meet her new friend, the brown dog.
