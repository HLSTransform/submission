One day there were two friends, Max and Molly, who were playing outside. Max was playing with his toy car and Molly was spinning around in circles.
Max said to Molly, "Let's tell a joke! I know one that is pretty funny."
Molly said, "Okay, let me hear it!"
Max said, "Why did the elephant measure the window? Because he wanted it to be pretty!"
Molly laughed and said, "That was a good joke, Max!" 
Then they went back to playing with their toys. They had lots of fun playing and laughing together.
