Once upon a time, there was a nice man who had a red shirt. He liked to wear his shirt when he went outside to play. One day, he saw a little girl who was sad because she lost her ball. The man wanted to help her, so he gently asked her where she last saw it. She said she thought she saw it pass by the tree. The man looked and found the ball! The little girl was happy and gave the man a big hug. He smiled and went back to his house, feeling good that he could help.
