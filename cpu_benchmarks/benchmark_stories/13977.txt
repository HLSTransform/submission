Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore. One day, she met a friendly dog named Max. Max was very young and loved to play too.
Lily and Max played together every day. They ran and jumped and learned new things. Lily learned how to throw a ball and Max learned how to fetch it back. They had so much fun together.
One day, Lily's mom called her inside for lunch. "Who is your new friend?" her mom asked. "His name is Max and he is a young dog," Lily replied. "He is so much fun to play with and we learn new things every day."
Lily's mom was happy to see her daughter having fun and making new friends. From that day on, Lily and Max played together every day and learned new things together. They were the best of friends.
