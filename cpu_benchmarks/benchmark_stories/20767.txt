Once upon a time there was a little boy. He wanted to watch a movie. The movie was open in the box. 
The little boy was so excited! He couldnâ€™t wait to watch it. He popped in the movie and the pictures began to move. Suddenly, the movie started to rot. It made a funny sound and the pictures were all smudgy. 
The little boy was very sad. He wanted to watch the movie so badly. He put the movie away and went outside to play. 
In the end, the little boy was still sad. But he knew that sometimes things can rot and nothing can be done about it. He decided not to be sad anymore and to just keep playing. He had lots of fun that day.
