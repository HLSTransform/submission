Jake loved to jog. Every morning, he woke up and put on his running shoes. Then he would run around the park. One day, he saw something disgusting on the ground. It was too much for him to handle, so he quit jogging.
He tried to find something else to do, but nothing worked out. He was sad because he missed his daily jog. He asked his mom if he could go back to his jog.
His mom thought that was a great idea. She told Jake he could jog, but warned him to be careful. She said he should stay away from anything that looked disgusting.
So Jake started to jog again. Each morning, he put on his running shoes and went on his daily jog. Jake made sure he stayed away from anything that seemed disgusting. He liked that he could get his morning jog in each day.
