Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny was very lonely because he didn't have any friends to play with. One day, Benny went to the forest to find some new friends. He saw a bird, a squirrel, and a deer. But they all ran away when they saw Benny. Benny felt very sad and lonely.
Suddenly, Benny saw a big carrot sticking out of the ground. He took a bite and it tasted very good. Benny ate the whole carrot and felt happy. Then, Benny saw a message on a tree that said, "Hello Benny, let's be friends!" Benny was so happy and he followed the message to find his new friend. They played together and had lots of fun. Benny wasn't lonely anymore.
