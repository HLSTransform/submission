Once upon a time, there was a mommy and her daughter. The mommy had a pretty dress, but the daughter had a modest one. The mommy said, "Let's go for a walk!" The daughter replied, "Can we go to the park?" The mommy said, "Yes, let's go to the park!"
When they got to the park, the daughter saw a big puddle. She stepped in it and got her dress wet. The mommy said, "Oh no! Let's go home and change your dress." The daughter said, "Okay, mommy."
At home, the mommy gave the daughter a new dress. It was just as pretty as the mommy's dress! The daughter said, "Thank you, mommy. I love my new dress." The mommy said, "You're welcome, daughter. I love you." The daughter said, "I love you too, mommy." And they hugged.
