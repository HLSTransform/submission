Jane lived in a big house. She wanted to get stronger and healthier, so she started doing yoga. Jane was uncomfortable at first. She was stiff and found it hard to do some of the moves. But every day she tried her best and little by little she started to improve.
Her arms and legs got stronger and she could finally do all the poses. Her balance also improved. Jane felt so happy. She was proud because she had achieved so much.
At the end of each week, Jane did her favourite yoga pose. She was so happy with her progress and glad she took the time to do yoga every day. Now days, Jane's yoga is so good that everyone in her family wants to join her!
