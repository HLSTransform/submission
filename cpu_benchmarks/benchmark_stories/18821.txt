Sara and Ben liked to play in the park. They liked to slide, swing, and run. One day, they saw a big pile of ash near a bench. It was dry and black.
"What is this?" Sara asked.
"I don't know. Maybe it is dirt," Ben said.
"Let's play with it. It looks fun," Sara said.
She took a stick and poked the ash. It made a cloud of dust. She coughed and rubbed her eyes.
"Ow, it hurts!" she cried.
Ben tried to help her. He gave her his water bottle. She drank some and washed her face.
"Are you okay?" he asked.
"I think so. But the ash is not fun. It is bad," she said.
They heard a voice behind them. It was a man in a uniform. He had a hose and a helmet.
"Hey, kids, what are you doing here? This is not a place to play. This is the remains of a fire. It is dangerous and dirty. You could get hurt or sick," he said.
He sprayed some water on the ash. It made a hissing sound.
"Sorry, sir. We didn't know. We were curious," Ben said.
"Curiosity is good, but you have to be careful. Always ask an adult before you touch something you don't know. And stay away from fire and ash. They can burn and harm you," he said.
He led them to their parents, who were waiting for them. They hugged them and checked them.
"We're sorry, mom and dad. We learned our lesson. We won't play with ash again," Sara and Ben said.
"That's good, kids. We're glad you're safe. And we're proud of you for telling the truth and apologizing. Now let's go home and have some ice cream," their parents said.
They smiled and followed them. They were happy and grateful. They learned to be careful and respectful. And they still liked to play in the park. But not with ash.
