Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big yellow truck. The truck has a long arm and a big bucket. The truck can dig and move dirt.
"Wow, look at the truck!" Lily says. "It is so big and yellow. I want to see it up close."
"Me too," Ben says. "Maybe we can ask the driver if we can sit in the truck. That would be fun."
They run to the truck and wait for the driver to stop. The driver is a nice man. He smiles at them and says, "Hello, kids. Do you like my truck?"
"Yes, we do," Lily and Ben say. "Your truck is very useful. It can do many things."
"Thank you," the driver says. "My truck is my friend. It helps me with my work. Do you want to see how it works?"
"Yes, please," Lily and Ben say.
The driver lets them sit in the truck. He shows them how to use the arm and the bucket. He lets them dig and move some dirt. Lily and Ben are very happy. They feel like they are driving the truck.
"Thank you, mister," Lily and Ben say. "This is the best day ever. We hope you have a good day too."
"You're welcome, kids," the driver says. "I'm glad you enjoyed the truck. You are very polite and curious. I hope you have a good day too."
Lily and Ben wave goodbye to the driver and the truck. They run back to the park. They tell their friends about the truck. They say it is big and yellow and useful. They hope they can see it again.
