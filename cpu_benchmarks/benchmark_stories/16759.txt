Lily liked to play with her toy fish. She had a big fish and a small fish. The big fish was blue and the small fish was yellow. They were her friends.
One day, Lily saw a real fish in a bowl. It was on the table in the kitchen. It was orange and shiny. Lily wanted to touch it. She climbed on a chair and reached for the bowl.
But the bowl was too heavy for Lily. It slipped from her hands and fell on the floor. The water splashed everywhere. The fish flopped on the tiles. Lily was scared. She cried.
Mommy heard the noise and came to the kitchen. She saw the mess and the fish. She was angry. She picked up the fish and put it back in the bowl. She gave Lily a towel and told her to dry the floor.
Mommy said, "Lily, you should not touch the fish. The fish is not a toy. The fish is alive. It needs water to breathe. You could have hurt the fish. You have to be careful."
Lily said, "I'm sorry, Mommy. I just wanted to see the fish. It was so beautiful. It reminded me of my toy fish. But my toy fish are not alive. They don't need water. They don't have scales."
Mommy said, "I know, Lily. The fish is beautiful. But it is different from your toy fish. It has scales that make it shiny. Scales are like tiny plates that cover the fish's skin. They protect the fish from dirt and germs. They also help the fish swim faster. Your toy fish don't have scales. They are made of plastic. They are soft and smooth."
Lily said, "Oh, I see. Scales are good for the fish. But not for me. They are hard and prickly. They hurt my fingers. I don't like scales. I like my toy fish better. Can I play with them now?"
Mommy said, "Yes, you can. But first, you have to finish drying the floor. And then, you have to say sorry to the fish. And then, you have to promise me that you will never touch the fish again. Do you understand?"
Lily said, "Yes, Mommy. I understand. I'm sorry, fish. I won't touch you again. You are beautiful, but you are not my friend. You are Mommy's friend. My friends are my toy fish. They are blue and yellow. And they don't have scales."
