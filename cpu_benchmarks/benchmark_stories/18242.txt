Once upon a time, there was a soldier. He wore a big hat and a pink shirt. He was very brave and strong, but sometimes he felt scared.
One day, the soldier was walking in the forest when he heard a loud noise. He looked around and saw a big bear! The soldier felt scared and didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, he heard a little voice say, "Don't be scared, soldier. I will comfort you." It was a little girl with a pink dress. She hugged the soldier and he felt better.
The soldier and the little girl became friends and walked together in the forest. They saw many animals, but the soldier was not scared anymore. He knew that his new friend would always be there to comfort him.
