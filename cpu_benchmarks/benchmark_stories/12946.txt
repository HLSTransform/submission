Once upon a time there was a nice lady called Marie. She wanted to help all the children in her neighborhood. One day, she saw a little girl who was in trouble. The little girl was stuck under the big slide in the playground. Marie came over to the slide and smiled at the little girl. She tried to lift the slide up so the little girl could get out but it was too heavy. 
Marie then asked some of the other children in the playground if they could help. One brave boy stepped forward and said he would help. He and Marie worked together to lift up the slide, and soon the little girl was free. 
The little girl thanked Marie and the boy for their help. But then a rude man came over and started shouting loudly. He said "What are you children doing? You should have asked me for help!" But Marie told him it was okay, because the nice boy and she had helped the little girl. The rude man turned around and walked away.
The little girl's mom arrived soon after and thanked Marie and the boy for their help. She said "You were both so kind. Thank you for helping my little girl." Marie smiled, she was happy to help.
