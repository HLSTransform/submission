Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She had a favorite pillow. She loved her pillow very much. Every night, she would hug her pillow tight and go to sleep.
One day, Amy's pillow was dead. It was old and flat. She was very sad. She told her mom and dad about her dead pillow. They wanted to make Amy happy again.
Amy's mom and dad had an idea. They went to the store and got a new pillow for her. Then, they gave it to her as a gift. Amy was so happy to receive a new pillow. She hugged it tight and went to sleep with a big smile on her face. And they all lived happily ever after.
