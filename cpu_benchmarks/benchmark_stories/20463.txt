Once there was a big, blue ocean. In the ocean, there was so many things. One of the things was jellyfish. The jellyfish were so thick and many.
One day, the jellyfish wanted to separate. They wanted to find different parts of the ocean. So, they decided to take two paths. One path was big, the other path was small.
The small jellyfish went one way and the big jellyfish went the other. After separating, the jellyfish couldn't see each other any more. But, the jellyfish felt happy because they could explore the ocean. 
The jellyfish had so much fun in the ocean. And the jellyfish were still friends, even when they couldn't see each other.
