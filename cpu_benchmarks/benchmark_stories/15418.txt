Jill was chubby but she loved math. She was very good at it, but sometimes she made mistakes. When she did, her mom would punish her. Even though it was hard, Jill kept trying her best to get better. 
One day, Jill wanted to prove to her mom that she had learned her lesson. She worked really hard and was really careful not to make any mistakes. When her mom checked her work, she was so proud! 
Even though her mom was still strict, Jill was happy that she had succeeded at math and made her mom happy. From then on, she was careful to always follow the rules and tried even harder to get better and better at math. 
Jill's hard work eventually paid off and her mom was so proud! From then on, she was rarely punished for her math mistakes - even though she was still chubby!
