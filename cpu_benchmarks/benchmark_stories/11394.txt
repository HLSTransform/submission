Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was very happy and loved to play outside.
One day she ran in the fields and saw a big yellow flower. She wanted to pick it so she put it in her pocket.
Suddenly the little girl felt a pain in her back. She tried to rest, but the pain wouldn't go away.
The little girl said, "Mama, my back hurts." Her mama said, "Let's go see the doctor."
The doctor looked at the little girl and said, "I'm sorry, but the yellow flower you picked is full of poisonous thorns. You have to stay in bed and rest for a few days."
The little girl was sad, but she did what the doctor said and stayed in bed. Gradually the pain went away, but she never picked yellow flowers again.
