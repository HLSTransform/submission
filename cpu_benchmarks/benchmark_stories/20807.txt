Once upon a time, there were two friends having a picnic. The first friend called the second one over. She said, "Come and try my sausage, it's so yummy!" 
The second friend tried the sausage, but she made a funny face. She said, "Your sausage tastes bad." The first friend was very sad. 
The first friend started to cry. She said, "But I made this sausage myself!" 
The second friend comforted her. She said, "It's okay. Let's go get something different to eat." 
The two friends went out and got something tasty. They laughed and smiled and had fun. They forgot all about the bad sausage.
