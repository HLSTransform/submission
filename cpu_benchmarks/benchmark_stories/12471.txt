Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the pool. Lily can swim very well. Ben is learning to swim. He is persistent. He tries hard every day.
One day, Lily and Ben see a big piece of cheese floating in the pool. They are curious. They want to taste it. They swim towards it.
"Who put cheese in the pool?" Lily asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it fell from the sky," Ben says.
They reach the cheese. They take a bite. It is not cheese. It is soap. It tastes bad. They spit it out.
"Yuck! This is not cheese. This is soap. It makes bubbles in my mouth," Lily says.
"Me too. It is icky. Let's throw it away," Ben says.
They throw the soap out of the pool. They rinse their mouths with water. They laugh.
"That was a silly cheese. It tricked us," Lily says.
"Yes, it did. But we are smart. We know cheese is not soap," Ben says.
They swim away. They have fun. They are happy.
