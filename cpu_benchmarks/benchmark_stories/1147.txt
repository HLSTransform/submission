Once, there was a small bug. It was an unusual bug. It could change its size. One day, it was playing near a tree.
The bug saw a big ant. The ant was sad. It could not get food from the tree. The bug wanted to help the ant. So, it changed its size. It became one inch long.
Now, the bug and the ant could get the food. They were happy. They played and ate together. The unusual bug and the ant became good friends.
