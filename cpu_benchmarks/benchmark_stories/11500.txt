One day, a little boy named Tim went to the store with his mom. They needed to buy some food for dinner. Tim saw some weird looking beef. He pointed at it and said, "Mom, what is that?"
His mom looked at it and said, "That is beef, Tim. But it looks a little weird. Let's get some other beef instead." They picked out some good beef and put it in their cart.
As they walked through the store, Tim saw a man trying to balance a lot of boxes on his head. The man looked like he was having a hard time. Tim wanted to help, but his mom said it might not be safe.
Suddenly, the man lost his balance and the boxes fell all around him. Everyone in the store stopped and looked. Tim's mom went to help the man pick up the boxes. Tim felt happy that his mom was helping, and they all worked together to fix the problem.
