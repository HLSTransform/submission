Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a girl named Lily. Lily loved to care for her rare pet, a small bird named Blue. Blue was very special because he could talk.
One sunny day, Blue had a message for Lily. He said, "Lily, I found a big tree with yummy fruit!" Lily was very happy and said, "Let's go find the tree and eat the fruit!"
Lily and Blue went outside and found the big tree. They picked the yummy fruit and shared it with their friends. Everyone was happy and loved the rare fruit. Lily and Blue cared for each other and had a fun day.
