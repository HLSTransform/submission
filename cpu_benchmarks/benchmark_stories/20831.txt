"Mommy, look at me!" shouted Josh. He was wearing a bright yellow t-shirt, a pair of blue shorts, and a big smile. His mom smiled back and said, "You look so handsome, Josh!"
Josh ran to the kitchen, looking for a snack. He found some butter on the table and quickly scooped some onto his finger. He licked it off with delight as he began dancing around the kitchen.
Suddenly, an unknown sound interrupted his fun. Josh stopped, listened, and ran to the living room. There, he found a small brown creature wearing a white hat. Josh was frightened and asked, "Who are you?"
The creature smiled and said, "My name is Dooley. I'm just here to bring you a special surprise." Josh was still unsure and asked, "What is it?"
"It's a new toy!" Dooley said cheerfully. Josh smiled and put it on. It was an unknown but exciting item, and Josh couldn't wait to try it out. He thanked Dooley and ran outside with his new toy, while Dooley disappeared as quickly as he had appeared.
