One day, a little girl named Lucy went outside to play. She saw a huge cloud in the sky. The cloud was big and white, like a fluffy pillow. Lucy thought it was very pretty.
Lucy wanted to tell her friend, Max, about the huge cloud. She ran to his house and knocked on the door. Max came outside, and Lucy said, "Look, Max! A huge cloud!" Max looked up and saw the cloud too. He thought it was pretty as well.
Together, Lucy and Max laid on the grass and watched the huge cloud. They talked about what the cloud looked like. Lucy thought it looked like a big bunny, while Max thought it looked like a giant teddy bear. They laughed and played until the cloud floated away.
