Once upon a time, there was a tiny mouse who enjoyed exploring. One day, he decided to climb up the roof of his house. He felt so excited - it was higher than he had ever been before!
On the roof, he discovered something incredible; a gigantic bowl of yummy treats. He couldn't believe his eyes! He scrambled over to the bowl and peeked inside. All sorts of delicious sweet and savory snacks lay inside.
The mouse was hungry, so he decided to have a taste of one treat. He bit into a soft, chewy caramel and it was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted. He helped himself to many more treats before heading back to his home.
The mouse kept visiting the roof every day to enjoy the incredible treats. He was happy and content, but he was sure to take only a few each time - after all, sharing is caring!
