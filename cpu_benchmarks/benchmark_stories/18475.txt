Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to climb up and down the stairs in her house. One day, she was climbing up the stairs when she saw her mom's phone on the top step. She tried to reach it, but she slipped and fell down the stairs. 
Lily cried out for her mom, who came running to help. Her mom asked, "Are you hurt?" Lily replied, "Yes, my leg hurts." Her mom was very helpful and took her to the hospital. 
At the hospital, the doctor said that Lily's leg was broken and she would need a cast. Lily was sad because she would not be able to climb the stairs anymore. Her mom said, "Don't worry, we will take care of you." 
But when they got home, Lily saw that her mom's phone was not there anymore. She asked her mom, "Where is your phone?" Her mom replied, "I don't know, I think I lost it." Lily was sad because she knew her mom loved her phone very much. She wished she had never tried to climb the stairs and own her mom's phone.
