Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play with engines. They had many toy engines of different colors and sizes. They liked to make them go fast and make loud noises.
One day, they found a big engine in the garage. It was black and shiny and had many buttons and wires. Lily and Tom were curious and wanted to play with it.
"Let's see what this engine can do!" Tom said. He climbed on the engine and started to push the buttons.
"No, Tom, don't!" Lily said. She was anxious and scared. She knew the engine was not a toy and could be dangerous. "We should ask dad first!"
But Tom did not listen. He pushed more buttons and pulled some wires. The engine started to make strange sounds and smoke. Lily and Tom felt the engine shake and tremble.
"Help! Help!" they cried. They tried to get off the engine, but it was too late. The engine exploded with a loud bang. Lily and Tom were hurt by the fire and the metal. They screamed and cried.
Dad heard the noise and ran to the garage. He saw the engine in flames and his children on the ground. He was angry and sad. He called the ambulance and the firemen. He hugged Lily and Tom and said, "Why did you play with the engine? You could have died! You should have listened to Lily and asked me first!"
Lily and Tom were sorry and ashamed. They learned a hard lesson. They should never play with things they don't know. They should always be careful and obey their parents.
