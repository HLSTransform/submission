Lily and Ben are playing with their toys. They have many shapes: circles, squares, triangles and stars. They like to zip them together and make different things.
"Look, I made a house!" Lily says, showing Ben her shape house. It has a square for the floor, four triangles for the walls and a star for the roof.
"That's nice, Lily. But I made a rocket!" Ben says, showing Lily his shape rocket. It has a circle for the base, a long triangle for the body and a star for the tip.
They both think their shapes are very cool. They want to show them to their dad. He is in the kitchen, making lunch. He is bald and has a big smile.
"Dad, dad, look what we made!" Lily and Ben say, running to the kitchen with their shapes.
"Wow, those are amazing!" Dad says, looking at their shapes. "You are very clever and creative. I love your house and your rocket."
He gives them a hug and a kiss. Then he says, "Lunch is ready. Do you want to zip your shapes together and make a big shape?"
"Yes, yes!" Lily and Ben say, excited. They zip their shapes together and make a big shape. It looks like a house with a rocket on top.
They laugh and clap. They think it is the best shape ever. They take it to the table and eat their lunch with their dad. They are very happy.
