Once there was a man named Crystal. He was a very fine man and everyone liked him very much. One day Crystal went to the park to relax. He was enjoying the peaceful day and looking at the birds when suddenly he heard a loud cry from the other side of the park. He went to see what was wrong and he saw a boy crying and very upset. Crystal asked the boy what had happened and the boy said that his balloon had been taken away by the wind. Crystal felt very sorry for the boy and so he decided to cheer him up by giving him a new balloon. The boy was so happy and thanked Crystal for his kind act. He felt very fine and hugged Crystal. From that day onwards, Crystal thought of the boy and wished him all the best.
