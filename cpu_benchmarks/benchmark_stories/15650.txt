Once upon a time there was a mom and a dad and their daughter. The mom and dad decided to take their daughter to the park. They were so excited to show her the fun they could have.
They arrived at the park and the daughter was ecstatic! She ran around, jumping and laughing. The parents watched her with smiles on their faces.
Mom said, "Let's pass the ball together!" The daughter grabbed it and quickly passed it to dad. He passed it back and she giggled with excitement. They continued to pass the ball for a few minutes. 
"Do you have fun, daughter?" Dad asked. 
"Yes, so much fun!" She replied enthusiastically. 
The mom and dad hugged their daughter and thanked her for being such a joy. They spent the rest of their time at the park happily playing together.
