Once upon a time, there was a queen who lived in a big castle. She was very kind and loved to help people. One day, she met a little girl named Lily. Lily was sad because she lost her toy bunny. 
The queen asked Lily, "What's wrong?" 
"I lost my bunny," said Lily. 
"Don't worry, we'll find it together," said the queen. 
So, they looked everywhere for the bunny. They searched high and low, and finally, they found it! 
Lily was so happy that she hugged the queen. "Thank you for helping me," said Lily. 
"You're welcome. It's always good to unite and help each other," said the queen. 
Lily smiled and said, "You're so fit to be a queen!"
