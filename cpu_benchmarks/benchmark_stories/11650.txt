Once upon a time there was a clever dog. He lived in a big house with his loving family. The family all loved him very much and he was always eager to show them his tricks. 
One night, the family was going camping and they invited the dog along. The dog was very excited to join them and he could hardly wait.
When they got to the campsite, the dog noticed a warm, glowing fire. He was tempted by it and cautiously approached. However, he soon realised it was too hot and quickly backed away.
The family saw what he was trying to do and laughed. They draped a blanket over the fire to make it safe and one of them said, "Welcome, friend! You are so clever to be so careful!" 
The dog was very happy that the family was happy with him, and the family all snuggled around the warm fire and shared stories until bedtime.
