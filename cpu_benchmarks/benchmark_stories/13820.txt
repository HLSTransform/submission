Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big truck with a picture of a cow on it. The truck has a window and a man gives out cream in cups. The cream is cold and sweet.
"Can we have some cream, please?" Tom and Mia ask the man.
"Sure, kids. Here you go. Enjoy your ice cream," the man says and smiles.
Tom and Mia take their cups and sit on a bench. They lick their cream and make funny faces. They laugh and have fun.
But then, a big dog comes by. The dog is hungry and smells the cream. The dog jumps on the bench and tries to get the cream from Tom and Mia.
"Hey, stop that! Bad dog!" Tom and Mia shout and try to hold their cups away from the dog.
But the dog is too fast and strong. He knocks over the cups and eats the cream. Tom and Mia are sad and angry. They cry and yell at the dog.
The man in the truck sees what happens. He feels sorry for Tom and Mia. He comes over and gives them new cups of cream.
"Here, kids. Don't cry. Have some more ice cream. And don't worry about the dog. He won't bother you again," the man says and chases the dog away.
Tom and Mia smile and thank the man. They lick their new cream and feel better. They laugh and have fun again.
