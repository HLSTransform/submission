Tim and Sam are brothers. They like to watch television after school. But today, the television is not available. Mom says it is broken. She says it burned in a storm. Tim and Sam are sad and bored.
They go to their room and look for something to play with. They find some crayons and paper. They start to draw pictures of their favorite shows. Tim draws a superhero. Sam draws a dinosaur. They show each other their drawings and pretend to act like them.
"Look, I am Super Tim! I can fly and save the world!" Tim says. He jumps on the bed and makes flying noises.
"Roar, I am Dino Sam! I can run and eat everything!" Sam says. He crawls on the floor and makes biting noises.
They have fun playing together. They forget about the television. They make up their own stories and adventures. Mom hears them laughing and smiles. She is happy that they are using their imagination. She thinks they are very creative and clever. She hopes the television will be fixed soon, but she also hopes they will keep playing like this.
