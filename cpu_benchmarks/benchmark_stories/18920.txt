Tom is a normal boy. He likes to play with his toys and his dog. He has a big red ball that he can kick and throw. He likes to give his ball to his dog and watch him run after it.
One day, Tom and his dog go to the park. They see a girl with a yellow dress and a blue bike. The girl is very quick on her bike. She can go up and down the hills and around the trees. Tom thinks she is cool.
Tom wants to be friends with the girl. He thinks maybe she will like his ball. He runs to her and says, "Hi, I am Tom. This is my ball. Do you want to play with it?" He gives his ball to the girl.
The girl smiles and says, "Hi, I am Mia. Thank you for your ball. It is very nice. Do you want to try my bike?" She gives her bike to Tom.
Tom is happy and surprised. He has never ridden a bike before. He tries to get on the bike, but it is too big for him. He falls down and hurts his knee. He cries.
Mia runs to him and says, "I am sorry, Tom. Are you okay? Here, take your ball back. It is better for you. And here, have a hug. It will make you feel better." She gives him his ball and a hug.
Tom stops crying and smiles. He says, "Thank you, Mia. You are very kind. I like you. Do you want to be my friend?"
Mia says, "Yes, Tom. I like you too. You are very brave. Do you want to play with me and my bike? I can teach you how to ride it."
Tom says, "Yes, Mia. I want to play with you and your bike. You can teach me how to ride it. And I can teach you how to throw my ball. We can have fun together."
Tom and Mia become friends. They play with the ball and the bike. They share and give and learn. They are normal and quick and happy.
