Once upon a time there was an ancient house. Every night, the house would make scary noises. The noises would make the little girl who lived in the house very scared.
One night, something even more scary happened. The little girl's brother came into the room. He held a pair of scissors in his hand. He shook them and said, "I'm going to scare you!"
The little girl was very scared. She was so scared that she couldn't move.
But then, something amazing happened. The girl's mom came into the room and said, "Stop that! You don't need to scare your sister!" Her brother put the scissors down and returned to his room.
The little girl felt relieved and safe. A few moments later, the house became quiet. The little girl felt better and soon was able to sleep.
