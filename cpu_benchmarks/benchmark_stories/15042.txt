Once upon a time there was an old man who would take photos of the world around him.
He wanted to make sure he captured every special moment and memory.
One day as he was walking down the street he spotted a little girl, who was only three years old.
The old man smiled but the little girl just frowned.
The old man said, “What’s wrong? Didn’t you like the photo I took?”
The little girl shook her head and said, “No. I don’t like the old camera you used.”
The old man was surprised.
He said, “But don’t you think memories are more important than the camera used to take the photo?”
The little girl thought for a moment and then smiled.
She said, “Yes, I think memories are way more important.”
The old man smiled back and they both went on their way.
The moral of the story is that memories are more important than the things we use to capture them.
