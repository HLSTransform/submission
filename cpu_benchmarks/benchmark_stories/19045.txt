Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pet cat named Mittens. Every day, Lily would feed Mittens some yummy cat food. 
One day, Lily saw an ambulance driving down the street. She wondered where it was going. Her mom told her that sometimes when people get hurt or sick, the ambulance takes them to the hospital. 
Later that day, Lily and Mittens were playing in the yard when they saw an ordinary bird fly by. Mittens tried to catch the bird, but it flew away too fast. Lily giggled and said, "Silly Mittens, you can't catch a bird!"
