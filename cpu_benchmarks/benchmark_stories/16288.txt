Once upon a time, there was a very big tree with many branches and leaves. One day, a little bird named Tweety, who was very small, hopped onto one of the branches. She looked around and noticed a row of other birds perched on the branch. The other birds had sharp beaks and seemed to be looking at Tweety in a very strange way. 
Tweety asked them what was going on, but the other birds just kept quiet. Tweety hopped a bit closer and asked again. The birds replied, “We are trying to find out who is the most ignorant here.” Tweety was so shocked that she hopped away quickly. 
The moral of the story is that it's not wise to compare yourself to others. We don't know the full story of someone else's life, so it's not fair to judge them. Being too ignorant can make us miss important opportunities and lessons in life.
