Tim and Sam are friends. They like to jog in the park. They jog fast and slow. They jog up and down. They jog with their dog, Rex.
One day, they see a big man with a notebook. He is sitting on a bench. He is writing in his notebook. He looks angry and harsh.
"Hello, mister," Tim says. "What are you writing?"
The big man does not look at Tim. He says, "Go away, kid. I am busy. I am writing a very important report. You are making noise. You are bothering me."
Sam does not like the big man. He says, "You are rude, mister. You are not nice. You should be kind. You should share your notebook. Maybe we can help you with your report."
The big man laughs. He says, "Help me? You are just kids. You know nothing. You can only jog and play. You cannot write. You cannot read. You cannot think. You are silly. You are stupid. You are useless."
Tim and Sam are sad and angry. They do not like the big man. They do not like his words. They think he is mean and wrong. They want to show him they are smart and useful.
They have an idea. They jog to the big man. They grab his notebook. They run away with it. They jog fast and far. They jog with their dog, Rex.
The big man is shocked and mad. He shouts, "Hey, stop! Give me back my notebook! That is mine! That is my report! Come back here, you little thieves!"
But Tim and Sam do not stop. They do not listen. They jog and jog. They find a nice spot. They sit down. They open the notebook. They look at the report.
They do not understand the report. They see many big words. They see many numbers. They see many lines and shapes. They think the report is boring and hard.
They have another idea. They take out their crayons. They draw on the report. They draw happy faces and flowers. They draw stars and hearts. They draw Rex and themselves. They think the report is fun and easy.
They are proud of their work. They smile and hug. They say, "We are smart, mister. We are useful. We can write. We can read. We can think. We are not silly. We are not stupid. We are not useless. We are joggers and artists. We are friends."
