Once, there was a small girl. She had two ears, but she never listened.
One day, she was playing outside, and saw a big rock. She wanted to push it, so she did.
But even though she was pushing and pushing, the rock didn't move. So the small girl kept pushing and pushing, but the rock still didn't move.
The girl's mom caled out to her, "What are you doing?"
The girl replied, "I'm pushing this rock!"
The mom said, "Listen to me, sweetheart. You can push and push, but if you don't listen, you won't succeed. Sometimes, you have to stop pushing and start listening."
The small girl listened to her mom, and sure enough, the rock moved!
The moral of the story is that if you listen, you can succeed. Listening is just as important as pushing!
