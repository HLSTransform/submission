Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lisa. She was very smart. Lisa loved to go to fun events with her friends. One day, she heard about a big event at the park. She was very excited.
At the event, there were many games and treats. Lisa and her friends played together. They laughed and had a great time. Suddenly, a little boy named Timmy came up to them. He was wearing a scary mask. "Boo!" he shouted.
Lisa and her friends jumped. They were scared at first. But then, they saw it was just Timmy. They all laughed together. "You scared us, Timmy!" said Lisa. "But it was funny."
After that, they all played more games and ate yummy treats. The event was a lot of fun. Lisa, her friends, and Timmy had a great day at the park. They all went home very happy.
