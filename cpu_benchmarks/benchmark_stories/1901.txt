Mama and Papa took Sarah to the fireplace, and Sarah was excited. She had never been to the fireplace before. Mama and Papa picked up some wood and put it in the fireplace. Sarah said, "Wow!" 
Then Mama lit a match and she lit the wood in the fireplace, and a fire began to burn. Sarah was so amazed! She said, "Look! Fire!" Papa said, "Remember, Sarah, to never touch the fire." 
Next, Sarah and Mama and Papa sat together in front of the fireplace, and they toasted marshmallows. They put them on a stick and held them near the fire, and when they were golden brown, Mama and Papa put the marshmallows in a bowl with some spicy sauce. Sarah smiled, and it made Mama and Papa laugh. 
Suddenly, Mama reached for Sarah's hand and gave it a squeeze to remind her of how hot the fire was. Sarah smiled and said, "I remember!"
