Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a purple cat. The cat had a big friend, a dog. They liked to play together every day. They ran, they jumped, and they had a lot of fun.
One day, the dog found a shiny coin. He did not know what it was, but he knew it had value. He showed the coin to the purple cat. The cat looked at the coin and nodded. They decided to keep the coin and call it their special treasure.
The purple cat and the dog hid the coin under a big tree. They played near the tree every day to make sure their treasure was safe. They had many happy days together, always remembering the value of their special coin and their friendship.
