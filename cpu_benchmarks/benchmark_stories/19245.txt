Once upon a time there was a very hungry little girl. She had been walking all day and was looking for something to eat. All of a sudden she saw something yummy in the grass. She leaned down and picked up a penny. It was shining in the sun, so she knew she could buy something yummy with the penny. 
The little girl went to the store and found some candy that looked yummy. She paid with the penny and the storekeeper gave her a bag of candy. She was so excited and hurried out of the store.
She opened the bag of candy and it was delicious. She leaned back against a tree and enjoyed the yummy candy. She was so content and happy that she stayed in the same spot for a long time. 
When she was done with the candy, she gathered her things and went on her way. She still had the penny in her pocket, and it reminded her of the yummy candy that she got with it.
