Susie and Sam were best friends. Every day after school, they would go to Susie's house and talk. Their favorite thing to do was to play pretend. 
At Susie's house there was a big old chest. It was a dark brown color and was very strong. Susie and Sam would open the chest and put their pretend treasures inside. Then they would lock it up tight. 
One day, Susie and Sam decided to show their friends the chest. They all gathered around and were amazed by its size and strength. 
Finally, they decided to open it. Inside, they found a ton of fine toys. Susie and Sam were so proud and began showing off the chest and its fine toys. For the rest of the day, the kids could be heard talking and laughing as they played.
