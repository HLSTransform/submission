Once upon a time, there was a lady who could fly. She had big wings like a bird. One day, she saw a small boy being mean to a cat. The boy was terrible, and the cat was sad.
The lady flew down and told the boy, "Being terrible is not nice. It makes others sad." The boy looked at the lady and felt bad. He said, "I am sorry, I will be nice now."
From that day on, the boy was nice to the cat, and they became friends. The lady was happy to see them play together. The moral of the story is, always be kind to others.
