Once upon a time, there was a lonely boy named Tim. He lived in a small house with his mommy and daddy. Tim did not have many friends, so he played with his toys all day. One day, Tim found a big carpet in the attic. It was very soft and colorful. Tim decided to play on the carpet.
Tim sat on the carpet and said, "I wish I had a friend to play with." Suddenly, the carpet started to move. It flew up into the air with Tim on it. Tim was scared at first, but then he started to have fun. The carpet took him to a park where he saw another lonely boy named Sam.
Tim asked Sam, "Do you want to play with me and my magic carpet?" Sam said, "Yes, I would love to!" So, Tim and Sam played on the carpet together. They flew high in the sky and had lots of fun.
After a while, it was time for Tim to go home. Sam was sad because he did not want to be lonely again. Tim said, "Don't worry, Sam. I will lend you my magic carpet so you can visit me anytime you want." Sam was very happy and thanked Tim.
From that day on, Tim and Sam were best friends. They played together every day on the magic carpet, and they were never lonely again.
