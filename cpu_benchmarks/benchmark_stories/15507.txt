Jerry the bear was so tired. He had been playing all day long. He lay down on his cozy bed and snuggled up with his heavy blanket. He looked around his room and saw his favorite picture frame. It had a picture of him and his family inside. That made him happy.
He closed his eyes and started to dream. In his dream, he was flying high in the sky! He zoomed around like a bee and nothing could stop him. He felt so light and free.
When he finally woke up, the sun was already in the sky. Suddenly, the heavy blanket felt way too hot. Jerry sighed because he wanted to keep on dreaming. He stayed in bed for a few more moments and then got up so he could go play again.
