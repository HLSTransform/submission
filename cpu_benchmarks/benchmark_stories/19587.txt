One day, a little girl was playing in her back yard. Suddenly, she heard a noise coming from the sky. It sounded like a rocket going "zip"! She looked up and saw a spaceship flying so fast! It was going crazy and all around the sky. 
The spaceship was carrying some newspapers. So the little girl ran to catch them before they flew away. She grabbed the newspapers before they could zip away, like the spaceship!
After that, the little girl and her friends started to read the newspapers. They were so excited! The newspapers had stories of crazy adventures and funny pictures. For the rest of the day, the friends laughed at the funny jokes and read about all sorts of strange things. 
When the little girl saw all the crazy stories in the newspapers, she couldn't help but smile. She was so happy she had caught them before they had the chance to zip away!
