Anna loves parades. She likes to see the big balloons, the loud music, and the people in costumes. She always wants to go to the parades with her mom and dad.
One day, Anna hears that there is a parade in the park. She asks her mom and dad if they can go. They say yes, and they get ready to leave. Anna puts on her hat, her coat, and her boots. She is very excited.
They walk to the park, and they find a good spot to watch the parade. Anna sees the balloons, the music, and the costumes. She claps and cheers. She is very happy.
But then, she sees something that makes her sad. She sees a little boy who has no hat, no coat, and no boots. He is shivering and crying. He has no mom and dad with him. He is alone.
Anna feels sorry for the boy. She realizes that he is cold and lonely. She realizes that she is lucky to have a hat, a coat, and boots. She realizes that she is lucky to have a mom and dad who love her.
She decides to do something nice for the boy. She takes off her hat, and she gives it to him. She says, "Here, you can have my hat. It will keep you warm." The boy smiles and says, "Thank you." He puts on the hat.
Anna feels good. She has done something easy, but kind. She has made a new friend. She watches the parade with the boy, and they both enjoy it. They are both happy.
