Anna and Ben are playing with a big box. They want to make a house with the box. They find some old clothes and a rope. They use the clothes to cover the box and make a roof. They use the rope to tie the clothes to the box and make a door.
"Look, we made a house!" Anna says. She is happy. She goes inside the box and pretends to cook. Ben follows her and pretends to eat.
"Yum, yum, this is good!" Ben says. He is happy too. They laugh and play.
Suddenly, they hear a loud noise. It is their dog, Spot. Spot sees the box and thinks it is a toy. He runs to the box and barks. He pulls the rope with his teeth. He wants to play too.
"Spot, no!" Anna and Ben shout. They are scared. They try to stop Spot, but he is too strong. He breaks the rope and the clothes fall off the box. The house is gone.
Anna and Ben are sad. They cry. They worked hard to make the house. They liked the house. They do not want to play anymore.
Their mom hears them cry. She comes to see what is wrong. She sees the mess and the dog. She understands what happened. She hugs Anna and Ben and calms them down.
"I'm sorry, sweeties. Spot did not know. He just wanted to have fun. He did not mean to ruin your house." She says. She is kind. She pets Spot and makes him sit.
"Can we make another house?" Anna asks. She is hopeful.
"Of course, you can. You did a great job. You had success. You can try again. But this time, let's use something else to tie the clothes. Something that Spot cannot break. How about some clips?" She says. She is helpful. She finds some clips and gives them to Anna and Ben.
Anna and Ben smile. They are happy again. They thank their mom and take the clips. They start to make another house with the box and the clothes. They use the clips to tie the clothes to the box and make a door.
"Look, we made another house!" Anna says. She is proud. She goes inside the box and pretends to sleep. Ben follows her and pretends to snore.
"Shh, shh, this is cozy!" Ben says. He is cozy too. They giggle and rest.
Spot watches them from a distance. He is calm. He does not bark or pull. He knows the house is not a toy. He knows Anna and Ben are his friends. He waits for them to come out and play with him. He is a good dog.
