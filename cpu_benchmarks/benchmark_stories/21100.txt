Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She had a big, shiny mirror in her room. Mia loved to look at herself in the mirror and make funny faces. One day, she found a round, hard ball in her toy box. She thought it would be fun to attach the ball to the mirror.
Mia asked her mom for help. "Mom, can you help me attach this hard ball to the mirror?" Her mom said, "Sure, Mia. Let's see how we can do it." They tried to attach the ball to the mirror with some sticky tape, but it did not work. The ball was too hard and heavy for the tape.
Mia's dad heard them and came to help. He had an idea. "Let's use some strong glue to attach the hard ball to the mirror," he said. Mia and her mom agreed. They carefully put glue on the ball and pressed it onto the mirror. They waited for the glue to dry.
Finally, the hard ball was attached to the mirror. Mia was so happy. She thanked her mom and dad for helping her. Now, every time she looked in the mirror, she saw the hard ball and remembered the fun day she had attaching it with her mom and dad. And they all lived happily ever after.
