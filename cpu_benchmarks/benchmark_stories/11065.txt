Lena and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs and worms. They also liked to water the plants and watch them grow.
One day, they saw a big green ball in the dirt. They wondered what it was. They decided to dig it out and see.
"Maybe it is a toy," said Lena.
"Maybe it is a rock," said Ben.
They dug and dug until they could lift the green ball out of the dirt. It was heavy and round and had stripes on it.
They rolled it to the grass and looked at it.
"What is it?" asked Lena.
"I don't know," said Ben.
They saw a small hole on the top of the green ball. They peeked inside and saw something red and juicy.
They smelled it and it smelled sweet and fresh.
They tasted it and it tasted yummy and cool.
They smiled and laughed.
"It is a melon!" said Lena.
"It is a fruit!" said Ben.
They ate the melon and shared it with their mom and dad. They were happy and full.
They thanked the garden for giving them a surprise.
They learned a new word: reveal.
Reveal means to show something that was hidden.
The garden revealed a melon to them.
They liked to reveal new things in the garden. They thought the garden was lively and fun.
