Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mommy. They played on the swings and went down the slide. Lily saw a big dog and got upset because she was scared. Mommy hugged her and they walked to the pond to see the tide go in and out. They saw ducks swimming and Lily laughed. It was a fun day at the park.
