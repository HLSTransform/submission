Molly and her dad went to the park. They sat on a bench and talked. They discussed what they were going to do. Dad said they could get ice cream.
Molly smiled and said yes. But then she thought of a joke and said they could get pizza instead. Her dad laughed and said why not?
On the way to get the pizza, they ran fast. They laughed as they raced each other. After they finished the race, they got the pizza. 
They discussed toppings on their pizza, and then Molly told another funny joke. They both laughed and dad said Molly was getting better at telling jokes every day!
