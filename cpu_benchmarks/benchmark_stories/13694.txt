Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play hide and seek with her friends. One day, she found a secret hiding spot behind a big tree. She felt her heart beating fast with excitement as she hid there. 
When it was her turn to seek, she looked everywhere but couldn't find her friends. She searched high and low until she finally found them hiding in the bushes. Lily was happy that she completed the game and found her friends. 
After the game, Lily showed her friends her hidden spot behind the tree. They were all amazed and wanted to hide there too. From that day on, they always played hide and seek near the big tree and Lily's hidden spot became a favorite hiding place for everyone.
