Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play games. She had a big sister named Emma who was very good at games. One day, Emma said to Lily, "Let's play a game. If you win, I'll give you a treat."
Lily was very excited because she loved treats. They played the game and Lily won! Emma was angry because she didn't like to lose. But she still gave Lily a treat because she promised.
The next day, Emma said to Lily, "Let's play another game. If I win, I get your treat from yesterday." Lily agreed and they played the game. Emma won this time and Lily was sad because she didn't want to give her treat away. But she remembered that Emma kept her promise and gave her a treat even when she was angry. So, Lily gave Emma her treat and they both felt happy.
