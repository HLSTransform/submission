Once there was a caterpillar who wanted to measure things. He wanted to measure the flowers and the leaves, but no one would help him. He asked other caterpillars, but they just laughed and said he wouldn't understand measuring.
But the caterpillar didn't give up. He kept trying and he kept asking.
One day, a harsh voice said, "I'll help." It was a bird who had flown down to help him.
The caterpillar was so excited. He asked, "Really? Will you help me measure?" 
The bird said "You need something to measure with." The caterpillar thought for a moment and then he remembered one of his friends had a ruler. 
The caterpillar ran to get the ruler and soon the caterpillar and the bird were measuring everything together. The caterpillar was so happy! He had measured so many things and he was proud of what he had accomplished.
