Sam and Lily were playing on the beach. They liked to make sand castles and dig holes. They also liked to watch the waves. The waves were big and blue and made a loud sound.
"Look, Sam, a big wave!" Lily said, pointing to the water.
"Wow, it is big!" Sam said. "Let's go closer and see it."
They ran to the edge of the water and waited for the wave to come. They were not afraid of the wave. They thought it was fun.
But then, a bigger wave came. It was so big that it reached them and splashed them. They got wet and cold and salty. They did not like it.
"Ah, the wave is angry!" Sam said, crying.
"Me too, the wave is mean!" Lily said, crying too.
They ran back to their mom and dad, who were sitting on a towel. They hugged them and told them what happened.
"Oh, poor Sam and Lily," their mom said. "The wave is not angry or mean. It is just a wave. It does not care about you. It just moves with the wind and the moon."
"Really?" Sam asked.
"Really," their dad said. "But we care about you. We love you. And we have a towel and a snack for you. Do you want to dry off and eat something?"
"Yes, please," Sam and Lily said.
They dried off and ate some crackers and juice. They felt better. They decided to play on the beach again, but not too close to the water. They still liked the waves, but they respected them too. They knew the waves did not care, but their mom and dad did. And that made them happy.
