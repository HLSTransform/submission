Once upon a time, there was a little fox who was very hungry. He was all alone in the forest, and he had not eaten anything in days. He often rolled around in the dirt, looking for something to eat. 
One day, he heard a noise and saw a man walking through the woods. In his hand, he had a can of spray and a waffle. The fox was so excited, he ran over to the man and begged for some food. The man could see how hungry the fox was and so he kindly gave him the waffle.
The fox was so happy and gobbled it up in an instant. But then the man pointed the spray at the fox and made him wet. The little fox ran away, scared and confused. Later he figured out that the spray was only water. The man was teaching the fox an important lesson - that you don't need to beg for food and that it is better to take care of yourself. 
The fox never forgot the lesson and he never begged for food again.
