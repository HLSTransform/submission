Once upon a time, there was a little kitten. She was very cute and had soft fur. One day, she met a big cat who was deaf. The kitten tried to meow, but the big cat couldn't hear her. So, the kitten decided to play with the big cat instead. They played and played until they both fell asleep. 
When they woke up, the kitten did something funny and the big cat laughed. The kitten liked making the big cat laugh, so she did it again and again. They became good friends and played together every day. The end.
