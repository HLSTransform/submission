Once upon a time there was a little girl who lived in a small town. Every day she would go out to explore and have fun with her friends.
One day when she was out exploring, she saw something strange in the sky. It was a cloud gathering in the sky and she knew it meant a storm was coming. She was a little scared but still she wanted to keep exploring.
As the cloud grew bigger, the townspeople started to get worried. This was because they were so weak and the storm could be very dangerous. So the little girl and her friends started to gather wood and stones to make a shelter so they could keep safe.
When the storm finally hit, it was more powerful than anyone had expected! But the little girl and her friends were safe in their shelter. When the storm had passed, everyone in the town was thankful that they were safe and they were even more thankful to the little girl who had helped them.
