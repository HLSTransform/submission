Lily and Ben were playing in the kitchen. They saw a big pastry on the table. It looked yummy and sweet.
"Can we have some pastry, Mom?" Lily asked.
"Not now, dear. It is for later. You need to eat your lunch first," Mom said.
But Lily and Ben did not listen. They waited until Mom went to the phone. Then they climbed on the chairs and reached for the pastry.
"Let's share it," Ben said. He tried to break the pastry in half. But it was too hard. He could not snap it.
"Let me try," Lily said. She pulled the pastry with all her might. But it was too sticky. She could not snap it either.
They pulled and pulled, but the pastry did not snap. It only stretched and stretched. It became longer and longer. It hung from the table like a rope.
Suddenly, Mom came back. She saw the pastry and the mess. She was very angry.
"What are you doing, you silly children?" she shouted. "You ruined the pastry! It was for Grandma's birthday!"
Lily and Ben felt sorry. They did not mean to be bad. They only wanted some pastry.
"We are sorry, Mom," they said. "We were hungry. Can we still have some pastry?"
Mom sighed. She was not happy, but she loved them. She cut a small piece of pastry for each of them.
"Here, have some pastry. But only a little. And then you need to clean up and say sorry to Grandma," she said.
Lily and Ben nodded. They ate their pastry. It was yummy and sweet. But they learned their lesson. They never tried to snap pastry again.
