Anna and Ben are playing in the sand. They have a big bucket and a small shovel. They want to make a sand castle.
"Look, Anna, I made a tower!" Ben says. He puts some sand in the bucket and turns it over. A sand tower comes out.
"Wow, Ben, that's a good tower!" Anna says. She makes another tower next to Ben's. They make four towers and a wall.
"Let's make a door for our castle," Ben says. He digs a hole in the wall with his shovel.
"OK, Ben, but be careful," Anna says. She helps him make the door.
They are happy with their sand castle. They sit inside and pretend to be a king and a queen.
"Who goes there?" Ben asks. He hears a voice outside the door.
"It's me, Mommy!" the voice says. "Can I come in?"
Anna and Ben look at each other and smile. They like Mommy.
"Yes, Mommy, you can come in!" they answer. They move aside and let Mommy in.
Mommy sees their sand castle and hugs them.
"What a beautiful castle you made!" Mommy says. "You are very clever and creative!"
"Thank you, Mommy!" Anna and Ben say. They are proud and happy.
They show Mommy their towers and their wall and their door. They invite Mommy to sit with them and play.
They have fun in the sand. They are a happy family.
