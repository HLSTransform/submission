Sara liked to display her toys on the shelf. She had a doll, a bear, a car and a book. She was proud of her toys and wanted to show them to everyone.
One day, her grandma came to visit. Grandma brought a big bunch of flowers for Sara's mom. They were white and pink and smelled nice. Sara saw a flower that looked like a star. It was a lily. She wanted to have it for herself.
She waited until grandma and mom were talking in the kitchen. Then she sneaked into the living room and took the lily from the vase. She ran to her room and put the lily on the shelf next to her doll. She smiled and thought it was very pretty.
But soon, the lily started to wilt. Its petals turned brown and fell off. Its stem bent and drooped. Sara felt sad and confused. She didn't know why the lily was dying. She thought it would be happy on the shelf with her toys.
She also felt uncomfortable. She knew she had done something wrong. She had taken the lily without asking. She had made grandma and mom unhappy. She wished she could make the lily alive again and put it back in the vase.
She decided to tell the truth. She took the lily and went to the kitchen. She said sorry to grandma and mom and gave them the lily. They hugged her and said they forgave her. They explained that the lily needed water and light to live, not a shelf. They also said that they loved her and were glad that she was honest.
Sara felt better. She learned a lesson. She never took flowers again without permission. She also learned to display her toys in a different way. She shared them with her friends and played with them together. She had more fun and made more memories.
