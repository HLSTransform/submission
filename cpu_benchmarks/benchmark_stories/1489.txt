Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. He was very brave and kind. He was always ready to help someone in need.
One day, Jack went for a jog by the harbor. He saw a man and a dog who were struggling in the water. Jack rushed to help them. He was very compassionate and fearless.
Jack jumped into the water and swam to them. He pulled the man and dog to the shore. Then, he ran to a nearby house and called the police.
The man and dog were taken to safety. Everyone thanked Jack for his brave and compassionate act.
Jack smiled. He was proud of himself for helping those in need. From that day on, Jack knew he could always help others.
