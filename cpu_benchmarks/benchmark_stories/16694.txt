Tim and Mia are playing with blocks. They like to build towers and houses and cars. Tim has a big block that he wants to attach to his tower. He tries to put it on top, but it is too heavy and the tower falls down.
"Oops!" Tim says. "Sorry, Mia. Can you help me?"
Mia nods and picks up some blocks. She helps Tim to make a new tower. She puts a small block on top of the big block. Then she attaches another small block to the side of the big block. She makes a shoulder for the tower.
"Look, Tim!" Mia says. "Now your tower has a shoulder. It is very strong and tidy."
Tim smiles and hugs Mia. He likes his tower and his friend. He says, "Thank you, Mia. You are very smart and kind. Do you want to make a house next?"
Mia nods and claps her hands. She says, "Yes, Tim. Let's make a house. We can use the blocks to make walls and windows and a door. And we can use a blanket to make a roof. It will be fun!"
Tim and Mia start to make a house. They use the blocks and the blanket and their imagination. They have a lot of fun playing with blocks.
