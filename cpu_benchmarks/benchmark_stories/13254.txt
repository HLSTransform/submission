Once there was a mommy and a baby. Mommy was in the kitchen, preparing dinner. The baby was playing on the floor. In the kitchen, there was a faucet, water coming out of it. Mommy smiled at the baby, and said "I want to remind you - never touch this faucet. It's not for you". The baby smiled and nodded. 
Mommy and the baby went outside and played. The sun was shining and the birds were singing. The baby looked up at the sky. Far away there were some distant clouds. Mommy said "That's a reminder to us - have a nice day". And they both laughed. 
The baby was so happy, because he was with Mommy. He was reminded how much Mommy loves him and how happy he is to be with her.
