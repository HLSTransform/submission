Once upon a time there was a girl called Daisy. One day, Daisy wanted to make something. She had seen a picture of a veil and wanted to make one just like it.
First, she found some material and some ribbon. Then, Daisy used the ribbon to make two loops. She put each loop through the material and then tied them together.
When Daisy finished making her veil, she put it on her head. But, the loops were weak and so the veil didn't stay on. Daisy was sad.
But then she had an idea. She took some tape and used it to stick the loops together. It worked! The veil stayed on her head and Daisy was very happy. She danced around with her veil on her head and everyone in the room couldn't help but smile.
