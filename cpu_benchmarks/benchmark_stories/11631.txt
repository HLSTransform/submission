Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mary. Mary was a very curious little girl, and she would often be playing in her backyard. 
One day, Mary saw a big cube sitting in the grass. She had never seen anything like it before. Excitedly, she ran over to it and started to roll it around the yard. 
She rolled and rolled the cube, until it suddenly stopped near an old grumpy tree. Mary was so excited that she decided to climb the tree to see if the cube was still there. 
But the tree was so grumpy, it shook and shook, trying to shake her off. Mary was determined and held on tightly, until finally she made it to the top. 
Sure enough, the cube had fallen right at the base of the tree. Mary cheered and cheered, until she finally climbed back down with the cube in her hands. 
From then on, Mary and the tree were not so grumpy with each other. Mary would roll the cube around the yard and the tree even gave her the occasional smile.
