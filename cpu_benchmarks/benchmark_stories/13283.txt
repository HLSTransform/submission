Grandma had a big box of toys that she wanted to give away. When she opened it, she could see that the box was full of all kinds of fun things! She took them out and started to scatter them across the floor. The room was filled with laughter as her grandkids ran around and grabbed everything they could find.
The kids had so much fun playing with the toys! Some built blocks, some played with dolls and some raced cars across the floor. They scattered around and all over the place. Grandma smiled and looked around the room. She had given them a score of laughs that day!
When all of the toys were put away and the kids were getting ready to go home, Grandma reached for the open box, looked inside and said ‘There’s always enough for next time!’
