Once upon a time there was a girl called Anna. Anna was three years old and loved her birthday! She was very excited for her special day to come.
On her birthday morning, Anna woke up early and ran down to the kitchen. She was so happy to see the birthday cake! It was big and colourful, with lots of candles on top.
Just as Anna was about to blow out the candles, one of her friends made a loud noise! Anna was so startled that she jumped back and panicked!
Her mum was very quiet, but she knew just what to do. She quickly gave Anna a big hug and wiped away some of her tears. Then she gave all the kids a big slice of birthday cake.
Anna and all her friends ate the yummy cake and soon they were all laughing and playing again. At the end of the day, Anna felt like her birthday had been special and full of love.
