Once upon a time there was a chubby girl named Mary. Mary loved to play. Every day, Mary would play with her friends outside. They would run, sing and make up silly stories. 
Mary's friends were always so excited to see what game Mary would come up with that day. After playing, they would head to Mary's house. There, they would have some sugar. Mary's mom always had something sweet waiting for them, like cookies, cake or candy.
Mary's friends loved to play with her, but they also loved her sugar. They all agreed that Mary had the best sugar in all the land! Mary was happy to share her sugar with her friends. That's what friends were for! 
Every day, Mary and her friends would play and eat sugar until the sun went down. All the chubby cheeks were evidence of all the sugar that had been enjoyed, but no one seemed to mind. They were just happy to have a friend like Mary, and each other.
