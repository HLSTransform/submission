Once upon a time there was a family who had been given a box by an old wise man. Inside the box was a bag of gold coins. They were so excited when they saw the bag. They opened it feeling reliable and happy. 
One of the coins was shiny and solid gold. The family wanted to keep it as it was a very special coin. So they removed the gold coin from the bag and placed it safely in their pocket.
From then on, the family was reliable. They always had the gold coin with them wherever they went. Whenever times were tough, the gold coin reminded the family that they had something to be thankful for. 
The end.
