Tim and Kim are twins. They like to play with their toys and books. But they do not like to share. Sometimes they fight and bite each other. Mom and Dad are not happy when they do that.
One day, Mom and Dad want to take a photo of Tim and Kim. They put them in nice clothes and make them sit on the couch. They say, "Smile, Tim and Kim! We want a nice photo of you two!"
But Tim and Kim do not want to smile. They want to play with their toys and books. They are bored and angry. They look at each other and make faces. They stick out their tongues and roll their eyes. They do not listen to Mom and Dad.
Mom and Dad are getting tired and frustrated. They say, "Tim and Kim, please behave! We just want one photo of you two! Why are you acting so crazy?"
But Tim and Kim do not care. They have a plan. They wait for Mom and Dad to count to three and say, "Cheese!" Then they do something very bad. They bite each other on the cheek!
Mom and Dad are shocked and angry. They say, "Tim and Kim, how could you do that? That is very naughty and rude! You hurt each other and ruined the photo! Go to your room right now!"
Tim and Kim run to their room. They are crying and rubbing their cheeks. They say, "Sorry, Tim. Sorry, Kim. I did not mean to bite you. I was just trying to make a funny photo."
They hug and say, "It's okay, Tim. It's okay, Kim. I forgive you. I love you. But next time, let's not bite each other. Let's smile and be nice."
They learn their lesson. They promise to share their toys and books. They promise to listen to Mom and Dad. They promise to never bite each other again.
