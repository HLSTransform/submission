Once upon a time, there was a jolly little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the big green bush behind her house. One day, she was playing with her friend Timmy when she started to feel very tired. 
"I am so sleepy," said Lily, as she began to yawn. "I think I need a nap."
Timmy nodded his head and said, "I like naps too. Let's go find a cozy spot to rest."
They searched around the bush until they found a soft patch of grass. They lay down and closed their eyes, feeling happy and peaceful. When they woke up, they felt refreshed and ready to play again. They skipped and laughed, enjoying their time together in the bush.
