Sara and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to draw with chalk on the sidewalk. They made flowers, stars, and animals with many colors. They were having fun.
But then, a big boy came. He was mean and rude. He took their chalk and threw it away. He laughed at them and said, "You are babies. You can't draw. Go away."
Sara and Tom were sad and scared. They wanted their chalk back. They saw the big boy put the chalk in his backpack and lock it with a key. He put the key in his pocket and sat on a bench.
Tom was brave. He said to Sara, "I have an idea. I can get the key and unlock the backpack. You distract him and I sneak behind him. OK?"
Sara nodded. She was brave too. She walked to the big boy and said, "Hey, you. Why are you so mean? You are not nice. You are a bully."
The big boy looked at her and sneered. He said, "What do you want, baby? Do you want to cry? Go away."
While he was talking, Tom crept behind him and reached for his pocket. He felt the key and pulled it out. He was happy. He ran to the backpack and unlocked it. He grabbed the chalk and ran back to Sara.
They smiled and hugged. They had their chalk back. They were brave.
But then, the big boy noticed. He saw the key in Tom's hand and the chalk in Sara's hand. He was angry. He shouted, "Hey, you. You stole my key. You stole my chalk. Give them back. Now."
He got up and ran to them. He was fast and strong. He caught them and pushed them to the ground. He took the key and the chalk. He hit them and kicked them. He hurt them.
Sara and Tom cried. They were hurt and scared. They wanted to go home. They wanted their mom and dad.
The big boy laughed and said, "You are stupid. You are weak. You can't play. Go away."
He left them and walked away. He had the key and the chalk. He was mean and rude.
Sara and Tom were sad and scared. They had no chalk. They were not brave.
