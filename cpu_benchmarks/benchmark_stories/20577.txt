Once upon a time, there was a sky so dark you could barely see. But then, something special happened. A cut in the sky opened up and from it came a star. It was very bright and twinkled brightly. Everyone was so excited that they ran outside just to see it.
They all wished on the star with all their might, hoping for all their hopes and dreams to come true. The star twinkled again, as if to say that it had heard them. They all smiled and felt so warm and happy.
Suddenly, from out of nowhere, a giant pair of scissors appeared. They were so big they covered the whole sky. The scissors started to cut the star, and it started to get smaller and smaller. Everyone was scared, but the star kept twinkling until it was so small that no one could see it.
Then, just as quickly as it had appeared, the scissors were gone and the star was gone too. All that was left was a dark sky, with no stars in it. Everyone sighed, sad that the star had gone. But they all knew that they still had their hopes and dreams to keep them warm.
