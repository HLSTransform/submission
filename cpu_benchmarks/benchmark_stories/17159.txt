Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily who loved to bake. One day, she decided to make some cookies for her friends. She went to the kitchen and got all the equipment she needed - a bowl, a spoon, and some flour. She mixed everything together and made the dough. 
After she rolled the dough into little balls, she put them in the oven to bake. While she waited, she decided to kneel down and play with her dog. Suddenly, she smelled something tasty coming from the oven. She quickly stood up and checked on her cookies. They were perfectly baked and smelled delicious. 
Lily took the cookies out of the oven and let them cool down. When her friends came over, she shared the tasty treats with them. They all loved the cookies and asked Lily for the recipe. She happily shared it with them and they all had a fun time eating the tasty cookies together. The end.
