Once upon a time, there was a dog called Biscuit. He was a very happy dog who loved to play. One day, he was playing in the garden when he saw a big, smelly old bag in the corner. Biscuit sniffed the bag and noticed a strange noise from inside. He barked and barked but nothing happened.
He decided to take a closer look and he ripped the bag open with his paws. Out popped a giant rat! Biscuit was so scared that he started to shake. The rat just stared at him and said, "I'm not going anywhere!"
Biscuit started to bark and try to scare the rat away, but the rat refused to leave. Suddenly, he felt something sharp in his fur. The rat had bitten him! Biscuit whimpered and started to tear away from the rat. He tried to run away as fast as he could, but the rat followed him. 
He ran and ran until he couldn't run anymore. The rat caught up and bit Biscuit again. Biscuit yelped in pain and the rat ran away. Biscuit was so hurt and scared that he stayed where he was all day until night fell.
In the end, Biscuit had a bad ending because he was scared and hurt. He was never the same and always kept a careful eye out for smelly old bags.
