Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she saw her neighbor, Mr. Brown, in his garden. He was holding a big bag of corn.
"Hi, Mr. Brown! What are you doing?" Lily asked.
"I'm going to feed the corn to my chickens," Mr. Brown replied. "Would you like to help me?"
Lily nodded and followed Mr. Brown to the chicken coop. He showed her how to scatter the corn on the ground. The chickens clucked happily and pecked at the corn.
After they were finished, Mr. Brown noticed a dead flower in Lily's hair. "Let me show you how to pick a fresh flower," he said. Together, they found a beautiful yellow flower and put it in Lily's hair.
"Thank you, Mr. Brown," Lily said with a big smile. "I love flowers and corn and learning new things!"
