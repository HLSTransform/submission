Once upon a time, there was a bear with a funny skull. He loved to raise it up high when he went for walks in the forest. He thought it made him look special.
One day, the bear was walking in the forest when he suddenly saw a funny sight. There was a squirrel with a twig in its mouth, trying to raise the skull on top of a tree. The bear laughed and decided to help the squirrel.
He headed over to the tree and held the skull steady, so the squirrel could raise it up high. Together, they did it and the skull was perched at the top.
The bear and the squirrel were so proud of their effort that they did a funny little dance around the tree! They had lots of fun together.
The End.
