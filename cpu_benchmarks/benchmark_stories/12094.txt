Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to cook with her mommy in the kitchen. One day, they decided to trade their favorite recipes with their friends. Lily's mommy made cookies and Lily made cupcakes. They wrapped their treats up pretty and went to their friends' houses. 
When they got to their friends' houses, they were confused. Their friends had made the same treats! They didn't know what to do. So, they decided to trade their treats with their friends anyway. They had so much fun sharing their yummy treats with each other.
