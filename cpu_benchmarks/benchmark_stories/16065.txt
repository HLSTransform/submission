One day, a little girl called Jo was playing in the garden with her favourite toy, a horse called Flora. She was so proud of her horse. Jo put a saddle on Flora and went for a ride. 
Suddenly, they arrived at a stable. Jo got off and opened the gate, and she saw a beautiful horse inside. But the horse seemed sad. Jo went over to talk to it and gently patted it. The horse said, "I'm so sad, I don't feel fit enough to go for a ride with you, I just want to weep!"
Jo was sad to hear this, because she wanted the horse to join her on her ride. Suddenly, an idea came to her. She ran to the stable and found an old brush. She gave the horse a nice groom and said, "Let's give it a try and see how you feel after this." 
The horse felt better after the brush and Jo was happy to see it so fit. They went for a ride and the horse was very happy, neighing and galloping to their joies. Jo and her new horse were the happiest they could be.
