Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jenna. Jenna was three years old and liked to play with her button collection.
One day, Jenna's mom was mailing a letter when Jenna came up to her. Jenna asked, "Mom, what is that?"
Her mom grinned and said "This is an amazing thing called 'mail' - I am mailing a letter to Grandma!"
Jenna was intrigued and asked, "Can I mail something too?"
Mom said, "Yes, why don't you mail one of your buttons to Grandma?" Jenna was so excited and quickly found her favorite button - a beautiful blue one. 
She gasped and said, "Mom, Grandma will love this button. I can't wait for her to get it!" 
So together they put the button in an envelope and Jenna put a smiley face on it. Mom mailed it and they both waited patiently for Grandma to get the amazing surprise.
