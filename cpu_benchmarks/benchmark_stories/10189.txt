One day, a little boy named Tim felt lonely. He had no friends to play with. He walked to the park to find someone to play with.
In the park, he saw a girl named Sally. Sally was eating yogurt. Tim asked Sally, "Do you want to play with me?" Sally shrugged and said, "Okay, let's play together."
Tim and Sally played all day. They were not lonely anymore. They shared the yogurt and became good friends. They promised to play together every day.
