Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a little ant named Andy. Andy was an organized ant. He liked to keep his home tidy and his food in the right place.
One day, Andy met a friendly bee named Bella. Bella said, "Andy, I need your help. My flowers are not growing well. Can you help me increase the number of flowers in the forest?"
Andy thought for a moment and said, "Yes, Bella, I can help you. Let's work together!" So, Andy and Bella worked hard every day. They planted more seeds and watered the flowers. Slowly, the number of flowers in the forest increased.
The forest became more beautiful and colorful with all the new flowers. Andy and Bella were very happy to see their hard work pay off. They became good friends and continued to help each other make the forest a better place for all the animals. And they all lived happily ever after.
