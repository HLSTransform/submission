One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk with his mom. They saw a big hole that went deep into the underground. Tim was curious and wanted to see what was inside. His mom said, "Be careful, Tim. Don't drop anything in there."
As they looked, Tim accidentally dropped his toy car into the hole. He was very frustrated and started to cry. "Mom, my car fell underground! How can I get it back?" Tim asked.
His mom thought for a moment and then said, "Let's go home and get a rope. We can use it to get your car back." So they went home, got a rope, and came back to the hole. Tim's mom tied the rope to a big stick and lowered it into the hole. After a while, they pulled the rope back up, and Tim's car was on the end of the stick!
Tim was so happy to have his car back. He hugged his mom and said, "Thank you, Mom! I will be more careful next time." And from that day on, Tim always held his toys tight when he was near the underground.
