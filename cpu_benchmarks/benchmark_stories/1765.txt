Today Mommy had a great idea. She suggested that they should play a game. So they all went outside to play. 
The first game they played was hide and seek. Mommy hid behind a big tree and shouted 'Ready or not, here I come!' They all laughed and had lots of fun. 
Then Mommy suggested something new. She said 'Let's play tag.' They all ran around, laughing and shouting. Everyone was so fast, it was hard to catch them! 
But then Mommy saw something ugly. It was a big spider! She quickly suggested that they should do something else. So they all decided to play hopscotch instead. 
Everyone hopped around the yard for ages and had lots of fun. That was a great game, and it was good that Mama had a suggestion.
