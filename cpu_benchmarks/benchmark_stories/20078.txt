Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her toys. One day, she was playing with her dolls when her little brother, Max, came in and started to scatter her toys all over the room. Lily got very upset and said, "Max, why did you scatter my toys? That's not nice!"
Max didn't know what to say, so he just shrugged his shoulders. Suddenly, there was a big earthquake and everything started shaking. Lily and Max held onto each other tightly and waited for it to stop. When it was over, they looked around and saw that their toys were scattered even more than before.
Lily started to cry because she was so proud of how she had organized her toys, but Max just laughed and said, "Look at all the fun we can have now!" Lily realized that Max didn't mean to be mean, he just wanted to play with her. They spent the rest of the day playing together and cleaning up their toys, and they were both very proud of themselves for being good siblings.
