Once there was a happy little girl called Daisy. She loved to run and zoom around the garden. One day, when Daisy was running, the fog began to roll in. Daisy could barely see any further than her own feet. She was scared and stopped running.
"Momma, I can't see through the fog. What should I do?" asked Daisy.
Her momma replied, "It's okay Daisy, the fog will disappear soon. Why don't you take a break while the fog clears?"
So Daisy sat down in the garden and waited. Soon, the fog started to move away. Daisy could see the sun again. She was so happy! She jumped up and started to zoom around the garden. She played hide and seek with her momma and laughed and smiled until the sun set.
