Once upon a time, there was a generous cat named Kitty. Kitty liked to climb trees and play with her friends. One day, Kitty saw her friend Doggy doing something new. Doggy was doing yoga! Kitty wanted to try it too.
Kitty and Doggy did yoga together. They stretched their legs and arms. They felt happy and strong. They loved doing yoga under the big tree. They laughed and had lots of fun.
After they finished doing yoga, Kitty and Doggy shared their snacks. They were very generous with each other. They played and climbed trees until the sun went down. Kitty and Doggy were the best of friends.
