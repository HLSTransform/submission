Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sally. One day she went outside to play in the snow. It felt so cold against her skin! Sally touched it with her hands and pinched some of the snow between her fingers. The texture was so strange and so light. 
Sally started building a snowman. She pinched some icing sugar from a pot and spread it on the snowman. It made his face look nice and sparkly! But then it started to get too cold and Sally's fingers were freezing. She went back inside and warmed up in front of the fireplace. 
Sally loved playing in the cold snow and feeling how soft it was. She pinched some snow again the next day and found it was still just as cold and soft as the day before. She laughed and spun around in the snow. 
And so, Sally happily played in the snow every day until the warm sunshine brought springtime back to the land.
