Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Mickey. Mickey loved cheese. One day, he was feeling very hungry and went out to find some cheese. He went to the kitchen and saw a big piece of cheese on the table. But the cheese was cold and hard.
Mickey said, "I want to eat the cheese, but it's too cold. How can I make it warm?" Just then, a kind cat named Tom came by and said, "I can help you. I will take the cheese and put it in the sun. The sun will make it warm and soft." 
Mickey was happy and said, "Thank you, Tom. You are a good friend." Tom took the cheese and put it in the sun. After a while, the cheese was warm and soft. Mickey ate the cheese and it was delicious. He said, "This is the best cheese I've ever had. Thank you, Tom!"
