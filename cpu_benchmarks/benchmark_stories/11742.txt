Once upon a time there was a furry dog. The dog liked to play and rub up against people. One day he decided to display his special talents by jumping on the bed. He bounced and jumped for a long time but then he heard a loud crash! The dog had broken the bed! He tried to escape but the owner was very angry and chased after him. He chased the furry dog out of the house and the dog never came back again. The end.
