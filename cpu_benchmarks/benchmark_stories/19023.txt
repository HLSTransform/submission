Once upon a time, there was a big park with lots of trees and grass. Many kids liked to play there because it was so fun. One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mommy. 
Lily saw a big slide and wanted to go down it, but there were too many kids waiting. So, she decided to go on the swings instead. She stood on the ground and waited for her turn. 
After a while, Lily got tired and wanted to go home. She asked her mommy where the exit was. Her mommy pointed to a gate and they walked towards it. On the way, they saw a popular ice cream truck. Lily wanted some ice cream, but her mommy said they could get some another time. 
Finally, they reached the exit and went home. Lily was happy because she had fun at the park and knew she could come back another day.
