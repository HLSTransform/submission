Once upon a time, there was a bird who wanted to fly to a faraway place. He asked his friend, an elephant, for help. The elephant said, "You must get a passport first." The bird was sad, for he did not have a passport.
Suddenly, an idea popped into the bird's head. He asked the elephant for their passport instead. The elephant thought this was a foolish idea, and told the bird, "no way!" But still the bird asked, "Please, just lend it to me for a day?" 
The kind-hearted elephant wouldn't give in. The bird tried to change the elephant's mind, but still, the elephant said "no". Then, the bird felt a sudden drop in his heart.
But suddenly, the elephant agreed. The elephant said, "Just this once", and gave the bird the passport. The bird was so excited. With the passport in hand, he could finally fly to a faraway place. 
He thanked his friend, gave him a big hug and took off. As the bird flew away, all he could think was, "I'm going to see the world!"
