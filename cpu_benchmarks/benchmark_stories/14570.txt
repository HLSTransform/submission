Once upon a time there was a seed. It was a very special seed. Everyday it would grow bigger and bigger. It grew so much that it became a big tree.
On hot summer days the tree would sway in the wind to the music of the birds. It loved the music and felt so happy. One day a new bird came to the tree. He sang the sweetest songs and the tree felt even happier.
Every night the tree would listen to the bird and grow bigger and stronger. It grew so much that it could reach the clouds.
The tree grew so tall and strong that it brought joy to all the animals and birds who lived near it. They all gathered around it and enjoyed the wonderful music.
And ever since then, the tree has been growing big and strong, bringing happiness to all its neighbors.
