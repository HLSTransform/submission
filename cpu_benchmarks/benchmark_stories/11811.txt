Once there was a little girl named Lucy. She was independent and wanted to do things all by herself. One day she was playing with a toy, but then it got stuck in her hand. She tried to pull it out but she couldn't. She started to tear up and her thumb hurt.
Suddenly a big, bright butterfly flew in front of her. It fluttered around her head and Lucy started to smile. The butterfly flew over to a drawer, waved its wings, and the drawer opened! In the drawer Lucy saw a box full of new toys.
She quickly grabbed a toy out of the box and smiled. When she tried to open the toy, her thumb slipped and she accidentally tore it open! Inside there were lots of colorful pieces and Lucy began to play.
The butterfly flew away and Lucy was very happy to have opened the box all by herself. She now knew she didn't need to ask anyone else for help. She was very proud of her independent spirit.
