Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a dog named Spot who was his best friend. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a quiz to see if he knew his colors. Timmy disagreed with his mom when she said that the color of the sky was green. He knew it was blue!
Timmy loved playing with Spot, but sometimes Spot would run away. Timmy wished that Spot was more dependable and wouldn't run away. One day, Timmy and Spot went for a walk in the park. Timmy played with Spot and threw a ball for him to catch. Spot caught the ball every time and Timmy was happy that Spot was dependable.
