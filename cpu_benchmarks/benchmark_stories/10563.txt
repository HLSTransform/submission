Once upon a time, there was a family who lived in the countryside. One day, the family heard an unusual noise outside. They ran outside and saw a tornado nearby!
The sky had become dark and the wind was blowing fiercely. Father felt worried and said, "We have to hurry, children. Let's go inside quickly!"
The tornado was coming closer. Mother pointed out the window and said, "What do you demand, tornado?"
The tornado made a loud sound and replied, "I demand that you hurry to safety!"
The family quickly grabbed their things and ran to the nearest shelter. Fortunately, the shelter was available. They stayed there until the storm was over.
When they came out of the shelter, they saw a lot of destruction. But they were thankful that they were all safe.
