Once there was a poor family. One day, they saw an amazing luxury appear in the distance. It was a big, fancy house with a big garden behind it. They thought maybe they could stay there if they asked the owners nicely.
The family knocked on the door of the house. A kind old man opened the door and welcomed them in. He said they could stay in the house as long as they wanted. They were so happy and felt so peaceful now that they were going to have a luxury stay.
The old man offered them food and asked them what their plan was. But the family had no plan, so the old man said, "I'll tell you what, I'll give you this house, so you can stay here forever, and never worry about money again." The family was overjoyed and thanked the old man.
But when they went inside the house, they realized that their dream of a peaceful, luxurious stay was just an illusion. The old man had tricked them! Inside the house, there were many hidden cameras and microphones. The old man was watching and listening to everything they did!
The family was devastated. They had realized too late that the old man's generosity was only a trap. They had to escape the house before the old man caught them. The family ran away in the dark of night, never to appear in that house again.
