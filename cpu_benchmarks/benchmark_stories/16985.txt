Lily and Tom were friends. They liked to play with toys and books. One day, Lily saw a big case in Tom's room. It was red and shiny. Lily wanted to see what was inside.
"Can I open your case, Tom?" Lily asked.
"No, Lily. That is my case. It is not for you. It is a secret," Tom said.
Lily felt sad. She wanted to know the secret. She waited until Tom went to the bathroom. Then she ran to the case and opened it. Inside, she saw a lot of candy. It was colorful and sweet. Lily smiled. She took some candy and put it in her mouth.
But the candy was not sweet. It was sour. It made Lily's mouth hurt. She spit out the candy and cried. It was a bad candy. Tom had tricked her. He had put sour candy in his case.
Tom heard Lily cry. He came back to his room. He saw Lily with the candy and the open case. He was angry.
"Lily, you are bad! You opened my case! You ate my candy! That was my candy! It was a joke! You are not my friend!" Tom shouted.
Lily felt sorry. She wanted to say sorry. She wanted to hug Tom. But Tom did not want to hug Lily. He pushed her away. He took his case and left. He did not play with Lily anymore.
Lily was alone. She had no candy and no friend. She was sad. It was a bad day.
