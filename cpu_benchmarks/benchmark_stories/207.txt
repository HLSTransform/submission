Lily liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes. She painted flowers and animals and houses. She made a big mess on the table and the floor. But she did not care. She was happy.
One day, she painted a picture for her grandma. She painted a big heart and wrote "I love you" with red paint. She was very proud of her picture. She wanted to send it to her grandma. She asked her mom for help.
"Mom, can you help me send this picture to grandma?" she said.
"Sure, Lily. That is a very nice picture. Grandma will love it. But first, we need to clean up your mess. Look at all the paint on the table and the floor. We need to be organized and tidy," her mom said.
"Okay, mom. I will help you. But can we send the picture today?" Lily said.
"Yes, we can. After we clean up, we will put the picture in an envelope and write grandma's address. Then we will go to the post office and mail it. Grandma will get it in a few days," her mom said.
Lily nodded. She was excited. She hoped grandma would like her picture. She helped her mom clean up the paint. She was organized and tidy. She put her colors and brushes in a box. She wiped the table and the floor with a cloth. She thanked her mom for helping her. Then they went to the post office and mailed the picture. Lily smiled. She loved her grandma. She could not wait to hear from her.
