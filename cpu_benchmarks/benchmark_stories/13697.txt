Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but they were always scattered around her room. One day, her mom came in and said, "Lily, let's organize your toys so you can find them easily!" Lily smiled and said, "Okay, Mommy!"
They started to put all of her toys in different boxes. Lily said, "I want to put my boat in this one!" Her mom replied, "Good idea, Lily! Now, let's put your dolls in this box." Lily said, "I like this box because it's flexible. It can fit all of my teddy bears too!"
After they finished organizing, Lily's room looked much neater. Her mom said, "Wow, Lily! Your room looks great now!" Lily replied, "Thank you, Mommy! I can find all of my toys now!"
