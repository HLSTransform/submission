Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there lived an intelligent little fox named Foxy. Foxy loved to play with her friends and find surprises in the forest.
One sunny day, Foxy and her best friend, Bunny, were playing near a big tree. Foxy said, "Let's enter the tree and look for a surprise!" Bunny nodded with a big smile, and they both went inside the tree.
As they looked around, they found a shiny box. Foxy said, "Look, Bunny! A surprise!" They opened the box and found yummy treats inside. They laughed and shared the treats, happy with their adventure in the forest.
