Mia and Mummy had a very different day. Mummy decided to take Mia to the beach. Mia loved the beach and when she saw the huge ocean she was very excited.
Mummy and Mia spotted a blue raft in the water. Mia wanted to try it, so they went to the beach shop. Mummy bought a red and white striped raft and they took it back to the beach.
Mia got on the raft and floated on the water. Mummy sat on the beach and read to Mia. The water felt warm and Mia had lots of fun.
When Mia was hungry, Mummy brought some apples. They ate them with the sand and enjoyed their day together. 
Mia and Mummy had a wonderful time and Mia loved the different raft.
