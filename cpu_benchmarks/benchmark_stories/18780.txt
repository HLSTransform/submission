Ben and Lily liked to play in the pool. They had a big pool in their backyard. They had many toys in the pool. They had balls, ducks, and boats.
One day, Ben saw a hole in the pool. The water was coming out of the hole. Ben was sad. He did not want the pool to be empty. He ran to his dad and said, "Dad, dad, the pool has a hole! Can you repair it?"
Dad looked at the pool and nodded. He said, "Yes, Ben, I can repair it. But I need some tape and glue. Can you help me find them?"
Ben said, "Yes, dad, I can help you. I know where the tape and glue are. They are hidden in the garage. Lily hid them there. She likes to hide things."
Ben and dad went to the garage. They looked for the tape and glue. But they could not find them. Lily had hidden them very well. Ben and dad were frustrated. They wanted to repair the pool.
They heard a giggle from behind a box. It was Lily. She had the tape and glue in her hands. She said, "I have the tape and glue. Do you want them?"
Ben and dad were angry. They said, "Lily, that is not nice. You should not hide things. We need the tape and glue to repair the pool. Give them to us now."
Lily felt sorry. She did not mean to make Ben and dad angry. She said, "I'm sorry, Ben and dad. I was just playing. Here, take the tape and glue. I will help you repair the pool."
Ben and dad took the tape and glue. They thanked Lily. They went back to the pool. They repaired the hole. The water stopped coming out. The pool was full again.
Ben and Lily hugged dad. They said, "Thank you, dad. You are the best. Can we play in the pool now?"
Dad smiled. He said, "Yes, you can. But please, don't hide things anymore. It can cause trouble."
Ben and Lily nodded. They said, "We won't, dad. We promise."
They jumped into the pool. They played with their toys. They had fun. They were happy.
