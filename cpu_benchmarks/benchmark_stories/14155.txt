Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. Jack was only three years old and he loved playing with his new drum. But one day, when Jack was playing with his drums, the drum started to make a funny noise. So Jack went to find his dad.
Jack: Daddy, my drum is broken! Can you fix it?
Jack's dad looked at the drum for a minute and then said:
Jack's dad: Yes, Jack. I can repair it.
So, Jack's dad took the drum to the repair shop and they made it look new again. 
When Jack's dad got home, he gave the drum back to Jack. Jack was so happy to see his drum newly repaired. He started playing and singing along right away. 
Jack was so happy and relieved that his dad was able to repair his new drum. From then on, Jack and his drum were inseparable.
