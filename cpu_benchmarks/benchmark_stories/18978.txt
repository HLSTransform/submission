Once upon a time, there was a little gray dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with his ball all day long. He was very good at catching it and bringing it back. Spot was a persistent dog, which means he never gave up.
One day, Spot's ball went into the woods. He wanted to get it back, but he was scared of the dark trees. His friend, a big bird named Tweet, saw Spot looking sad. Tweet wanted to help and encourage Spot to go into the woods. Encourage means to make someone feel brave and strong.
Tweet said, "Don't worry, Spot! I will go with you and we will find your ball together." Spot felt better with Tweet by his side. They walked into the woods and found the ball. Spot was so happy and thanked Tweet for being a good friend. From that day on, Spot and Tweet played together and encouraged each other to be brave and have fun.
