Once upon a time, there was a big, bright sun in the sky. It made the sky a beautiful blue color. A kite flew high above it, the kite's cord dangling and swaying in the wind. 
The kite flew so high that the cord couldn't be seen anymore. But then out of nowhere, the cord dropped. It fell way down and twirled around the sky until it landed on the ground.
 
The kite was now alone in the sky, so the sun smiled brightly to make it feel better. A gust of wind then appeared and grabbed the kite by its cord, lifting it back up into the sky. The sun kept smiling down, and the kite kept flying free.
