Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They saw a big tree with shiny things on it. They wanted to see what they were.
"Look, Lily, jewels!" Ben said. "Let's climb the tree and get them."
"OK, Ben, but be careful," Lily said. They climbed the tree and reached for the jewels. They were incredible. They sparkled and glowed in the sun.
But the jewels were not real. They were made of glass and plastic. They were part of a decoration for a party. The tree was not strong. It could not hold Ben and Lily.
The tree branch broke. Ben and Lily fell. They screamed. They hit the ground. They were hurt. They cried.
A man came running. He was angry. He was the owner of the jewels. He saw Ben and Lily on the ground. He saw his jewels broken and scattered.
"What have you done?" he yelled. "You ruined my jewels! You are bad children! You have to pay for this!"
Ben and Lily were scared. They did not have any money. They did not know what to do. They wished they had never climbed the tree. They wished they had never seen the jewels. They wished they had stayed on the ground.
