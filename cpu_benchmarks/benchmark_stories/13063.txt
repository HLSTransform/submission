Once upon a time, there was a girl called Lola. She was three years old and loved yoga. Every day she would practice yoga in her living room with her mum.
One day, Lola wanted to go to a yoga class with her mum. The class was far away and her mum said she needed to wait until she was bigger and stronger. Lola was disappointed and wanted to go right away, but her mum said no.
On the day of the yoga class, Lola's mum said it was too dangerous to go outside because of the rainy weather. So they had to delay their yoga adventure.
Lola was really upset, she wanted to learn new yoga skills and practice with her mum. But the weather was just too dangerous.
Lola and her mum decided to do yoga in the living room again until the sun came out.
The end!
