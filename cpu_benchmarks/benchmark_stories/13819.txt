Lily and Ben were playing with magnets in the kitchen. They liked to attach them to the fridge and make shapes and patterns. Lily made a heart with red magnets and Ben made a star with blue magnets.
"Look, Lily, I made a star!" Ben said, proud of his work.
"That's nice, Ben. I made a heart. Do you like it?" Lily asked, showing him her heart.
"Yes, it's pretty. But I like stars more. They are bright and shiny," Ben said.
Lily felt sad. She wanted Ben to like her heart too. She liked stars, but she liked hearts more. They were warm and compassionate.
"Can we share?" she asked Ben. "You can have some of my heart magnets and I can have some of your star magnets. Then we can make both hearts and stars."
Ben thought for a moment. He liked his star, but he also liked Lily. She was his friend and he wanted to make her happy.
"Okay, Lily. We can share. Here, you can have two of my star magnets and I can have two of your heart magnets. Then we can make both hearts and stars," he said, giving her the magnets.
Lily smiled and hugged Ben. She was glad he was compassionate and willing to share. They attached the magnets to the fridge and made new shapes and patterns. They had fun playing with magnets and being friends.
