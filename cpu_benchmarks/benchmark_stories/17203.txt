Once upon a time, there was a long snake. The snake loved to slither around and explore. One day, the snake found a pile of money. It was shiny and sparkly and the snake wanted it. So, the snake decided to steal the money. 
The snake took the money and slithered away. But soon, the snake realized that stealing was not nice. The snake felt bad and wanted to give the money back. So, the snake slithered back to where it found the money and left it there. 
From that day on, the snake learned that it was important to be kind and not steal from others. The snake continued to slither around and explore, but now it did so with a happy heart.
