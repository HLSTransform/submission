Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play with blocks and cars. One day, Sara has a new toy. It is a big eye. It can see many things.
"Look, Ben, this is my big eye. It can see far and near. It can see colors and shapes. It can see you and me." Sara says.
"Wow, Sara, your big eye is cool. Can I try it?" Ben asks.
"Sure, Ben, you can try it. But be careful. It is fragile. Do not drop it or break it." Sara says.
Ben takes the big eye and puts it to his eye. He sees many things. He sees the trees and the birds. He sees the cars and the bikes. He sees the clouds and the sun. He sees Sara and her smile.
"This is amazing, Sara. Your big eye can see so much. It can improve my sight. It can make me happy." Ben says.
"I am glad you like it, Ben. My big eye can make me happy too. It is a gift from my grandma. She says it can help me learn and explore. She says it can make me smart and curious." Sara says.
Sara and Ben share the big eye. They take turns to see different things. They learn and explore. They are smart and curious. They are happy. They are friends.
