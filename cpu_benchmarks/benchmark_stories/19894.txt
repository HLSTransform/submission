Once upon a time, there was a kind dog named Max. Max loved to play with his ball in the park. One day, Max got very tired and needed to rest. He found a cozy spot under a tree to settle down. As he lay there, he noticed he was having trouble breathing. His lung hurt and he didn't feel good. 
Max knew he needed to go see his dependable vet. The vet checked Max's lung and gave him some medicine to help him feel better. Max was so happy to have a dependable vet who could help him. After a few days of rest and medicine, Max felt much better and was able to play with his ball in the park again.
