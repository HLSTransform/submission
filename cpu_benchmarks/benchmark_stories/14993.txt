Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mark. Mark was always very healthy, and she loved running around in the park. One day when she was playing in the park, she met a special delivery man.
The delivery man said, "Hello Mark! We have a very special delivery for you today. I'm here to deliver it to you."
Mark asked, "What is it? Can I see it?"
The delivery man smiled and said, "Yes, you can! It's a beautiful, healthy apple!"
Mark was so excited to get the apple. She said, "Thank you for delivering it to me!"
The delivery man smiled and said, "You're welcome Mark, enjoy your healthy snack!"
Mark thanked the delivery man again and said goodbye. Then she took her apple and happily ran off to enjoy her snack.
From that day on, Mark always remembered the special delivery man, who had brought her a healthy snack.
