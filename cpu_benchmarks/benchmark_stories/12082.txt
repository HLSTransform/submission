Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the grocery store with her mommy. One day, they went to buy some beef for dinner. 
As they walked down the aisle, Lily saw a lively puppy playing with a ball. "Mommy, can we buy the puppy?" she asked. 
Her mommy smiled and replied, "No, sweetie. We can't buy the puppy today. But we can buy some delicious beef for dinner!" 
Lily was a little sad they couldn't buy the puppy, but she was happy they were going to have yummy beef for dinner. When they got home, Lily helped her mommy cook the beef and it smelled so good! They had a nice dinner together and Lily felt very happy.
