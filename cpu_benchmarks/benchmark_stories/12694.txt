Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was three years old and she liked to eat cake. One day she decided to make a cake all by herself. She found a bowl and spoon in the kitchen, and she gathered all the things she needed to make the cake.
The little girl carefully measured out the ingredients and mixed them together in the bowl. Then she put the bowl in the oven and waited. Soon the smell of cake filled the room, and the little girl knew it was time. 
The little girl opened the oven and peered inside. The cake was big and round, and it looked beautiful and clear. She closed the oven and smile happily.
A few minutes later, the little girl opened the oven again. The cake was now golden and crispy and smelled delicious. She took out the cake and placed it on the counter.
The little girl wanted to share her cake, so she called for her mom.
"Mom!" said the little girl, "Look at my cake, it's so clear and delicious!" 
Her mom smiled and said, "That looks amazing! Let's try a piece together!"
So they each had a piece of the little girl's homemade cake, and it was so yummy!
The end.
