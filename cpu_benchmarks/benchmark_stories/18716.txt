Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, her mom asked her to stack the plates on the table. Lily carefully stacked the plates one on top of the other.
Suddenly, Lily's little brother came into the kitchen. "I'm hungry," he said. "What are you making?" 
"We're making a delicious cake," Lily's mom replied. 
"Can I have a piece?" her brother asked. 
"Of course, you can," Lily said. "But be careful, the knife is sharp!" 
Lily's mom cut a slice of cake and gave it to her brother. He took a bite and smiled. "This is delicious!" he said. 
Lily and her brother enjoyed the cake together, and they were happy to have each other.
