Sara and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. They had many toys: cars, dolls, blocks, books, and more. They liked to scatter them all over the floor and make up stories with them. They did not like to tidy them up when they were done.
"Let's build a castle with the blocks," Sara said. "We can be the king and the queen."
"OK," Ben said. "But we need more blocks. Let's get them from the closet."
They ran to the closet and opened the door. Inside, they saw a big pile of clothes that their mom had folded and put away. They had an idea.
"Look, Ben," Sara said. "We can use these clothes to make our castle bigger and prettier. We can put them on the blocks and make walls and roofs and flags."
"Good idea, Sara," Ben said. "Let's do it."
They grabbed the clothes and ran back to the living room. They started to put them on the blocks and scatter them around the floor. They did not notice that their mom was coming home from the store.
When their mom walked in, she saw the mess they had made. She was very angry.
"Sara! Ben! What have you done?" she shouted. "You have scattered all the clothes I folded and put away. You have made a big mess. You have to tidy it up right now."
Sara and Ben looked at their mom. They looked at their castle. They looked at each other. They knew they were in trouble. They wished they had not had that idea.
