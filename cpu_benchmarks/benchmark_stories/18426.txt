Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside, even when it was cold. One day, she went outside to play and forgot to put on her coat. Her mommy said, "Lily, where is your coat? It's very cold outside." 
Lily said, "I forgot it, mommy. Can I go play outside without it?" 
Mommy said, "No, you will get very cold. Please go back inside and put on your coat." 
Lily went back inside and put on her coat. She went outside to play and found a big, messy pile of leaves. She started to chew on a leaf and said, "This leaf is yummy, mommy!" 
Mommy said, "Lily, we don't chew on leaves. They are not for eating. Let's go inside and have a snack." 
Lily and mommy went inside and had a yummy snack together. They were happy and warm with their coats on.
