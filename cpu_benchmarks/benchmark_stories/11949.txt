Once upon a time, there was a small child. The child loved to play with toys and run around. One day, the child went outside to play and saw a small bird. The child wanted to play with the bird, so the child called out to the bird. 
The bird came and played with the child. They had so much fun together. But the child didn't know that the bird had a family. The bird's family was looking for the bird and couldn't find it. 
When the bird's family finally found the bird playing with the child, they were so happy. But they were also angry that the child had taken the bird away from them. The bird's family took the bird back and flew away. The child was sad and missed the bird.
