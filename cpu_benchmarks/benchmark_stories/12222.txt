Once there was a three year old child named Jack. He was very excited! He was going to the market for the very first time. Everywhere he looked there were colourful vegetables and fruits, scary spiders hanging from the ceiling and people talking loudly. He was so amazed.
Jack told his mom, "Mom, I want to buy something nice!" His mom said, "Sure, you can buy whatever you like but make sure to look at the price first!" Jack nodded and started walking around. He saw a very shiny red apple and wanted to buy it. That apple certainly had the best price. Jack smiled, picked it up and gave it to his mom. His mom said, "Ok, let's go to the cashier."
At the cash register, Jack saw a big scary man. He was a bit afraid but still he said, "Thank you!" to the man. The man smiled and handed Jack his apple. Jack smiled back and thanked the man again.
When they got back home, Jack showed his prize to his dad. His dad said, "Nice job, Jack! You are very smart!" Jack smiled and said, "Thank you!"
