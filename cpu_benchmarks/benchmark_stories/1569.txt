Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to bounce around in the grass and play with his friends. One day, Benny fell and hurt his paw. His mommy called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Benny was scared, but the ambulance came quickly and the nice paramedics took good care of him. Benny was impatient to get better so he could go back to playing with his friends. After a few days, Benny's paw felt much better and he could bounce around again. He was so happy to be back with his friends and have fun in the sunshine.
