Lily liked to walk with her mom and dad in the park. She saw many things that made her happy: birds, flowers, dogs, and swings. Sometimes, she saw other kids and played with them.
One day, she saw a big book on a bench. It had many words and pictures. She wanted to look at it. She asked her mom, "What is this?"
Her mom said, "This is a novel. It is a story book for grown-ups. Do you want to hear some of it?"
Lily nodded. Her mom opened the book and read a page. It was about a scary monster that chased people and ate them. Lily felt fearful. She did not like the story. She said, "Stop, mom! I don't want to hear more!"
Her mom closed the book and hugged her. She said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I did not know it was a scary novel. You don't have to listen to it. Let's go and find something fun to do."
Lily smiled and said, "Okay, mom. Can we go to the swings?"
Her mom said, "Sure, Lily. Let's go to the swings." They walked to the swings and Lily forgot about the fearful novel. She had fun with her mom and dad in the park.
