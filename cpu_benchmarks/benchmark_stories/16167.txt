Once there was a nosy bird. It loved to peep into other animal's homes. One day, it spotted a big wave lapping against the shore. The bird got curious and decided to fly over to check what was going on. 
When it reached the wave, the bird found a group of animals playing in the sand. The bird listened in on their conversation. He heard one of them telling the others that they should not spoil their toys or they'll be in trouble.
The nosy bird felt very proud of itself. It had learned an important lesson - to not spoil things that do not belong to you. 
The bird was ready to fly away when one of the animals spotted it.
"Hey look, that nosy bird knows how to mind its own business!", said one of the animals.
The nosy bird was very happy that the animals had noticed it. From then on it would always remember to mind its own business.
