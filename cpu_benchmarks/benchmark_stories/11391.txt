Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Juliana who liked to play in her room. One day, she found some shapes in the corner of her room. She was so excited to show them to her mom, so she ran to find her mom.
When she saw her mom, Juliana shouted, “Look, Mommy! I found these shapes in my room!”
Her mom smiled and said, “Those are very fine shapes, Juliana. I think we should sell them to someone else so that they could play with them too.”
Juliana thought this was a great idea and so they went together to find someone they could sell the shapes to. They soon found a boy who was really excited to buy the shapes. He paid Juliana and her mom with some sweets and thanked them for the shapes.
The moral of the story is that it's nice to share what we have with others. If we give things that we don't need away, it makes other people happy and it makes us happy too. It's important to be kind and generous!
