Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to sing songs all day long. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean up his toys. Timmy said, "Okay, Mommy! I will clean up my toys now." 
But Timmy got distracted by his favorite song and started singing and dancing instead of cleaning up. After a while, his mom came back and saw that Timmy hadn't cleaned up yet. She said, "Timmy, you forgot to clean up your toys. Please be obedient and clean them up now."
Timmy felt bad for forgetting and started cleaning up right away. As he cleaned, he sang his favorite song quietly to himself. When he was done, he proudly showed his mom his clean room and said, "Look, Mommy! I cleaned up my toys like an obedient boy." His mom smiled and gave him a big hug.
