Once upon a time, there was a happy little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to hop and play in the meadow with his friends. One day, while hopping around, Benny fell into a hole. He was scared and didn't know what to do.
His friends heard him crying and came to help. They saw Benny in the hole and started to applaud him for being brave. They knew he was scared, but he didn't give up. Together, they pulled him out of the hole and everyone was happy again.
From that day on, Benny learned that even when things get tough, he can always count on his friends to help him. And they knew that Benny was a brave bunny who deserved a round of applause. The end.
