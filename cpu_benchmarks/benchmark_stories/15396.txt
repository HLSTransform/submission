Once upon a time, there was a happy family. They had a big, comfy bed to all snuggle in, and lots of yummy food to eat. The family liked to eat meat for dinner, and the mum and dad would always smile. One night, the family was eating dinner and their little son, Tommy, said something strange. He shouted, "I'm not eating the meat, I'm lying!" Mum and Dad laughed - Tommy was too young to lie. Tommy smiled, and his parents asked him why he said that. He explained that he wasn't really lying, but he wasn't eating the meat either. That's when mum and dad realised he only meant he wasn't eating his dinner. They all laughed, and Tommy ate his dinner. The family was happy, and everyone was content!
