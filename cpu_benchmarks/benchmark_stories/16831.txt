Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play her flute every day. One morning, she woke up early and went outside to play her incredible flute. 
As she was playing, a bird flew down and landed on her shoulder. "Wow, your flute sounds amazing!" the bird chirped. 
Lily was surprised and happy. "Thank you!" she replied. "Do you want to sing with me?" 
The bird nodded and they played together. It was a beautiful sound. After they finished, the bird said goodbye and flew away. Lily smiled and continued to play her incredible flute.
