Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy lived in a big house with lots of rooms and lots of cheese. One day, Timmy saw a match on the ground and he wanted to play with it. But his mommy told him matches are dangerous and he shouldn't touch them. Timmy thought it was stupid, but he listened to his mommy and walked away.
Later that day, Timmy was playing in the kitchen when he saw a big cat coming towards him. He knew he had to escape, so he ran as fast as he could. He ran through the living room, up the stairs and into his bedroom. The cat followed him, but Timmy was too quick and he escaped through a little hole in the wall. 
Timmy was so happy he escaped from the cat, but he knew he had to be careful and listen to his mommy. He never played with matches again and he stayed safe from the big cat. The end.
