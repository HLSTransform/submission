John the cat was very playful. He would spend hours playing on his own chasing a ball or performing amazing flips and jumps. One day, he decided to do something special.
John ran through the doorway and trotted outside. He spotted a pile of salt on the ground and he found it fascinating. He sniffed it, licked it and sat down in the middle of the pile. He began to perform.
John rolled around, jumped and danced - all while surrounded by salt! As he performed, the salt sprayed around him like snow. John felt so happy.
He stayed there all day, performing and having fun. When he was done, he thanked the salt for such a wonderful day.
