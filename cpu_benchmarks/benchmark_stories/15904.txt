Once upon a time, there was a kitty cat who liked to rest. Every day, she found a sunny spot and stretched out in the sun.
One day, she saw an open window and thought she'd like to rest there. She poked her head through the window, and saw a nice, warm corner to curl up in. 
The kitty cat was so happy! She curled up in the corner and purred contentedly. But then, a strong voice said, “No kitty! That corner is not healthy. You won’t rest there.”
The kitty cat looked up, and saw the voice belonged to a man. He smiled and said, “Why don’t you come outside, kitty? There’s plenty of sunny spots to rest in the garden.”
The kitty cat was so excited! She followed the man outside and found the most perfect spot to rest in the sunshine. She curled up, closed her eyes, and rested all day!
