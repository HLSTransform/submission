Once there was a clever girl named Mary. She was only 3 years old, but she was very smart. Every day, Mary would play with her friends and have a good time.
One day, Mary was playing with her friends when she saw a mustache on the ground. She was so excited that she picked it up and put it on her own face. Mary's friends thought she looked funny, but she didn't care.
Mary kept playing with her friends, but eventually she got tired and decided to quit. She said goodbye to her friends and went home.
On the way home, Mary passed by a store and saw a mirror. She looked in the mirror and saw that she still had the mustache on her face! She laughed and took it off, knowing she had been clever to find it.
Mary went back home and put the mustache away in her drawer, where it would always remind her of the fun times she had with her friends.
