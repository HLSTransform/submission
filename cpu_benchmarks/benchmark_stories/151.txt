Once upon a time, there was a big house with a door. The door was brown and it could move when people opened it. One day, a little boy came to the house and he saw the impressive door. He wanted to open it and see what was inside. So he moved the door and went inside. Inside the house, he found a lot of toys to play with. He was very happy and he played with the toys all day. When it was time to go home, he moved the door again and went outside. He was very impressed by the big house and the amazing toys inside.
