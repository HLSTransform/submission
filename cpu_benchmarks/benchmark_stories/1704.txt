Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw pictures of her favorite animals, like bunnies and puppies. One day, Lily's mom said, "Lily, let's organize your drawings so we can find them easily." 
Lily asked, "What does organize mean?" 
"It means we can put all your bunny drawings together and all your puppy drawings together," her mom explained. 
Lily thought that was a great idea. She went to her room and brought out all her drawings. Her mom helped her sort them by animal, and then they put them in a big folder to keep them safe. 
After they finished organizing, Lily's mom said, "Let's print a picture of your favorite animal and put it on your wall." 
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I love bunnies. They are so sweet!" 
So they printed a picture of a cute bunny and hung it on Lily's wall. Lily was so happy to see her organized drawings and her sweet bunny picture every day.
