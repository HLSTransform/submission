Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play outside. They had a big yard with a swing, a slide and a sandbox. They also had a dog named Spot who was very friendly and liked to chase balls.
One day, Lily and Ben decided to make a cake with sand and water. They used a bucket, a spoon and some leaves and flowers. They worked very hard and made a big cake. They were very proud of their cake and wanted to show it to their mom.
But their mom was busy in the kitchen. She was making dinner for the family. She told Lily and Ben to come inside when the sun went down. She said they had to wash their hands and face before eating. She said dinner was delicious and they would love it.
Lily and Ben did not listen to their mom. They wanted to play more with their cake and Spot. They did not see the sun go down. They did not hear their mom call them. They did not smell the dinner.
When their mom came outside, she was very angry. She saw Lily and Ben covered in sand and dirt. She saw their cake and Spot. She said they were naughty and did not obey. She said they had to punish them. She said they had to go to bed without dinner. She said they had to clean their cake and Spot tomorrow.
Lily and Ben were very sad. They said they were sorry and they loved their mom. They said they wanted to eat dinner and hug their mom. They said they did not mean to be naughty. They said they just wanted to have fun.
Their mom was still angry, but she also loved them. She said they had to learn to listen and follow the rules. She said they could have dinner tomorrow and hug her then. She said she hoped they would be good and not make trouble again.
Lily and Ben went to bed without dinner. They were hungry and sorry. They hugged each other and Spot. They looked at the sky and saw the stars. They wished they could see the sunset. They hoped their mom would forgive them. They fell asleep and dreamed of delicious cake.
