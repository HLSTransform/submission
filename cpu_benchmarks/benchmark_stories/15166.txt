Yesterday, Annie was hungry so she ate. She moved slowly and carefully as she chewed each bite. When she was done, she was filled with joy. She said, "Yay! I ate yesterday, and now I'm full." 
Annie had so much fun. She decided to dance around in celebration. She moved slowly and enjoyed every dance move. Annie wasn't too fast, but that was alright with her. She smiled and twirled around, still content with the food she had eaten the day before.
When Annie was done, she looked up at the sky. She thought to herself that the sky was so big, and that she was so small. She waved goodbye to yesterday and smiled, happy to have eaten something so delicious.
