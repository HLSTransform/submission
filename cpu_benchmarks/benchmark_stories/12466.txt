Jen and Ben are twins. They like to play with blocks. They make towers and bridges and houses with the blocks. They have fun.
One day, they find a new toy in their room. It is a zigzag. It is a long and bendy thing that can change shape. It can be a circle, a square, a snake, or anything they want. They are happy.
They take turns with the zigzag. Jen makes a heart with it and says, "This is for you, Ben. You are my lovely brother." Ben makes a star with it and says, "This is for you, Jen. You are my lovely sister." They hug and smile.
But then, they both want to make something else with the zigzag. Jen wants to make a flower. Ben wants to make a rocket. They pull and tug on the zigzag. They say, "No, it's mine!" They are angry.
They hear a snap. The zigzag breaks in two. They are sad. They look at the broken zigzag. They look at each other. They say, "I'm sorry. I was mean. Can we share?" They are sorry.
They nod and hug. They take the pieces of the zigzag and make new things. Jen makes a butterfly. Ben makes a car. They say, "Look, we can still play with the zigzag. It can change again." They are happy. They are friends.
