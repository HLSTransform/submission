Once upon a time, there was a big, noisy whale. He loved to swim and play in the sea. One day, he saw a little fish swimming nearby. The whale wanted to play with the fish, but he didn't know how to be gentle. So he threw the fish into the air and caught it again. The fish felt scared and didn't want to play with the whale anymore.
The whale felt sad when he saw that the fish was scared. He realized that he had been too rough and didn't want to hurt anyone again. From that day on, the whale learned to be gentle and kind to all the sea creatures. He made lots of new friends and they all loved to play together.
The moral of the story is that it's important to be kind and gentle to others, even if we are big and strong. We should always think about how our actions might affect others and try to be gentle with them.
