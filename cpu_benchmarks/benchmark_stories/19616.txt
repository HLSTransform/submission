Once upon a time, there was a bad man. He had been naughty and he didn't follow the rules. He did mean things and made people sad.
One day, the people of the world decided to punish the bad man for his bad behaviour. They said he must be patient and wait for his punishment to come.
The bad man waited and waited, but his punishment never came. He thought he was getting away with being bad, but he was wrong.
The people of the world had a plan. They waited patiently, and one day the bad man was punished. The bad man had to leave the world and never come back. 
The people were happy again. The bad man was gone and they could feel safe again. They had been patient, and the bad man was punished.
