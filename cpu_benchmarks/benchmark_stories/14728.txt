Once upon a time there was a magical creature with purple wings, who loved to give massages. The creature was so special that when it gave a massage, it made things freeze. Anything around the creature that received the massage would freeze too! 
One day, a little girl received one of these magic massages. Her eyes went big and she couldn't move. Everything around her had frozen, including her friends.
The little girl was so excited, she laughed and shouted, "Funny magic!"
The magical creature said, "You can unfreeze it all with a magical word. Think of a special word and say it out loud to make everything move again".
The little girl thought very carefully. Then she smiled, and with a wave of her hand she yelled, "Unfreeze!" Everything around her unfroze, and started moving again. Her friends were so happy, they hugged her and the magical creature! 
The little girl smiled and thanked the magical creature for the special massage. She was so happy she had experienced such a magical thing.
