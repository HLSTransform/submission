Once there was a little girl called Alice. She was very brave, but one day she got scared. Alice was playing in the park when she saw a ghost. It was white and it floated in the air. Alice wanted to run away, but the ghost said, "Stop". Alice stopped and looked at the ghost. The ghost said, "Don't be scared. I'm not a bad ghost." Alice was still a bit scared, but the ghost said, "I only want to be your friend." Alice smiled and said, "Okay!" She laughed and the ghost laughed too. From that day on, Alice was no longer scared of ghosts. She knew they weren't all bad.
