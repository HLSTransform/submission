Once upon a time, there was a puppy named Flash. Every day, Flash would observe the other animals running around the park. Flash wanted to run just as fast as them, but he could only run so fast. 
One day, Flash decided he wanted to be successful in running. He tried and tried to run faster and faster. He ran as hard as he could and he did get a little faster each day. 
Soon, Flash was running much faster than before, but it wasn't enough. Other animals were still faster. Flash was so upset that he could not run as fast as they could. 
But then, something amazing happened! One day Flash was running faster than ever before and soon he had reached their speed. Everyone started to cheer and clap for Flash and his success. From that day on Flash was the fastest animal in the park!
