Once upon a time, there was a bald man. Everyday he would walk to the beach near his house and admire the beautiful ocean. On his way, he would always pass by a small shop. He looked inside and saw a very special vase. The vase was so beautiful, the bald man just had to have it. 
He went inside and asked to the shopkeeper, "Can I make the vase mine?" 
The shopkeeper replied with a smile. "Of course! That will be five dollars." 
The bald man was so excited - he now had the vase! He quickly paid the shopkeeper and ran home. 
The bald man was so proud of his vase. He showed it to all his friends, who all admired it. 
The bald man said softly to himself, "I am so happy I was able to make this vase mine."
