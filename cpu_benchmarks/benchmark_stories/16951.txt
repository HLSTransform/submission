Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play and laugh together. One day, they find a big box of clothes in the attic. They decide to try them on and pretend to be different people.
Tom wears a hat and a coat. He pretends to be a doctor. He says, "Hello, Lily. I am a doctor. Do you need a check-up?" Lily wears a dress and a necklace. She pretends to be a princess. She says, "No, thank you, doctor. I am a princess. I need a crown."
They have fun and make jokes. They say silly things and giggle. They take turns to wear different clothes and pretend to be different people.
But then, Tom sees a pair of glasses. He thinks they are funny. He wears them and says, "Look at me, Lily. I am a teacher. Do you want to learn something?" Lily looks at him and frowns. She says, "No, Tom. Those are not funny. Those are my daddy's glasses. He needs them to see. You should not wear them. You should be kind."
Tom feels bad. He did not know they were Lily's daddy's glasses. He did not mean to be unkind. He says, "I am sorry, Lily. I did not know. I was just making a joke. Please forgive me." Lily is patient. She knows Tom is her friend. She says, "It's okay, Tom. I forgive you. But you should be careful. Some things are not for jokes. Some things are important. You should respect them."
Tom nods. He takes off the glasses and puts them back in the box. He says, "You are right, Lily. I should respect them. Thank you for being patient with me. You are a good friend." Lily smiles. She says, "You are welcome, Tom. You are a good friend, too. Let's play some more."
They hug and play some more. They have fun and laugh together. They learn to be kind and respectful. They are happy.
