Once upon a time, there was a obedient farmer called Joe. He was always very kind and worked hard on his farm. One day, there was a big storm coming, so Joe knew he had to act quickly.
He grabbed his hat and boots and raced to the barn. He wanted to move the animals to safety, but they wouldn't listen to him. They kept running away and wouldn't follow his instructions.
Joe was getting frustrated but he didn't give up. He was determined to keep the animals safe and moved them all to the other side of the farm. After a lot of hard work, Joe finally managed to get the animals to their new home.
Once the farm was safe and sound, Joe could relax. He was so proud that he had been obedient and acted quickly despite the difficult situation. Joe smiled, now he knew his farm was safe and ready for the storm.
