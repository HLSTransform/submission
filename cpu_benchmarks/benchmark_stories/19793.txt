Once upon a time, there was a fancy turkey. Every morning, the turkey would roll around in the green field. He loved to run around and have fun.
One day, when the turkey was out in the field rolling around, a sweet smell filled the air. The turkey stopped and sniffed the air. What was it?
He followed the smell and found a big oven. Inside the oven was a big fancy turkey, all nicely cooked and golden brown. The turkey was so excited and started to run around in circles! He was so happy he even started to do a funny dance - he rolled from side to side.
The turkey decided he wanted to be as fancy as the one in the oven. He ran back out into the field and rolled around to make himself look nice and fancy. Then he ran back to the oven to show it off.
The turkey was so happy that the oven turkey was impressed. The two of them rolled around in the green field all day until it was time for the sun to set.
The next day, the turkey was even more fancy, and he rolled around in the green field all morning until he found more oven turkeys to show off to. It was a perfect day!
