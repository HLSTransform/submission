Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go fishing with her grandpa. They would go to the lake and sit on the dock. Grandpa would give Lily a rod and help her cast it into the water. 
One day, Lily caught a big fish! She was so proud of herself. She yelled, "Grandpa, look! I caught a fish!" Grandpa was proud of Lily too. 
But then, as they were taking the fish off the hook, it snapped! The fish swam away with the hook still in its mouth. Lily was sad, but Grandpa told her not to worry. They would catch another fish next time.
