One day, Abbie went to the park with her mom. She saw a swing and ran over to it. She could not wait to reach up and grab it. With a heave, Abbie pulled herself onto the swing. She loved the feeling of the wind in her hair and the swing going higher and higher.
The swing was so much fun. Abbie was laughing and giggling. But then, suddenly, she was pulled off of the swing. She felt embarrassed and looked down at the ground. Abbie's mom had come to take her away because it was time to go home.
Abbie's mom said goodbye to the park, and they turned to leave. Abbie dropped her head in disappointment, but then she saw something that made her smile. Her mom had put her back on the swing so she could reach up and grab it. She giggled as she felt the wind blowing in her hair and the swing going higher and higher. Home could wait, it seemed. Abbie was happy again.
