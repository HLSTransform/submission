Sam and Lily were very happy. They were going to see their grandma and grandpa in a big aeroplane. They packed their bags and went to the airport with their mum and dad.
The aeroplane was shiny and loud. Sam and Lily got on the aeroplane and found their seats. They buckled their belts and looked out the window. They saw the clouds and the sky. They saw other aeroplanes too.
The aeroplane flew very fast and very high. Sam and Lily felt a little cold. They asked their mum for a blanket. Their mum gave them a soft and warm blanket. They wrapped themselves in the blanket and said thank you to their mum.
The aeroplane flew for a long time. Sam and Lily played with their toys and read their books. They ate some snacks and drank some juice. They saw the sun and the moon. They saw the stars and the snow.
The aeroplane landed in a new place. Sam and Lily saw their grandma and grandpa waiting for them. They were very happy to see them. They hugged them and kissed them. They said thank you to the aeroplane for taking them there. They saw the ground was white and icy. They were excited to play in the snow.
