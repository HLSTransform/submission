One day, a 3 year old boy called James went to the library. He was very polite and said hello to everyone he saw, smiling and waving.
When he arrived at the library he saw lots of people talking, reading and walking. He looked up at all the big books on the shelves and smiled. He wanted to read all of them!
James walked up to the lady and librarian and said hello. She smiled back at him and asked him what he wanted. He said he wanted to read.
The librarian smiled and said "That's very polite of you. You can read any of these books you want!" She pointed to all the books on the shelves.
James thanked her, took a book off the shelf and began to read. He was so excited! 
He read the pages carefully and spoke some of the words out loud too. He had such a great time at the library.
