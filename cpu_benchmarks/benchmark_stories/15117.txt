Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Samantha. She was three years old and liked to explore. As she was playing one day, she noticed a big, juicy steak in the grass. She was so excited and wanted to pick it up and eat it.
She asked her mom, "Mommy, can I have the steak?" Her mom replied, "No, Samantha, that steak looks dangerous. We don't want you to get hurt."
Samantha was disappointed, but she listened to her mom. She knew it was important to stay safe. She noticed a fluffy bunny nearby and decided to go play with it instead. She had lots of fun and soon, the dangerous steak was forgotten!
