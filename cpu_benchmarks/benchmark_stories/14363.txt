Once upon a time, there was a boy. He had a soft toy that he loved to play with. One day, he heard his mom call him for dinner. He didn't want to stop playing, but he knew he had to rush to the table. So, he put his soft toy down and ran to the kitchen. After dinner, he rushed back to his room to play with his toy again. The end.
