Tom and Anna are twins. They like to play in their room. They have many toys, but they also like to use other things. One day, they see a telephone on the table. It is big and shiny. They want to touch it.
"Let's crawl to the telephone," Tom says. "Maybe we can talk to someone."
"Okay," Anna says. "But we have to be quiet. Mom and Dad are in the kitchen."
They crawl to the table. They reach the telephone. Tom picks it up. He presses some buttons. He hears a beep.
"Hello, hello," he says. "Who is there?"
Anna takes the other part of the telephone. She puts it to her ear. She hears Tom's voice.
"Hi, Tom," she says. "It's me, Anna."
They giggle. They think they are very clever.
But they do not know that the telephone is hard. It is not a toy. It is a real telephone. And they have called a real number.
The number is 911. It is for emergencies. When people need help, they call 911.
A voice answers the call. It is a woman. She works at 911. She is serious.
"911, what is your emergency?" she says.
Tom and Anna do not understand. They keep giggling.
"Hello, hello," Tom says. "Who are you?"
"911, what is your emergency?" the woman says again. "Is this a prank call?"
Tom and Anna do not know what a prank call is. They think the woman is funny.
"No, no," Anna says. "We are Tom and Anna. We are twins. We are playing with the telephone."
The woman is not amused. She is angry. She thinks Tom and Anna are wasting her time. She needs to help people who are in trouble.
"Tom and Anna, this is not a game," she says. "You have called 911. This is for emergencies only. You should not play with the telephone. You should hang up now and tell your parents what you did."
Tom and Anna are scared. They hear the woman's voice. She is loud and hard. They do not like her.
They drop the telephone. They crawl away. They hide under the bed.
They hear Mom and Dad coming. They hear the telephone ringing. They hear Mom and Dad talking to the woman.
They feel bad. They know they did something wrong. They are sorry.
They come out from under the bed. They hug Mom and Dad. They say they are sorry.
Mom and Dad are not happy. They are not angry. They are worried.
They explain to Tom and Anna what 911 is. They explain why they should not play with the telephone. They explain why they should listen to the woman.
They tell Tom and Anna that they love them. They tell them that they should be careful. They tell them that they should be respectful.
Tom and Anna nod. They understand. They say they are sorry again.
They hug Mom and Dad. They promise to be good.
They learn a lesson. They learn that the telephone is hard. They learn that 911 is important. They learn that playing is fun, but not with everything.
The end.
