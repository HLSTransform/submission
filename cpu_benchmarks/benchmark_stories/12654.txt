Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Bubbles. Bubbles loved to jump and play in the grass all day long. He had many friends, and they would all jump together. 
One day, Bubbles got very tired from all the jumping and playing. He decided to take a nap under a big tree. While he was sleeping, a big bird swooped down and took Bubbles away. 
Bubbles woke up in the bird's nest, scared and confused. He missed his friends and his life in the grass. Bubbles tried to jump out of the nest, but he was too tired and weak. Sadly, Bubbles never made it back to his happy life in the grass.
