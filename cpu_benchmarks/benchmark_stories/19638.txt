Once upon a time, there was a leopard. He was very fast! He liked to explore and meet new friends. One day, he ventured deep into the forest. As he was walking through, he came across a beautiful meadow. He was so excited to meet new friends! 
He plodded around the meadow looking for someone to meet. He could smell a little cub nearby. He crept up slowly, trying not to make too much noise. He found a little cub, cuddled up in a bush! 
The leopard slowly stepped closer and said hello. The cub was startled but before he could run away, the leopard assured him he was just saying hi. The cub eventually smiled and hopped up to meet his new friend. 
He and the leopard spent the afternoon playing together around the meadow. They laughed and ran around - the cub was amazed at how fast the leopard ran! 
Before it got too dark, the cub said goodbye to his new friend and they hugged tightly. The cub was sad to see the leopard go, but he was looking forward to meeting him again soon.
