Miley had a friend named Lily. They both liked to play yoga. Miley was really good at it and Lily asked her to lend her a yoga mat. Miley said it was fair and lent the mat to Lily. 
They had lots of fun practicing yoga together. They moved their bodies into different shapes and laughed when they fell over. 
After playing, Lily wanted to lend the mat back to Miley. Miley said it was no problem and thanked her. They waved goodbye and Miley went home with her mat. 
Miley and Lily had so much fun playing together and they promised to play again soon.
