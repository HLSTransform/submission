Lily liked to perform for her family. She would sing and dance and make funny faces. She wanted to make them laugh and clap. One day, she had a new idea. She asked her mom to help her with a magic trick.
"What do you need, sweetie?" her mom asked.
"I need an onion and a knife and a plate," Lily said.
"An onion? Are you sure?" her mom said. She was puzzled, but she got the things for Lily.
Lily took the onion and the knife and went to the living room. She put the plate on the floor and called her family. "Come and see my magic trick!" she said.
Her dad, her brother and her dog came to watch. They were curious and alert. Lily smiled and held up the onion. "I will cut this onion in half and make it disappear!" she said.
She cut the onion with the knife and put the two halves on the plate. Then she covered them with a cloth. She waved her hands and said some magic words. She lifted the cloth and showed the plate. The onion was still there.
Lily frowned. She tried again. She covered the onion and said more magic words. She lifted the cloth and showed the plate. The onion was still there.
Lily was confused. She looked at her family. They were not laughing or clapping. They were waiting and watching. Lily felt a sting in her eyes. She rubbed them and sniffed. The onion was making her cry.
She dropped the cloth and the knife and ran to her mom. She hugged her and sobbed. "My magic trick didn't work!" she said.
Her mom hugged her back and wiped her tears. "It's okay, honey. It was a brave try. But onions are not good for magic. They are good for cooking. Maybe we can use them to make some soup later. Would you like that?" she said.
Lily nodded and smiled. She felt better. She looked at her dad, her brother and her dog. They were smiling too. They came and hugged her and said they loved her. They said she was a great performer. Lily was happy. She forgot about the onion. She decided to try a different magic trick next time. Maybe with a carrot or a banana.
