Once upon a time, there were two friends called Bob and Sue. They were both very young, only three years old.
One day, Bob looked up and saw a stair. He thought to himself, "That looks like an interesting thing. Maybe I could play on it."
He turned to Sue. "Let's play on the stair," he said.
Sue liked the idea. "Good idea," she said.
They both ran to the stair and began to climb it. It was a little hard so Bob suggested that Sue should find something soft to put at the bottom step.
Sue thought for a moment then ran off to find something soft. After a few minutes she came back with a big pillow. They both laughed and put the pillow at the bottom step.
Bob and Sue had so much fun climbing the stair with the soft pillow at the bottom. From that day forward, they always remembered to put something soft down before they started to climb.
