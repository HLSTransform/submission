Once upon a time on a hot summer day, two friends, Tommy and Mary, were playing together in the garden. Tommy was really thirsty and said to Mary, "Let's get some water, please." So Mary grabbed a pail and the two of them walked over to the old, rusty water pump that was near the garden fence.
Mary started to pump the handle and, after a few tries, the pump started to work and the water started to pour out and soak the ground. They filled up the pail and took it back to the garden.
Tommy and Mary sat down in the grass and both put their feet into the pail filled with cool water. They both sighed in wonder, feeling the refreshment from the cool water.
After a while, Mary looked around the garden and said to Tommy, "Look at all the flowers around us! Aren't they impressive?" Tommy agreed and smiled happily, looking around the garden full of vibrant colors.
The two friends stayed in the garden and enjoyed the sunshine until it was time to go home. But they both enjoyed the rest and refreshment they got from the cooling, soaking water in the pail.
