One day, Sally was discovering new things around the house. She stumbled upon a cute and adorable cup. She couldn't take her eyes off it. It had a gentle pink color and a smiling face painted on it. "What is this?" she asked out loud.
Just then, her elder sister came into the room. Without any hesitation, she grabbed the cup and said, "This is mine! You can't have it". Sally was really sad. She wanted to keep the adorable cup. She tried to argue with her sister but she wouldn't change her mind.
In the end, Sally was forced to leave without the cup. She was very disappointed and she knew that her sister was unfair. She went off in search of something new to discover.
