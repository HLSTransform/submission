Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint with her fingers and make pretty pictures. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a present. It was a big box with a bow on top. Lily was so happy! She opened the box and inside was a new set of paintbrushes and paints. 
Lily wanted to paint right away, but her little brother was being stubborn and wouldn't let her use the table. So, Lily decided to paint outside. She painted the trees, the grass, and even her puppy's nose! 
When Lily was finished painting, she went back inside to show her mommy. Her mommy was so proud of her beautiful painting that she put it up on the fridge for everyone to see. From that day on, Lily loved to paint even more and used her new paintbrushes every day.
