Once upon a time, there was a fair river. It sparkled in the sun and the light glinted from its surface.
One day, a little frog came to the river. He blinked and looked around. He could see rocks and plants, and he smiled.
Suddenly, he saw a sparkly stone by the bank of the river. He blinked and hopped towards it. The stone was so pretty and it sparkled in the light.
He hopped a little closer and reached out with his tiny hand to grab it. As soon as he touched it, something amazing happened - a rainbow burst out of the stone and filled the sky.
The frog blinked, in amazement. He had never seen something so fair. He smiled and hopped away, happy he had been able to make such a beautiful discovery.
