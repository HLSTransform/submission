John looked at something very special. He was watching a vase. It was big and made from shiny glass. John thought it was very beautiful. 
John went to the vase and knocked on it. He wanted to make it move. Suddenly, an old lady came out of the vase. She was very surprised. 
John said, “Hello! Can I watch the vase too?”
The old lady smiled. She said, “Yes, you can watch. But be polite.”
John nodded and watched the vase carefully. He was very polite and quiet. The old lady was happy and thanked him. 
John was glad that he had been polite. Watching the vase was a lot of fun.
