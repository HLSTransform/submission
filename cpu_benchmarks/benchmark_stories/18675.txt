Once upon a time, there was a big boat that sailed on the sea. The boat had a lot of friends on it, and they all liked to play together. One day, they arrived at a port, and they decided to explore. They had so much fun, but they forgot about the time. When they got back to the boat, they saw that the boat had left without them. They were all alone and didn't know what to do. They were scared and ashamed that they had missed the boat. They tried to call for help, but no one could hear them. They had to sleep on the port that night, and they were so cold and scared. The next morning, they woke up to find that the boat had sunk, and all their friends were gone. They were so sad and didn't know what to do. They had lost their friends and their home.
