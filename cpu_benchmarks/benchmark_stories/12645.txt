Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she saw a bird flying high in the sky. She said, "Look, a bird! It's so pretty!"
Her friend, Jack, said, "I want to climb that tree over there. Do you want to come with me?" Lily replied, "Yes, I love to climb trees!" 
So, they both climbed the tree. It was a big tree and they had to climb high to reach the top. When they finally made it to the top, they saw the bird again. It was flying around and making a loud noise. Lily said, "The bird is so loud!" 
Jack said, "Maybe it's trying to tell us something." They both listened carefully to the bird's chirping. Suddenly, they heard their mom calling them for lunch. They climbed down the tree and ran back home, excited to tell their mom about their adventure.
