Once, there was a little girl who loved sunflowers. She always talked about the sunflowers to everyone she knew - her mom, her dad, her friends, her neighbors. Everyone knew she loved them! 
One day, when the little girl went for a walk, she spotted a sunflower growing in a field. She was so happy and lucky to have found it! She ran up to the sunflower and gave it a big hug. 
The sunflower was very special. Every time the little girl came to visit, it would wave it's petals at her. And, when they were together, the sunflower would always mention how happy it was to see the little girl. 
The little girl always felt so lucky to have found this special sunflower - it would always make her smile!
