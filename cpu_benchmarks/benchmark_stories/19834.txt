Once there was a little girl who didn't like her meals. She always thought the food was too dull, too plain and she hated it.
The little girl asked her Mom to make something different, but her Mom said no and asked her to eat the same meal.
The little girl kept asking her Mom for something different, but her Mom said no. 
Finally, the little girl came up with a plan. She worked hard and cooked up a new meal herself. She added more flavour and it tasted much better!
Mum tasted it and was so proud of her little girl. From that day on, the little girl was allowed to make her own meals whenever she wanted - and she was never unhappy again.
