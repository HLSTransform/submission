Once upon a time there was a big gray tree. It was very tall and old. Every day, a little girl named Lucy would come and swing from it. She liked to swing very high and close her eyes.
Above her head, at the top of the tree, there were lots of different shapes. Big shapes, small shapes, and all sorts of colors. When she opened her eyes, she would smile at all the shapes. They were so fun to look at!
One day, the wind was blowing strong and she started to swing really high. She flew over the shapes and they all became a big gray blur. She laughed with joy!
Finally, when she came back down, she looked up at the tree and the shapes looked different. She noticed the shapes were all a bit bigger and brighter. She smiled once again and decided to swing again tomorrow!
