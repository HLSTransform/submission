Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved to study.
She studied her ABC's, numbers, colors and shapes. Every day she studied a bit harder and got smarter.
One day she was studying with her waist up on the chair, when she heard a voice.
It was her brother. He was telling her she was stupid.
She felt sad, because he was saying mean things. But she knew he was wrong.
She put her waist down from the chair and went to talk to him.
She told him that she was smart and studying would help her get smarter.
Her brother changed his mind and said that studying was a fantastic thing to do. He even asked her to help him with his studies too.
She smiled and hugged him.
They then both sat down and started studying together.
