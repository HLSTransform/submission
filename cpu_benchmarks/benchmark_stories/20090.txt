Tom was hungry. He saw his mom in the kitchen. She was making food for him and his sister. She had a big tray with plates and cups and spoons. Tom ran to his mom and said, "Mom, can I have some food?"
Mom smiled and said, "Yes, Tom, you can have some food. But first, you have to do something for me. Do you see this tray? It has different things on it. Can you tell me what they are?"
Tom looked at the tray. He recognized some things. He pointed and said, "This is a plate. This is a cup. This is a spoon."
Mom nodded and said, "Very good, Tom. You are smart. Now, can you tell me what this is?" She pointed to something that Tom did not recognize. It was round and green and had a stem.
Tom scratched his head and said, "I don't know, Mom. What is it?"
Mom said, "This is an apple. It is a fruit. It is sweet and juicy and good for you. Do you want to try it?"
Tom nodded and said, "Yes, Mom, I want to try it. It looks nice."
Mom gave Tom the apple and said, "Here you go, Tom. You can have the apple and some food from the tray. But don't forget to share with your sister. She is hungry too."
Tom said, "OK, Mom. Thank you for the food. You are nice too." He took the apple and the tray and went to the living room. He saw his sister playing with her dolls. He said, "Hi, sis. Look what I have. Do you want some?"
His sister looked up and smiled. She said, "Yes, Tom. I want some. Thank you for sharing. You are nice too." She took a plate and a cup and a spoon from the tray. She also took a bite of the apple. She said, "Mmm, this is good. What is it?"
Tom said, "This is an apple. Mom gave it to me. She taught me what it is. It is a fruit. It is sweet and juicy and good for you."
His sister said, "Wow, Tom. You are smart. You know what an apple is. I like apples too. They are nice."
Tom and his sister ate their food and enjoyed their apple. They were happy and full. They thanked their mom for the food. They hugged and kissed her. They said, "We love you, Mom. You are the best."
