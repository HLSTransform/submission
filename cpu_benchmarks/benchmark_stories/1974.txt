Once upon a time, there was a fun park for kids. In the middle of the park was a big square swing that was very smooth and slippery.
Two friends, Cory and Mark, saw the swing and decided to give it a try.
Cory shouted, “Let’s swing!”
Mark said, “That looks fun! Let’s do it!”
Cory and Mark grabbed onto the swing and started to swing back and forth. Cory and Mark kept swinging higher and higher until they felt like they were flying!
The wind blew their hair as they screamed and laughed. They went higher and higher until their feet were touching the sky! 
Cory and Mark had so much fun swinging on the smooth, slippery square swing that they stayed at the park all day. Every time they felt like they were getting tired, they just thought about their flying dream and started swinging higher and higher.
