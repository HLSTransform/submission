One day a little boy wanted to explore. He opened the door to the barn and peeked inside. He saw there were lots of creatures living in the barn. The little boy felt comfortable and curious, so he stepped inside.
He heard a noise and saw a horse. He was so excited and said, "Hello, horse! What is your name?" 
The horse looked at him and said, "My name is Lucky." 
The little boy was happy and said, "That's a cool name!" 
Lucky smiled and said, "I have some friends. You should meet them!" 
The little boy followed Lucky around the barn and met the other horses, cows, pigs, and chickens. They were all so friendly and comfortable. 
The little boy said, "Thank you for showing me around. This is the best day ever!" 
Lucky nodded and said, "It was my pleasure. Maybe we can explore the barn again soon!" 
The little boy smiled and opened the door to leave. He knew he would never forget this wonderful day at the barn.
