Once there was a boy named Charlie who was very curious and liked to explore. He found a haystack in the farm near his house, and needed to know what was inside it. He knew it was serious and should not go inside, but the curiosity was too much. 
One day he crept in, looking around. He found many interesting things! But then he heard a voice shouting, "Charlie, what are you doing in there?"
It was Farmer Jim, who owned the farm. He was very serious about his hay, and he did not want anyone taking it. "Charlie," he said, "you need to stay out of the haystack. It is not safe to play in here." 
Charlie knew it was wrong to disobey Farmer Jim and he felt bad that he made the old man so angry. He understood the importance of following rules and respecting other people's property. 
Charlie thanked FarmerJim and promised to never take another person's belongings without permission. From then on, he knew that it was very important to always follow the rules and never be too curious for his own good.
