Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and her teddy bear. One day, her mommy came home with some news. She said that Lily's grandma was coming to visit.
Lily was so happy! She loved her grandma very much. When her grandma arrived, Lily ran to her and gave her a big hug. But then, her grandma said that her leg hurt. Lily was sad to hear that her grandma was in pain.
So, Lily decided to help her grandma feel better. She brought her a soft pillow and a warm blanket. She also gave her a big hug. Her grandma felt much better and thanked Lily for being so kind. From that day on, Lily knew that hugs could make people feel better when they were hurt.
