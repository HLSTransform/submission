Once upon a time, there was an old lady who loved flowers. She would go to the garden every day and take care of them. One day, a little girl saw her and said, "Why do you like flowers so much?"
The old lady smiled and said, "Flowers are beautiful and they make me happy. When I see them, I want to applaud!"
The little girl didn't understand what applaud meant, so the old lady clapped her hands and said, "Like this! It means I'm happy and I like something very much."
The little girl thought about it and said, "I like flowers too! Can I help you take care of them?"
The old lady was happy to have some help and they spent the rest of the day planting and watering the flowers. When they were done, the little girl clapped her hands and said, "I'm so happy we did this together! Thank you for showing me how to applaud for flowers."
