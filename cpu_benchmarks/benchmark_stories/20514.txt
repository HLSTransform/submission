Once there were two bears who lived in the woods. One night, they got curious and decided to go on an adventure. They discovered a raft and were about to go on it when they suddenly began to quarrel. The bigger bear wanted to go on the raft first, but the smaller bear wanted to go first.
The quarrel went on for a long time and the bears almost gave up on their adventure. Then they had an idea - they could both go on the raft together! They worked together to take the raft down to the river, and started paddling. 
 
The bears paddled all night, which was very tiring, but eventually they reached their destination. They jumped off the raft and hugged each other, happy that they had been so curious and gone on an adventure together.
