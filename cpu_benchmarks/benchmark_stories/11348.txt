Once upon a time, there was a seal named Sammy. Sammy always swam in the ocean with his friends and had the most fun.
One day, Sammy's friends asked him to come to try the weird ice. He was a bit scared, but he was courageous and decided to join them. They all went to the ice and played around, having fun.
Suddenly, the sun came out and heated up the ice. It started to melt and soon enough Sammy was stuck in a big puddle. He tried to get out, but his flippers could not reach the edge of the ice.
Sammy's friends started to laugh at him and made fun of him. Sammy became very sad and started to cry. 
Then, one of Sammy's friends stepped forward and said, "It's okay, Sammy. We will help you."
Together, they all worked hard and eventually managed to get Sammy out of the ice. Sammy was so happy and grateful that he hugged all of his friends. He never forgot that day and always showed kindness to his friends.
