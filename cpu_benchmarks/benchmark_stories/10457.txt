Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He was happy and he loved to ride his scooter. He was very peaceful when he rode it.
Every day, he would ride his scooter around the park. He would go around and around, feeling so free and peaceful.
One day, something bad happened. A bigger boy replaced the little boy's scooter with one of his own. The little boy was so upset and he started to cry. He had been so peaceful while riding his scooter, and now it was gone.
The bigger boy didn't even stop to think about how the little boy felt. He just took what he wanted and replaced it with his own scooter. The little boy was so saddened and he turned away, not knowing what to do.
The little boy realized that he could never get his old scooter back. He was so sad and he sadly walked away, never to feel that peace he once got from riding his scooter again.
