Once upon a time there was a small, adventurous rabbit. He was always looking for something new and different to explore. 
One morning, the rabbit came across a big, red box. He was curious and demanded to know what was inside. After some pushing and shoving, he managed to open it. 
The rabbit was so excited to see what was inside! To his surprise, he found lots of tasty carrots. He grabbed a few and ran off in search of his next adventure.
Suddenly a big, scary fox appeared. He demanded the rabbit give back his carrots. 
The brave little rabbit didn't want to give up what he found, so he quickly hopped away and ran as fast as he could. He never looked back!
