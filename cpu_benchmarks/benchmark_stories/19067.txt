Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat melons. He thought they were the perfect snack. One day, Timmy's mom went to the store and mentioned that she would buy him a big, juicy melon. Timmy was so excited!
When his mom came home, Timmy saw that the melon was perfect. It was big and round, with green stripes on the outside. Timmy's mom cut the melon open and the inside was bright pink and juicy. Timmy took a big bite and it tasted so sweet and delicious.
From that day on, Timmy asked his mom to buy him a melon every time she went to the store. He loved how perfect they were and how they tasted so good. And every time he ate a melon, he remembered how his mom had mentioned buying him one and how happy it made him.
