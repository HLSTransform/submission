Once upon a time, there was a friendly dog named Max. Max loved to play outside and chase after balls. One day, Max was feeling very tired and wanted to relax. He went inside and lay down on his bed.
Max's owner, a little girl named Lily, came into the room and asked, "What are you doing, Max?"
"I'm relaxing," Max replied. "I played outside all day and now I need to rest."
Lily went to her bookshelf and grabbed her favorite dictionary. She sat down next to Max and started looking up words. Max watched as Lily flipped through the pages and pointed to different words.
"Look, Max," Lily said. "This dictionary has so many words. It's like a big book of words!"
Max wagged his tail and smiled. He was happy to have a friendly owner like Lily who loved to learn new things. Together, they continued to relax and read the dictionary until it was time for bed.
