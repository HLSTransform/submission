One day, Charlie went to the park. He felt something funny on his nose. He put his finger up to it and felt an itch. He wanted to scratch it but he didn't want to ruin his perfect day. He kept playing. Suddenly, he smelled something delicious. He was so hungry! He looked around and saw a pretzel cart. He went over and asked for a pretzel. It smelt perfect. Charlie took a big bite of the pretzel and it tasted so yummy. His tummy was so happy! The itch had gone away. Charlie ate the rest of the pretzel and it was the perfect snack. He was so glad that he didnâ€™t have to deal with anymore itches!
