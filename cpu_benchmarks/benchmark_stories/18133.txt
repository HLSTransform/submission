Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved muffins and ate them every day. One day, she went to the park and saw a man doing tricks with a flexible stick. She clapped her hands and said, "Wow, that's amazing! Can you teach me how to do that?"
The man smiled and said, "Of course, I can teach you." He showed her how to use the flexible stick, and Lily tried her best. After a while, she finally got the hang of it and the man applauded her.
Excited to show her parents what she learned, Lily ran home with the flexible stick. But as she was crossing the street, she wasn't paying attention and got hit by a car. Her parents rushed to the hospital, but it was too late. Lily didn't make it.
From that day on, the man at the park never used his flexible stick again. He would just sit and stare at it, remembering the little girl who loved muffins and wanted to learn his trick.
