Once upon a time there was a little girl named Susie. She loved to play outside in her yard. It was very big and long. Everyday, Susie would run around and explore.
One day, Susie found something new in her yard. It was a big, long stick. She thought it was so cool and wanted to show her mom.
When Susie's mom saw the stick, she asked if she wanted to keep it. Susie happily accepted. She was so excited to have something new to play with in the yard.
Every day, Susie would take the stick out and have fun. She would swing it around and pretend it was a sword. She would even use it to race across the yard and try to run as fast as she can.
Susie loved her new stick and was so happy that her mom accepted it. She loved playing in her big, long yard more than ever!
