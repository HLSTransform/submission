Once upon a time, there were two friends named Sam and Alex. They loved to play and explore together.
One day, Sam and Alex went to the beach. Sam had a bucket and a shovel. Alex saw a dolphin near the shore. He was so happy, he wanted to touch it!
Sam stopped him. "Be careful," said Sam. "We can't spoil the dolphin!" Alex nodded. He remembered that dolphins are special and should be treated with respect. 
They sat on the beach and watched the dolphin. The water was cold, so Alex and Sam decided to go back to the sand.
They built a sand castle together until it was time to go home. On the way back, Alex said, "I'm glad we didn't spoil the dolphin, Sam. It's important to treat animals with respect!".
Sam smiled and nodded. They had learned an important lesson about taking care of animals.
