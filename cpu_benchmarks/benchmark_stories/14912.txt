Once upon a time, there was a happy family. Mommy and Daddy loved their little boy very much. One day, Daddy had to leave the family to go on a long, far away trip. This made the little boy very sad. He felt so heavy inside. 
Mommy saw how sad the little boy was and knew she had to do something to restore his joy. 
"Come with me, sweetheart," said Mommy. They took a special trip to the grocery store. At the grocery store, there was a very large and colorful display of toys and candy. 
Mommy said, "Let's pick out something to make you happy. This is a special treat just for you."
The little boy smiled and was so happy. He left the store with a lollipop in hand and was full of joy.
On their way home, the little boy said, "When Daddy comes back home, can we welcome him with this special treat too?" 
Mommy beamed and hugged her little one.
The moral of the story is that kindness is always worth the effort. Kindness can restore joy and a happy welcome is always the best way to show appreciation and love.
