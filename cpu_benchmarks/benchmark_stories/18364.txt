Once upon a time, there was an adorable mole. The mole lived in a big hole in the ground. He had a lot of friends who would come to play with him.
One day, the mole found a beautiful rock. He did not know what it was, but he knew it was special. The mole showed the rock to his friends, and they all thought it was pretty. They knew it had value, even if they did not know what that word meant.
The adorable mole and his friends decided to keep the rock safe. They put it in the middle of their play area, so everyone could see it. The mole and his friends learned that some things have value, and it is important to take care of them. They were very happy to have the special rock and to be able to share it with each other.
