Lily and Ben love to play with their toys. They have many toys, but their favorite is the jet. The jet is big and red and makes a loud noise when they push a button. They like to pretend they are flying to far away places.
One day, they decide to play with the jet in the living room. They put the jet on the floor and sit inside. They push the button and the jet makes a noise. They say, "Ready, set, go!" and pretend to fly.
But the living room is not very big. The jet is too big for the space. It bumps into the couch, the table, the lamp. Lily and Ben feel uncomfortable. They have no room to move. They squeeze each other and say, "Ouch!"
Mom hears the noise and comes to see. She sees the jet and the mess. She is not happy. She says, "Lily and Ben, what are you doing? The jet is not for the living room. It is for outside. You are making a mess and hurting each other. Take the jet outside now!"
Lily and Ben feel sorry. They say, "Sorry, Mom. We were just playing." They take the jet outside and put it in the yard. They have more room to play there. They are more comfortable. They say, "Thank you, Mom. We love you." Mom smiles and says, "I love you too. Have fun, but be careful."
