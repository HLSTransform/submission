Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go to the beach and play in the sand. One day, while she was playing, she found a big net. She was so happy and cheerful that she started jumping up and down.
Her friend, Timmy, came over and asked, "What did you find, Lily?" 
"I found a big net!" she said, still cheerful. "Let's examine it together!"
They looked at the net closely and noticed that it had some holes in it. "Maybe we can fix it," Timmy suggested. They worked together to mend the holes and soon the net was as good as new. 
Lily and Timmy used the net to catch some fish in the ocean. They were so excited and cheerful when they caught their first fish. "This is so much fun!" Lily exclaimed. 
From that day on, Lily and Timmy would always bring the net to the beach and examine it to make sure it was still in good condition. They would catch fish and have cheerful adventures together.
