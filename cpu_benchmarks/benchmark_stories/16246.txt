Once upon a time, there was a small bunny. The bunny liked to explore and have fun. One day, it found a very cool cave. Inside the cave, the bunny discovered something very special. But, it was too scared to stay. Suddenly, there was a loud sound and the bunny wanted to escape.
The bunny was in shock! It hopped away as fast as it could. It ran outside and hid in the grass. Everything was quiet. The bunny was happy to be outside and safe.
From then on, the bunny was very careful when exploring. It never wanted to feel the shock of escaping again!
