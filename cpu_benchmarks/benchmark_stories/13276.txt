Once there was a little girl named Lily. She was very curious and liked to explore the world around her.
One day, Lily was playing in the park near her house when she saw three people wearing the same uniform. She was so excited to talk to them.
Lily ran over to the people and asked why they were wearing the same uniform. But the people didn't answer her. Even though they were smiling, Lily could tell that they were being ignorant. 
Lily was so disappointed and decided to go back home. As she was walking, she saw a tin can on the road. It was full of juice, so she decided to drink some. 
The juice was sweet and tasty and gave Lily energy to continue her journey. She finished her drink and left the can on the side of the road. 
As she walked away, Lily felt happy that she could enjoy something delicious, even though the people in uniform had been so ignorant.
