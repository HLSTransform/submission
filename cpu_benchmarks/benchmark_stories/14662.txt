The dog was feeling guilty. She had done something bad and saw her paw. It was a yucky feeling. 
So she decided to go and sit down in her favourite spot to think. She remember how much fun she used to have sitting there with her owner.
She thought and thought until she felt a little bit better. Then she slowly stood up and put her paw on her owner's lap. She was asking for a hug.
Her owner saw the guilty look in her eyes and smiled. They sat together on the sofa and hugged for a long time.
The dog knew that everything was going to be ok. She had her owner's love and that was all she needed.
