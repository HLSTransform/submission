Once upon a time, there was a gifted little girl. She was always looking for something fun to do. One day, she had a great idea.
"Mommy, can we go to the movies?" she asked.
Mommy smiled and said, "Yes, of course we can go to the movies."
The excited little girl began to imagine what kind of movie they would watch. Would it be a funny movie or a scary movie? She couldn't wait to find out.
Mommy put on her coat and the two of them went off to watch a movie that afternoon. It was the best movie ever and the little girl was filled with joy. She was a gifted little girl and she had just had the best day ever.
