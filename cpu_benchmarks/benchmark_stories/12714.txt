One day, a little girl named Jessie was in her classroom. She was playing a game and having a lot of fun. All of a sudden, she heard a voice shouting from the other side of the room. She ran over to see what it was all about.
In the corner of the classroom, Jessie saw a big, red fire-truck. She was so excited she couldn't help but shout out loud.
"Fire trucks are so good," said Jessie.
The fireman who was driving the truck said, "Yes they are, Jessie. And I work hard to help keep people safe."
Jessie smiled and said, "Good job! You're the best fireman ever!"
The fireman gave her a big thumbs up and said, "Thanks Jessie, that's very kind of you!"
