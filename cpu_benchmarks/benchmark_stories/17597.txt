Once upon a time, there was a clumsy boy named Timmy. He liked to play with his tools, but he always dropped them. One day, he was trying to fix his toy car, but he couldn't do it. He felt sad and didn't know what to do. 
His mom saw him and asked, "What's wrong, Timmy?" He shrugged his shoulders and said, "I can't fix my car." His mom smiled and said, "It's okay, Timmy. Let's fix it together." 
Timmy was happy and they worked on the car together. His mom showed him how to use the tools and he learned a lot. In the end, they fixed the car and Timmy was proud of himself. He hugged his mom and said, "Thank you for helping me."
