Once upon a time, there was a brave little bird. The bird had a family. The family lived in a big tree. The tree was in a pretty park. The bird loved its family very much.
One day, the bird went to find food for its family. The bird saw a big, red ball. The ball lay on the grass. The bird was very curious. It went to see the ball. The bird pushed the ball with its beak. The ball rolled and rolled.
The bird was happy. It played with the ball all day. Then, the bird remembered its family. The family was waiting for food. The bird was brave. It flew high and found food. The bird brought the food to its family. The family was happy. They all ate and played together.
