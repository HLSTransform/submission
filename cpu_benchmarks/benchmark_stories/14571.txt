Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue had a box full of toys, including a pair of scissors. Every day, Sue would take out her scissors and throw them up in the air. She thought it was fun to watch them twirl around and catch them again.
One day, Sue decided to make a game out of throwing the scissors. She cut out some paper in the shapes of stars and moons, then she tossed them up in the air. Every time she caught the scissors, she would try to catch a star or a moon. Soon, her room was filled with stars and moons.
Sue was so excited with her game she decided to share it with her friends. She invited two of her friends over for a tasty snack. After the snack was finished, Sue showed them her game with the scissors and the stars and moons. Her friends loved the game too and they all had so much fun throwing the scissors and catching the stars and moons. Even the grownups in the house couldn't help but join in and have a great time!
