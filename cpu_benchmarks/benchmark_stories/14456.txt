Molly and her mom were walking in the park. Molly saw a lot of trees and a pond. She was so excited!
Then, Molly discovered a little path that went around the lake. She saw that it was on the left side. Her mom said it was a secret path, and that they could explore it together.
Molly and her mom went down the path and saw so many things. There were colorful insects, frogs, and birds. Molly was so excited and smiled with joy.
The path was very flexible and they were able to go around the lake in so many directions. Even when the path curved and went up the hills, Molly and her mom followed it.
Molly and her mom had a lot of fun discovering the secret path. Now the path was their special place, and they visited it all the time.
