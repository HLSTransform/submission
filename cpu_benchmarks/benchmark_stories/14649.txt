Once there was a little boy. He always wanted to find something special. So, one day he decided to search. He searched everywhere he could think of. He looked high and low and in between. The little boy searched and searched, but he could not find what he was looking for.
At last, he stopped looking and sat down, feeling a bit cold. But then he saw something - a big smile! It was coming from the clouds and it filled him with warmth and happiness. He knew he had found what he was looking for.
