Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a green witch. She lived in a tiny house near the big forest. The green witch had a big hat and a long dress. She liked to play with her cat and make magic.
One day, a little girl named Lucy met the green witch. Lucy was not scared of the witch, because she looked nice. The witch asked Lucy, "Do you want to play with me and my cat?" Lucy was happy and she nodded her head.
They played all day, running around and laughing. The green witch showed Lucy how to make flowers grow with magic. When it was time for Lucy to go home, the witch gave her a big hug. Lucy said, "I want to see you again!" The green witch nodded and smiled. From that day on, they were the best of friends.
