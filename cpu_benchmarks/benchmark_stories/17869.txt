Mia watched as her family melted away. She had one last hug with her mom, dad and brother and they melted into the horizon. Mia was sad but she kept her original spirit alive.
The sun was shining and Mia picked a nice spot under a big tree. She sat down and closed her eyes. She thought about her family and smiled - she could still feel the warmth of their hugs and love.
Mia decided to use her imagination and close her eyes. Then she pictured her family with her again. She felt their hugs and the warmth of their love. She was so happy she started to jump.
Suddenly, Mia heard a noise. When she looked up, she saw her family walking towards her again. At first they seemed like they were far away, but then they came closer and closer until they were right next to her! Mia smiled and hugged them tightly.
Mia learned that day that families melt away and come back again. She also learned that families are amazing and she would never forget that magical moment with hers.
