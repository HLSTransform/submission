Once upon a time there was a silly ladybug. He was very famous, but also very tired. He wanted to take a nap so he decided to find a nice place to rest. He flew over a meadow until he came across a bright and sunny spot.
The ladybug settled down and was just about to take a nap when he heard a voice. "Who's there?" asked the voice. The ladybug opened his eyes and saw a dragonfly nearby. The dragonfly had lots of power and immediately the ladybug got scared.
The dragonfly shook his wings. "You are not allowed to nap here. This is my spot!" he said. The ladybug was too tired to argue so he flew away and went to look for another place to take a nap. 
The ladybug flew and flew but he couldn't find a place to nap in peace. He eventually began to feel really tired and just before he could fall asleep he heard a voice again. It was the dragonfly! He had followed the ladybug and was there to stop him from napping!
The bad news was that the dragonfly succeeded. The ladybug was too exhausted to fly away so he had to just sit there, wide awake and unable to rest. The moral of the story is that if you are famous, you might find it hard to take a nap in peace!
