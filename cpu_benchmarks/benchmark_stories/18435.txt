Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved eating cereal for breakfast every day. One morning, she asked her mom for a bowl of cereal, but her mom said they were out of milk. 
Lily was sad and asked if they could go to the store to buy more milk. Her mom said they could go, but they needed to lock the front door before they left. 
Lily was patient and waited for her mom to lock the door. As they walked to the store, Lily saw a bird in a tree and pointed it out to her mom. They talked about how the bird was singing a pretty song. 
When they got to the store, they found the milk and went back home. Lily was happy to have her cereal with milk and thanked her mom for taking her to the store. Her mom smiled and said she was happy to help.
