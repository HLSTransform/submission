Once upon a time, there was a girl. She was very happy. One day, she wanted to go for a walk. As she was walking, she heard something yummy. It was a purple ice-cream truck. She couldn't believe it. She quickly came to the truck.
When she arrived, she saw lots of yummy ice-creams. She asked for one. The ice-cream man gave her the yummiest purple ice-cream ever. She was so happy.
She enjoyed her ice-cream as she continued her walk. She was so happy she wanted to come back to the truck later. She wanted more ice-cream.
