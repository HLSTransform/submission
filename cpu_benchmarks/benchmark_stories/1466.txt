Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sarah. She was very excited to explore nature. Sarah was so excited that she ran quickly outside.
Sarah saw many exciting things around her. She saw mountains, trees, and birds. She was so amazed that she felt a bit dizzy. She couldn't believe how beautiful nature was!
Sarah ran around in the grass and played with the animals. She chased butterflies and laughed a lot. It was so exciting!
Eventually, Sarah got so dizzy from running around that she had to stop. She lay down and enjoyed the view of nature all around her.
Sarah felt so happy and excited about exploring nature. From that day forward, she knew that she would always love to explore the great outdoors.
