One day, a black cow was walking in the meadow. The cow saw a whip lying on the ground. She picked it up and store it away in her mouth.
Just then, a little girl walked in. She saw the cow and the whip and said, "That's mine! Give it back please!"
But the cow refused to give it back. She was scared to let go of the whip.
The little girl started to cry and asked her dad for help. The dad saw the cow and said, "Give the whip back. It's not yours."
The cow was hesitant. But at last, she understood and store the whip in the little girl's hand.
The little girl thanked the cow, and they all said goodbye. 
From then, the cow always remembered the lesson to always store things in the right place.
