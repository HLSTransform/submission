Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play together. One day, they went to the park and saw a big boat on the water. It was a yacht. It was white and shiny and had many windows.
"Wow, look at that boat!" Lily said. "It is so clean and pretty. I want to go on it and see inside."
Ben shook his head. "No, Lily, we can't go on that boat. It is not ours. It belongs to someone else. And it is too far and too deep. We might fall in the water and get wet and cold."
Lily and Ben disagreed. Lily wanted to go on the yacht, but Ben wanted to stay on the land. They argued and got angry with each other.
"Fine, then I will go by myself!" Lily said. She ran to the edge of the water and tried to reach the yacht.
"Stop, Lily, stop!" Ben shouted. He ran after her and grabbed her hand. "It is not safe, Lily. You can't swim. And the boat might move and leave you behind. Please, come back with me. We can play something else."
Lily looked at Ben and saw that he was scared and worried. She realized that he was right. She let go of the yacht and hugged Ben. "I'm sorry, Ben. You are a good friend. I don't want to go on the boat anymore. I want to play with you."
Ben smiled and hugged Lily back. "I'm sorry, too, Lily. You are a good friend, too. I don't want to fight with you. I want to play with you, too."
Lily and Ben made up and went to the swings. They had fun and forgot about the yacht. They agreed that they liked each other more than the boat.
