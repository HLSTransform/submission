Once upon a time, there was a big truck. It was enormous and very loud. The driver of the truck loved to drive fast and go on adventures. 
One day, the driver decided to go on a trip to the mountains. He drove and drove until he saw something shiny in the distance. It was ice! 
The driver got very excited and decided to drive on the ice. He drove around and around, but then he heard a loud cracking noise. Oh no! The ice was breaking! 
The driver quickly drove his truck back to safety. He learned that it's important to be careful when driving on ice. From then on, he always made sure to check the ice before driving on it again.
