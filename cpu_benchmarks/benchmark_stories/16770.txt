Anna and Ben are playing at the beach. They like to make castles with sand and shells. They have a big bucket and a small shovel. They work hard and have fun.
But then a big wave comes and washes away their castle. Anna and Ben are sad and angry. They scream at the wave. "Go away, wave! You are mean and silly! You ruined our castle!" They cry and stamp their feet.
A nice lady sees them and comes to help. She has a big smile and a big hat. She says, "Don't be sad, Anna and Ben. The wave is not mean or silly. It is just water. It does not know about castles. It just moves with the wind and the moon. You can make another castle, or you can do something else. Look, there are many things to do at the beach. You can swim, or dig, or collect shells, or fly a kite. What do you want to do?"
Anna and Ben stop crying and think. They look at the lady, and then at the beach. They see the sun, and the sky, and the birds, and the boats. They see the sand, and the shells, and the water, and the wind. They see the wave, and they smile. They say, "Thank you, lady. You are nice and smart. We want to swim, and dig, and collect shells, and fly a kite. We want to have fun at the beach. Come, let's go!" They take the lady's hand and run to the water. They forget about the castle, and they laugh and play. They are happy.
