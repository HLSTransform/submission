Lia and Kai liked to swim in the sea. They saw many fish and shells and corals. They had fun and laughed a lot. One day, they saw a big reef. It was very pretty and colorful. They wanted to go closer and see more.
"Look, Kai, there is a hidden cave in the reef. Let's go inside and explore!" Lia said.
"OK, Lia, but be careful. We don't know what is in there. Maybe there are sharks or eels or crabs." Kai said.
They swam to the reef and found the hidden cave. It was dark and cool. They saw some shiny stones and some strange plants. They felt curious and excited.
"Wow, this is amazing, Lia. I wonder what else is in here." Kai said.
"Me too, Kai. Let's go deeper and find out." Lia said.
They swam deeper and deeper into the cave. They did not see the sign that said "Danger. Do not enter." They did not hear the sound of water rushing. They did not notice the tide was changing.
Suddenly, they felt a strong pull. The water was moving fast and pushing them. They tried to swim back, but they could not. They were trapped in the cave. They screamed and cried, but no one heard them. They ran out of air and sank to the bottom. They never came out of the hidden cave. They never saw their family and friends again. They never jumped and played in the sea again.
