Lily was a chubby girl who liked to wear skirts. She had many skirts of different colors and patterns. She liked to twirl and dance in her skirts. One day, she went to the park with her mom and dad. She wore her favorite skirt, a pink one with flowers.
At the park, Lily saw a big slide. She wanted to go on the slide, but there was a long line of kids waiting. She waited and waited, but the line did not move fast. She started to feel bored and tired. She yawned and rubbed her eyes.
"Mom, can we go home?" she asked.
"Not yet, sweetie. You wanted to go on the slide, remember?" her mom said.
"But I'm sleepy. And my skirt is dirty. And the slide is too high." Lily whined.
Her mom looked at her skirt and saw that it had some grass stains and mud on it. She sighed and smiled.
"Okay, okay. Let's go home. You can take a nap and change your skirt. Maybe we can come back another day when the slide is less busy." she said.
Lily nodded and took her mom's hand. Her dad followed them. They walked to the car and drove home. Lily fell asleep on the way, dreaming of her skirts.
