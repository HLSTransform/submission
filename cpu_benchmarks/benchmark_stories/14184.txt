Once upon a time there was a little boy called Bob. He was three years old and liked to jog around the garden. One day he jogged through a dark forest. But Bob wasn't scared - he kept jogging on. Suddenly, the forest opened and he saw a bright meadow. The sun was shining and the grass was so soft and green. 
Bob laughed with delight and jogged around the meadow. He played all day and enjoyed the warm sun on his face. As the sun began to set, Bob jogged quickly back through the forest, now bright with the setting sun shining through the trees. 
Finally, Bob reached home and stopped jogging. He couldn't wait to go out jogging again tomorrow!
