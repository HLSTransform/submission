Lily and Ben were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a new boy sitting on a bench. He looked sad and lonely. He had a blue hat and a blue bike.
"Hi, what is your name?" Lily asked the boy.
"I am Max. I just moved here. I don't know anyone," the boy said.
"Do you want to play with us?" Ben asked. "We have a ball and a kite. We can have fun."
Max smiled. He liked the ball and the kite. He wanted to have fun. He said yes.
Lily and Ben welcomed Max. They played together. They kicked the ball, flew the kite, and ran around. They laughed and talked. They became friends.
They saw a big bin in the park. It was full of waste. People had thrown away cans, bottles, and papers. It was dirty and smelly.
"That is not good," Lily said. "We should not waste things. We should keep the park clean."
"You are right," Ben said. "We can help. We can pick up the waste and put it in the bin."
Max agreed. He said he had a bag in his bike. He got the bag and gave it to Lily and Ben. They used the bag to collect the waste. They put the waste in the bin. They made the park clean.
They were happy. They had done a good thing. They had made a new friend. They hugged each other. They said goodbye. They went home. They looked forward to playing again.
