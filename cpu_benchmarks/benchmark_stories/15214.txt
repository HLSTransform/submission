One day, Tom saw an ugly toy on the floor. It looked sad and lonely. Tom wanted to make it work, but it needed a battery. He asked his mom, "Mom, can I have a battery for my toy?"
Mom said, "Yes, Tom. Let's look for one." They looked in a box and found a battery. Tom put the battery in the toy. The toy started to move and dance. It was not sad and lonely anymore.
Tom played with the toy all day. They had fun together. At night, Tom put the toy next to his bed. He said, "Good night, toy. I am happy you are not ugly and sad anymore." The toy smiled and they both went to sleep.
