Once upon a time, there was a dad and his daughter. They went to the park to play. The dad had a ball and he set it down on the ground. The daughter picked it up and threw it back to her dad. They played catch for a while, but then the sky got dull and it started to rain. The dad and daughter went home, but they were happy because they had fun playing together.
