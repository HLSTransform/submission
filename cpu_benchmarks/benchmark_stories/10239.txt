Once upon a time, there was a fireman named Jack. He was a very brave man who loved to help people. One day, Jack was walking down the street when he saw a little boy who was lost. Jack asked the boy where he lived, but the boy didn't know. Jack decided to help the boy find his way home.
As they were walking, they saw a big fire. Jack knew he had to help, so he ran towards the fire. The little boy was scared and asked Jack if he was going to be okay. Jack just shrugged and said, "I'll be fine, don't worry."
Jack ran into the burning building to save the people inside. He was able to save everyone, but he got hurt in the process. When he came out of the building, the little boy was waiting for him. The boy asked if Jack was okay, but Jack just shrugged again and said, "I'm fine, don't worry."
The little boy went to get help, but when they came back, Jack was gone. He had died from his injuries, but he was remembered as a very brave and modest hero who saved many lives.
