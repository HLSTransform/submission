Anna loved to play the piano. She liked to press the keys and make sounds. Some sounds were high and some were low. She learned how to make songs with her fingers.
One day, Anna saw a big piano in the hall. It was shiny and black. It had many more keys than her small piano. She wanted to try it. She looked around and saw no one. She ran to the big piano and climbed on the stool.
She reached for the keys and pressed them. They made deep sounds that filled the hall. She felt happy and excited. She played faster and louder. She did not hear the footsteps behind her.
"Anna, what are you doing?" It was her mom. She sounded angry and scared. Anna turned around and saw her mom's face. She looked mad and sad. Anna felt bad and scared. She did not mean to make trouble.
She jumped off the stool and ran to her mom. She hugged her mom and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I just wanted to play the big piano. It was so pretty and fun. Please don't be mad at me."
Her mom hugged her back and said, "I'm not mad at you, Anna. I'm glad you love music. But you can't play the big piano without permission. It belongs to someone else. It is very expensive and delicate. You could break it or hurt yourself. Do you understand?"
Anna nodded and said, "Yes, mom. I understand. I won't do it again. I'm sorry."
Her mom smiled and said, "It's okay, Anna. I forgive you. But you have to be careful and respectful. Come on, let's go home. I have a surprise for you."
They walked to the car. Anna wondered what the surprise was. She hoped it was something good. She felt sorry for playing the big piano. She rubbed her eyes and sniffed.
When they got home, Anna saw a big box in the living room. It had a bow and a card. Her mom said, "This is for you, Anna. Happy birthday. I hope you like it."
Anna opened the box and gasped. It was a new piano. It was bigger than her old one, but smaller than the big one. It was white and shiny. It had many keys and buttons. It looked beautiful and fun.
Anna hugged her mom and said, "Thank you, mom. I love it. It's the best gift ever. Can I play it?"
Her mom said, "Of course, you can. It's your piano. You can play it anytime you want. But remember to be careful and respectful. And practice every day. Maybe one day, you can play the big piano in the hall. But only with permission."
Anna smiled and said, "Okay, mom. I will. I love you."
She climbed on the stool and pressed the keys. They made high and low sounds that filled the living room. She felt happy and excited. She played a song with her fingers. It was her favorite song. It was the song her mom taught her. It was the song of the piano.
