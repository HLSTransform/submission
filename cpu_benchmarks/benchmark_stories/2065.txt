Once upon a time, there was an elderly lady who loved oranges. She would count them every day to make sure she had enough. One day, a little boy came to her house and saw all the oranges. He asked, "Why do you have so many oranges?"
The elderly lady replied, "I love oranges. They are sweet and juicy. I like to count them every day."
The little boy asked, "Can I count them too?"
The elderly lady smiled and said, "Of course, you can count them with me."
So, the little boy and the elderly lady counted all the oranges together. They had so much fun that the little boy came back every day to count oranges with the elderly lady. They became good friends and enjoyed each other's company.
