Once upon a time, there was a brave knight named White Knight. He had a big white shield that he could hide behind.
One day, White Knight was walking in the forest looking for an adventure. Suddenly, he saw a giant! The giant was very angry and was ready to fight White Knight.
Though White Knight was scared, he was brave enough to stand up to the giant. He put up his white shield and was ready to fight.
White Knight: “Let’s match. If I win, you must go away.”
The giant thought for a moment, then said: “Okay, I agree. Let’s match!”
So White Knight and the giant had their match. After a long and tiring match, White Knight won. The giant had to leave and the forest was safe again.
White Knight was very happy and proud of himself. He went back home with a big smile on his face.
