Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to stargaze at night. One night, he saw a comet in the sky. He thought it looked so cool and wanted to see it up close.
The next day, Timmy went to the park with his friend, Johnny. Johnny had a yummy sandwich for lunch. Timmy asked if he could have a bite, but Johnny said no. Timmy felt sad and said, "I wish I had a delicious sandwich like that."
Johnny saw that Timmy was sad and said, "I have an idea! Let's bury your sandwich in the ground, and maybe it will turn into a comet like the one you saw last night." Timmy thought that was a great idea and they buried the sandwich in the ground.
After a while, Timmy realized that the sandwich was not going to turn into a comet, but he learned that sharing with others is more important than having something delicious all to himself.
