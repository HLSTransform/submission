Once upon a time there was a sport. It was empty and nobody was playing yet. 
Then one day a boy came. He was very excited to attach himself to the sport. The sport was happy to have him, so they began to play together.
The boy loved the sport. He spent hours playing it with a great smile on his face. He enjoyed feeling like he was part of the sport. 
The sport and the boy were very happy. They laughed and had lots of fun together. 
And they lived happily ever after. The end.
