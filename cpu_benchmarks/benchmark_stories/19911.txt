Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with blocks. She would build tall towers and knock them down. One day, Lily was playing with her blocks when she realized that she had made a mistake. She had used too many blocks and her tower was leaning to one side. 
Lily tried to fix it, but it just kept falling over. She felt sad and frustrated. Then, she had an idea. She decided to start over and use fewer blocks. This time, her tower was strong and straight. It was also very bright because she used colorful blocks. 
Lily was proud of her tower and realized that sometimes, it's better to start over and use fewer things to make something better. She learned that bright colors can make things look happier too. From that day on, Lily always made sure to use just the right amount of blocks and add some bright colors to make her creations even more beautiful. The end.
