Once, there was a dependable friend called Jean. Jean had a crystal that she loved very much. Every day, she polished her crystal to make it shine brightly. Jean talked to her crystal, telling it she would never forget it.
One day, the crystal became unhappy and tried to cry. Jean showed the crystal lots of love and kindness. She gave it a warm hug and said "My crystal, you can always depend on me."
The crystal's tears stopped and it felt much better. Jean carefully polished the crystal until it sparkled like the stars. She smiled and said, "My crystal, I will never leave you". The crystal thanked Jean and said, "Thank you for being my dependable friend".
