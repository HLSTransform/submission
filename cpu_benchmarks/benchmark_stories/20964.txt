Maggie was so excited to go explore the forest. She had a pink map and she was ready to find something special. 
"Come on, let's go!" She said to her friend Jake.
They both started walking in the forest, following the pink map. Suddenly, Jake stopped. Maggie asked him, "What's wrong?"
He answered, "I don't know what to do. I'm starting to panic!"
Maggie smiled and said, "Don't worry. We can use the map to find a way out of the forest. Let's just look at the pink map again".
They followed the pink map and soon they were out of the forest. Maggie was so relieved and happy. They had made it out of the forest! 
They hugged and laughed in joy, feeling excited about their next adventure.
