Once upon a time, there was a messy dog named Mark. Mark loved to play in the mud. One sunny day, Mark went to the park to play with his ball.
Mark saw a big goal on the grass. He wanted to kick the ball into the goal. He ran fast and kicked the ball with all his might. The ball flew into the goal. Mark was very happy.
Mark played all day until he was very tired. He went home to his bed, still messy from the mud. Mark's mom saw how messy he was and gave him a bath. Mark was clean and cozy in his bed, dreaming about his fun day at the park.
