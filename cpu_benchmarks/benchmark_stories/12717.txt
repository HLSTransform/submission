Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved playing with her toys and collecting shells from the beach with her dad.
One day, Lucy and her dad went to the beach, and she was very excited. When they got there, her dad said “We are going to find some oysters underwater for lunch!”.
Lucy watched as her dad swam to the ocean floor and returned with some oysters. But when Lucy went to take a closer look, she saw that the oysters were spoiled!
“Oh no!” said Lucy. “The oysters are bad! We should forget about them.” 
So, Lucy and her dad enjoyed the rest of the beach trip. They collected lots of shells and made a castle in the sand. 
So remember, don’t forget the bad oysters, and always have fun at the beach!
