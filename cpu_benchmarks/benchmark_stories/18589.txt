Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved Tuesdays because that's when his mom would bake him cookies. One Tuesday, Timmy went outside to play with his friends. He found a big rock and wanted to show it to his mom. 
Timmy's mom was in the kitchen making cookies when Timmy came in. "Mommy, look at my rock! It's heavy!" Timmy said. His mom smiled and said, "That's a nice rock, Timmy. Why don't you lay it on the table?" 
Timmy put the rock on the table and his mom gave him a cookie. Timmy was so happy. But then, he accidentally knocked the rock off the table and it fell on his foot. Timmy started crying and his mom rushed him to the hospital. 
The doctors said that Timmy's foot was broken and he would have to wear a cast. Timmy was sad that he couldn't play with his friends anymore. He missed his Tuesdays with his mom and her cookies. From that day on, Timmy made sure to be extra careful with heavy things.
