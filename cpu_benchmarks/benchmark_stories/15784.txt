Mummy and Daddy were sitting in the living room. Daddy said to Mummy, "We need to give Sam the pill. It tastes bad, but it will help him get better."
Mummy and Daddy went upstairs to Sam's room. Sam was sitting in bed. Daddy said, "Sam, we need to give you a pill. It tastes bad. Can you be brave?"
Sam looked up at Daddy and shook his head. He said, "No, I don't want to taste it."
Mummy said, "It's ok, sweetie. It won't last long. We'll get you something yummy afterwards. How about an ice cream?"
Sam thought for a moment and then nodded. He opened his mouth and Daddy put the pill in. Sam made a face and said, "Yuck, that tastes bad!" 
But in a few moments, Daddy had given him a yummy ice cream and Sam felt better.
