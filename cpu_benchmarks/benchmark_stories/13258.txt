Once upon a time, there was a bunny. The bunny was very silly, so it hopped around all day long. 
One day, the bunny came across a shelf. The shelf was very tall, and it was filled with lots of exciting things. The bunny hopped up and tried to reach the things on the shelf. 
The bunny wasn't able to reach them, no matter how hard it tried. Suddenly an idea struck the bunny. The bunny asked the shelf to accept it, and sure enough the shelf did. 
The bunny suddenly found itself on top of the shelf. It was so happy, it could finally reach all the exciting things. 
The bunny stayed on the shelf and explored the exciting things, until the sun went down. The bunny thanked the shelf and hopped away, feeling very silly, but also very happy.
