Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to clean up her toys and put them in a sack. Lily was slow at first, but then she got faster and put all her toys in the sack. 
After Lily finished cleaning, she went upstairs to play in her room. Her room was upstairs, and it was her favorite place to play. She had lots of toys and books up there. Lily loved playing upstairs, but sometimes she was slow to come down for dinner. 
That night, Lily's mommy called her for dinner, but Lily was still playing upstairs. Her mommy had to call her a few times before she finally came down. Lily's mommy was happy that she had cleaned up her toys, but she reminded her to come down faster next time. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
