Tom and Lily like to play with blocks. They make towers with the blocks. They try to make the tallest tower they can. They have fun with the blocks.
But Sam does not like to play with blocks. He likes to knock down the towers. He thinks it is funny to see the blocks fall. He is a silly boy. He does not care if Tom and Lily are sad.
One day, Tom and Lily have an idea. They want to prevent Sam from knocking down their tower. They make a trap for Sam. They put some blocks on the floor. They hide behind the couch. They wait for Sam to come.
Sam sees the blocks on the floor. He thinks they are part of a tower. He runs to knock them down. But he does not see the string. The string is tied to a bucket. The bucket is full of water. The bucket is on top of the door.
When Sam pulls the blocks, he pulls the string. The bucket falls on his head. The water splashes on him. He is wet and cold. He is not happy. He cries.
Tom and Lily come out from behind the couch. They laugh at Sam. They say, "That is what you get for being a silly boy. Now you cannot knock down our tower. We prevented you from ruining our fun."
Sam learns his lesson. He says he is sorry to Tom and Lily. He asks if he can play with them. They say yes, but only if he is nice. They share the blocks. They make a big tower together. They have fun with the blocks. They are friends.
