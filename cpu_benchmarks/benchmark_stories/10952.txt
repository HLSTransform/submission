Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She had a big box of toys in her room. One day, Sally's mom said, "Sally, your room is very messy. Let's organize your toys and make it nice."
Sally and her mom started to organize the toys. They found a pair of sunglasses in the box. Sally put them on and said, "Look, Mom! I have sunglasses!" Her mom laughed and said, "You look very cool, Sally!"
While they were organizing, Sally found a toy with a bad wheel. She showed it to her mom and said, "Mom, this toy is bad. It can't roll." Her mom said, "Don't worry, Sally. We can fix it later. Now, let's finish organizing your toys." And they did.
