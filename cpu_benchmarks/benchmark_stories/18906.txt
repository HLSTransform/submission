Lily was a big girl who liked to help her mom. One day, mom gave Lily a task. She said, "Lily, can you deliver this basket of cookies to grandma? She lives next door and she will be very happy to see you."
Lily was excited. She put on her coat and hat and took the basket. She said, "OK, mom, I will deliver the cookies to grandma. I love grandma and I love cookies."
She walked to grandma's house and knocked on the door. Grandma opened the door and smiled. She said, "Hello, Lily, what a nice surprise! What do you have in the basket?"
Lily said, "I have cookies for you, grandma. Mom made them and she gave me a task to deliver them to you."
Grandma hugged Lily and said, "Thank you, Lily, you are a brilliant girl. You did a very good task. Come in and let's have some cookies and milk together."
Lily and grandma had a lovely time. They ate cookies and milk and talked and laughed. Lily felt happy and proud. She said, "I like to deliver cookies to grandma. It is a fun task and it makes grandma happy. I am a brilliant girl."
