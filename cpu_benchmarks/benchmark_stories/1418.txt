Once there was a little boy, named Dan. Dan was three years old and lived with his mom and dad. Every Tuesday morning, Dan would get out of bed early. He liked Tuesdays because they were always fun, and usually something special would happen on Tuesdays.
Today was a Tuesday. Everything outside was gray and quiet. Dan went down to the kitchen. His mom had made him a special breakfast. It was Dan's favorite: cereal with milk and blueberries.
After breakfast, Dan and his mom went to the park. Dan loved playing in the park. He ran around, exploring and finding all kinds of new things. Dan only stopped running when he got tired. Sooner or later, he would take a break and sit in one of the swings.
Dan had a great time at the park, but eventually it was time to go home. As they were walking back, his mom said, "Dan, today was Tuesday and we had a lot of fun. Tomorrow will be Wednesday and there will be more fun! 
Dan smiled, happy that he had been able to get out and enjoy a fun special Tuesday.
