One day, a boy and a girl went to the forest with their dad. They wanted to cook some fish for lunch. Dad gave them each a spear and said, "Be careful and stay close to me. We will look for a pond with fish."
They walked and walked until they saw a pond with yellow water. The boy said, "Look, dad, the water is yellow. Why is it yellow?" Dad said, "The water is yellow because of the sun. The sun makes the water shine like gold. But we cannot drink it. It is not good for us."
The girl said, "Can we catch fish here, dad?" Dad said, "Yes, we can. The fish like the yellow water. They are also yellow and shiny. But we have to be quiet and quick. They are very smart and fast."
The boy and the girl held their spears and waited for the fish to come near. They saw some fish swimming and splashing in the water. They tried to poke them with their spears, but the fish were too fast. They missed them and made a splash.
The fish heard the splash and swam away. The boy and the girl were sad. They said, "We are sorry, dad. We scared the fish. We cannot cook fish for lunch." Dad said, "It's okay, my children. You did your best. We can try again another day. Let's go back home and cook something else. I have some bread and cheese and apples. We can make a picnic and eat under the tree."
The boy and the girl smiled and said, "Okay, dad. That sounds good. We love bread and cheese and apples. And we love you, dad." They hugged their dad and walked back home. They had a picnic and ate under the tree. They were happy and full. They thanked the sun for making the water and the fish yellow and shiny. They thanked the tree for giving them shade and fruits. They thanked their dad for taking them to the forest and teaching them how to cook. They had a good day.
