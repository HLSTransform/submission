Once upon a time, there was a bunny named Benny. Benny was very cute and adorable. One day, Benny went on a tour of the forest. He hopped from tree to tree and saw many animals along the way. 
Suddenly, Benny saw a big carrot patch. He hopped over to it and started eating the carrots. They were so yummy! But then he heard a loud noise. It was the farmer who owned the carrot patch. 
Benny quickly hopped away and continued his tour of the forest. He saw birds flying and squirrels playing. It was a fun adventure for Benny. When he got back home, he was tired but happy. Benny fell asleep dreaming of all the fun he had on his tour.
