Once upon a time, there was a small hut in the woods. In the hut, there lived a kind rabbit and a careless frog. They were very good friends.
One sunny day, the rabbit and the frog went out to play. They jumped and ran in the grass. Soon, they got tired and wanted to nap. They found a big tree and lay down under it.
While they were napping, a strong wind came and blew the hut away. The rabbit and the frog woke up and saw their hut was gone. They were sad, but they worked together to build a new hut. And from that day on, the careless frog learned to be more careful. They lived happily ever after.
