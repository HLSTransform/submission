Once upon a time, there was a boat. This boat was very popular with the people in the town. Every weekend they would take it out to the lake and go fishing or swimming.
One day, Billy and his sister Molly decided to take the boat to the lake. Billy was really excited and he said, "I'm gonna record us having fun in the boat!" Molly said, "Okay, let's go!"
When they got to the lake, they hopped into the boat and got ready to go. Billy got out a special recording device and recorded Molly and himself playing in the boat and singing songs.
When they were done, they both smiled and said, "That was a lot of fun! Let's go do it again next weekend!" Then they rowed the boat back to shore.
Billy had recorded a special memory that he and Molly could look back on. And every weekend since, they have kept taking the popular boat out to the lake. That's how the boat became even more popular with the people in the town.
