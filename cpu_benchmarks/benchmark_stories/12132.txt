Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they went to the park to play on the swings. Lily loved to move back and forth on the swing. She felt like she was flying! 
As they were playing, Lily's friend Jack said something that wasn't true. Lily knew it wasn't true because she heard the opposite from her mom. She told Jack that what he said wasn't true. 
After playing on the swings for a while, Lily felt a little dizzy. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When she opened her eyes, she saw her friends playing tag. She got up and joined them, feeling happy and dizzy at the same time.
