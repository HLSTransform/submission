Once upon a time, there was a little mouse who was very brave. He wanted to find something special so he decided to follow his nose. His nose brought him to a big house.
The mouse saw a bottle of wine in the house, and he knew it was important. He carefully climbed up to the top and opened the bottle. He smelled the yummy smell, and he decided to take a sip.
The mouse enjoyed the taste of the wine very much. He decided to bring the bottle with him and show it to his friends. He told them the story of how important it was to not be scared to follow his nose.
The mouse and his friends were so happy that they decided to have a party and drink the wine. They sang and danced until late into the night. They were so happy that the little mouse had followed his nose!
