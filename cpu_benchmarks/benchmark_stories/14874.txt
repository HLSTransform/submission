Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went outside to play in the garden. She saw a small, colorful beetle crawling on a leaf. Lily was happy to see the beetle, and she wanted to catch it. But the beetle was too fast for her.
Lily's mother came outside and saw her daughter trying to catch the beetle. She whispered to Lily, "Be careful not to hurt the beetle. It's a tiny creature and needs to be treated gently." Lily listened to her mother and decided to watch the beetle quietly. She saw that the beetle was beautiful, with shiny wings and a colorful body.
After a while, the beetle flew away, and Lily felt sad. But she was happy to have seen such a pretty insect up close. She whispered to her mother, "Thank you for showing me the beetle. I love its colors!" And Lily and her mother went back inside, happy and content.
