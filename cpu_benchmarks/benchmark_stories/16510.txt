Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her daddy. Daddy was cool because he always made her laugh. One day, Lily and daddy went for a walk in the park. Daddy carried Lily on his shoulders because she was tired. 
As they walked, they saw a big tree with apples on it. Daddy lifted Lily up so she could pick an apple. She was so happy! They walked some more and saw a pond with ducks swimming in it. Daddy carried Lily so she could see the ducks up close. 
Finally, they reached a playground with swings and a slide. Daddy pushed Lily on the swing and she giggled with joy. After playing, they went home and had some yummy snacks. Lily hugged daddy and said, "Thank you for carrying me and making today so much fun." Daddy smiled and said, "I love you, Lily."
