Lily and Sam were best friends. They liked to play with dolls and cars and books. They always shared their toys and snacks. They were happy.
One day, Lily's mom said they had to move to a new house. Lily was sad. She did not want to leave Sam. She gave him a hug and a picture of them. "Don't forget me, Sam," she said. "You are my best friend."
"I won't forget you, Lily," Sam said. "You are my best friend too. Maybe we can see each other again someday."
Lily and Sam said goodbye and got in their cars. Lily looked out the window and waved to Sam. Sam waved back and smiled. But he was not really happy. He was fake happy. He was sad too.
Lily and Sam never saw each other again. They grew up and made new friends. They forgot about their old toys and snacks and books. They forgot about their picture. They forgot about each other.
One day, Lily found the picture in a box. She looked at it and tried to remember Sam. But she could not. She did not know who he was. She did not know why she had the picture. She threw it away.
One day, Sam saw Lily on the street. He looked at her and tried to remember Lily. But he could not. He did not know who she was. He did not know why she looked familiar. He walked away.
Lily and Sam never knew they had lost their best friend. They never knew they had a memory that made them happy. They never knew they had a reason to cry.
