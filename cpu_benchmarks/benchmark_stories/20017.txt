Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun making different shapes and animals with their blocks, balls and dolls. Lily liked to make houses and gardens, and Tom liked to make cars and rockets. They were very creative and happy.
But then, Lily had an idea. She saw a big bottle of glue on the shelf. She wanted to make her house more strong and pretty. She took the bottle and opened it. She poured some glue on her blocks and stuck them together. She thought it was brilliant. She smiled and said to Tom, "Look, Tom, I made a glue house! It is very strong and shiny. Do you want to make one too?"
Tom looked at Lily's house. He thought it was silly. He did not want to use glue. He liked to move his blocks and change his shapes. He shook his head and said, "No, Lily, I don't want to make a glue house. Glue is sticky and messy. I like to make cars and rockets. They are fast and cool. You can keep your glue house."
Lily felt sad. She wanted Tom to like her house. She wanted to share her glue with him. She did not understand why he did not want to use glue. She said, "But, Tom, glue is fun and nice. It makes things more strong and pretty. You can make a glue car or a glue rocket. They will be strong and shiny too. Please, Tom, try some glue."
Tom felt annoyed. He did not like Lily's idea. He did not want to ruin his toys with glue. He wanted to play his way. He said, "No, Lily, I don't want to try glue. Glue is bad and yucky. It makes things stuck and hard. I like to move my toys and play with them. Go away, Lily, leave me alone."
Lily felt hurt. She did not like Tom's words. She did not want to go away. She wanted to play with him. She said, "But, Tom, we are friends. We always play together. Why are you so mean to me? Don't you like me anymore?"
Tom felt guilty. He did not mean to hurt Lily. He did like her. He was just angry with her glue. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I do like you. You are my friend. I was just mad at your glue. I don't like glue. It is not fun for me."
Lily felt hopeful. She wanted to make up with Tom. She wanted to play with him again. She said, "It's okay, Tom. I'm sorry too. I did not know you don't like glue. It is fun for me. But we can play different things. We can play with blocks and balls and dolls. We can make anything we want. We can have fun together."
Tom felt happy. He wanted to make up with Lily too. He wanted to play with her again. He said, "Yes, Lily, let's do that. Let's play with our toys. We can make anything we want. We can have fun together."
Lily and Tom hugged and smiled. They put the glue away and took their toys. They played with their blocks and balls and dolls. They made different shapes and animals. They were very creative and happy. They were friends again.
