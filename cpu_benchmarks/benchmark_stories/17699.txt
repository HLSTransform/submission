Tom was eager to go to the park. He was already dressed in his favorite yellow coat. He grabbed his show and made his way outside. 
Tom's mom picked him up and drove him to the park. When they got there he was so excited to get out of the car and explore. He ran around, picking up sticks and playing tag with his mom. 
He noticed another child and wanted to play, so he ran up to them. The child didn't want to talk or play, so Tom tried to show them his favorite toy. He held it up and smiled, but the other child still didn't respond. Tom was sad. 
Then Tom's mom stepped in and smiled. She pulled Tom close, gave him a hug, and said “It's ok. Show the other child your will, and then you can play together.” Tom smiled and offered the other child the toy. The other child smiled too and pulled it closer. They became the best of friends.
