Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a little boy named Tim and his dog, Spot. Tim loved Spot very much. They played together every day. Spot was deaf, but he was very smart and could understand Tim's signs.
One day, Tim had an itch on his arm. He tried to scratch it, but it didn't go away. He showed his itch to Spot and said, "Help me, Spot." Spot licked Tim's arm, and the itch was gone. Tim smiled and said, "Thank you, Spot!"
Tim and Spot went outside to play. They saw a big tree and decided to climb it. Tim was scared to go up high. Spot looked at Tim and barked, as if to say, "Trust me, I'll help you." Tim trusted Spot, and they climbed the tree together. They had a fun day and were very happy.
