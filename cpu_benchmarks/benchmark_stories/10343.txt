Tim and Sue were friends who liked to travel. They had a big map on the wall and they put stickers on the places they wanted to see. One day, they decided to go to the farm with their bikes. They packed some snacks and water and put on their helmets.
The farm was far away, but they enjoyed the ride. They saw cows, sheep, horses and chickens. They waved to the farmer and he waved back. He was a modest man who worked hard. He let them pet some of the animals and gave them some fresh milk.
Tim and Sue were having fun, but they did not notice the time. It was getting dark and they had to go back home. They thanked the farmer and got on their bikes. But they did not know the way. They got lost and scared. They tried to follow the road, but it was too dark and they could not see.
They heard a loud noise behind them. It was a big truck with bright lights. The driver did not see them either. He was going too fast and he had a whip in his hand. He was a mean man who liked to hurt animals. He saw Tim and Sue and he laughed. He used his whip to hit them and make them fall off their bikes.
Tim and Sue cried and screamed. They were hurt and bleeding. They wanted to go home, but they could not. The truck driver did not stop. He drove away and left them alone. Tim and Sue were very sad and afraid. They wished they never went to the farm. They wished they stayed home and played with their map.
