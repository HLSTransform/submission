Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her toy mouse. One day, Lily's mom saw that her toy mouse was very dirty. "Lily, we need to clean your mouse," said her mom. "But I don't want to clean it," said Lily. "It's my favorite toy." "I know, but we need to clean it so it doesn't get sick," replied her mom.
Lily's mom took the mouse and washed it with soap and water. "Look, Lily, your mouse is all clean now," said her mom. "Wow, it looks like a fake mouse now," said Lily. "What do you mean?" asked her mom. "It looks like a new mouse, not my old one," explained Lily. "Oh, I see. Well, it's still your favorite toy mouse," said her mom. "Yay, thank you, mom!" exclaimed Lily, hugging her clean and fake-looking mouse.
