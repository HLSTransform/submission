Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big green house with her mom and dad. One day, Lily's dad told her they were going to visit a farm. Lily was very excited because she loved animals.
When they got to the farm, Lily saw lots of animals. She saw cows, pigs, and chickens. But her favorite animals were the sheep. They were very quiet and fluffy. Lily wanted to touch the sheep, but her dad told her to be careful.
Suddenly, the sheep started to rush away. Lily was sad because she didn't get to touch them. But then, one of the sheep came back and let Lily pet her. Lily was very happy and she thanked the sheep for being so nice. From that day on, Lily loved sheep even more.
