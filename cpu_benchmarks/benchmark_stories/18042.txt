Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books with her mommy before bed. One night, they read a funny story about a talking squash. Lily giggled and thought it was so silly.
The next day, Lily and her mommy went to the farmer's market. They saw a big pile of squashes and decided to buy one. When they got home, they cut open the squash and found it was filled with seeds. Lily thought it was funny that the squash looked just like the one in her book.
Lily and her mommy decided to plant the squash seeds in their garden. They watered them every day and soon they grew into big, funny-looking squashes. Lily loved playing with them and pretending they were talking to her. She even read her funny squash story to them. And that's how Lily had a fun adventure with a talking squash. The end.
