Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a river in the park. It is very pretty. It has fish and ducks and stones.
Anna and Ben want to see the fish. They go near the river. They sit on a big stone. They look at the water. They see a fish with a red tail. They see a duck with a green head. They see a stone with a shiny spot.
Anna likes the shiny stone. She wants to touch it. She leans over the river. She reaches for the stone. But she slips. She falls into the water. Splash!
Ben is scared. He sees Anna in the water. She is wet and cold. She cries. He jumps into the water. He grabs Anna. He pulls her out of the water. He hugs her.
Anna is happy. Ben is brave. He saved her. She smiles. She kisses him on the cheek. Ben is surprised. He blushes. He is embarrassed. He looks away.
Anna and Ben are wet. They are cold. They are embarrassed. But they are still friends. They laugh. They run to their moms. They tell them what happened. Their moms are glad. They hug them. They give them towels. They take them home. They say they can play in the park again. But not near the river.
