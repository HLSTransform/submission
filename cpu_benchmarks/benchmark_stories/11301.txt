One day, a little girl named Lucy was playing in the garden. She saw a lemon tree, and couldn't help but gaze at it. She thought the lemons were so big and strong, and she wanted to pick one. She wanted to take a bite, to taste how sweet it was.
So Lucy carefully picked the biggest and strongest lemon from the tree. She was so excited, and she ran to her mom to show her. But, when she bit into the lemon, it was sour and not sweet at all! Lucy was disappointed.
Instead of eating it, Lucy decided to make lemonade with her strong lemon. She gathered up some sugar and lots of water, and mixed it all together in a big glass. When the lemonade was ready, she shared it with her mom and they both drank it in the garden, looking back at her beautiful, strong lemon tree.
