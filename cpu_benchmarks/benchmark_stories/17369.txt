Lily and Tom were playing in the garden. They liked to run and jump and laugh. But they did not like the mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were small and bad. They had sharp teeth and they bit Lily and Tom. They made them itch and cry.
"Go away, mosquitoes!" Lily shouted. "You are mean and nasty!"
Tom tried to catch the mosquitoes with his hands. But they were too fast and too smart. They flew away from Tom and bit him again.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tom said. "They hurt me!"
Lily had an idea. She saw a big leaf on the ground. She picked it up and waved it in the air. She made a loud noise with her mouth.
"Look, Tom!" she said. "I have a fan! I can blow the mosquitoes away!"
Tom smiled. He thought Lily was clever and brave. He found another leaf and did the same. They fanned the air and made noises. The mosquitoes did not like that. They were scared and confused. They flew away from Lily and Tom.
"Yay, yay, yay!" Lily and Tom said. "We did it! We scared the mosquitoes away!"
They hugged each other and laughed. They were happy and proud. They were lucky. They had fun and they had each other. They did not care about the mosquitoes anymore. They played in the garden until the sun went down.
