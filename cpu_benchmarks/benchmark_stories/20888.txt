Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a little girl. The little girl was three years old.
One day, the little girl wanted to go on an adventure. She went outside and saw a big tree. She walked up to it and sat down underneath. She looked into her pocket, and she found something special. It was an open book.
The little girl was so excited. She opened the book, and she was amazed. Inside the book were lovely pictures and stories about animals and places she had never seen before.
The little girl sat under the tree for hours, reading the book. She loved all of the wonderful stories she was discovering.
When the sun started to set, the little girl stood up and put the book back in her pocket. It was time to go home, but she would never forget her special adventure.
