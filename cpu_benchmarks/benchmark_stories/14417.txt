Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go on walks in the forest with her mommy. One day, they found a red mushroom. "Look mommy, a red mushroom!" said Lily.
"That's right, Lily. We need to be careful though. Not all mushrooms are safe to eat," replied her mommy.
"I want to eat it!" said Lily.
"No, we need to sort it first. Let's take it home and ask daddy if it's safe," said her mommy.
So, they took the red mushroom home and showed it to Lily's daddy. He sorted it and said it was safe to eat. They cooked it for dinner and it was delicious! From then on, Lily always remembered to sort the mushrooms before eating them.
