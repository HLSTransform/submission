Once upon a time there was a shy little girl who was feeling sad. She had no friends to celebrate with. Suddenly she saw something that made her heart swell with joy. It was a group of other kids playing together, laughing and celebrating. She wanted to join them, but she was too shy.
The girl's mum saw her watching the other kids and came to her side, putting her arm around her. "Are you feeling sad, dear?". The little girl nodded, her eyes still on the other kids.
"Let's go home and celebrate", said her mum, "just the two of us".
At home, her mum set out a tea party for the shy little girl. They laughed and celebrated, making silly faces and telling stories. After the celebration, the girl felt happy and no longer shy.
The mom smiled and said, "See, even when it's only us at home, we can still celebrate".
