Jack was very eager to finish his box. He had been working on it for weeks. He wanted to show everyone his hard work. It was a blue box with green stripes. 
Finally the day came for Jack to finish his box. He took out the glue and started to stick all the pieces together. When he was done, the box was perfect.
Everyone was amazed when Jack showed them the box he had finished. Everyone clapped and cheered. It made Jack feel even more proud. 
But then Jack's mom asked him if he had cleaned up his room. Jack was ashamed that he had forgotten. He quickly picked up all the pieces and put them away in the box he had finished.
