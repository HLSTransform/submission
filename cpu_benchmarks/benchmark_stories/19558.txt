Jill and Jack were twins who liked to play together. One day, they were in their room playing with the furniture. 
They climbed up on the chair and then the table. As they climbed higher on the furniture, they noticed something in the corner of the room. It was a strange looking box with a handle. 
The twins eagerly opened the box. Inside, there was a polite golden bird. The bird was happy to meet them and said, "Thank you for being so polite. As a reward, I will yield an unexpected surprise." 
The bird hopped out of the box and flew around the twins, scattering sparkles of gold everywhere. When the sparkles disappeared, there were two little bicycles just for the twins. 
The twins were so pleased with their surprise. They thanked the polite bird for being so generous. From that day on, the twins and their golden bird played together often.
