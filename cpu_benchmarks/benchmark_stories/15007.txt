Macy and her dad were out for a walk in the woods. "Look Dad!" she said. "What is it, Macy?" her dad asked. Macy pointed to the lake. "It's so attractive!" she said. "Let's go down to the lake," said Macy's dad.
So they went down to the lake and saw that it was frozen solid. "What do you think we can do with the ice?" asked Macy's dad. Macy smiled. She ran around the lake and then stopped. "Let's make an ice castle!" she said. Her dad was impressed with Macy's idea. So they started to yield ice pieces to build the castle.
Soon they had finished the castle. Macy and her dad were so proud of it. They smiled at each other. Macy ran up to the castle and said, "I'm the queen of this castle!" Her dad laughed and said, "Yes, you are."
