Tom and Lily are playing in the park. They like to slide, swing and run. They are very happy.
But then, Tom hears a loud sound. He looks up and sees a big dog. The dog is barking and running towards them. Tom is scared. He does not like big dogs.
"Help, Lily, help!" Tom shouts. He runs to Lily and holds her hand.
Lily sees the dog too. She is not scared. She likes dogs. She thinks the dog is friendly and wants to play.
"Don't worry, Tom. The dog is nice. Look, he has a shirt on. Maybe he is lost. Let's go and say hello," Lily says. She pulls Tom with her.
Tom does not want to go. He thinks the shirt is silly. He thinks the dog is mean. He wants to hide.
But Lily is brave. She walks to the dog and smiles. She says, "Hi, dog. What is your name? Why do you have a shirt on?"
The dog stops barking. He wags his tail. He likes Lily. He licks her face. He says, "Woof, woof. My name is Max. I have a shirt on because it is cold. My owner gave it to me. It is perfect for me."
Lily laughs. She pets Max. She says, "You are a good dog, Max. Your shirt is perfect for you. It is blue and red. They are my favorite colors."
Tom sees that Max is not mean. He sees that Lily is happy. He feels sorry for being scared. He walks to Max and Lily. He says, "Hi, Max. I am sorry for being afraid. You are a nice dog. Your shirt is perfect for you. Can we be your friends?"
Max wags his tail again. He licks Tom's face too. He says, "Woof, woof. Yes, you can be my friends. You are nice kids. Do you want to play with me?"
Tom and Lily nod. They say, "Yes, we want to play with you. Let's go to the slide. It is fun."
They run to the slide. They take turns sliding with Max. They laugh and have fun. They are very happy.
