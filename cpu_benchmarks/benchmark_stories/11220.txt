Once upon a time, there lived a special alligator. He could hang upside down just like a bat! But he was careful not to get too close to any of the other animals.
One day, he decided to take a closer look at some of the animals. He was swinging and hanging close to the ground. Suddenly, he saw a rabbit. He said hello to the rabbit, but the rabbit hopped away in a hurry!
The alligator was very sad. He asked a squirrel “where did the rabbit go?” The little squirrel replied, “Don't worry, he will be back. But be careful!”
So the alligator decided to be extra careful from then on. He was careful to stay away from any of the animals. But he still enjoyed doing his special hanging trick!
