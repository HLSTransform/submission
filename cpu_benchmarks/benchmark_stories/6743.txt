One day, a small girl was sitting in her room looking at her toys. She found a piece of paper and then smiled. She carefully picked it up and started to fold it. She folded it slowly and carefully until it looked like a grape. She was so proud of her new grape! She showed it to her mum who was very happy. She reached for the grape and gently held it. She was amazed at how perfect it was. 
The small girl then looked around the room and saw her big brother. She smiled at him, and he smiled back. Her big brother then took the grape and set it on the table nearby. He gently took his finger and started folding the paper again. The small girl watched in awe as her brother quickly and expertly folded the paper. This time he had made a plane out of it!
The small girl was so impressed with her brother. She smiled and clapped for him. Together, the two of them played with the plane and the grape, having so much fun. It was the best day ever!
