Tom and Lily were on a farm with their mom and dad. They liked to see the animals and play in the grass. They saw a big cow with black and white spots. The cow was eating some hay near a fence.
"Can we pet the cow, mom?" Lily asked.
"Sure, but be gentle and quiet. The cow might be shy," mom said.
Tom and Lily walked slowly to the cow. They reached out their hands and touched its soft fur. The cow looked at them with big brown eyes and mooed softly.
"Hello, cow. You are so pretty," Lily said.
The cow licked Lily's hand with its wet tongue. Lily giggled and rubbed the cow's nose.
"Can we ride the cow, dad?" Tom asked.
Dad shook his head and smiled.
"No, son. The cow is too slow and heavy for riding. Cows are not like horses. They are for giving milk and cheese," dad said.
Tom sighed and pouted. He wanted to ride the cow. He thought it would be fun and fast.
"Maybe we can ride the tractor instead," dad said.
Tom's eyes lit up. He loved the tractor. It was big and loud and fast.
"Yay! Let's go, dad!" Tom said.
He ran to the tractor with dad. Lily waved goodbye to the cow and followed them.
The cow watched them go and mooed again. It was happy to have some friends, even if they were not cows. It went back to eating its hay.
