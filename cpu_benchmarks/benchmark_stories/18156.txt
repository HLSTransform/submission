Once upon a time, there was a cool planet. On this planet, there were two friends, Tom and Sue. They liked to play and have fun together. They knew this planet was their home.
One day, Tom and Sue had a fight. Tom wanted to play with a big red ball, but Sue wanted to play with a small blue ball. They did not know what to do.
Then, a wise old bird saw them fighting. The bird told them, "You both can play with your own ball and still have fun together." Tom and Sue thought about it and knew the bird was right. They played with their own balls and had a great time. The conflict was over, and they were happy friends again on their cool planet.
