Once upon a time, there was a tall boy named Tim. Tim had a big bag with a zipper. One day, he wanted to weigh his bag to see how heavy it was.
Tim asked his mom, "Mom, can you help me weigh my bag?" His mom said, "Sure, Tim!" She put the bag on a big scale. The scale showed that the bag was very heavy.
Tim opened the zipper of his bag. Inside, there were lots of toys! Tim took out some toys to make the bag lighter. Then, he closed the zipper and weighed the bag again. This time, the bag was not as heavy as before. Tim was happy and decided to share his toys with his friends.
