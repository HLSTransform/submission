Lila and Tom were playing by the river. They saw a big raft made of wood and rope. It looked amazing. They wanted to go on it and have fun.
"Can we go on the raft, please?" Lila asked her mom, who was sitting on a blanket nearby.
"Only if you wear your life jackets and stay close to the shore," her mom said. "And be careful, the raft might not be very strong."
Lila and Tom put on their life jackets and ran to the raft. They climbed on it and felt it move on the water. They pretended they were pirates and explorers. They waved to their mom and shouted, "Ahoy, matey!"
They had a lot of fun on the raft, but then they heard a loud crack. The raft was breaking apart. They felt scared and wet. They grabbed each other and tried to swim to the shore.
Their mom saw them and ran to help them. She pulled them out of the water and hugged them. She was glad they were safe.
"I'm sorry, mom," Lila said. "The raft seemed so amazing, but it was not."
"It's okay, sweetie," her mom said. "You did the right thing to swim to the shore. Next time, we'll find a better raft to play with. How about we go home and have some hot chocolate?"
Lila and Tom nodded and smiled. They were happy to have their mom and each other. They learned a lesson about the raft. They still liked to play by the river, but they were more careful.
