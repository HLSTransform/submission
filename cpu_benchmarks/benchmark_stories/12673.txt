Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to eat pears. One day, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to go to the store to buy some pears. Lily said yes and they went to the store together.
At the store, Lily saw her friend Timmy. Timmy was holding a big, difficult puzzle. Lily asked him if he wanted to play with her. Timmy said, "I can't play right now, this puzzle is too difficult for me. But we can talk while I work on it."
Lily and Timmy talked about their favorite colors and animals while Lily's mom picked out some juicy pears. When they were done, Lily's mom gave them each a pear to eat. They sat down on a bench and enjoyed their sweet snacks while continuing to talk and laugh together.
