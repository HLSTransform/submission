Once upon a time, there was a big bird that could fly really high. His name was Titch. One evening, the sky was very clear and Titch wanted to fly higher than usual.
He said to his mum: “Mum, I want to fly higher. Can I?” But his mum said: “No darling, it’s too late. It will be dark soon and it’s too dangerous. You need to be careful.”
Titch was disappointed, but he listened to what his mum said. He decided to look for a safer place for his fun. In the end, he decided to have fun in a nearby park and only when the sky was clear.
The moral of the story is to always be careful and listen to the grown-ups. Even when the sky looks beautiful and clear, it is better to be safe and have fun in a safer place.
