Once there was a little boy named Joe. He was three years old and always very happy. One day, Joe wanted to try something new and exciting. He decided to take a walk in the park.
Joe's mom told him to stay close and to trust her. Joe listened and held her hand as he followed her through the park. He was happy to be with his mom and explore new places.
But then, something strange happened. They came to a place with a big sign. Joe looked up at the sign and it said "Do not enter". Joe was upset. He didn't want his mom to leave him. But his mom said not to worry and to trust her.
Joe was scared but he listened and stayed close to his mom. She hugged him tight and they walked around the sign. Joe was excited to see what was on the other side.
When they finally got around the sign, Joe found out it was safe. He was relieved and happy to trust his mom. Together, they explored the park and Joe learned an important lesson - trust your mom!
