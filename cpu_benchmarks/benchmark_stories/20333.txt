Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big tree with green fruits. Sue says, "Look, Tom, limes! I like limes. They are sour and good."
Tom says, "Me too. Let's pick some limes. We can make juice later." They run to the tree. They try to reach the limes. But the limes are too high. They jump and stretch. But they cannot get the limes.
They see a big branch. The branch is low and long. Tom says, "I have an idea. We can use the branch as a spring. We can sit on the branch and bounce. Then we can fly and catch the limes."
Sue says, "That sounds fun. Let's try it." They sit on the branch. They push with their feet. The branch bends and swings. They feel the wind in their hair. They laugh and shout.
They see a lime near them. Tom says, "Now, Sue, spring!" They spring from the branch. They reach for the lime. They touch the lime. But the lime is too hard. It does not come off. It stays on the tree. Tom and Sue fall to the ground. They land on the grass. They are not hurt. But they are sad. They did not get the lime.
They hear a voice. It is the park keeper. He is alert. He saw them playing on the tree. He says, "Hey, you two, what are you doing? You cannot play on the tree. You can break the branch. You can hurt the tree. You can hurt yourselves. That is not nice. That is not safe."
Tom and Sue feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, sir. We just wanted some limes. We like limes. We did not mean to hurt the tree. We did not know it was bad."
The park keeper says, "I understand. Limes are good. But you cannot take them from the tree. They are not yours. They belong to the tree. The tree needs them to grow and be healthy. You can buy limes from the store. Or you can ask me. I have some limes in my shed. I can give you some. But you have to promise me. You will not play on the tree again. You will be careful and respectful. You will be good."
Tom and Sue nod. They say, "We promise, sir. We will not play on the tree again. We will be careful and respectful. We will be good." They smile. They thank the park keeper. He gives them some limes. They are happy. They say goodbye. They go home. They make juice. They drink the juice. They say, "Mmm, limes are sour and good." They are friends. They are happy. The end.
