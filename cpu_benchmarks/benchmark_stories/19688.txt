There was a boy named Brad who was three years old. Brad was curious about the world and he wanted to learn all he could.
One day, his mother took him to an igloo. It was very cold outside, but he was very excited! They went inside the igloo and Brad saw that it was very interesting.
There was a lot to learn here. His mom showed him how the walls of the igloo were built with blocks of ice. He also learned about how igloos were used by people for shelter in the ancient past.
Brad had a wonderful time learning about the igloo. His mind was filled with exciting, new knowledge. He knew he would remember this interesting experience for a long time.
