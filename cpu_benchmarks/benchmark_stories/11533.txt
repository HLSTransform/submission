Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max had a soft mattress to sleep on every night. But one day, Max did something naughty. He dug a hole in the yard and got mud all over his paws. Max felt ashamed of what he did.
Max's friend, a little bird named Lucy, saw Max looking sad. She asked, "Max, why are you sad?" Max said, "I am ashamed because I made a mess with my paws." Lucy wanted to help Max feel better.
Lucy found a way to clean Max's paws. She took Max to a small pond and helped him wash the mud off. Max was so happy that his paws were clean again. He didn't have to suffer from feeling ashamed anymore. That night, Max slept on his clean mattress with a big smile on his face. And from that day on, Max and Lucy were the best of friends.
