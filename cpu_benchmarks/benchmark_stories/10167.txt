Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved waking up early to watch the sunrise. She would sit on her porch and watch as the sky turned pink and orange.
One day, Lily's little brother, Max, woke up early too. He wanted to watch the sunrise with Lily. But Lily didn't want Max to sit with her. She wanted to watch the sunrise alone.
Max was sad, but he was patient. He decided to study the birds in the backyard while Lily watched the sunrise. After a while, Lily realized that it was more fun to watch the sunrise with her brother. They sat together and watched the sunrise every morning after that.
