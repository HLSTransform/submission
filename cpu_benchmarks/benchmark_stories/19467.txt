Once upon a time, there was a man who wanted to create something special. He worked really hard to make it. Finally, he made a hot motorcycle. He took it for a drive around town. Everyone was excited to see it!
The man was so proud of his creation. The motorcyle was fast and strong. Everywhere he went, people waved and cheered at him. It made the man feel very happy.
Soon, he made lots of motorcyles that were even hotter. Everyone wanted to have one just like the man's. He taught them how to make the motorcyle and soon lots of people had their own hot motorcyles. 
The man was so proud of all the people he had helped create their own hot motorcycle. They all enjoyed riding them around town and having fun. 
The end.
