Kate was 3 years old and she liked to take things slow. She took her time playing with her toys, and she also liked to sit quietly and just watch the world around her. One day, Kate was outside in her backyard. Everything around her was still, and she could hear the peaceful sound of birds chirping in the trees. She slowly looked around, and recognized the beauty of the green grass, the blue sky above and the warm sunshine. Kate smiled and relaxed in the peaceful atmosphere. She felt so happy and calm, and was just so content to be able to recognize the peace in her world.
