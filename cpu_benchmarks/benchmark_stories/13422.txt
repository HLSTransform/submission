Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the park and chase after butterflies. One day, Timmy's mom told him it was time to go home and bathe before dinner. Timmy didn't want to stop playing, but he knew he had to listen to his mom.
After Timmy took his bath, he put on his pajamas and went to bed. As he lay there, he looked up at the world map on his wall. He thought about all the different countries and how they looked so different from his own. Timmy thought the world was very big and interesting.
The next day, Timmy went back to the park to play. He saw a beautiful butterfly and followed it to a flower that was very attractive. Timmy thought the flower was the prettiest thing he had ever seen. He was so happy he had taken a bath the night before and was able to enjoy the park and the attractive flower.
