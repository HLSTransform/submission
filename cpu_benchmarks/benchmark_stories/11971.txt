Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars, especially his red motor car. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to go to the store to buy some milk. Timmy was so excited to go on an adventure and lead the way to the store.
As Timmy was walking to the store, he saw a careless man walking on the street. The man was not looking where he was going and almost bumped into Timmy. Timmy quickly moved out of the way and continued on his journey.
When Timmy arrived at the store, he saw his friend Johnny. Johnny asked Timmy what he was doing and Timmy replied, "I'm buying milk for my mom." Johnny said, "That's so nice of you to help your mom. Can I come with you?" Timmy said, "Sure, you can lead the way back home."
Timmy and Johnny walked back home with the milk and Timmy's red motor car. Timmy's mom was so happy to see them and gave them both a big hug. From that day on, Timmy learned that it's important to be careful and always look where you're going.
