Lily and Tom were twins who liked to go to the park with their mom. They had to take the bus to get there, and they always sat by the window to see the cars and the trees and the people. Sometimes they saw dogs and cats and birds, too.
One day, when they were on the bus, they heard a loud roar. They looked out the window and saw a big, fierce lion. It had escaped from the zoo and was running on the street. It had sharp teeth and claws and a long mane. Lily and Tom were scared and hugged their mom.
"Mom, what is that?" Lily asked.
"That is a lion, sweetie. It is a wild animal that lives in Africa. It should not be here. The zookeepers are trying to catch it and take it back to the zoo," mom said.
"Will it hurt us?" Tom asked.
"No, honey. The bus is safe. The lion cannot get in. We just have to stay calm and pray that the lion does not hurt anyone or itself," mom said.
Lily and Tom nodded and closed their eyes. They prayed to God to protect them and the lion and everyone else. They prayed until they heard a siren and saw a big truck with a cage. The zookeepers had caught the lion and put it in the cage. They drove away with the lion, and the bus continued to the park.
Lily and Tom opened their eyes and smiled. They thanked God for answering their prayers. They were not scared anymore. They were happy to go to the park and play. They hoped the lion was happy, too, in its home at the zoo.
