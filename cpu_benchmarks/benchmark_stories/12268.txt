Once upon a time there were two friends, Jack and Ann. They decided it was time for an adventure, so off they went on a grand journey! 
As they walked, Jack turned to Ann and said, "I hear a giant is available somewhere nearby." Ann got very excited and asked, "Do you think we can find it?" 
Jack replied, "Let's look around and see if we can find any clues. With a bit of luck, maybe we can find the giant!" So, Jack and Ann decided to explore the area.
As they continued, they came upon a huge patch of bright green flowers. "Spring has come!" they both said together. 
Jack realized that these flowers were the clue they needed to find the giant. They quickly followed the flower path, and soon enough they found the giant! 
Jack and Ann were so excited. The giant saw them and smiled. "Welcome! I'm so glad you found me."
The giant's smile made Jack and Ann feel very brave. They looked at each other and whispered, "Let's go explore the giant's world!"
