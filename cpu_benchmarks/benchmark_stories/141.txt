Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty dress and loved to play outside. One day, Lily's mom asked her to go to the store to buy some sugar.
Lily was excited to go to the store, but when she got there, she saw a big line. The line was very long, and it made her feel sad because it would delay her from getting home to play.
She waited patiently in line and finally got the sugar. On her way back home, she met her friend, Timmy. Timmy said, "Wow, Lily, your dress is so pretty!" Lily smiled and replied, "Thanks, I went to the store to get some sugar, but the line was so long that it delayed me." Timmy said, "That's okay, let's go play!" And they ran off to play together.
