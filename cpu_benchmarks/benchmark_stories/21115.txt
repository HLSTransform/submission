Once upon a time, there was a tall tree. It lived near a train station. The tree was very big and strong. It had lots of green leaves.
One day, a big wind came. The wind tried to push the tree down. The tree did not want to fall. It tried to resist the wind. It held on tight to the ground with its roots.
The wind blew and blew, but the tree did not fall. The tree was brave and strong. It showed that if you resist and stay strong, you can face anything. And that is the moral of the story: be brave and strong like the tall tree.
