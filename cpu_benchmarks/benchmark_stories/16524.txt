Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went outside to play with her ball. She bounced it up and down, up and down, until it rolled away. Lily ran after it and found herself in a big, open field. 
She saw a group of kids playing a game. They were running around in a circle, laughing and having fun. Lily wanted to join in, but she didn't know how to play. Suddenly, she realized that she could just ask them to teach her. 
After playing for a while, the sun started to set and Lily knew it was time to go home. She started walking back, but then she saw a puddle. She stepped in it and her shoes got all wet. She was sad because she didn't like wet shoes. But then she remembered that the sun would dry them off. She felt happy again and skipped all the way home.
