Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was a teddy bear. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and brought her teddy bear in a bag. The sun was shining and the sky was blue.
As they were walking, Lily saw a beautiful butterfly. It was flying in the air and its wings were glowing in the sunlight. Lily wanted to catch it, so she opened her bag and tried to catch the butterfly. But the butterfly flew away.
Lily was sad and wanted to go home. As they were walking back, they saw a big, terrible storm cloud in the sky. It was getting closer and closer. Suddenly, there was a loud thunder and a bright light that made the sky glow. Lily was scared and held onto her mom's hand tightly.
They ran as fast as they could, but they couldn't make it home in time. The storm was too strong and a big tree fell on them. Lily and her mom were hurt and couldn't get up. They called for help, but no one heard them. It was a terrible ending to a beautiful day.
