Tim and Sam were brothers. They liked to play in the woods behind their house. One day, they saw a deer in the woods. The deer was brown and had big horns.
"Wow, look at the deer!" Tim said. "Let's go closer and say hello."
"No, Tim, that's a bad idea," Sam said. "The deer might be scared or angry. We should stay away."
But Tim did not listen to Sam. He ran towards the deer and tried to touch it. The deer did not like that. It kicked Tim with its hoof and ran away.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tim cried. He fell to the ground and held his leg. It was bleeding and hurt a lot.
"Tim, are you okay?" Sam asked. He ran to Tim and tried to help him. He was scared and sorry.
"I'm not okay, Sam," Tim said. "The deer hurt me. Why did you let me go?"
"I told you not to go, Tim," Sam said. "But you did not listen to me. You were silly and rude to the deer. Now we have to go home and tell Mom."
They walked back to their house, slowly and sadly. Tim was still crying and Sam was still sorry. Mom was angry and worried when she saw them. She took Tim to the doctor and Sam to his room. They had no more fun that day. It was a boring and bad day. They learned to be careful and kind in the woods.
