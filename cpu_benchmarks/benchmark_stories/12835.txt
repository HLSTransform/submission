Once upon a time there lived a cool monkey. Every day he visited his best friend, the parrot. They had so much fun together, playing games, singing songs and telling stories. But the parrot always seemed sad.
One day, the monkey asked why the parrot was so sad. The parrot said, “I had a very special image and I lost it. I'm so sad, I don't know what to do.”
The monkey thought and thought and then he had an idea. He said, “Let's visit the wise old owl. He knows a lot and he might be able to help.”
The parrot agreed, so they went to visit the owl. The owl asked the parrot to tell him the story of the image. The parrot told the story and the owl smiled. He said, “I know where your image is. Follow me!”
The parrot was filled with excitement. He followed the owl to a cool cave and there, in the corner, was the parrot’s lost image. The parrot was so happy, he couldn’t believe it!
The parrot thanked the monkey, who had thought of the plan. Then, the two friends hugged, because they were so happy to be together again.
