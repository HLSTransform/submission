Once upon a time, there was a little beetle. He was very small and had a hard shell that protected him from danger. One day, he saw a piece of candy on the ground and wanted to eat it. But the candy was too heavy for him to lift.
He tried and tried, but he couldn't lift it. Then, a big beetle came along and saw the little beetle struggling. The big beetle offered to help and lifted the candy for him. The little beetle was very grateful and thanked the big beetle.
The moral of the story is that sometimes we need help from others, and it's okay to ask for it. We should also be willing to help others when they need it.
