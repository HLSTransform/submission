Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she put on her favorite shoes and went for a walk in the park.
As she walked, she noticed a persistent buzzing sound. She looked around and saw a bee flying near her. Lily tried to shoo the bee away with her shoe, but accidentally struck it instead.
The bee became angry and started to chase Lily. She ran as fast as she could, but the bee was persistent and wouldn't give up. Finally, Lily found a safe place to hide and the bee flew away.
From that day on, Lily learned to be careful around bees and to always be kind to all creatures, big and small.
