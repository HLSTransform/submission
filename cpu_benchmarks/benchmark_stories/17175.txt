Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, her mom told her to sit on a towel while she played with her toys. Lily was busy playing with her dolls and didn't listen to her mom. 
Suddenly, Lily spilled her juice on the floor. Her mom said, "I told you to sit on the towel. Now we have to clean up the mess." 
Lily learned her lesson and always sat on the towel when she played with her toys. One day, her mom surprised her with a new toy. Lily was so excited that she forgot to sit on the towel. But this time, her mom had put a towel under the toy to catch any spills. 
Lily was happy and said, "Thank you, Mommy! I will always remember to sit on the towel."
