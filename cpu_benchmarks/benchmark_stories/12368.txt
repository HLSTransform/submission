One day, in a backyard, there was an unknown thing. The thing made a loud noise when it was cut. Suddenly, the unknown thing became two pieces! They were so small, like toys. The little girl who lived in the backyard was very excited. She started to play with the two pieces. She used them to make another unknown thing. But it was not as loud as the first one. The little girl smiled and ran back into her house, happy to have cut the unknown thing.
