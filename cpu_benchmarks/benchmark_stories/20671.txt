Once upon a time there was a very independent pink pig who loved to cook. Every day she would try to cook something new. She decided to make a big, delicious cake. She grabbed some eggs, flour, sugar, and butter and started whisking away. She put all the ingredients together and put the mixture into the oven.
After a few minutes, her cake was ready! She carefully took it out of the oven, and she was so happy to see that her cake looked perfect. She added some pink sprinkles on top and cut it into pieces. She offered the first piece to her friend the cow and they both gobbled it up and said it was delicious.
But the pink pig found out that cooking was so much fun. Every day she would try something new, and everyone in the barnyard loved it. She was so happy to be able to cook, and she was becoming very independent. The end.
