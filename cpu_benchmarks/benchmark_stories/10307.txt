Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their toy cars. They liked to make noises like the cars on the road. Ben had a red car that was shiny and fast. Lily had a blue car that was big and loud. She had a horn on her car that she could press to make a beep.
"Beep beep!" Lily said, as she drove her car towards Ben's car. "Move out of the way, slow car!"
Ben did not like that. He wanted to play nicely with Lily, but she was being mean. He tried to drive his car away, but Lily followed him. She pressed her horn again and again.
"Beep beep! Beep beep! Beep beep!" Lily said, laughing.
"Stop it, Lily!" Ben said, feeling angry and sad. "You are hurting my ears! And you are not being a good friend!"
Lily did not stop. She thought it was funny to annoy Ben. She drove her car closer and closer to Ben's car, until they crashed. Ben's car fell on the ground and broke. The wheel came off and the paint scratched.
"Uh oh!" Lily said, looking at Ben's car. "I'm sorry, Ben. I did not mean to break your car."
Ben picked up his car and saw the damage. He felt tears in his eyes. He loved his car. It was a gift from his grandpa. It was very expensive and special.
"It's okay, Lily," Ben said, trying to be brave. "But you have to be more careful. And you have to be nicer. You can't just beep your horn all the time. It's rude and noisy."
Lily felt bad. She realized she had been a bad friend. She wanted to make Ben happy again.
"I'm sorry, Ben," Lily said, giving him a hug. "Can we still be friends?"
Ben smiled and hugged her back. He was a kind boy. He forgave Lily.
"Of course we can, Lily," Ben said. "But can you please stop beeping your horn so much?"
Lily nodded. She learned her lesson. She decided to share her horn with Ben. They played together with their cars, taking turns to beep the horn. They had fun and were friends again.
