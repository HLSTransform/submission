Once there was a grumpy seal who lived in the sea. One day, the seal decided to go for a swim and explore the area. As the seal swam, it soon met another seal. The two seals began to chat and played together all day.
But then something bad happened. The second seal became grumpy too and started to argue with the first seal. The two seals started pushing and shoving each other until the first seal got very scared. The seal quickly swim away, never to be seen again.
The first seal had an unhappy ending to its adventure. It never got to say goodbye to the other seal and was left feeling upset and alone.
