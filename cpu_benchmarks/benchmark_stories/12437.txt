Once upon a time there was a huge firework. Every night it sparkled and soared in the sky. Everyone was so excited to see it.
One day a three year old child saw the firework and wanted to find out what made it sparkle so brightly. So he called out to the firework, "Why are you so sparkly?"
The firework didn't answer at first, but then it yielded an answer. "I am sparkly because - when I am lit up - I give off lots of sparks."
The child was amazed. He asked one more question. "Can I try to light you up one day?"
The firework said, "Sure. Just be careful."
The child was happy and excited. He could not wait to light up the huge firework.
