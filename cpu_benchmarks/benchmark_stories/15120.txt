One day, a little girl named Emma was very excited. She had been waiting for the mail to come. When she heard the mailman coming, she ran outside to meet him. He smiled and handed her a small gray box.
"What's this?" asked Emma.
"It's a special mask for you!" said the mailman. "I think you'll like it."
Emma was so excited, she hugged the mailman and ran inside. She quickly opened the box and found a beautiful, gray mask inside. It had sparkly pink and purple sequins around the edges.
Emma smiled and put the mask on. She looked in the mirror and was so proud of herself. She loved her new mask and knew that she would wear it all the time.
