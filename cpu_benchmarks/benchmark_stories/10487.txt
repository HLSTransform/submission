Once upon a time there was a girl named Kathy. Kathy loved to read books. She read everyday for fun. But one day, Kathy was scared about reading. She was scared of being slow.
One day, Kathy's mom said to her, "Kathy, why don't you try doing some exercises?" Kathy was surprised. She thought exercises were only for grown-ups!
But Kathy decided to try it anyway. She was scared at first, but then she started to like it! Soon enough, Kathy noticed she was getting faster when she read. And she was no longer scared! 
Kathy kept practicing exercises every day and now she reads even faster than before. She still loves to read her favorite books and the exercises helped her a lot.
