Lily and her mom went to the big store to buy furniture. They needed a new bed for Lily, because she was too big for her old one. Lily saw many beds in the store, but she liked the one with pink flowers best.
"Mom, can we buy this bed?" Lily asked, pointing to the bed.
"Let me see, sweetie," her mom said, looking at the price tag. "Hmm, this bed is very expensive. How about this one?" She showed Lily another bed, with blue stars.
Lily shook her head. "No, mom, I want the pink one. It is so pretty and cozy."
Her mom sighed. "I know, honey, but we have to save money. We can't buy everything we want. Maybe we can find something else that you like."
Lily felt sad. She really wanted the pink bed. She wondered if her mom would ever buy it for her.
They walked around the store, looking at other furniture. Lily saw a big couch, a round table, and a tall bookshelf. She also saw a small kitchen, with a stove, a sink, and a fridge. It had pots and pans, plates and cups, and fake food. Lily loved to play pretend, and she thought the kitchen was very fun.
"Mom, look at this!" Lily said, running to the kitchen. "Can we buy this?"
Her mom smiled. "That is a nice kitchen, Lily. Do you want to play with it for a while?"
"Yes, please!" Lily said, happily. She put on an apron, and pretended to cook. She made soup, salad, and cake. She invited her mom to join her.
"Here, mom, have some soup. It is very tasty," Lily said, offering her mom a spoon.
"Thank you, Lily. Mmm, this is delicious," her mom said, pretending to eat.
They played for a long time, and had a lot of fun. Lily forgot about the pink bed, and enjoyed the kitchen. She liked to make her mom happy.
After a while, her mom said, "Lily, it is time to go. We have to buy your bed, remember?"
Lily nodded. She cleaned up the kitchen, and said goodbye to it. She hoped she could play with it again someday.
They went back to the bed section, and looked for a bed that they could afford. Lily saw a bed with yellow suns, and thought it was nice. It was not as expensive as the pink bed, but it was still cozy.
"Mom, how about this bed?" Lily asked.
Her mom looked at the bed, and smiled. "That is a good choice, Lily. It is bright and cheerful, and it fits our budget. Do you like it?"
Lily nodded. She liked the yellow bed. She thought it would make her happy.
"OK, then, let's buy it," her mom said. She paid for the bed, and asked for help to load it in their car.
They drove home, and set up the bed in Lily's room. Lily put on her pajamas, and climbed into her new bed. She hugged her mom, and said, "Thank you, mom, for buying me this bed. I love you."
"I love you too, Lily," her mom said, kissing her goodnight. "Sweet dreams."
Lily closed her eyes, and felt warm and cozy. She dreamed of pink flowers, blue stars, and yellow suns. She was happy.
