Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He was very cheerful and loved playing pretend.
One day, Tim was playing in his garden and saw a big blueberry bush. He was so excited that he started to run towards it.
He reached the bush and saw that it was loaded with big, ripe blueberries! He started picking them happily and putting them into his bucket.
Then he heard a voice from behind him. It was his grandpa! His grandpa said to him, “ Hi Timmy! What are you doing?”
Tim replied excitedly, “I’m picking blueberries and I’m going to make a pie!” 
His grandpa smiled and said, “That sounds great. I can’t wait to taste it!”
Tim was very happy and cheerfully finished picking blueberries. He couldn’t wait to go home and make the best blueberry pie ever!
