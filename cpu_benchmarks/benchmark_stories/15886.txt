Once upon a time there were two young friends, Bob and Harry. They were out in the forest looking for acorns and nuts.
Bob said to Harry, "Let's part ways and look for nuts. "
Harry replied, "Ok! I'll look for acorns and you look for nuts."
They each went in different directions and soon enough, Bob found a nut! He called out excitedly, "Harry! I found a nut!" 
Harry joined him and said, "That's great Bob! Let's find more!" 
So they kept looking and soon they had a bag full of nuts. 
They were so happy with their findings that they decided to make something special with the nuts. They gathered some leaves and twigs and made a pyramid of nuts.
The young friends were very proud of their work. Bob said, "Look at what we made! We're so clever!" And Harry agreed, "Yes, we are!" 
The two friends had such a wonderful time in the woods that day. With their bag of nuts, they had a picnic and enjoyed the nature around them. 
The End.
