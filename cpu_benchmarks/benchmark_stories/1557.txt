Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the sun. One day, Timmy went on a walk with his mommy. They walked and walked until Timmy got tired. 
"Mommy, my legs are tired," Timmy said.
"I know, Timmy. Let's take a break," Mommy said.
They sat down on a bench, and Timmy started to play with his thumbs. He realized that his thumbs were very important because he could use them to hold things and play games. 
"Mommy, look at my thumbs!" Timmy said.
"Yes, Timmy. Your thumbs are very helpful," Mommy said. 
After their break, Timmy and his mommy continued their walk. Timmy was happy because he realized how important his thumbs were and he wasn't tired anymore.
