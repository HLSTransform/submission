Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, but he got frustrated when they wouldn't work right. One day, Timmy was playing with his toy car when he accidentally twisted it too hard and it broke.
Timmy was very frustrated and didn't know what to do. He tried to fix the car, but he couldn't. He started to cry and his mom came to see what was wrong. Timmy showed her the broken car and she tried to fix it too, but it was no use.
Timmy was so upset that he threw the car on the ground and stomped on it. His mom tried to calm him down, but he wouldn't listen. In the end, Timmy was left with a broken toy and a bad temper.
