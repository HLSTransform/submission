Once upon a time, there was a gentle cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to play with her friends. One day, Kitty and her friends decided to have a fun party. They were very excite to play games and eat yummy food.
Kitty wanted to make the party even more fun. So, she found a mask for everyone to wear. The mask made everyone look like a funny animal. Kitty put on a mask that made her look like a dog. Her friends laughed and said, "Look, Kitty is a dog now!"
At the party, Kitty and her friends played a game. They took turns trying to guess who was behind the mask. When it was Kitty's turn, she gently tapped her friend and said, "Are you Bunny?" Her friend took off the mask and said, "Yes, it's me, Bunny!" They all laughed and had a great time at the party.
