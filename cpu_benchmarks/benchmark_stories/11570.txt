Once upon a time, there was a shy goose. The goose lived near a big pond. The goose had many friends, but it was always too shy to talk to them.
One day, a duck came to the pond. The duck said, "Hi, shy goose! I am new here. Can you provide me some food?" The shy goose wanted to help the duck, but it was too shy to say anything.
The shy goose thought for a moment and then went to find some food. It found some yummy grass and gave it to the duck. The duck said, "Thank you, shy goose! You are a good friend." The shy goose felt happy and not so shy anymore.
