Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She went on a trip with her family and brought a big bag. When they arrived at their hotel, Lily had to unpack her bag. It was heavy, but she worked hard to take everything out.
After they unpacked, Lily's parents told her that if she helped them clean up the room, she would get a reward. Lily was very excited to hear this. She helped her parents put away their clothes and toys.
Finally, when they were all done, Lily's parents gave her a reward. It was a yummy ice cream cone! Lily was very happy and ate it all up. She was proud of herself for being such a good helper. The end.
