Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books, but she had read all of her books many times. One day, her mom took her to the library to find a new book. Lily saw a big book with a pretty cover and asked her mom if she could have it. Her mom said yes and allowed her to borrow the novel.
When they got home, Lily started to read the novel. But she quickly became confused because there were many big words she didn't know. She asked her mom for help, and her mom explained the words to her. Then Lily was able to understand the story and she loved it. She read the novel many times and was happy her mom had allowed her to borrow it from the library.
