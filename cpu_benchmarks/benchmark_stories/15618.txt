Anna was very happy. Tomorrow was her birthday. She wanted to have a big party with her friends. She asked her mom if she could invite many people.
"Mom, can I have a big party for my birthday?" Anna said.
Mom smiled and hugged Anna. "Of course, my dear. You can have a party. But we have to be flexible. You know the virus is still around. We have to be careful and follow the rules. We can't have too many people inside the house. Maybe we can have some people outside in the garden. And we have to wear masks and wash our hands. Do you understand?"
Anna nodded. She understood. She wanted to be safe and healthy. She also wanted to have fun. She was flexible. She could have a party outside. She could wear a mask. She could wash her hands. She thanked her mom and gave her a kiss.
"Thank you, mom. You are the best. I love you."
"I love you too, Anna. You are a good girl. I'm proud of you. Now, let's make a list of who you want to invite. And what kind of cake do you want?"
Anna thought for a moment. She wanted to invite her best friends, Lily and Ben. And her cousins, Sam and Mia. And her teacher, Mrs. Lee. And her dog, Spot. And she wanted a chocolate cake with sprinkles. She told her mom.
"OK, Anna. That sounds good. I will call them and see if they can come. And I will bake you a chocolate cake with sprinkles. But you have to promise me one thing. You have to go to bed early tonight. You need to rest and be ready for your big day. Do you promise?"
Anna promised. She was excited. She couldn't wait for her birthday. She hoped everyone could come. She hoped the sun would shine. She hoped she would get many presents. She hugged her mom again and said good night.
"Good night, mom. I love you. Thank you for permitting me to have a party."
"Good night, Anna. I love you too. Happy birthday, my sweet girl."
