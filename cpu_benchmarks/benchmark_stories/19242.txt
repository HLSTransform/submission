Olly woke up one morning and wanted a cup of coffee. He asked his mom for the coffee and she said yes.
He went to the kitchen and opened the cupboard. He found the coffee but it was messy! He had to spend a few minutes picking it up so it was all neat.
Once the coffee was tidied up, Olly made the coffee himself. He put in the milk, sugar and coffee beans. Then he pressed the button and waited.
When it was ready, the coffee smelled good. Olly drank it while standing in the kitchen. He liked the taste and thanked his mom for the coffee.
