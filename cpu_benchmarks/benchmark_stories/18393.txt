Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to draw and make things. He would create pictures of animals and cars with his crayons. One day, Timmy decided he wanted to create something big. He asked his mommy for some boxes and tape. 
Timmy worked hard all day, cutting and taping the boxes together. When he was finished, he had made a big fort! He was so proud of himself. He invited his friends over to play in his fort. They had so much fun pretending they were in the wild west, hiding from cowboys and Indians. 
After a while, Timmy's fort started to get old and spoiled. The tape was coming undone and the boxes were falling apart. But Timmy didn't give up. He got some more boxes and tape and created an even bigger and better fort. And this time, he made sure to take good care of it so it wouldn't get spoiled again.
