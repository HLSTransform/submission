One day, two children, Tom and Emma, were looking for something interesting to do. Tom noticed a strange object at the bottom of the lake. It was so deep that they couldn't see it very well. 
Tom said, “We should get that object! Let's weigh it and find out what it is!”
Emma thought it was a great idea, so they went to get a weighing scale from Tom's house. They came back to the lake and Tom carefully put the object on the scale. The scale moved back and forth and finally settled on an answer.
Tom read the numbers on the scale: “It weighs four kilos!”
Emma and Tom looked at each other in amazement. They couldn't believe what they had found! What could it be?
