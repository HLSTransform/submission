Once there was a little girl. She wanted to climb up a big tree. She could see a nest in the high branches. She asked herself a question, "Can I get to the nest?". She was determined to try it. She started climbing and reaching for the leaves. She was careful because she didn't want to fall down. But she got higher and higher. Finally, she made it to the nest! She was so happy to be there. She saw that there were eggs inside the nest and she wanted to reach them. The eggs weren't available yet, so she had to wait. But she was patient and she was able to get them when they were ready. She was so glad she was able to climb to the nest and get the eggs.
