Once upon a time, there was a pale little girl named Amy. She loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, her mom was baking a cake in the oven. The oven was big and warm. Amy was very excited to eat the cake.
Amy wanted to help her mom with the cake. So, she asked, "Mom, can I help you with the cake?" Her mom said, "Yes, Amy, you can help me mix the cake batter." Amy was very happy to help her mom.
They mixed the cake batter together and put it in the oven. Amy and her mom waited for the cake to bake. When the cake was ready, they took it out of the oven. The cake smelled so good! Amy and her mom ate the cake together, and it was the best cake they ever had.
