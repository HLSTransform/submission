Once upon a time, there was a man who lived in a big house. He was very rich and had many toys. One day, he saw his neighbor's new car and became very jealous. He wanted a car just like that.
The man decided to wander around the town to find a car like his neighbor's. He walked and walked until he found a store that sold cars. He saw a shiny red car and knew he had to have it.
He bought the car and drove it home. But when he got home, he realized that he didn't feel happy. He realized that having things doesn't always make you happy. From that day on, he decided to be happy with what he had and not be jealous of others.
