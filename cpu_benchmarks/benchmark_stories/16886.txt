Once upon a time, there was a big factory. The factory made toys for kids to play with. Making the toys was difficult work, but the people who worked there did it with a smile on their face. 
One day, a little boy named Timmy went to the factory to see how the toys were made. He saw the workers serving the toys on a big conveyor belt. They worked hard to make sure each toy was perfect. 
Timmy was so happy to see all the toys being made. He knew that the workers were doing a great job. When he went home, he told his friends all about the factory and how the workers served the toys to make kids happy.
