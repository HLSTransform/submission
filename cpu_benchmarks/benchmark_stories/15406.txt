Once upon a time there was a fierce tiger who lived in the jungle. He was always hungry, so he went searching for food. One day he found some oil in an old pot near the river. The tiger was so happy! He tasted the oil and it was delicious! He kept some of the oil and tried to find something to serve it with.
He searched through the jungle for hours, until he finally found a yummy turtle. He caught the turtle and started to eat it with his oil. It was a perfect meal for the fierce tiger!
The tiger enjoyed his meal very much and kept eating his oil and turtle for a long time. He was a very happy tiger!
