Once upon a time, in a big garden, there was a little flower. The little flower was very worried. It wanted to bloom, but it was scared.
One day, a kind guard came to the garden. The guard saw the worried flower and asked, "Why are you so worried, little flower?" The little flower said, "I want to bloom, but I am scared."
The guard smiled and said, "Don't be scared, little flower. I will help you." The guard gave the flower some water and talked to it every day. Soon, the little flower started to feel better.
One sunny day, the little flower bloomed. It was so happy! The guard was happy too. They both knew that with a little help and love, anything is possible. And from that day on, the little flower was never worried again.
