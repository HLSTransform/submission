Tom and Amy were friends who liked to play with toys. But they did not like to share their toys with each other. They always put labels on their toys to show who they belonged to. They said, "This is mine, not yours. You cannot touch it."
One day, they had a big fight over a new toy car. They both wanted it, but there was only one. They pulled and pushed and shouted. They said, "I hate you. You are not my friend." They made each other cry.
Then, the lights went out. It was dark and scary. They could not see their toys or each other. They felt alone and sad. They wished they had someone to hug and talk to.
They heard each other's voices in the dark. They said, "I'm sorry. I don't hate you. You are my friend." They found each other and hugged. They said, "It does not matter who has the toy car. We can share it and play together."
When the lights came back on, they saw their toys and their labels. They said, "We don't need these labels. They are silly. We can play with any toy we want." They tore off the labels and threw them away. They smiled and laughed and played.
The moral of the story is: Sharing is caring. Hating is hurting. Labels are not important. Friends are.
