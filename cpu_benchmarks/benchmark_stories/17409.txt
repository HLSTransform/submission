Mia likes to play in the garden. She likes to dig holes and look for bugs. One day, she finds a big hole under a tree. She wonders what lives in the hole. She puts her hand in the hole and feels something soft and furry.
"Hello, who are you?" Mia asks.
"I am a mole," a voice says. "I live in the hole. I dig tunnels and eat worms."
Mia is surprised. She has never seen a mole before. She pulls her hand out of the hole and sees a small animal with a long nose and tiny eyes. The mole is fat and brown.
"You are a mole?" Mia says. "You are very fat. Do you eat a lot of worms?"
"Yes, I do," the mole says. "Worms are yummy. They make me fat and strong. Do you want to try some?"
Mia makes a face. She does not like worms. She likes cookies and apples and cheese.
"No, thank you," Mia says. "I do not like worms. They are icky. I like cookies and apples and cheese. Do you want to try some?"
The mole makes a face. He does not like cookies and apples and cheese. He likes worms and beetles and grubs.
"No, thank you," the mole says. "I do not like cookies and apples and cheese. They are yucky. I like worms and beetles and grubs. Do you want to use my hole?"
Mia thinks for a moment. She likes to use holes, but she does not like to share them with moles. She likes to play with her friends and her toys.
"No, thank you," Mia says. "I do not want to use your hole. I have my own hole. I like to play with my friends and my toys. Do you want to play with me?"
The mole thinks for a moment. He does not like to play with friends and toys. He likes to dig and sleep and eat.
"No, thank you," the mole says. "I do not want to play with you. I have my own work. I like to dig and sleep and eat. Goodbye, Mia."
"Goodbye, mole," Mia says.
Mia and the mole go their separate ways. Mia goes back to her hole and plays with her friends and her toys. The mole goes back to his hole and digs and sleeps and eats. They are both happy in their own way.
