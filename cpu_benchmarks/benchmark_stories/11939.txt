Once upon a time, there were two friends named Tom and Jerry. They loved to play together every day. One day, Tom wanted to wrap a present for his mom's birthday. But he didn't know how to do it. So, he asked Jerry to help him. Jerry was happy to help his friend.
But when they were wrapping the present, they started to quarrel about who was doing it better. They were so busy arguing that they didn't realize they had made a big mess. Tom's mom was very upset when she saw the ruined present. She scolded both of them and they felt very sad.
The moral of the story is that we should always be modest and not argue with our friends. It's important to work together and help each other. Otherwise, bad things can happen, and we might lose our friends.
