Mommy was sad one day. She was sad because it was the end of the week. She told Max, her 3 year old son, that it was time to bury something big. 
Max looked confused. "What do you mean, Mommy?" he asked.
"It's what we do at the end of the week," Mommy said. "We bury a big thing so that it can grow and be ready when we start the next week."
Max said nothing, but he knew that Mommy wanted him to do something. He looked around and saw a big tree branch. He picked it up and brought it to Mommy.
Mommy smiled and said, "Good job, Max! Now let's bury it in the ground and start the next week fresh." 
Max helped Mommy dig the hole and they put the big tree branch in. Then they patted down the dirt and said a small prayer.
Mommy hugged Max and said, "When the new week starts, we'll come back here and find something big and new. That's our bury day tradition. It's special."
Max smiled and knew that everything was okay now. They hugged and went off on a new adventure.
