Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had a hairy dog named Max. Max was her best friend. One day, Lily wanted to go for a walk, but she didn't want to go alone. 
"Max, will you come with me?" Lily asked.
"Woof woof!" Max barked, which meant "Yes, I will come with you."
Lily grabbed her favorite doll and Max carried it in his mouth. They walked through the park and saw many pretty flowers. 
"Look, Max! These flowers are beautiful!" Lily said.
Max wagged his tail and barked happily. They continued to walk until they reached the ice cream truck. 
"I want strawberry ice cream, please!" Lily said to the ice cream man.
Max barked, which meant "I want a treat too!"
Lily bought Max a doggy ice cream and they sat on a bench together, enjoying their treats. Lily was happy to have her best friend and her doll with her on her adventure.
