Once upon a time, there was a strong man who mentioned to everyone he knew how tough he was. Everyone thought he was very boastful, but he always insisted he was telling the truth. One day, he decided to prove his strength by wearing his old boots and making the long journey up a high mountain. As he was walking, a strong wind started to blow. The man had to hold on to his boots tightly to keep them from flying away.
When the man finally reached the peak of the mountain, a thunderous roar greeted him. Thinking he had conquered the mountain, he shouted out in joy. Then he noticed a large crack in the ground. Before he could do anything, the crack started to spread and soon the ground beneath him was shaking. 
Soon, the man found himself standing on a small island between two large pieces of land. The man tried to jump to the other side, but he was too scared. He thought he could make it if he could use his strong boots, but the gap was too wide. In the end, the man stayed stranded on the island until his death. 
Moral of the story: Be careful when you mention how strong you are, or you may end up with a bad ending like the strong man did.
