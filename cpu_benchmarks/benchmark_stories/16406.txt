Sam likes to read books. He has many books in his bookcase. He likes to look at the pictures and learn new things. Sometimes he reads with his mom or dad. They help him with the hard words.
One day, Sam sees a new book in his bookcase. It is big and colorful. He takes it out and opens it. He sees animals and letters and numbers. He is very happy. He wants to read it with his mom.
He runs to the living room, where his mom is sitting on the couch. He says, "Mom, look! I have a new book! Can you read it with me?"
His mom smiles and says, "Sure, Sam. That is a nice book. Where did you get it?"
Sam says, "It was in my bookcase. I think someone gave it to me. Maybe it was dad. Or grandma. Or the mailman."
His mom laughs and says, "Maybe it was a regular surprise. Come, let's read it together. I'm sure you will like it."
She hugs him and takes the book. They sit on the couch and start to read. Sam is very happy. He likes his new book. He likes his mom. He likes to read.
