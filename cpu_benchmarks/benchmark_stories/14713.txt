Once upon a time, there was a shelf. On the shelf were two small books. One had a blue cover, the other had a red cover.
The books had mild colors that were very nice. They made the shelf look nice, too.
The books liked to be displayed on the shelf. When they were displayed, they felt happy and special.
They liked that they were able to show off their colors. The colors were bright and happy, just like the books.
The books were very happy when they were displayed on the shelf. Everyone who saw the books felt happy, too.
