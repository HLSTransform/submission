Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a boy named Tim. Tim was troubled because he lost his favorite toy. He looked everywhere but could not find it.
One day, Tim met a wise cat who could talk. The cat said, "I recommend looking in your pocket." Tim was surprised but did what the cat said. He put his hand in his pocket and found his toy!
Tim was very happy and thanked the cat. From that day on, Tim and the cat became best friends. They played together and had lots of fun. Tim never forgot to check his pocket again.
