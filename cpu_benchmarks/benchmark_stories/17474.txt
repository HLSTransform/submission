Mia and Leo were twins who liked to help their mom in the kitchen. They were very enthusiastic and wanted to learn how to cook. One day, their mom let them make some cookies with her. She gave them each a bowl of dough and some cookie cutters.
"Look, Mia, I made a star!" Leo said, showing his cookie to his sister.
"That's nice, Leo, but I made a heart!" Mia said, snapping her cookie cutter on the dough.
They both smiled and put their cookies on a tray. Their mom put the tray in the oven and turned on the stove.
"Now we have to wait for the cookies to bake," she said. "But be careful, the stove is very hot. Don't touch it, okay?"
"Okay, mom," Mia and Leo said.
They sat on the floor and played with their toys while they waited. They could smell the cookies getting ready. They were very excited.
"Mom, are the cookies done?" Mia asked.
"Let me check," their mom said. She opened the oven and took out the tray. She put it on the counter and used a spatula to lift a cookie.
"Ouch!" she said. She dropped the cookie and shook her hand. "The cookie is too hot. I burned my finger."
Mia and Leo ran to their mom and hugged her.
"Are you okay, mom?" Leo asked.
"I'm okay, sweetie, it's just a little burn," their mom said. She put some ice on her finger and kissed them both. "Thank you for caring. You are such good helpers."
She gave them each a glass of milk and a cookie. They were still warm, but not too hot. They tasted delicious.
Mia and Leo enjoyed their cookies and thanked their mom. They were very happy. They decided that they loved to cook with their mom.
