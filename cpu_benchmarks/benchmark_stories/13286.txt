Once upon a time there was a white cow. She loved eating grass and walking in the fields. One day, she saw some gray clouds in the sky. She wondered what the clouds were going to do. 
Suddenly it started to rain. The white cow was so excited! She loved being in the rain and feeling the drops on her fur. 
The white cow noticed that the rain was providing a special drink for her. It was a special drink from the clouds called rainwater. She slurped it up and thought it was the best drink ever. 
The white cow was so thankful for the rain. She was so happy that the clouds provided her with such a special drink.
