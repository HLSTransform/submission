Once upon a time there was a robot. It was very fancy. Every day the robot would pinch things. It would pinch flowers, books, and toys.
One day the robot got a surprise! It was a little 3 year old child! The child was excited to see the robot and the robot was excited too. They started to play together.
The robot showed the child all sorts of things. It showed the child how to pinch things and the child was so excited. The child pinched flowers, books, and toys and laughed.
At the end of the day the robot and the child said goodbye. The child was happy they got to play and the robot was happy too. They promised to meet again soon.
