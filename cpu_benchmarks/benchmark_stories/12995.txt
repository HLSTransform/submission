John looked up at the tall tree. He leaned his head back and saw the stars in the night sky. He smiled and clapped his hands together. He wanted to reach the stars and touch them!
John turned around and saw his candle on the table. He had left it open. He picked it up and gave it a big hug. He liked the way the candle glowed in the dark.
John looked back up at the tree. He leaned the candle up against the trunk and it stayed there. The candle lit up John and the tree. The stars looked like they were twinkling down at John and the open candle.
John smiled and said good night to the stars! Then he walked slowly back to his house, feeling warm and happy. The candle shone in the night and watched him go.
