One day, there was a famous man named Jack. He liked to jog every morning. He went outside and put on his special socks. The socks were made especially for running. They were very soft, and he felt comfy in them.
Jack started to jog around the park. He ran past a lake, a tree and a big, green hill. He jogged around and around for a long time. He felt happy and truly enjoyed his morning jog.
When he was finished jogging, Jack started to wave to the people around him. Some clapped and cheered, because he was famous! Jack smiled and felt very proud.
The next morning, Jack put on his special jogging socks and started to jog around the park again. He didn't feel tired at all and it felt really good to stretch his legs. He jogged around and around, smiling with joy as he waved to the people around him.
