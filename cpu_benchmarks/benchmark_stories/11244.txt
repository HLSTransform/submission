Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mary. Mary was only three years old and she wanted to explore. On this day, she decided to take a walk down the street. 
As she walked, she noticed how everything seemed so impressive. Everything was so big and new that she couldn't help but pause and admire it.
While she was admiring the street, she saw a butterfly! She was so excited that she couldn't help but run to catch it. As she ran, she shouted, "Come back butterfly!"
The butterfly flew away, but Mary was determined to catch it. She followed it until the butterfly finally stopped on a flower. Mary paused and was so happy that she caught it. 
With a smile on her face, Mary said, "I caught you!" She was so proud of herself for catching such an impressive butterfly. 
Mary went home with a big smile on her face, feeling very proud of her accomplishment.
