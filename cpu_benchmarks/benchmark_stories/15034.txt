Once upon a time, there was an ancient duck who loved to settle by the pond. He would spend his day swimming and playing in the water. Every day, he would settle in the same spot.
One day, a group of children came to the pond. They spotted the ancient duck and wanted to meet him. The duck was a bit shy at first but soon the children earned his trust.
The children and the duck played together all day. They swam in the pond, chased each other around and even had a race. When it was time for the children to go, the duck settled down and watched them leave. 
The ancient duck would settle by the pond every day and wait for the children to come back. He enjoyed their company and soon he was happy in his new home.
