Once upon a time there was a beautiful princess who lived in a castle. She was very wealthy and owned lots of nice things. Every day the princess would wake up and wear her sparkly dress. All of the other princesses were jealous of her clothes. 
The princess had lots of long, golden hair. She liked to wear a big crown that was decorated with precious jewels. The other princesses wished they could be as special as her. 
The princess of the castle loved going outdoors and playing in her garden. She especially liked to wear a yellow dress and twirl around like a ballerina while she played. She wanted to show off her wealth to everyone. 
At the end of the day, the princess would take of her crown and dress, snuggle up in her blanket, and go to sleep happy knowing that she was a special, wealthy princess.
