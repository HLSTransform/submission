Sara and Ben were playing with their toys in the garden. Sara had a doll and Ben had a bow and arrow. Ben wanted to shoot his arrow at Sara's doll, but Sara did not like that.
"Stop it, Ben!" Sara said. "You will hurt my doll. She is my friend."
"But I want to play with you," Ben said. "You can be the princess and I can be the charming prince. We can have an adventure."
Sara thought for a moment. She liked adventures, but she did not want to lose her doll. She had an idea.
"OK, Ben," she said. "We can play, but you have to include my doll. She can be the fairy who helps us. And you have to be careful with your arrow. You can only shoot at the bad guys, not at us."
Ben agreed. He liked fairies and bad guys. He put his arrow in his quiver and took Sara's hand. They ran to the other side of the garden, where they found a big tree.
"This is our castle," Sara said. "We have to defend it from the evil dragon."
"Where is the dragon?" Ben asked.
Sara pointed to the shed. "There he is. He is hiding behind the shed. He is waiting to attack us."
Ben took out his arrow and aimed at the shed. He pretended to shoot, making a whoosh sound. Sara clapped her hands and cheered.
"You did it, Ben!" she said. "You scared away the dragon. You are a brave and charming prince."
Ben smiled. He was happy. He gave Sara a hug and said, "You are a beautiful and smart princess. And your doll is a nice and helpful fairy."
They played for a long time, until their mom called them for lunch. They put away their toys and ran to the house, holding hands. They were the best of friends.
