Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to watch the animals at the zoo. One day, she saw a big hippo in the water. It was so cool! 
Lily's mom said, "Let's go see the monkeys now." But Lily was persistent. She wanted to watch the hippo more. "No, Mommy. I want to stay and watch the hippo," she said. 
So they stayed and watched the hippo for a while. Suddenly, the hippo came out of the water and walked around. "Wow, look at that!" Lily exclaimed. "The hippo is so big!" 
Lily's mom smiled and said, "Yes, it is. But now it's time to go see the monkeys." Lily nodded, but she knew she would come back to watch the hippo again soon.
