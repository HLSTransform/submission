Once upon a time there were two friends called Tom and Cindy. Tom and Cindy wanted to play a game so they asked each other: "What game do you want to play?" Tom said: "Let's join our bulbs together and try to make something delicious".
Cindy smiled and said: "That's a great idea! What do we need to make it delicious?" Tom took a deep breath and answered: "We need some sugar, some milk and some fruit." 
Cindy clapped her hands. "I have all of those!" she said. "Let's join our bulbs together and make something delicious!" 
So they joined the bulbs and mixed the sugar, milk and fruit together. Finally, they added some of Cindy's secret ingredient (she wouldn't tell Tom what it was!). 
When it was ready, they both tried it and it tasted absolutely delicious! They hugged each other, feeling proud that they had made something so yummy together.
