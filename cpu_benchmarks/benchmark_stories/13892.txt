Once upon a time, there was a little town. In the town, they had a fun festival. All the people in the town came to play and eat.
At the festival, there was a girl who loved to paint. She had a big box of paint with many colors. She painted happy faces on all the people at the festival.
The little girl painted all day. She painted red, blue, yellow, and green. Everyone in the town was happy. The festival was the best day ever.
