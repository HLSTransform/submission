Lily loved to pick berries with her mom. They went to the big field where the berries grew. Lily wanted to fill her basket with the reddest and sweetest berries. She saw a big bush with many berries. She ran to it and reached for a berry.
But the berry was not a berry. It was a bug. A big, red, hairy bug. It moved and made a loud noise. Lily screamed and dropped her basket. She felt something bite her hand. It hurt a lot. She ran back to her mom, crying and shaking.
Her mom hugged her and looked at her hand. She saw a small mark where the bug bit her. She said, "Don't worry, Lily. It's just a little bite. It will improve soon. You are very brave. But next time, be careful what you pick. Not everything that looks like a berry is a berry."
Lily nodded and sniffed. She felt embarrassed that she made a mistake. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I wanted to pick the best berries for you. But I picked a bad bug instead."
Her mom smiled and kissed her cheek. She said, "It's okay, Lily. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. You can still pick the best berries for me. Just look closer and use your nose. The real berries smell sweet and yummy. The bugs smell bad and yucky."
Lily smiled and wiped her tears. She said, "Thank you, mom. I love you. Can we try again?"
Her mom said, "Of course, Lily. I love you too. Let's try again. But watch out for the bugs!"
They walked to another bush with real berries. Lily looked closer and used her nose. She picked a big, red, sweet berry. She tasted it and smiled. She said, "This is a good berry, mom. Here, you try it."
Her mom tasted it and smiled too. She said, "You're right, Lily. This is a good berry. You did a great job. I'm proud of you."
They filled their basket with good berries. They avoided the bad bugs. They had a fun and happy day. Lily learned a new lesson. She improved her berry picking skills. She was not embarrassed anymore. She was happy.
