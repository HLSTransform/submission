Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to color with her purple crayon. One day, she noticed that her purple crayon was dull and needed sharpening. So, she asked her mommy to help her sharpen it.
After her crayon was sharp again, Lily decided to draw a big flower. She used her purple crayon to color the petals, and then she used her green crayon to color the stem. But, she noticed that the purple color wasn't spreading very well on the paper. So, she asked her mommy for a new purple crayon.
Mommy gave her a new purple crayon, and this one worked much better. The color spread easily on the paper, and Lily was very happy with her beautiful flower. She showed it to her mommy, who was very proud of her. From that day on, Lily made sure to keep her crayons sharp so she could create more beautiful drawings.
