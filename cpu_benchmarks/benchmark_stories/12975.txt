Once upon a time there was a girl called Emily. Emily was three years old and she had a lot of fun. 
One day Emily's mom asked her to take a quiz. Emily was worried that she wouldn't do a good job.
So Emily's mom said, ''Don't worry Emily. I know you can do it.'' 
But Emily was still scared so she asked her mom, ''What if I don't do well?'' 
Her mom hugged her and said, ''That's ok, even if you don't do your best you mustn't be rude to yourself. Sometimes things don't go how we want, that's alright.'' 
Emily smiled at her mom and hugged her back. She knew that no matter what she would try her best.
