Tom is a hairy dog. He likes to run and play with his friends. But today, he is very dirty. He has mud and leaves on his fur. His owner, Sam, says, "Tom, you need a bath. Come here, boy."
Tom does not like baths. He runs away from Sam. He hides under the bed. He thinks, "I do not want to get wet. I do not want to smell like shampoo. I want to rest and be hairy."
Sam looks for Tom. He finds him under the bed. He says, "Tom, I know you do not like baths, but you have to be clean. Shampoo is good for you. It makes your fur soft and shiny. And you will feel better after the bath. Please, come out."
Tom sees that Sam is not angry. He sees that Sam loves him. He thinks, "Maybe Sam is right. Maybe a bath is not so bad. Maybe shampoo is not so bad. Maybe I will feel better after the bath." He comes out from under the bed. He lets Sam take him to the bathroom.
Sam fills the tub with warm water. He puts some shampoo on Tom's fur. He rubs it gently. He says, "Good boy, Tom. You are being very brave. You are almost done." He rinses off the shampoo. He wraps Tom in a towel. He says, "See, that was not so bad. You are clean and handsome. Now you can rest and be happy."
Tom feels the towel on his fur. He feels warm and cozy. He smells the shampoo. He thinks, "Sam was right. The bath was not so bad. The shampoo was not so bad. I feel better after the bath. I am clean and handsome. I am happy." He wags his tail. He licks Sam's face. He says, "Woof, woof. Thank you, Sam. I love you."
