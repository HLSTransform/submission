Ben and Mia are twins. They like to play together. They have many toys in their room. Some toys are big and strong. Some toys are small and fragile. Fragile means they can break easily.
One day, Ben and Mia are bored. They want to do something new. They see a book on the shelf. The book has numbers and shapes. The book is called math. Math is what big kids learn at school.
"Let's do math!" Ben says. He takes the book and opens it. He sees a page with a long snake. The snake has numbers on its body. The book says: "Stretch the snake and count the numbers."
"Wow, that looks fun!" Mia says. She wants to try too. She grabs the other end of the book and pulls it. Ben and Mia stretch the book as much as they can. They count the numbers on the snake. "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!" they say together.
But the book is fragile. It is not meant to be stretched. The book rips in the middle. The snake breaks into two pieces. Ben and Mia are shocked. They hear a loud voice. It is their mom.
"What are you doing?" Mom asks. She sees the broken book. She is angry. "That is my math book. It is not a toy. It is fragile. You should not stretch it. You should be careful with books. They are for reading, not for tearing."
Ben and Mia are sorry. They did not know. They say: "We are sorry, Mom. We wanted to do math. We did not mean to break your book. Can you fix it?"
Mom sighs. She is not happy, but she is not mad anymore. She says: "I can try to fix it. But you have to promise me something. Next time, if you want to do math, ask me first. I can show you how to do math without breaking books. Math can be fun, but you have to respect the books. They are fragile, but they are also valuable. They have many things to teach you."
Ben and Mia nod. They say: "We promise, Mom. We will ask you next time. We will respect the books. We want to learn math. We want to be smart like you."
Mom smiles. She hugs them. She says: "I love you, Ben and Mia. You are smart and curious. You can learn math and many other things. But you have to be gentle and careful. Fragile things can break, but they can also be beautiful and useful."
