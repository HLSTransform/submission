Once upon a time there was a hairy jewel. It was so beautiful the little girl wanted to take it home. She ran to it, but it was just out of reach. She frowned and tried to stretch just a bit more. 
Suddenly, she heard a noise. She looked around, and saw a furry creature come out of the trees. It had a big smile on its face and it was holding the glittery jewel. 
The furry creature said it was the owner of the jewel, and it wanted it back. The little girl argued, but the furry creature shook its head. It said she could not have the jewel. 
The little girl frowned. She made a sad face, but the furry creature did not seem to notice. The furry creature said they both should find another jewel to share. 
The little girl's frown disappeared and was replaced with a smile. She agreed, and the two of them searched the field until they found a sparkly jewel together. The two of them smiled as they shared the jewel. 
The end.
