Once upon a time there was a girl who was very proud. Her name was Sonya and she had a very special snack. It was a green apple and it was her favorite.
One day, Sonya went outside to play. She had her green apple with her and she wanted to show it to her friends. When she went outside, she saw a big tree. It looked so tall and strong. She pointed at the tree and said, "I can shoot my apple to the top!"
Sonya went back inside and got a special stick. It was a long stick with a round end. She pointed the stick to the sky and closed one eye. She pulled the stick back and shot her apple into the sky. The apple flew high and landed at the top of the tree.
Sonya was so proud of herself. She got her special snack and she was able to shoot it to the top of the tree. She could hardly believe it. She picked up her apple and went back inside to show her friends. They were so amazed and they all laughed together. Sonya was proud of herself and happy to have her delicious green apple.
