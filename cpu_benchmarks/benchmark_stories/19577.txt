Once there was a kangaroo with a big mouth. He had done something wrong and he knew his friends wouldn't forgive him. He hung his head low and began to cry.
One of his friends noticed what had happened and asked him what was wrong. He told her what he had done and asked if his friends would forgive him. 
His friends watched him sadly and then suddenly, something amazing happened. One of the kangaroos said, "I forgive you," in the most impressive way. 
The kangaroo couldn't believe it. He was so relieved that his friends had forgiven him! He smiled for the first time in days and thanked them for understanding him.
