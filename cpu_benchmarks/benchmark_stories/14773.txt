Lily was a very independent girl. She liked to do things by herself and explore new places. One day, she went to the park with her mom and saw a big maze made of hedges. She wanted to go inside and find the way out.
She asked her mom if she could go. Her mom said yes, but she had to stay close and listen to her voice. Lily agreed and ran to the entrance of the maze. She was very excited and curious.
She walked along the paths and turned left and right. She saw many flowers and birds and bugs. She also saw some other kids who were playing in the maze. She decided to introduce herself and make some friends.
She said hello to a boy who had a red hat and a girl who had a blue dress. They said hello back and told her their names. They were Tom and Anna. They asked her if she wanted to play with them. She said yes and they smiled.
They played hide and seek and tag and made funny noises. They had a lot of fun and laughed a lot. Lily was happy and forgot about the time. She did not hear her mom calling her name.
Her mom was worried and looked for her in the maze. She asked some other parents and kids if they had seen her. They said no and helped her search. They walked and shouted and checked every corner.
Finally, they found Lily and her new friends. They were sitting on a bench and eating some cookies. Lily saw her mom and ran to hug her. She said sorry for not listening and introduced her friends. Her mom was relieved and happy. She said hello to Tom and Anna and thanked them for sharing their cookies. She also said it was time to go home.
Lily said goodbye to her friends and promised to see them again. They said goodbye and waved. Lily and her mom left the maze and walked to the car. Lily told her mom about her adventure and how much she liked the maze. Her mom listened and smiled. She was proud of her independent girl.
