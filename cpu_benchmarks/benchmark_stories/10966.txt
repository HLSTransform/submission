Once upon a time, there was a big rocket. The rocket was very fast and could fly up, up, up in the sky. All the other rockets were envious, because they wanted to be as fast as the big rocket.
One day, the big rocket saw a little girl. The little girl was sad. The big rocket asked, "Why are you sad?" The little girl said, "I want to read, but I don't know how." The big rocket wanted to help the little girl.
The big rocket took the little girl up, up, up in the sky. They found a big star that could teach the little girl to read. The little girl was happy, and the big rocket was happy too. They flew back home, and the little girl read books to the big rocket every day.
