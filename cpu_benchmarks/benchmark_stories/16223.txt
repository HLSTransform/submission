Once upon a time there was a happy girl. She was wearing a black dress. She was feeling excited and ready to start her day.
The girl started to run around the garden. She smiled as she saw the pretty flowers and the nice grass.
Then, she spotted a big black rabbit. She was so happy! She ran closer to the rabbit to say hello. The rabbit was also very happy.
The rabbit started jumping around the garden. And the girl followed quickly behind, also jumping. They had lots of fun together that day.
At the end of the day, the girl and the rabbit said goodbye. The girl waved goodbye until she couldn't see the rabbit anymore. She was so happy to meet her new friend. 
The End.
