Lila and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to run and jump and laugh. They saw a big vine on the wall. It had many green leaves and purple flowers.
"Look, Lila, a vine!" Ben said. "Let's climb it and see what's on the other side."
"OK, Ben, but be careful. The vine may be weak and break," Lila said.
They took hold of the vine and started to climb. They felt happy and curious. They wanted to see the other side of the wall.
But the vine was not strong enough. It snapped and they fell down. They landed on the grass and hurt their knees and elbows. They cried and felt scared.
"Ow, ow, ow, it hurts!" Lila said.
"Me too, me too, it hurts!" Ben said.
They hugged each other and prayed. They prayed to God to make them feel better and to help them go back to their house.
"God, please help us. We are sorry we climbed the vine. We are hurt and scared. Please make us feel better and show us the way home," they prayed.
They heard a voice. It was their mother. She had heard their cries and came to find them. She saw them on the grass and ran to them. She was fast and kind.
"Lila, Ben, what happened? Are you OK?" she asked.
"Mommy, mommy, we climbed the vine and fell down. We are hurt and scared. We prayed to God to help us," they said.
"Oh, my poor babies. I'm so sorry. God heard your prayers and sent me to you. Let me see your wounds. I'll clean them and put some bandages on them. Then we'll go home and have some cookies and milk. You'll feel better soon," she said.
She kissed them and hugged them. She cleaned their wounds and put some bandages on them. She held their hands and walked with them to their house. They felt better and loved.
They learned a lesson. They learned not to climb the vine and to be careful. They learned to pray to God and to trust their mother. They thanked God and their mother for their help. They ate some cookies and milk and smiled. They were happy and safe.
