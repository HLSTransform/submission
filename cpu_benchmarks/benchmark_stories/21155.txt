Once upon a time there was a little girl called Olivia. She was three-years-old and wanted to measure something. Olivia asked her mummy, "What can I measure?" Her mummy opened the kitchen drawer and gave Olivia a menu.
"This is a menu", said her mummy.
"It looks funny," Olivia replied.
Mummy smiled and said, "You can measure with it. It is flexible. You can change it however you like."
Olivia got out some paper and a pencil. She started to measure things with the menu. She measured the kitchen table and the chairs. She even measured the curtains!
When she was finished measuring the room with the menu, Mum said, "Now it's supper time. Let's order from the menu you've been measuring with!"
Olivia was so happy and proud. She had learnt how to measure with the flexible menu.
