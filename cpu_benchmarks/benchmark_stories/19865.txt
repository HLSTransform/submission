Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie loved to sing all day long. It sang in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. Everyone loved to hear the birdie sing.
One day, the birdie flew too high and couldn't breathe. It needed oxygen to breathe, but there wasn't enough up there. The birdie started to feel sick and tired. It couldn't sing anymore.
Luckily, the birdie flew back down to where the oxygen was normal. It breathed in the fresh air and felt much better. The birdie started to sing again and everyone was happy to hear its beautiful voice. From that day on, the birdie knew to stay where the oxygen was normal so it could sing all day long.
