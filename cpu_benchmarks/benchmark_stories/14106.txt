One day, there was a strong little girl who lived near a park. Every day, she wanted to play in the park, but her dad told her that she had to stay inside because he wanted to prevent her from getting hurt.
The little girl was so sad. Every day she watched the other kids play in the park while she stayed inside and cleaned the house with a mop. 
But one day, the little girl got a bright idea. She got the mop and ran out to the park. On reaching the park, she started sweeping the leaves away with her mop. Everyone was surprised to see her mop the park and the strong little girl worked really hard for a long time. 
When night time finally came, the park was sparkling clean and everyone cheered for the little girl. The dad was so proud of his daughter for using the mop to help the park stay clean. He never knew the mop could be used to prevent the park from getting messy.
