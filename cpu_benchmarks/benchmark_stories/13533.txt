Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat candy all day long. One day, her mom said, "Lily, you can't eat candy all the time. It will make your stomach hurt." But Lily didn't listen and kept eating candy.
One day, Lily's stomach started to hurt really bad. She cried and cried. Her mom said, "I told you that candy would hurt your stomach. Now we have to go to the doctor." At the doctor's office, the doctor said, "Lily, you have to stop eating so much candy. It's not good for your stomach."
Lily felt sad and ashamed. She said, "I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't listen to you." Her mom hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. We all make mistakes. But now you know that too much candy is not good for you. I'm proud of you for admitting your mistake and learning from it." From that day on, Lily only ate candy in moderation and her stomach felt much better.
