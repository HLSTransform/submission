Once upon a time, there was a frog. The frog lived in a wide pond. Every day, the frog would hop around and enjoy the sun.
Every day, the frog would grow. He grew bigger and bigger. He grew so big that his pond started to feel small.
So, one day, the frog decided to leave his pond. He hopped away, looking for a bigger pond. He hopped, hopped and hopped until he found a wide pond.
The frog was so happy to have a bigger home. He hopped around the pond, happy and content. He would enjoy living in his new, wide pond.
