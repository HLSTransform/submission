One day, Tom went on a long journey. He sailed across the sea and arrived at an island. Tom felt confused when he first arrived and saw that the island was huge and mysterious. 
Tom was also scared because he didn't know what might be on the island. He thought he heard strange noises as he got closer and closer. Suddenly, he started to shiver, as the atmosphere on the island was so cold and eerie.
Tom was brave and decided to explore the island. He soon found the source of the noise. It was a large and friendly dog who was barking. Tom was very happy to find the dog. He decided to take the dog with him and sailed away from the island.
Tom returned back to his hometown with his new friend. He was glad that he was brave enough to explore the island and faced his fear. Tom and his dog were very happy together and will never forget the experience on the mysterious island.
