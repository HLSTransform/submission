Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat candy, especially mint candy. He would always ask his mommy for some after dinner. One day, Timmy's mommy gave him a piece of mint candy that tasted so good. Timmy was so happy that he asked for another piece. But his mommy said no because he had already had one.
Timmy got upset and started to cry. He wanted more candy so badly. Suddenly, Timmy's little sister came into the room and asked what was wrong. Timmy told her that he wanted more candy but mommy said no. His sister had an idea and said, "Let's spray some mint spray in our mouths, it will taste just as good as candy!"
Timmy was hesitant at first but decided to try it. They both sprayed the mint spray in their mouths and it tasted so good! Timmy was no longer upset and was happy that he had something that tasted as good as candy.
