Sam and Mia like to fish with Dad. They have a rod, a hook, a worm and a bucket. They go to the lake and find a good spot. Dad helps them put the worm on the hook and throw the rod in the water.
They wait and wait for a fish to bite. Sam sees a big fish near his rod. He gets excited and pulls hard. The fish jumps out of the water and lands on the grass. Sam runs to get it, but the fish is slippery and wiggles away. Sam chases the fish and tries to catch it with his hands.
Mia sees another fish near her rod. She is ready and pulls gently. The fish comes out of the water and into the bucket. Mia is happy and proud. She shows Dad and Sam her fish. Dad says she did a good job. Sam is sad and jealous. He wants a fish too.
Dad tells Sam not to give up. He says there are more fish in the lake. He gives Sam a new worm and helps him throw the rod again. Sam waits and hopes for a fish. He sees a small fish nibble his hook. He pulls slowly and carefully. The fish comes out of the water and into the bucket. Sam is happy and proud. He shows Dad and Mia his fish. Dad says he did a good job too.
Sam and Mia hug and smile. They have two fish in the bucket. They are ready to go home and cook the fish. They shut the lid of the bucket and carry it together. They thank Dad for taking them fishing. They had a lot of fun.
