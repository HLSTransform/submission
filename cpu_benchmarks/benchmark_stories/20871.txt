Once upon a time, Jack and Emma were walking in the park. Jack started to cry because he was very hot and he was feeling very sad. Emma saw this and said in a comforting voice, "Don't worry Jack, I have something that will help".
Jack looked up. He asked, "What can help me?". Emma smiled and said, "Let's go over to the pond and you can cool down in the water". Jack felt excited.
At the pond, Jack jumped and played in the water. It felt wonderful. The hot feeling was gone and Jack felt much better. He said to Emma, "Thank you for being so helpful".
Afterwards, the two friends dried off in the sun. Jack was very happy. He said to Emma, "I'm so glad we came to the park and you were so helpful". Emma smiled and said, "Me too, now let's go and find something else fun to do". 
The two friends ran off to continue their adventure.
