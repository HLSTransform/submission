Once upon a time there was a little girl named Emma. She was three years old. Every morning she loved to go outside with her mom and see the boats sailing by in the sea.
One day while they were watching, they noticed a huge anchor in the water. Emma was so excited and wanted to go closer to take a look. So her mom and her went on the boat to take a look.
When they got near the anchor, Emma jumped off the boat and touched it. She said, “Mommy, I wish I could take it home.” Her mom wiped away the tears in Emma’s eyes and said, “No sweetheart, an anchor is too big for us to take home.”
But Emma was determined, so she decided to stay with the anchor and make it her new home. Her mom thought it was a great idea, so she helped Emma set up a peaceful little camp around the anchor.
Every morning, Emma would wake up and go on a tour around the anchor. She would stay out until the sun was setting and feel a sense of peace and comfort every time she returned home.
Whenever it rained, her mom would wipe the water off the anchor and make sure Emma stayed dry. She would tell her, “Home sweet Home!”, which always put a smile on Emma’s face.
