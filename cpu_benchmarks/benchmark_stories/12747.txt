John and Lucy were playing in the garden. Suddenly, the sky became dark and mist started to form. Lucy was sad about the change of weather.
John said to Lucy, "Let's organize something, so we can keep playing. We can all make sandcastles together!"
Lucy smiled and they started to organize the sand. But, a strong wind blew and the sand got everywhere. 
"It's too poor!" Lucy cried. 
John wanted to help Lucy, so he said, "Let's organize the sand together. That way, we can still have fun in the mist!"
So, John and Lucy grabbed their shovels and organized the sand. They built a beautiful castle together and they had so much fun that they forgot the mist.
