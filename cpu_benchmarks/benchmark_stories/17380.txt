Tim and Sam were two dogs who liked to play in the park. They had collars with their names on them, so people knew who they belonged to. One day, they saw a big rock near a pond. They ran to the rock and barked at it.
"Let's rock the rock!" Tim said. "Maybe there is something under it!"
"Okay!" Sam said. "You push and I pull!"
They tried to rock the rock, but it was very heavy. They pushed and pulled with all their strength, but the rock did not move. They got tired and panting.
"Maybe we should give up," Sam said. "This rock is too big for us."
"No!" Tim said. "We can do it! One more try!"
They pushed and pulled again, but this time, the rock rolled a little bit. It rolled towards the pond, and Tim and Sam followed it. They did not see the water until it was too late. The rock fell into the pond with a splash, and dragged Tim and Sam with it. They tried to swim, but the collars were too tight and heavy. They could not breathe. They sank to the bottom of the pond.
The next day, their owners came to look for them. They saw the rock in the pond, and the collars floating on the surface. They cried and called their names, but Tim and Sam did not answer. They were dead.
