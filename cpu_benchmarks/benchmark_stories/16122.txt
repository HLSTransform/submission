Max woke up early one morning. He was so excited to go outside. As he opened his bedroom window, he saw the sun just rising in the east. He was so brave! He wanted to go outside and explore the world.
Max's mom heard him and said, "Where are you going Max?"
Max replied with a smile, "I'm going outside to explore the world. I wanna see what the east has to show me!"
His mom couldn't help but laugh. She said, "Okay, be careful and stay brave Max!"
Max was so happy. He waved goodbye to his mom, and he was off! He went east, and he had the most exciting adventure. He felt so brave, and he felt so proud of himself. He learned a lot from his exploration. 
The next morning, when Max woke up, he was eager to go outside and explore again. He knew he was brave enough for any adventure.
