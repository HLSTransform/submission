Once there were two friends named Susy and Tim. Susy was nosy and liked to talk to everyone. Tim was more shy and stayed to himself.
One day, Susy went to Tim's house to help him make toast. She was excited and kept poking her head into the kitchen to see what he was doing.
Tim was very nice and showed Susy how to turn on the toaster and put the bread in. They laughed as they watched the bread pop out of the toaster.
The next day, Susy brought a jar of jam to help make the toast even more delicious. They had the best breakfast ever together and ate their yummy toast.
Susy and Tim loved having fun together, and Susy was glad that she could help out. That nosy Susy always had a way of making every day an adventure!
