Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max loved to play outside in the rain. One day, Max's owner said, "Max, you need to come inside now. You're all wet!" 
Max replied, "I know, but I like the rain. It makes me happy."
His owner said, "But you're getting sick, Max. You need to dry off."
Max looked at his collar and noticed it was wet too. "Oh no, my collar is wet too. I don't like it when my collar is wet."
His owner said, "Don't be ignorant, Max. You need to come inside and dry off. Then we can play again later when it's sunny." 
Max agreed and went inside to dry off. He felt much better after he was dry and was ready to play again with his owner.
