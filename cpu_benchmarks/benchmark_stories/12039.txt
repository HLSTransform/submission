Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear pretty skirts. One day, her mom took her to the store to buy a new skirt. Lily saw a really pretty one, but it was too expensive. Her mom said, "Let's look for a cheap one instead."
They looked and looked, but Lily couldn't find a skirt she liked. She started to get upset and said, "I don't want to delay anymore. I want a pretty skirt now!" Her mom said, "Don't worry, we'll find one. Let's ask the lady over there for help."
The lady showed them a skirt that was both pretty and cheap. Lily was so happy she started to dance around. "Thank you, thank you!" she said to the lady. Her mom smiled and said, "See, sometimes it's good to delay and wait for the right thing." Lily nodded and twirled in her new skirt. She was so happy!
