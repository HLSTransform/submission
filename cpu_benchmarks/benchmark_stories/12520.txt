Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo liked to swim in the ocean with his friends. One day, they saw a jellyfish. The jellyfish was very pretty, but Nemo's friend said it was also very dangerous. Nemo didn't believe him and swam towards the jellyfish. Suddenly, the jellyfish stung Nemo! It hurt a lot, but luckily Nemo's friend knew what to do. He helped Nemo and they swam back to their home.
When they got back, Nemo's friend told him a joke to make him feel better. Nemo laughed and forgot about the jellyfish. Later, they went to play in a pond, but it was very filthy. They didn't want to swim in it because it was too dirty. Instead, they played on the shore and had fun telling more jokes. Nemo was happy to have such a good friend who could make him laugh and keep him safe.
