Tim and Kim were twins who liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big tree with red fruits. They wanted to try them, so they ran to the tree.
"Let's pick some fruits!" Tim said.
"OK, but be careful. They might be sour." Kim said.
They picked some fruits and bit into them. They were very sour! They made faces and spit them out.
"Yuck! These fruits are sour!" Tim said.
"Maybe we picked the wrong ones. Let's try the other side of the tree." Kim said.
They went to the other side of the tree, where the fruits were yellow. They picked some fruits and bit into them. They were sweet and juicy! They smiled and ate them.
"Mmm! These fruits are sweet!" Kim said.
"I like them too. They are much better than the red ones." Tim said.
They ate some more fruits and felt happy. Then they saw a sign on the tree. It said: "This is a lemon tree. The red fruits are lemons. The yellow fruits are oranges. Lemons are sour. Oranges are sweet. Pick wisely."
They read the sign and learned a lesson. They learned that not everything that looks good is good, and not everything that looks bad is bad. They learned to pick wisely.
The end.
