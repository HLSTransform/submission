There was once a little boy named Tom. Tom liked to read books at the library. Every day he would go to the library after school and bring home a new book. He liked to work hard to read them, and learn something new.
One day Tom found a really strong book. The book had thick pages and its cover was very strong. Tom wanted to work very hard to read the strong book.
He opened it up and started reading. It was very complicated, with lots of big words. Tom worked and worked, but he just couldn't understand it. So he went back to the library and found a book that was easier to read. He worked very hard to understand it, and before long he knew more than ever before. 
He was so proud of himself for working hard in the library. And he knew if he kept going, he could read even the strongest of books.
