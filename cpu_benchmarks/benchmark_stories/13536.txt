Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mommy went to a big building with many floors. They went inside an elevator and pressed the button for the 10th floor. Lily loved going in the elevator because it made her feel like she was flying.
As they were going up, Lily heard a strange noise. She said to her mommy, "Mommy, listen! What's that noise?" Her mommy listened and heard the noise too. They both looked at the elevator buttons and saw that the number 5 button was flashing.
Lily's mommy said, "Oh no, the elevator is broken. We have to wait for someone to come and fix it." Lily was sad because she wanted to go to the 10th floor. But then, a man came and fixed the elevator. Lily's mommy said, "He's a very dependable man. He fixed the elevator so quickly!" Lily was happy because she could finally go to the 10th floor and play with her toys.
