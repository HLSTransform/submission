The sun was shining in the sky and the warm air felt so nice. Joe was playing in the garden while his mom watched. He was having so much fun. He ran and he jumped and he laughed so loud. 
Joe wanted to show his mom he could do something new. He stood tall and he stretched his arms out wide and waved them up and down.
"Look at me!" he said.
His mom smiled. "You are stretching so well Joe, that's great!"
Joe felt happy and proud that he had done something his mom liked. He ran off to the nearby forest to explore. 
The forest was so quiet and a bit scary but Joe was brave. He saw many trees with thick trunks and some tall skinny ones too. Joe liked the tall, skinny ones best. He ran up to a tree and stretched up high trying to touch the leaves on the top. He wasn't quite tall enough, so he tried again and again. 
Finally, after much stretching Joe was able to just touch the top leaves! He smiled with delight and ran back home to tell his mom the exciting news.
