Once upon a time, there was a lovely sailor who sailed the seas. He loved to travel and explore the world. Every day, the sailor found something that he valued. He found seashells, fish and coral, and he valued them all.
One day, the sailor found something extra special. He spotted a little island with a white sand beach and smiles from the friendly people. He quickly realized that this island was most special and that it was valuable to him.
The sailor visited the island often and he made many friends. He realized that people, time, and memories were some of the most valuable things in life. Every time he left the island, the sailor felt so happy and thankful. He knew that this island and his friends had given him something he could treasure forever.
