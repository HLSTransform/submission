Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat avocados because they were soft and yummy. One day, Lily went to the store with her mom to buy some avocados. 
Lily saw a toy she wanted and asked her mom if they could buy it. Her mom said, "No, we can't spend money on toys today. We need to buy some avocados for dinner." 
Lily was sad she couldn't get the toy, but she was happy when they got home and her mom made some avocado toast for dinner. It was so soft and delicious! 
Lily said to her mom, "I'm glad we didn't spend money on the toy. This avocado toast is much better!" Her mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it, Lily." And they both enjoyed their avocado dinner together. The end.
