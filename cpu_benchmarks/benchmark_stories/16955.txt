Tom and Mia liked to play outside in the sun. They ran and jumped and laughed. One day, they saw a big hill with a cave. They wanted to see what was inside.
They walked up the hill and looked at the cave. It was dark and quiet. Tom said, "Let's go in and explore." Mia said, "OK, but be careful. There might be something unknown in there."
They held hands and walked into the cave. They saw rocks and bats and spiders. They were not afraid. They liked to see new things. They went deeper and deeper into the cave.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a roar. It came from the end of the cave. They stopped and looked at each other. They were scared. What was making the roar? Was it a lion? A bear? A monster?
They heard the roar again. It was louder and closer. They turned around and ran. They wanted to get out of the cave. They ran and ran and ran.
They reached the entrance of the cave. They saw the sun and the sky. They felt the wind on their faces. They were happy. They were safe.
They looked back at the cave. They wondered what was in there. They decided to never go back. They ran down the hill and back to their home. They hugged their mom and dad and told them what happened. They said, "We heard a roar in the cave. It was unknown and scary. We ran away."
Their mom and dad said, "We are glad you are OK. You are brave and smart. But next time, don't go into unknown places. They might be dangerous. Stay close to us and play in the sun."
Tom and Mia said, "OK, we will. We love you." They smiled and kissed their mom and dad. They learned a lesson. They were happy. The end.
