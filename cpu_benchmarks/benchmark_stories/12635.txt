Once upon a time, there was a big forest with many trees. One day, a kind man came to the forest with a big truck. He had some lumber in the truck and wanted to give it to the animals who lived in the forest. 
The animals were very happy and obedient. They all gathered around the man and his truck. The man gave the lumber to the animals and they used it to build new homes. 
The animals were so grateful to the man for giving them the lumber. They were also very obedient and worked together to build their new homes. From that day on, they all lived happily in their new homes in the big forest.
