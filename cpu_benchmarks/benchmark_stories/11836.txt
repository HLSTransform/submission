Daddy took his daughter to the park. The park was so fancy! He sat on the bench and daughter played on the swings. Daddy said, "Let me spoil you a little bit. What would you like?" She said, "Can I have some oil? I want to make something with it!" Daddy said, "Of course you can, my sweetheart. That's a great idea." 
They went to the store and Daddy bought a big bottle of oil. When they came back to the park, Daddy gave the oil to his daughter. She was so happy. She wanted to make a work of art with the oil. She spread some of the oil on the ground in a big circle. Then, she put some drops of oil around the circle.
It was a beautiful sight! Daddy was so proud. He said, "This looks so fancy! You are so creative. You have spoiled this park with your beautiful oil circles!" His daughter was so happy that Daddy loved her creation!
