One day, Mikey was feeling bored. He wanted to find something fun to do. He noticed a big, messy dictionary on the floor. He wanted to pick it up. He knew it was heavy, but he was brave and strong. He picked up the dictionary. 
Mikey started to look at all the words. He couldn't understand them, but it still looked interesting. His mom noticed him holding the dictionary and smiled. She said, "Let's look up some fun words together!" 
Mikey was so excited. He and his mom read some silly words. They laughed when they read the word "giggle". Mikey then decided he wanted to know what his own name meant. His mom flipped through the pages until they found it. It said that Michael means "God is mighty". 
Mikey and his mom put the dictionary back where it was. It was still a bit messy, but it didn't matter because Mikey had so much fun learning. He knew it was the best way to spend a boring day.
