Lily liked to splash in the pool. She had a big pool in her backyard. She had a yellow duck and a blue ball to play with. She was happy.
But her neighbor Tom was lazy. He did not like to splash. He liked to sit on a chair and read a book. He had a small pool in his backyard. He had no toys to play with. He was bored.
One day, Lily saw Tom sitting on his chair. She wanted to make him happy. She said, "Tom, come and splash with me! It is fun!"
Tom looked at Lily. He said, "No, thank you. I like to read. Splashing is too noisy and wet."
Lily was sad. She said, "But splashing is fun! You can play with my duck and my ball. Please, Tom, come and splash with me!"
Tom shook his head. He said, "No, thank you. I like to read. Splashing is not fun for me."
Lily was angry. She said, "Fine, then. I will splash you!" She picked up her ball and threw it at Tom. The ball hit Tom and made a big splash. Tom got wet and dropped his book.
Tom was surprised. He said, "Hey, stop that! You splashed me!"
Lily laughed. She said, "See, splashing is fun! Come and splash with me, Tom!"
Tom looked at his wet book. He looked at Lily's smile. He thought for a moment. He said, "Okay, okay. I will splash with you. But only for a little while."
Lily was happy. She said, "Yay, Tom! Come and splash with me!" She gave him her duck and they splashed together. They had fun.
