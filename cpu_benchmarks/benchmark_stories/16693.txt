One day, a boy and a girl were playing in the garden. They saw a big red fox hiding behind a bush. The fox looked hungry and angry.
"Let's go away, the fox is scary!" the girl said.
"No, let's stay and watch, maybe the fox will do something funny!" the boy said.
They stayed and watched, but the fox did not do anything funny. The fox jumped out of the bush and ran towards them. The boy and the girl were very scared. They ran to the house, but the door was not open.
"Help, help, the fox is coming!" they shouted.
Their mom heard them and came to the door. She opened the door and let them in. She saw the fox and said a magic word. The fox started to shrink and shrink until it was very small.
"Look, the fox is tiny now!" the boy said.
"Yes, the fox is tiny and harmless now. Mom is very clever!" the girl said.
The mom smiled and hugged them. She said, "Don't worry, the fox will not bother you anymore. But next time, be careful and don't go near wild animals. They can be dangerous."
The boy and the girl nodded and said, "Yes, mom, we will be careful. Thank you for saving us!"
They went inside and had some cookies and milk. The fox ran away and never came back. The end.
