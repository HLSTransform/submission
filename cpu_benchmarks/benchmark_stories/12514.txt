Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved olives and always ate them with her meals.
One day, Lily went to the park and saw two groups of kids playing separately. She wanted to play with both groups, but they didn't want to play together.
Lily had an idea. She went to each group and said, "Let's unite and play together! It will be fun!" The kids agreed and played together happily.
After playing, Lily's mom asked her how her day at the park was. Lily replied, "It was great! I made new friends and we had famous olives together!"
