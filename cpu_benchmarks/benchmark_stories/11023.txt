Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play in the bath. They splash and laugh and make bubbles. Mommy says it is time to get out. She wraps them in big towels and rubs them dry.
"Can I comb your hair, Lily?" Tom asks. He likes to comb his sister's hair. He thinks it is soft and shiny.
"Okay, Tom. But be gentle," Lily says. She sits on the floor and lets Tom comb her hair. He tries to make it look nice. He makes a ponytail and a braid and a bun.
"Look, Lily! You are so pretty!" Tom says. He is proud of his work. He shows Lily a mirror.
Lily looks in the mirror. She does not like what she sees. She thinks Tom made her hair look silly. She feels angry and sad.
"Tom, you are mean! You ruined my hair!" Lily cries. She pulls the comb from Tom's hand and hits him with it. Tom feels hurt and scared. He drops the mirror and it breaks.
Mommy hears the noise and comes to see what is wrong. She sees Lily and Tom crying, the comb on the floor and the broken mirror. She is very angry and disappointed.
"Lily, Tom, what have you done? You are both naughty and careless. You could have hurt yourselves or each other. And you wasted a good mirror. You are in big trouble, young ones. No more bath time for a week. Go to your rooms right now and think about what you did," Mommy says.
Lily and Tom feel ashamed and sorry. They wish they had not fought over the comb. They wish they had been kind and gentle. They hug each other and say sorry. Then they go to their rooms and cry. They have a bad ending.
