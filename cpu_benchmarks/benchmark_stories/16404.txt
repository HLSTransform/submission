Anna likes to help her mom in the kitchen. She wants to be a good cook like her mom. One day, mom asks Anna to get a pan from the shelf. Anna sees a big pan that looks shiny and new. She wants to use that pan.
"Can I have this pan, mom?" Anna asks, pointing to the big pan.
"No, Anna, that pan is too big for you. You need a smaller pan that fits your hands. The big pan is heavy and hot. You might drop it and hurt yourself or make a mess." Mom says.
"But I want to try, mom. Please, let me have the big pan." Anna says, not listening to mom.
"Okay, Anna, but be careful. You have to balance the pan with both hands and not let it touch the stove." Mom says, hoping Anna will learn her lesson.
Anna takes the big pan and tries to carry it to the counter. But the pan is too big and heavy for her. She can't balance it well. She feels the pan slipping from her hands. She tries to catch it, but it is too late. The pan falls to the floor with a loud bang. It makes a dent in the floor and a scratch in the pan. Anna is scared and sad. She starts to cry.
"Anna, are you okay? What happened?" Mom runs to Anna and hugs her.
"I'm sorry, mom. I dropped the big pan. I wanted to use it, but it was too big for me. I couldn't balance it. I made a big noise and a big mess. I ruined the pan and the floor." Anna says, sobbing.
"It's okay, Anna. I'm glad you are not hurt. The pan and the floor can be fixed. But you have to listen to me next time. I know what is best for you. You have to use things that fit you and your skills. You can't do everything by yourself. You have to ask for help when you need it. That is how you learn and grow." Mom says, wiping Anna's tears.
"I understand, mom. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you. I will use the smaller pan next time. And I will ask for help when I need it. Thank you for teaching me, mom. I love you." Anna says, smiling.
"I love you too, Anna. You are a good girl. Now, let's clean up this mess and make some cookies with the smaller pan. How does that sound?" Mom says, smiling too.
"Yay! I love cookies. And I love you, mom." Anna says, hugging mom.
The end.
