Once upon a time there was a girl who had nothing but an empty ground. She felt so very sad and lonely. But then one day, the girl heard a voice. It said "Let me help you." The voice belonged to a magical creature! He said, "I will fill your empty ground with something special."
The girl was so excited. She said yes please! The magical creature waved his hand, and suddenly the ground was no longer empty. It was filled with flowers, birds, and wonderful things. The girl was so happy she could hardly believe it.
The magical creature smiled. He said "Now you will never feel lonely or sad again." The girl thanked the creature and they said goodbye. She looked around her beautiful filled ground and knew she was very lucky. She thanked the creature every day, for filling her empty ground with something special.
