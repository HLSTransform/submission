Sara and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big dog with brown fur and a long tail. The dog is running and barking. Sara and Ben like dogs. They want to join the dog and play with him.
"Hi, dog! Can we play with you?" Sara asks. She runs after the dog. Ben follows her.
But the dog does not want to play. He is fierce. He growls and shows his teeth. He does not like strangers. He thinks Sara and Ben are bad.
"Go away! This is my park!" the dog says. He snaps at Sara and Ben. They are scared. They stop running and back away.
The dog chases them. He bites Sara's leg. Sara cries. She feels a lot of pain. She also feels an itch. The dog's teeth hurt her skin.
"Help! Help!" Sara and Ben shout. They run to their mom. She is sitting on a bench. She sees the dog and the bite.
"Oh, no! Are you okay, Sara?" she asks. She hugs Sara and Ben. She looks at Sara's leg. It is red and swollen.
"We need to go to the doctor. The dog might have germs. He might make you sick," she says. She picks up Sara and Ben. She walks to the car.
The dog stays in the park. He is still fierce. He does not like people. He does not want to join anyone. He is lonely and sad.
