Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park with their bikes. One day, they saw a big hill with a lot of flowers. Lily wanted to go up the hill and see the flowers. Ben was scared of the hill. He said, "No, Lily, it is too high and steep. We might fall."
Lily said, "Don't be scared, Ben. It will be fun. Look, there is a light rose at the top. It is so pretty. I want to pick it for my mom. Come on, let's go." She pedaled her bike and started to go up the hill.
Ben did not want to lose his friend. He followed her, but he was very nervous. He said, "Lily, slow down. You are going too fast. The hill is slippery and bumpy. You might crash."
Lily did not listen. She said, "I can do it, Ben. I am not afraid. I want to see the rose. It is shining like the sun. It is the best flower ever." She pedaled faster and faster. She reached the top of the hill and saw the rose. She smiled and said, "I did it, Ben. I did it. Look at the rose. It is so beautiful. I am going to pick it."
She reached out her hand to touch the rose. But she did not see the thorns. The rose pricked her finger and made her bleed. She cried out, "Ow, ow, ow. The rose hurt me. It is not nice. It is mean." She let go of her bike and fell down the hill. Her bike rolled after her and hit her. She got more hurt and more sad.
Ben saw what happened and rushed to help her. He said, "Lily, Lily, are you okay? I am sorry. I should have stopped you. The rose was not worth it. You are more important than the rose. You are my friend." He hugged her and tried to make her feel better.
Lily said, "I am sorry, too, Ben. I should have listened to you. You were right. The hill was too high and steep. I was too fast and silly. The rose was not pretty. It was bad. You are my friend. You are the best." She hugged him back and smiled a little.
They walked back to their bikes and went home. They learned a lesson. They decided to never go up the hill again. They decided to play in the park with their bikes and their friends. They decided to be careful and happy. They decided to be good.
