Once upon a time, there was a bunny who lived in a cozy burrow underground. The bunny liked to count the stars in the night sky, and made sure to count them all before bed! One day, the bunny hopped out of the burrow and found an old, smelly skin lying on the ground. It had been there for a long, long time.
The bunny was curious about the skin, so he started counting it. 1, 2, 3... The bunny counted all the way up to 7. But then something strange happened - the skin started to move! The bunny was frightened, but he stayed brave and kept counting. Soon, the skin opened up, and out came a long snake!
The snake was big and scary, but the bunny stayed calm. He counted the colors on the snakeâ€™s back - 1, 2, 3, 4, all the way up to 12! The bunny knew the snake must be very old, and he thanked the snake for letting him count it. The bunny hopped away and went back to counting the stars that night.
