Once upon a time, there was a family that lived in a tall building. Every morning, the family would get into the elevator, which was a calm and peaceful place.
One day, the little girl noticed a strange noise coming from the elevator. It sounded like a buzzing. "Mom, the elevator makes a funny noise," she said.
Her mother smiled and said, "Let's find out what it is". They got out of the elevator and opened the panel on the wall. Inside, there was a busy bee trying to get out. She carefully reached in and carefully set it free.
The bee flew away and the family watched it go. They felt calm as they watched it settle in the trees outside. Then they got back into the elevator and continued their ride. Now the elevator was extra peaceful.
