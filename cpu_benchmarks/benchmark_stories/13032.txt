Once upon a time there was a big yellow factory. It was very noisy and made lots of things. One day the factory sent a big truck full of things down the road. All of a sudden, a small cat ran across the road in front of the truck! The driver of the truck quickly braked and didn't run over the cat, who was very happy. The driver was happy too and said "What a lucky cat! We can send this truck someplace else now".
The driver drove the truck to a nearby farm and stopped. He delivered many products to the people there and everyone was very happy. They thanked the driver for coming in the big yellow truck. After all the products were loaded into the farm, the driver waved and drove away in the big yellow factory truck.
The driver was so happy to have send the products to the farm and the people were happy too to have the new products which they needed. The yellow truck was a very important part of making sure the people had what they needed. It sent things to far away places.
