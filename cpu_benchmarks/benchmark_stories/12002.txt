Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to sing songs all day long. Her favorite song was about a little bird that flew high in the sky. 
One day, Lily's mom told her that they were going to visit her grandma's house. Lily was very excited because her grandma was very rich and had a big garden with lots of flowers. 
When they arrived at grandma's house, Lily saw that her grandma was in the kitchen washing some dishes. Lily wanted to help, so she asked if she could wash the spoons. Her grandma was happy to let her help, and they sang a song together while they washed the dishes. 
After they finished, Lily's grandma took her to the garden to show her the beautiful flowers. They sang another song about the flowers and danced around in the sunshine. It was a very happy day for Lily and she couldn't wait to come back and visit her grandma again. The end.
