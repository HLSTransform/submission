One day Jack decided to hide something very special. He chose to hide a mint. He carefully put it underneath a big stone in his yard. 
Days went by and Jack was starting to worry. What if someone found it? He knew he needed to check on it. He peered carefully around the stone, but it was still hidden. Jack smiled with relief. Now he could relax. 
Weeks went by and Jack was starting to worry again. What if the mint was still there? He knew he needed to check on it one more time. He carefully lifted the stone and peered underneath. There was the mint! Jack let out a sigh of relief. 
Jack took the mint and put in his pocket. Now it will stay safe, he thought. Jack never had to worry again.
