Once there was a nice man who wanted to build something. He looked up in the sky and saw a high shape. He wanted to make something just like it. So he got out some paper and drew a plan. 
He showed his plan to his friend. His friend thought the plan looked good and they got to work. 
They got lots of blocks and built the shape on the ground. They stacked the blocks very carefully to make it high. Soon they had built the shape just like in the plan. Everyone was so happy!
The man looked up again, and he could see the shape in the sky. He had made the same shape. He was very proud. 
He and his friend had worked hard and now they had a high shape. It felt good to have a plan that worked.
