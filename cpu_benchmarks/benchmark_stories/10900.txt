Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved looking up at the sky and watching the stars twinkle. One night, she saw a comet shoot across the sky. It was so pretty and bright!
The next day, Lily went to the store with her mom. She saw a toy that she really wanted, but it was too expensive. She felt sad because she couldn't have it. She told her mom, "I miss the comet from last night. It was free and beautiful."
Lily's mom hugged her and said, "Don't worry, sweetie. We can still have fun without buying expensive things. Let's go home and make some crafts together." Lily smiled and felt happy again. She realized that cheap things can be just as special as expensive things.
