Davey was walking in the forest when he saw something weird. It was a soldier. Davey had never seen a soldier before and he was scared. He tried to run away but the soldier disappeared in a flash. 
The soldier reappeared a few steps ahead of Davey, blocking his path. Davey was getting scared and he wanted to run away. But then the soldier disappeared again. 
This time Davey was brave and he stayed there. He saw the soldier disappear and reappear a few steps further away. He realised the soldier was playing with him. Davey laughed and started to play the game. He chased the soldier and when he got too close, the soldier would disappear and reappear a few steps away. 
The game was so much fun! But then, when Davey was closer than ever, the soldier disappeared one more time. He didn't reappear. Davey couldn't find the soldier no matter how much he looked. He was gone. 
Davey had an idea. He thought the soldier was playing hide and seek with him. He ran through the forest, sure he would soon find the soldier hiding behind a tree. Sure enough, when he looked, he saw the soldier there, waiting for him.
