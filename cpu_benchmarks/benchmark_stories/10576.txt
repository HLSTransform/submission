Millie and her brother Sam had a pet parrot. One day when they entered the room, they noticed that the parrot was nowhere to be seen. Millie was puzzled. "Where is he?" she asked. 
Sam scratched his head. "Maybe he's hiding," he suggested.
So they searched the room high and low, but they still couldn't find him. Millie was getting restless. She decided to call out his name. "Parrot! Parrot!"
Just then, they heard a chirping sound coming from underneath the bed. They looked over and sure enough, they saw the parrot, peeking his head out from behind the bed.
Millie laughed. "Hey, parrot!" she said. "Why were you hiding? You shouldn't do that!"
The parrot just chirped a reply, but Millie and Sam knew that he wouldn't do it again.
