Once upon a time there was a family. The family had a nice house with a fireplace. But one day, the fireplace broke. The family was very sad and did not know what to do.
So the family asked their neighbor to lend them some money to pay for the repairs. The neighbor said yes and the family was so happy. They quickly paid someone to repair the fireplace and it was good again.
But then the family asked the neighbor for another favor. They wanted to borrow some money to buy some new toys. The neighbor said no and the family was very sad.
The family worked for days to try to earn enough money for new toys, but it was not enough. In the end, the fireplace remained broken and the family never got the toys.
