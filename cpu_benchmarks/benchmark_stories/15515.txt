One day, Jack was walking in the park. He saw a big yellow bird. He was so excited and wanted to get closer. But the bird started to zoom away! Jack was scared and started to panic. He felt so dizzy, like he was spinning around.
Jack did not know what to do. He looked around and saw his dad. He ran up to him, feeling very scared. His dad gave him a big hug and said it was ok.
Jack was still a bit shaky but felt much better. His dad explained the bird was just trying to be safe. He said that all animals can panic when they feel scared. Jack smiled and felt better. He knew he was safe with his dad.
