Lily and Max were playing in the living room. They had a big cardboard box that they used as a house. They cut out windows and a door and drew pictures on the walls. They had a lot of fun.
But then Max got hungry. He looked around for something to eat. He saw a banana on the table, but it was too far away. He saw a cookie on the floor, but it was dirty. He saw the cardboard box, and it looked tasty. He took a bite.
"Max, what are you doing?" Lily asked. She saw Max eating the cardboard. She was angry. "That's our house! You can't eat our house!"
"But I'm hungry," Max said. He chewed the cardboard. It was hard and dry. He didn't like it, but he didn't want to stop.
"Yes, you are hungry, but cardboard is not food," Lily said. She tried to take the cardboard away from Max. "You need to eat something else. Something good for you. Like a banana or a cookie."
"No, I want to eat the cardboard," Max said. He held on to the cardboard. He tried to eat more, but it didn't fit in his mouth. He spit it out.
They both looked at the cardboard. It had a big hole in it. It was not a house anymore. It was a mess.
They both felt sad. They had ruined their fun. They wished they had not eaten the cardboard. They wished they had eaten something else. Something good for them. Like a banana or a cookie.
