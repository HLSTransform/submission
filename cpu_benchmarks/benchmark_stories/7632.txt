Molly was so excited. She was finally going on vacation. She looked out the car window. Everything seemed so wide and new. And she was going to explore it all.
When Molly finally arrived, she saw a beach. The ocean was sparkling in the sun. She felt so happy.
After her first day exploring, Molly was tired. She yawned and curled up in her bed. Soon, she was fast asleep.
The next day, Molly went in search of new adventures. She yawned and stretched as she went. Everywhere she looked was amazing. She couldn't believe she was on vacation.
At the end of her vacation, Molly was sad to leave. But she was excited to tell everyone all about her wide adventures.
