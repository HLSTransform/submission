Lily and Mom went to the mall. Lily liked the mall. She saw many toys and books and clothes. She wanted to touch everything. Mom said no. Mom said they were here to buy a gift for Dad.
They walked and walked. Lily got tired. She also got cold. The mall was very big and had cold air. Lily shivered. She hugged Mom. Mom said, "Are you cold, sweetie?" Lily nodded. Mom said, "Let's find a warm place to sit and have a snack."
They found a cafe. It had a fireplace and soft chairs. Mom bought a hot chocolate for Lily and a coffee for herself. They sat by the fire. Lily sipped her hot chocolate. It was sweet and warm. She felt better. She smiled at Mom. Mom smiled back. She said, "You are a good girl, Lily. I love you." Lily said, "I love you too, Mom. And I love the mall. But I love you more."
Mom gave Lily a hug and a kiss. She said, "Let's finish our drinks and then go find a gift for Dad. What do you think he would like?" Lily thought for a moment. She said, "Maybe a book. Or a hat. Or a toy." Mom said, "Those are all good ideas. Let's go see what we can find." They finished their drinks and threw away their cups. They held hands and walked to the store. Lily was happy. She was not cold or tired anymore. She was warm and excited. She wanted to surprise Dad with a gift. She hoped he would like it.
