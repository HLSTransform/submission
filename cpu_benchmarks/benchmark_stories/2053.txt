Once upon a time, there was a big train. It went chugga chugga choo choo all day long. One day, the train got tired and needed to rest. 
The train found a nice spot under a tree and took a nap. It felt much better after a good rest. 
Later, a kind man came by and gave the train some water and snacks. The man was very generous and the train was very happy. 
From then on, the train made sure to rest and take breaks when it needed to. And it always remembered the generous man who helped it when it was tired.
