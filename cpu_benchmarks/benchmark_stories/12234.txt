Once upon a time there was a family who had to move house. They had to pack all their things into boxes and sacks. It was a difficult job to do but they all worked together to get it done quickly. 
When they had finished packing, the family went on a holiday. They went in a big car and drove for a long time until they arrived in their new house. 
The family had lots of fun on their holiday. They stayed in a big hotel, ate in nice restaurants and went to the zoo. 
When the holiday was over, the family had to unpack all the sacks and boxes. It was a lot more difficult than it was to pack them! But eventually the job was done and the family settled into their new house. 
The End.
