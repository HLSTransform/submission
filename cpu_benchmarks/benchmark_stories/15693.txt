Once there was a little girl named Sam. She was only three years old but she was very brave. One day Sam took a walk in a garden. As she walked through the garden she came across an old and rich man.
The man started talking to her and asked her to come with him. But Sam didn't want to go! She stayed strong and resisted the man's orders.
The man said: "Come with me. I will give you a lot of money."
But Sam shook her head and said: "No, I'm not interested!"
The man was a bit surprised but Sam didn't give in. She kept resisting him and the man had to leave.
At the end of the day, Sam was proud of herself. She was still very brave even though she was only three years old. She had resisted the old and rich man's orders!
