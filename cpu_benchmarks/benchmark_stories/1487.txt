One day, a puppy was born. He had very soft fur, and a little brown collar around his neck. The puppy loved playing in the grass, running around with the children, and eating tidbits of food. He was very brave and clever, and he was sure he could do anything.
One day, the little puppy was out in the garden when he decided he wanted to go explore the world. He raced around the yard and then leapt out over the fence and into the big wide world.
He wasn't too sure what to do, so he just kept running. He raced up and down hills, and through the meadows, feeling the fresh grass between his toes. Finally, he arrived at a brilliant blue lake. He'd never seen a lake before and he thought it was amazing.
The little puppy decided to take a swim. He loved the way he felt as he raced around the lake, feeling free and wild. He promised himself he would come back to the lake every day.
Back at home, the puppy settled in with a contented sigh. He knew he'd made the right decision, and he promised himself he'd wear his collar with pride. Because while it was fun to explore the world, he was happiest at home.
