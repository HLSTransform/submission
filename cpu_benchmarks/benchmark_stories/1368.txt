Once upon a time there was a very rude tank. This tank rolled everywhere he went, bumping into things and making them fall over. He was never very careful and no one seemed to like him.
One day the tank rolled near a small lake. He couldn't stop in time and fell in the lake. He tried to get out but he was so heavy he couldn't do it. He was really scared!
Suddenly, a little frog hopped by and noticed the tank struggling. The frog was kind and offered her help. She hopped onto the tank's back and balanced there until he could get out.
The tank was very thankful and said "Thank you!" to the little frog. From that day on, the tank was much more careful, friendly and kind. He always thanked the little frog in his heart for helping him balance again.
