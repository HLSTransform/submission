Once upon a time there was a little girl. Her name was Daisy. Daisy was three years old.
One day, Daisy wanted to touch something new. She walked over to a big tree with lots of leaves. Daisy was so excited - she just had to touch it!
When Daisy touched the tree she heard a loud noise. A police officer was walking by and he heard the noise. He saw Daisy, so he said "What are you doing?"
Daisy said, "I wanted to touch the tree." The policeman said, "That's against the law, you can't do that!"
Daisy didn't know what the law was, but she was scared. She said, "Please don't get mad at me - I'm sorry!"
The policeman said, "It's ok - just don't do it again. Next time, find something new to touch!"
Daisy said, "Ok, I promise!"
And that is the story of how Daisy learned about the law.
