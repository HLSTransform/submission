Once upon a time there was a kind bear. He lived in a big forest. Every day, he would go around the forest asking questions. One day, he asked an old tree what the best surprise was. The tree thought for a moment and then said the perfect surprise was a friend.
The bear was happy. He wanted a friend too! He ran around the forest looking for one. He asked all his friends in the forest but none of them wanted to be his friend.
The bear was sad, but then he saw a small bunny. The bear asked the bunny if it wanted to be his friend. The bunny said yes! 
The bear was so happy. He and the bunny hugged and played together every day. The bear finally had the perfect surprise - a very special friend.
