Once upon a time, there was a famous cricket named Jim. Jim loved to sing and dance, but he was very selfish. He never shared his food with his friends and always wanted to be the center of attention.
One day, Jim went to take a bath in the pond. He saw a little frog who was trying to get out of the water. Jim didn't help the frog and instead started to soak in the water, splashing around and having fun. 
Suddenly, a big bird came and caught Jim in its beak. Jim was scared and yelled for help. The little frog saw what was happening and jumped on the bird's back, making it lose its grip on Jim. Jim was saved by the little frog.
From that day on, Jim learned a valuable lesson. He realized that being kind and helpful to others is more important than being famous or selfish. He became a better cricket and a better friend to all the animals in the forest.
