One day, a squirrel was running around looking for acorns. He had been looking all morning and was getting upset. He was so upset that he stopped to sit down. Suddenly, he heard a noise. He looked around and saw a bird calling out. The bird was standing on a branch and holding a tiny device. The bird said that he was there to help the squirrel find an acorn.
The bird told the squirrel that he wanted to record him finding an acorn. The squirrel was excited. He looked around until he found one. He grabbed the acorn and put it into the bird's device. Then, the bird thanked the squirrel and flew away.
The squirrel was so proud of himself. He found an acorn all by himself. With the help of the bird, he was able to record it. He kept looking for more acorns until the sun started to go down. Then, he went back home and told his friends about his big adventure.
