Once upon a time there was a beautiful girl named Jane. Jane wore a pretty skirt every day - it was a bright yellow and very special. But one day Jane wanted to do something extra-ordinary, something no other girls would do!
So she decided to try and succeed. She worked very hard and practiced until she was tired.
The day of her big success came and Jane was so excited! She put on her pretty skirt and showed the world what she could do.
Jane succeeded! She was the best in her town and everyone cheered for her. It was an ordinary day, but it felt like something extra-ordinary had happened!
