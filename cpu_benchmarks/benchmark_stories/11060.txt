Tim and Tom are brothers. They like to play with their toys and eat snacks. But sometimes they fight over who gets what. One day, their mom makes meat for lunch. She puts two plates on the table, one for Tim and one for Tom.
"Here you go, boys. Eat your meat and veggies. They are good for you," mom says.
Tim and Tom run to the table. They both want the bigger piece of meat. They grab the same plate and pull.
"Let go! This is mine!" Tim shouts.
"No, it's mine! I saw it first!" Tom yells.
They tug and tug until the plate falls to the floor. The meat and veggies splatter everywhere. Mom hears the noise and comes back.
"What happened here?" mom asks. She is angry.
"Tim is selfish! He took my meat!" Tom says.
"No, Tom is selfish! He took my meat!" Tim says.
Mom shakes her head. She is disappointed.
"Boys, boys. You should share and be nice to each other. Meat is not the most important thing. Love is. Now you have no meat and no lunch. And you have to clean up this mess. I don't permit you to fight like this. Do you understand?" mom says.
Tim and Tom look at each other. They feel sorry. They nod.
"Yes, mom. We understand. We are sorry," they say.
They hug and say sorry to each other. They help mom clean up the floor. They eat some bread and cheese instead. They learn their lesson. They promise to be less selfish and more loving. Mom smiles and hugs them. She is proud.
