Sam was feeling bored one day. He wanted to watch a movie, but his mom said it was too late. He decided to find something else to do. He went outside and saw his friend Paul. Paul pulled out a kite and asked Sam if he wanted to play. Sam thought it looked fun and said yes.
Sam and Paul ran together to find a good spot to fly the kite. As they were running, they heard a noise coming from behind them. It was their neighbor Mrs. Smith. She was deaf and was shouting for help. Sam and Paul stopped and turned around. Mrs. Smith showed them a piece of paper with the word "pull" written on it.
Sam and Paul both figured out what Mrs. Smith wanted them to do. They ran over to her lawn chair and pulled it for her. Mrs. Smith was so happy and thanked them both. She told them that it was very kind of them to help someone in need.
The moral of the story is to always be kind and helpful to others, even if you don't know them. It might be a small gesture like helping someone pull a lawn chair, but it could mean the world to someone in need.
