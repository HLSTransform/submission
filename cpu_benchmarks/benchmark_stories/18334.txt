Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cute hat that she loved to wear everywhere she went. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. While she was playing, a gust of wind came and blew her hat away. Lily was very sad and started to cry.
Her friend Emma saw what happened and asked, "What's wrong, Lily?"
"My hat is gone," Lily said sadly.
"Don't worry, we'll help you find it," Emma said. They looked all around the park, but they couldn't find the hat. Lily was about to give up when she saw a man walking towards them holding her hat.
"Is this your hat?" the man asked.
"Yes, it is! Thank you so much!" Lily said happily. She was so grateful that her hat had been returned to her. From that day on, Lily never went anywhere without her cute hat.
