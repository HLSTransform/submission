Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat yogurt with a teaspoon. One day, she went to the kitchen to get a spoon, but she couldn't find one. Her mom was washing dishes and saw her looking. She asked, "Do you need a spoon, Lily?" Lily nodded her head and her mom gave her a teaspoon.
Lily was very happy and said, "Thank you, Mommy!" Her mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, Lily. You are always so polite." Lily ate her yogurt with the teaspoon and it tasted so good. She finished it all up and went to play with her toys. The end.
