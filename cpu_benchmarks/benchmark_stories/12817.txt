John was a strong boy who liked to go to the library. He liked to read books and find new stories about knights and dragons. One day, John noticed no one was in the library. He asked why and a librarian said, "We had to quit".
John was confused and asked the librarian, "What does to quit mean?". The librarian smiled and said, "It means to stop."
John was sad the library was now closed, but he was strong. He said goodbye to the librarian, feeling strong and determined to find a new adventure. He set off to look for stories and adventures outside the library.
