Once upon a time, there was a big, scary monster. He lived in a cave by the sea. One day, he found an oyster and he was very happy. He opened the oyster and inside was a shiny pearl. The monster was so happy that he forgot to be scary.
One day, an elderly woman came to the cave. She was looking for shells on the beach. The monster saw her and tried to scare her, but the woman wasn't scared. She saw the pearl and asked the monster if she could have it. The monster gave her the pearl and she was very happy.
From that day on, the monster wasn't scary anymore. He would share his oysters with the people who came to the beach. And the elderly woman would visit him often, bringing him cookies and telling him stories. They became good friends and lived happily ever after.
