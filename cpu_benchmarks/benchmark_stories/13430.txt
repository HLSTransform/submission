Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color pictures of rainbows. One day, she went to the store with her mommy to buy some new crayons. 
Lily saw a big box of crayons that she really wanted, but they were too expensive. "Mommy, can we get these crayons?" she asked. "No, sweetie, they are too cheap," her mommy replied.
Suddenly, it started to rain outside. Lily and her mommy ran to their car, but they saw a homeless man sitting in the rain with no umbrella. "Mommy, we have to help him!" Lily said. So they gave the man their umbrella to support him from the rain.
When they got home, they saw that their house had flooded from the rain. They had no umbrella to cover their house. "Oh no! Our house is ruined!" Lily cried. It was a bad ending for them, but they still felt good for helping the homeless man.
