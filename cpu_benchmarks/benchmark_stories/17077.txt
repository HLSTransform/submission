Once upon a time, there was a mule named Max. Max lived on a farm with his friend, a boy named Ben. They liked to play hide and seek. Max was very good at hiding because he could find hidden spots.
One day, Ben's mom needed to send a letter to grandma. She asked Ben to take the letter to the mailbox. Ben thought it would be fun to ride Max to the mailbox. So, Ben put the letter in his pocket and climbed onto Max's back. They started to walk to the mailbox.
On the way, Max saw a big bush. He thought it was a good hidden spot to play hide and seek. Max ran to the bush and hid behind it. Ben laughed and said, "Max, we need to send the letter first, then we can play." Max came out of the bush and they continued to the mailbox. Ben put the letter inside and they both went back to the farm to play their favorite game.
