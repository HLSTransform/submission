Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the big green yard. One day, she found a bush with pretty flowers. She thought it was so nice, she wanted to own it. 
Lily asked her mom if she could have the bush, but her mom said no. The next day, Lily went back to the bush and sang a loud song to it. She hoped the bush would like her and she could own it. 
As she was singing, a butterfly flew out of the bush and landed on her nose. Lily giggled and thought it was the best thing ever. She realized she didn't need to own the bush to enjoy it. She could just visit it and sing to it whenever she wanted. And that made her very happy. The end.
