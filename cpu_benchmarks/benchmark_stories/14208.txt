Once upon a time there was a kind little girl named Lily. She wanted to help animals in the sea, so she swam out to find them. She saw a big shark swimming and she said, "Hi! Can I help you?".
The shark was scared and quickly turned around. She said to Lily, "No, I'm scared you will hurt me." Lily said, "I won't hurt you. I only want to help you". 
The shark said, "Thank you for offering to help, but I'm too scared. I can only trust my own kind. You should go find someone else that needs your help".
Lily swam back but she was sad. She had hoped the shark would want her help. She realized that sometimes it's hard to trust someone that is not like us, even if they are kind. So she decided to use her kindness to help others find friendship and trust too.
