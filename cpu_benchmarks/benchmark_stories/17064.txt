One day, a little frog named Tim was very impatient. He wanted to jump high and far like his big brother, Sam. Tim saw a shiny zipper on a bag by the pond. He thought it was a magic zipper that could help him jump.
Tim hopped on the bag and pulled the zipper with his mouth. The bag opened, and a small trampoline fell out. Tim was so happy! He thought the magic zipper gave him a gift. He put the trampoline on the ground and got ready to jump.
Tim jumped on the trampoline and went up, up, up! He was so excited that he jumped again and again. Tim was not impatient anymore. He knew that he could jump high and far just like his big brother. And it was all thanks to the magic zipper.
