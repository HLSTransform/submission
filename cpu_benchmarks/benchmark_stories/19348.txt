Once upon a time there was a small family. Mommy, Daddy, and Baby. One day, the family had an emergency. Mommy and Daddy got their special things and left the house in a hurry. Baby didn't know where they went.
All night, Baby waited and asked everyone he saw if they knew where Mommy and Daddy had gone. Everyone said no, and Baby felt very alone.
When the sun came up, Baby saw something different outside. It was a big truck with big lights! With a happy heart, Baby went to ask the truck people if they knew where Mommy and Daddy had gone.
The truck people smiled and said, “Yes! We saw your Mommy and Daddy. They told us to take you to them!”.
Baby hopped in the truck and soon he was back with Mommy and Daddy! He was so happy! Emergency solved!
