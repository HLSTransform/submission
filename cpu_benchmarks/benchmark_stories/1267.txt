Sam was a lazy bear. He never wanted to help his mom around the house. One day, his mom asked him to pack a bag. Sam was confused. What was that? Then his mom showed him. She took a big box and put some soap and clothes inside. 
Sam was happy. Now he knew what to do. He took some towels and stuffed them into the bag. He even added the soap. He was careful to make sure everything fit. 
When he was done, he showed his mom. She smiled and thanked him for all of his hard work. Sam was so proud that he had packed the bag. From then on, he always helped his mom with chores around the house. He wasn't so lazy anymore!
