Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a unique teddy bear that she loved very much. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her teddy bear. She left her teddy bear on the bench and went to play on the swings. When she came back, her teddy bear was gone!
Lily started to cry and went to her mom to tell her the news. "Mommy, my teddy bear is gone! I miss him so much," said Lily. Her mom hugged her and said, "Don't worry, we'll find him."
They looked everywhere in the park but couldn't find the teddy bear. Just when they were about to give up, they saw a little boy playing with the teddy bear. Lily ran over and said, "That's my teddy bear! I missed him so much!"
The little boy said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know it was yours. Here you go." Lily hugged her teddy bear tightly and said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
