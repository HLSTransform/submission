Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a jolly smile and loved to play with her toys. One day, Lily was playing with her dolls when she saw herself in the mirror. She demanded her dolls to come and see her reflection too. 
Lily's dolls were happy to see themselves in the mirror, but then they noticed something strange. The mirror was broken and had a big crack in it. Lily demanded her mom to come and fix the mirror. 
Her mom came and saw the broken mirror. She told Lily not to worry and that she would fix it. Lily was happy to hear that and went back to playing with her dolls. From that day on, Lily made sure to be careful around the mirror so it wouldn't break again.
