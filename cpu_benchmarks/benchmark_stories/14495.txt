Once there was a little boy called Tom. Tom was 3 and he was starting school for the first time. As Tom walked into the classroom, he gazed around in wonder. All the desks and chairs looked big and new.
Tom saw some other children in the classroom. They all seemed very friendly. Tom was about to go and say hello when he saw one of them take out a big box of chocolates. The boy was being very selfish and wouldn't share them with the other children.
Tom was very sad to see this happen. So he decided to do something. Instead of taking some chocolates, he asked everyone to come and sit in a circle. Then, he shared out all the chocolates between everyone and nobody felt left out.
Tom smiled. It felt good to do something kind. Everyone was happy and they were all friends by the end of the day. Tom enjoyed his first day of school and he knew that everyone else had a great time too.
