Once upon a time there was a girl called Lily. She was very curious and loved exploring. One day, Lily decided to visit the market. She looked around excitedly, taking in all the sights and sounds. 
As she was walking, she noticed something special. There was an original pattern on one of the walls. The colours and shapes were so beautiful that Lily wanted to take a closer look. She went up to touch the pattern. 
Suddenly, the storekeeper stepped forward. He said Lily couldn't touch the pattern as it was valuable. Lily was disappointed and started to cry. 
The storekeeper felt sorry for Lily and noticed how eager she was to touch the pattern. He kindly asked her if she would like to visit the market again one day and take a closer look at the pattern.
Lily was overjoyed! She thanked the storekeeper and promised that she would come back to visit the market again soon. 
The storekeeper smiled, and Lily continued to explore the market feeling very happy.
