Once upon a time, there was a hungry bunny named Bubbles. Bubbles was very hungry and wanted to eat some carrots. But Bubbles didn't know how to find the carrots. So, Bubbles went to the gate of the garden to see if there were any carrots inside.
Bubbles tried to jump over the gate, but it was too high. Bubbles needed to measure how high the gate was so he could find a way to get inside. Bubbles found a stick and used it to measure the height of the gate. The gate was very high!
Bubbles thought and thought, and then he had an idea. He found a big rock and put it next to the gate. Bubbles climbed up the rock and jumped over the gate. Finally, Bubbles found the carrots and ate them all up. Bubbles was very happy and no longer hungry. The end.
