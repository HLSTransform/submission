Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite cap that she wore all the time. One day, she lost her cap while playing outside. She looked everywhere but couldn't find it. She felt sad and lonely without her cap.
Lily's friend, Timmy, saw her looking for her cap and asked her what was wrong. Lily told him she lost her cap and couldn't find it. Timmy said, "Don't worry, I'll help you find it." They searched together and finally found the cap under a bush.
Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you, Timmy! You're the best friend ever!" Timmy smiled and said, "No problem, Lily. I'm glad I could help." From that day on, Lily never felt lonely with her favorite cap on her head.
