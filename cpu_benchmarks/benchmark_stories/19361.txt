Sara was a very sleepy girl. She was so sleepy that she had to take a nap. She found a comfortable spot and curled up for a nap.
Sara's mom made her a nice cup of tea when she woke up. Sara loved the sweet tea and felt much better.
Sara felt energized after her nap and her cup of tea. She was so happy and excited she could barely contain herself!
Sara wanted to show her mom just how energized she was feeling. She decided to run around in circles around her mom and laugh.
Sara and her mom had a lot of fun together. After playing for a while, Sara was starting to feel tired again. She was happy though, because she knew she'd get to have another cup of tea just before bed.
