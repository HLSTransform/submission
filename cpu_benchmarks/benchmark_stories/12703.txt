Jane was playing in the garden when something shiny caught her eye. She bent down and carefully picked up a pair of sunglasses. They were beautiful! She put them on and set off exploring.
Jane looked up and noticed a large tree. She was curious and decided to climb up. As she climbed higher she heard a noise below her. She stopped what she was doing and looked down. There was a big bird sitting on the ground.
'Hello,' said Jane. 'What are you doing?'
The bird turned and looked at her. 'I'm sad. I'm looking for my baby.'
'Your baby?' said Jane.
The bird nodded sadly. 'He got scared by something and flew away. I can't find him.'
Jane thought for a moment. 'Maybe I can help you!' She carefully climbed down and set off looking for the bird's baby.
After a while, she found it. It was lying on the ground, dead. Jane carefully picked it up and brought it back to the bird.
The bird was very grateful and thanked Jane with a gentle peck on her head. Jane smiled and put her sunglasses back on. It had been a good day.
