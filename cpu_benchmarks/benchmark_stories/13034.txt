Once upon a time, there was a boy named Bob. Bob loved sweets and he was always looking for something sweet to eat. One day he went to the park and he saw a big envelope on the ground. He went to pick up the envelope. When he opened it, he heard a sweet sound. Inside the envelope, he found lots of candy. He was so happy! He ate the candy and then he ran home with a big smile on his face. He thanked the envelope for bringing him sweet treats!
