Anna loves to hear stories from her mom. Every night, mom tells her a beautiful story about animals, princesses, or stars. Anna listens with her eyes wide and her mouth open. She likes to ask questions and imagine the story in her head.
One night, mom is very tired. She has a lot of work to do and she is not feeling well. She tells Anna that she can only tell her a short story tonight. Anna is sad, but she understands. She hugs mom and says, "I love you, mom. You are the best."
Mom smiles and kisses Anna. She starts to tell her a story about a little bird who wants to fly high in the sky. But the bird is too small and weak. He struggles to flap his wings and catch the wind. He falls down many times and hurts himself. Anna feels sorry for the bird. She wants to help him.
"Mom, what happens to the bird?" Anna asks. "Does he ever fly high?"
Mom pauses. She is too tired to finish the story. She yawns and says, "I don't know, Anna. Maybe you can make up the rest of the story. You have a big imagination. You can make the bird happy."
Anna thinks for a moment. She likes to make up stories. She says, "Okay, mom. I will try. Maybe the bird meets a friend who teaches him how to fly. Maybe the friend is a butterfly who has beautiful wings. Maybe they fly together and see the rainbow and the clouds. Maybe the bird is happy and thanks the butterfly for being his friend."
Mom nods and smiles. She says, "That's a wonderful story, Anna. You are very clever and kind. I like your story. Now, it's time to sleep. Good night, sweetie."
Anna hugs mom and says, "Good night, mom. I love you. Thank you for your story."
They both close their eyes and fall asleep. They dream of flying high in the sky.
