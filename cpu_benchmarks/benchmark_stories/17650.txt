Once upon a time there was an incredible boy who lived in a happy town.
One day, he got married to a charming girl who he loved very much. She had long, shiny hair and a big smile. Everyone was very excited and they had a big party to celebrate! 
At the wedding, the boy and girl wore pretty strips of white cloth. They looked so nice together and all the guests clapped and cheered.
The couple went on an amazing honeymoon and had lots of fun. Every day they would do something incredible and make incredible memories. They were very happy and their love made their lives even better.
Soon, the happy couple returned to their home town and continued to be incredible together. They were married for many years and stayed in love for all that time.
