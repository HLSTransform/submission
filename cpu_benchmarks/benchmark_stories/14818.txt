Lily and Ben went to the park with Mom. They saw a big fountain with water that went up and down. Lily and Ben liked the fountain. They wanted to play in the water.
Mom said, "No, you cannot play in the fountain. The water is not clean. It has dirt and germs. You will get sick."
Lily and Ben were sad. They complained to Mom. They said, "But we want to play in the fountain. It looks fun. It is hot today. We are thirsty."
Mom said, "I have a better idea. Let's go to the ice cream truck. You can have a cold treat. Then we can find a clean fountain to drink from. How does that sound?"
Lily and Ben smiled. They liked ice cream. They said, "OK, Mom. That sounds good. Thank you."
They went to the ice cream truck and got their favorite flavors. Then they found a clean fountain to drink from. They were happy and refreshed. They thanked Mom for the ice cream and the water. They had a good day at the park.
