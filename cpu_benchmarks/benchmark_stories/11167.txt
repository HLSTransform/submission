Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a friendly dog named Max. They loved to play together in the park every evening. Lily knew that Max loved to chase after the ball and he always knew when she was going to throw it. 
One evening, Lily and Max went to the park and saw some new friends. They were very friendly and wanted to play with them. Lily was happy to have new friends and even Max was excited to meet them. They played together until it was time to go home. Lily knew that they would come back to play with their new friends again soon. 
As they walked home, Lily looked up at the sky and saw the stars shining bright. She asked Max if he knew how many stars there were. Max didn't know, but he knew that he loved playing with Lily and their new friends in the evening.
