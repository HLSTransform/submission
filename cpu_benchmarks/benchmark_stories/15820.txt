Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl named Lucy. She was always very proud. Her parents had taught her that she must protect the minerals under their home.
Every week, Lucy would go with her dad outside to check the minerals. She would wear her pink boots and her yellow hat with a proud smile on her face. Her dad would put his hat on too and grab a shovel. Together, the two would look out for any damage to the minerals.
One day, Lucy asked her dad, "What are we protecting, Daddy?"
Her dad smiled and said, "We are protecting the minerals under our home. They are very important and we need to make sure nobody hurts them."
Lucy nodded, understanding what her dad meant. She felt proud the minerals she loved were safe, and even prouder that she and her dad were the ones protecting them. Lucy was a brave and strong little girl, and she promised herself she would always protect the minerals.
