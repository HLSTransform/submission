Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to walk in the park with his dog, Max. One day, during a terrible season, the sky was dark and the wind was strong. Tim and Max still wanted to go for a walk.
As they walked, they met a big man. The man said, "You should not walk in this terrible season. It is not safe." But Tim did not listen. He wanted to keep walking with Max.
The wind got stronger and stronger. Tim and Max got scared. They tried to walk back home, but they could not find the way. They were lost in the terrible season, and they never found their way back home.
