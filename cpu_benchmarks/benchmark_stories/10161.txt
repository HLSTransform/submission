Once upon a time, there was a little piggy named Peppa. Peppa lived in a lively farm with many other animals. One day, Peppa saw a big, scary wolf running towards the barn. Peppa knew she had to do something to protect her friends.
Peppa ran as fast as she could to warn the other animals. They all quickly ran into the barn and locked the door. The wolf tried to get in, but he couldn't. Peppa felt proud of herself for being brave and helping her friends.
The moral of the story is that it's important to help others and be brave, even when we're scared.
