Once upon a time there was a prince called Jack. One day Jack was out walking in the woods when he noticed a delicate temple. He wanted to find out more about the temple, so he walked up the path towards it. As he got closer, he realized it was actualy a beautiful old temple. He pushed open the big doors and the bright sun light filled the temple. Inside he noticed a lady.
He approached her and said "Hello, I saw the temple and was curious. What can you tell me about it?" 
The lady replied "It's a very special place. People used to come here to pray and offer sacrifices. It's been here for a very long time and it is still very delicate."
Jack thanked the lady and continued to explore the temple. He felt it was a very special place. As he left he felt lucky to have seen such a delicate temple.
