John dropped his toy train on the ground while he was playing. He wanted to get it back, but it had landed in a small hole in the ground. It was so small that he couldn't fit his hand in. His mom told him it was an underground. She said it was too expensive to get back.
John was very sad and started to cry. He wanted to find a way to get his toy back. Then, he had an idea. He asked for a large bucket from the kitchen and took it outside. He put the bucket over the underground and started to fill it up with water from the garden hose.
Little by little, the water began to fill up the underground and the toy train started to float. John was so happy and grabbed it before it could drop again.
His mom was proud of John for his clever thinking and said that sometimes being expensive is not the best way to solve a problem.
