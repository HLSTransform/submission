Once upon a time there was an old man who loved to go for walks. One day, he was out walking when he zipped past a playground. He noticed a little girl on the swing, who was feeling sad.
The old man stopped and asked the little girl what was wrong. The little girl told him that her mom was busy and she was all alone.
The old man felt sorry for her so he gave her a big hug. The little girl gave him a big hug too. Then, the old man told the little girl to zip around the playground, so she did!
The old man watched her, with a big smile on his face. She felt much better after their hug and the old man was happy to have made her day a little bit brighter.
