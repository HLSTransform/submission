Once there was a purple castle. It was a very happy place. Everyone who lived there was always happy.
One day, things started to change. The castle began to look different. The walls were no longer purple, but blue.
The people inside the castle started to feel sad. They missed their purple walls. 
But then something magical happened. A big, beautiful purple dragon flew into the castle. He said he wanted to help.
The dragon waved his big wings and the castle walls changed back to purple. Everyone inside was so happy.
The dragon said goodbye, flew away and the castle stayed the same happy, purple place.
