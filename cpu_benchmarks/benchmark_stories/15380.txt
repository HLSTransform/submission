Once there was a little boy called Max. He was three years old and loved to explore. One day, Max decided to go for a walk in the park with his mum. He was very alert, so he noticed a big spoon near the pond. Max decided to increase his adventure, so he decided to pick up the spoon. Suddenly, he heard a voice behind him. It was a fairy! She smiled and said, "You found my spoon! I have been looking for it everywhere". She then thanked him with a magic kiss. From that moment on, Max could increase his adventures even further!
