Lila and Ben are twins. They like to draw with pastels. Pastels are soft and colorful. They make pretty pictures on paper.
One day, Lila and Ben find a big box of pastels in the closet. They are very happy. They take the box to the living room and open it. There are many pastels inside. Some are new and some are old. Some are long and some are short. Some are bright and some are dull.
Lila and Ben start to draw on the floor. Lila draws a flower. She uses red, yellow and green pastels. Ben draws a car. He uses blue, black and white pastels. They have fun and make a lot of noise.
Mom comes to the living room. She sees the pastels and the drawings on the floor. She is not happy. She has a serious face. She says to Lila and Ben: "What are you doing? You are making a mess. You cannot draw on the floor. You have to use paper. And you have to put the pastels back in the box when you are done. Do you understand?"
Lila and Ben feel sorry. They nod their heads. They say to Mom: "We are sorry, Mom. We like to draw with pastels. They are pretty. But we will not draw on the floor again. We will use paper. And we will put the pastels back in the box. We promise."
Mom smiles. She says to Lila and Ben: "That's good. I'm glad you like to draw with pastels. They are pretty. But you have to be careful and tidy. Now, help me clean up the floor. And then you can draw some more on paper. OK?"
Lila and Ben smile. They say to Mom: "OK, Mom. Thank you, Mom. We love you, Mom." They hug Mom. They help her clean up the floor. And then they draw some more on paper. They are happy.
