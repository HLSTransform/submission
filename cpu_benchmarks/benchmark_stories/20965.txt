Once upon a time, there was a man who had a very special job. He was a repair man, and he liked to fix things that were broken! He was very good at his job, too. 
One day, the man was fixing something special - a big copper pipe. It was going to take a lot of work to make it look nice and tidy again. He decided to use some tools to help him repair it. 
First, he used a big hammer to straighten the pipe. He worked carefully and slowly, to make sure it was perfect again. He was so proud when he was finished! 
Then, the man used a very special cleaner. It made the copper shiny and sparkly. With a few gentle wipes, he had it looking very tidy. 
At the end of the day, the man was happy with his work. He had done a really good job. Thanks to him, the copper pipe was fixed and looked as good as new!
