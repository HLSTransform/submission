Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play with their mom's computer. They knew how to turn it on and off, and how to click on the pictures and games. One day, they found a new game that let them decorate the screen with different colors and shapes. They had fun making rainbows, stars, flowers and hearts.
But then, mom came home and saw what they had done. She was not happy. She said they had messed up her work and made her computer dirty. She asked them who did it. Lily and Ben looked at each other. They were scared and wanted to hide.
But then, Lily remembered what mom always told them. She said it was important to be honest and tell the truth, even when they did something wrong. She said mom would love them no matter what, but she would be sad if they lied. So Lily took a deep breath and said, "We did it, mom. We're sorry. We wanted to decorate the computer like a game."
Mom smiled and hugged Lily. She said she was proud of her for being honest, and that she forgave her and Ben. She said they could still play with the computer, but only with her permission and supervision. She said they could also decorate their own paper and crayons, and hang them on the wall. Lily and Ben nodded and said they understood. They said they loved mom and they were sorry again. Mom said she loved them too, and they all went to the kitchen for a snack.
