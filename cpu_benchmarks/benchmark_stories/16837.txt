Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to pick flowers in the garden. One day, she found a beautiful red rose and she felt very happy. She picked the rose and smelled it. It smelled so good! 
Later that day, Lily's mom made her favorite sandwich for lunch. Lily felt grateful and said "thank you" to her mom. She ate her sandwich and felt very full. 
At bedtime, Lily snuggled up in her cozy bed and felt very sleepy. She closed her eyes and thought about the fun day she had. She felt happy and grateful for all the good things in her life.
