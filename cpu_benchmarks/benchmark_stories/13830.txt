Anna and Ben were playing with their toy cars on the grass. They liked to make noises and pretend they were racing. Anna had a red car and Ben had a blue car.
"Look, my car is faster than yours!" Anna said.
"No, mine is faster!" Ben said.
They both wanted to win, so they ignored each other and kept driving their cars. They did not see the cliff that was near the edge of the grass. It was very high and steep.
Anna's car went too fast and fell off the cliff. She heard a loud crash and saw her car break into pieces. She was very sad and scared.
"Anna, are you okay?" Ben asked. He stopped his car and ran to the cliff. He saw Anna crying and holding her car.
"I'm sorry, Anna. I'm sorry I ignored you. I didn't mean to make you sad. Are you hurt?" Ben said.
Anna shook her head. She was not hurt, but she was sorry too. She was sorry she ignored Ben. She didn't mean to make him angry.
"I'm sorry, Ben. I'm sorry I ignored you. I didn't mean to make you angry. Can we be friends again?" Anna said.
Ben nodded. He was happy that Anna was okay. He was happy that they were friends again.
"Of course we can be friends again. I'm sorry about your car. Do you want to share mine?" Ben said.
Anna smiled. She was glad that Ben was nice. She was glad that they could share.
"Thank you, Ben. That's very kind of you. Can we play together?" Anna said.
Ben smiled too. He was glad that Anna was happy. He was glad that they could play together.
"Yes, let's play together. But let's stay away from the cliff. It's too dangerous." Ben said.
Anna agreed. They picked up Ben's car and went back to the grass. They played with their car and talked to each other. They did not ignore each other anymore. They were sorry for what they did. They were good friends.
