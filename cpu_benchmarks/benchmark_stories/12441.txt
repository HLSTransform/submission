Ben is a farmer. He has a big farm with many animals. He likes to feed the cows, the pigs, the sheep and the chickens. He also likes to grow corn, carrots, apples and pumpkins.
One day, Ben has to go to the town. He has to sell some of his food and buy some things for his farm. He takes his truck and drives on the road. He is happy to go to the town.
But on the way, he sees a big problem. There is a lot of water on the road. It rained a lot last night and the road is flooded. Ben cannot drive his truck through the water. He has to stop and wait. He is sad and worried. He does not want to delay his trip to the town.
Then he sees a big boat. It is a famous boat. It is the boat of the mayor. The mayor is the boss of the town. He is very nice and helps people. He sees Ben and his truck. He waves to him and says hello.
"Hello, Ben! I see you have a problem. Do you need some help?" the mayor says.
"Yes, please. I have to go to the town, but the road is flooded. Can you take me and my food on your boat?" Ben says.
"Of course, I can. Come on board, Ben. I have some space for you and your food. I am also going to the town. We can go together." the mayor says.
Ben is very happy. He thanks the mayor and puts his food on the boat. He gets on the boat and sits next to the mayor. The boat starts to move on the water. Ben sees the animals and the plants on his farm. He waves to them and says goodbye.
He is not sad and worried anymore. He is excited and grateful. He does not mind the delay. He is happy to go to the town with the mayor on his famous boat.
