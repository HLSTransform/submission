Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore and learn new things. One day, she went to visit her grandma who gave her a new backpack with a shiny zip. Lily was so excited to use it!
As she walked through the park, she met a nosy squirrel who wanted to see what was inside her backpack. Lily showed the squirrel all the things she had learned about, like different types of flowers and bugs. The squirrel was amazed and thanked Lily for sharing her knowledge.
From that day on, Lily always carried her backpack with the shiny zip wherever she went. She loved to learn new things and share them with her friends, even if they were nosy like the squirrel.
