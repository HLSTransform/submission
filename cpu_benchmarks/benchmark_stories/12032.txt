Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy's dad gave him a hammer to play with. Timmy thought it was a cool toy and started to play with it. 
But then, Timmy saw a nail on the ground. It was difficult for him to pick it up, but he managed to do it. He then tried to hammer the nail with the toy hammer, but it didn't work. Timmy blinked and tried again, but it still didn't work. 
Timmy's dad saw him struggling and offered to help. He showed Timmy how to use the hammer properly and they worked together to hammer the nail into the wall. From that day on, Timmy loved using the hammer and would always blink whenever he saw a nail that needed hammering.
