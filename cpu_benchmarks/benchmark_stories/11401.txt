Once there was a nice sack. It was sitting in the middle of the street. A big yellow truck drove by and blew the sack away. The sack went all the way across the street. It went around the corner and over the hill.
The sack stopped in a nice field. There was a big apple tree and some tall grass. The sack was so happy. It looked around and saw some butterflies flying in the sky. It was a beautiful sight.
The sack wanted to stay forever. But after a while, the sun went down and it was getting dark. So the sack slowly started to make its way back down the street. It reached the same spot it started in and settled down for the night. 
The next morning, the sun was shining. The sack had a nice nightâ€™s sleep. Now it was ready to explore the street again.
