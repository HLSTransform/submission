Molly was excited! She was going to the park for the first time and couldn't wait to explore. Her mommy said it didn't have any slides, but Molly was sure there were still lots to do.
They arrived to the park, but there was not much there. Everything was empty and dull. "Where are the swings?" Molly asked her mom. 
"Oh, wait a minute," said her mom, "we haven't seen the surprise yet." Mom led her to the far side of the park, and Molly saw it: a big playground! It had swings, slides, and monkey bars in a special style. 
Molly clapped and laughed, surprised by how fun the park was.
