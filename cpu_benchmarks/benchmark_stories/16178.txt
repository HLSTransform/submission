Mommy was so excited to go to the store. She was looking for a bookshelf to put in her room.
"What kind of bookshelf do you want, Mommy?" asked Emily, Mommy's 3-year-old daughter.
"I'm looking for a cool bookshelf," said Mommy.
They walked into the store and Mommy saw the perfect bookshelf. It was white and tall with lots of shelves.
"This one is perfect," said Mommy. "Let's buy it."
The store clerk came over and said, "That will be $75. Would you like to pay with cash or a card?"
Mommy handed the clerk her card and the clerk said, "Thank you so much! We sold the bookshelf to you."
When they got home, Mommy put the bookshelf in her room. Emily was so excited about the cool bookshelf. She couldn't wait to put all her books on it.
