Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo lived in the ocean with his family and friends. One day, Nemo saw a big house on the shore. He wanted to go and see it, so he swam towards it.
When Nemo got to the house, he saw that it was very big and fancy. He thought to himself, "I wish I could live in a house like this." But then he remembered that his little humble home in the ocean was just as special because it was filled with love and happiness.
Nemo learned that it's not important to have a big fancy house, but to have a humble home filled with love. From that day on, Nemo was happy with his little home in the ocean and he swam around with his family and friends, feeling grateful for what he had.
