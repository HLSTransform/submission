Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a unique talking corn. The corn could speak to all the animals and people. Everyone loved the corn, and they liked to listen to its stories.
One day, a little boy named Tom came to the corn. He said, "Hello, corn! Can you speak to me?" The corn smiled and said, "Yes, Tom! I can speak to you, and I have a fun story to tell." Tom sat down, and the corn began to tell a story about a big, friendly bear.
In the story, the bear lived in a forest with many friends. The bear would dance and play with the other animals all day. Everyone in the forest loved the bear, just like how the village loved the talking corn. Tom listened to the story and laughed with joy.
When the story was over, Tom thanked the corn for the fun story. He went back to his home and told his mom about the unique talking corn. From that day on, Tom and the corn became good friends, and they shared many more stories with each other.
