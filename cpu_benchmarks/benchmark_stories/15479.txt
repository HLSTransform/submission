Once there was a monkey named Bob. Bob lived in a very tall tree. Every day he climbed up to the top and looked out at the world with a special map. This map showed all the places Bob wanted to explore.
But one day Bob got very tired. He decided to rest in his tree and not go anywhere. He put the map down next to him and snuggled into a nest of leaves. Then he closed his eyes and fell asleep.
Suddenly Bob woke up! The map was gone! It was very scary! Where had the map gone?
But then Bob heard a noise. He looked up and saw that a bird had found the original map! She was trying to make it her nest! Bob was so relieved! He quickly thanked the bird and took the map back.
Bob rested again in his tree, happy that he had his original map back. He knew now that he would be able to explore the world and find new and exciting places.
