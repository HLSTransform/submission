One day, a mommy and her little girl went to the mall. The mommy had something important to do. But the little girl was very stubborn and wanted to go to the toy store. She begged and begged, so the mommy put her in charge of the shopping cart and said she could go do what she wanted.
The little girl was so excited, she ran straight to the toy store. But once she was inside, the mommy gave her a lecture. The mommy said she needed to be careful and not buy anything without asking. The mommy also said if the little girl was still stubborn, she had to put the cart back at the front of the store before she left.
The little girl was sad to have to put the cart back. But she was also very excited to go into the toy store. So she listened to her mommy's lecture and put the shopping cart back up front. Then she ran inside the toy store and had lots of fun.
