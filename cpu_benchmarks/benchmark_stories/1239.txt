Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved to explore. One day she decided to go on a big adventure. She went down to the park to find something special.
At first, she couldn't see anything but then suddenly she discovered music coming from a big tree near the swings. She decided to go and have a look. 
When she got closer she found a rhythm! It was very playful and it made her feel so happy. She started clapping and dancing to it.
 
Soon the little girl was surrounded by the music and the rhythm. It was like it was a part of her. She had never been so happy before. 
The little girl spent the whole afternoon playing and exploring her new rhythm. When it was time to go home, the little girl said goodbye to her new rhythm and continued on her adventure.
