Once upon a time, there was a little sunflower. It was a happy flower, but it was always stuck in one place. It wanted to sail away and explore the world. 
One day, a strong wind came by and blew the sunflower's seeds far away. The little sunflower was scared at first, but then it realized it was free to go wherever it wanted. It felt independent and brave. 
As it sailed away, it met many different flowers and creatures. Some were kind, and some were mean. The little sunflower learned that it was important to be kind to others, even if they were different. 
Finally, the little sunflower found a new place to call home. It was happy and free, and it knew that it had learned an important lesson. It was okay to sail away and explore, but it was even more important to be kind and independent.
