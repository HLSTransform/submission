Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with her crayons. One day, she was coloring a picture of a flower, but her red crayon disappeared! She looked everywhere for it, under her bed and in her toy box, but it was nowhere to be found. 
Lily was sad because she couldn't finish her picture without her red crayon. But then, her mom came in and gave her a new red crayon. Lily was so glad and started coloring again. 
As she colored, she noticed that her green crayon had disappeared too! But this time, she wasn't sad because she knew her mom would give her a new one. And so, Lily continued to color and have fun with her crayons. The end.
