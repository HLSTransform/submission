Once upon a time there was a small girl called Annabel. She was three years old, and loved to learn new things. Every day Annabel would study something new.
One day Annabel saw a big switch on the wall of her bedroom. It looked very smooth, and Annabel wanted to know what would happen if she pressed it. She asked her mum if she could press it and her mum said, "Yes, go ahead".
So Annabel pressed the switch and suddenly the room filled with bright light. Annabel was so happy and giggled with joy. She had learned something new that day - she had discovered the power of the switch!
From then on Annabel continued to study new things and to make exciting discoveries.
