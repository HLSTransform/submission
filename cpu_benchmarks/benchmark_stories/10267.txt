Once upon a time, there was a baby named Billy. Billy was very small and liked to play with toys. One day, Billy's big sister was being bossy and wouldn't let him play with his favorite toy. So, Billy decided to whistle to get his mom's attention. 
When his mom came, she saw that Billy was sad. She talked to his sister and told her to share her toys with Billy. Billy was happy again and started playing with his toys. He even tried to whistle again, but it didn't work very well because he was still learning. 
From that day on, Billy's sister wasn't bossy anymore and they played together happily. Billy learned how to whistle better and even taught his sister how to do it too. They had fun whistling together and playing with their toys. The end.
