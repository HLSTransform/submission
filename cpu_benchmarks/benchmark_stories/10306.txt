Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a cube. The cube is rough and big. They can roll it and throw it.
One day, they see a dog in the park. The dog is brown and furry. It looks friendly. Lily and Ben want to pet the dog. They jog to the dog with the cube.
But the dog does not like the cube. The dog thinks the cube is a toy. The dog wants to play with the cube. The dog barks and jumps. It grabs the cube with its teeth.
"Hey, that's our cube!" Lily says. She tries to pull the cube from the dog.
"No, it's mine!" the dog says. It growls and shakes the cube.
Ben is scared. He does not want to fight with the dog. He wants to run away. He says to Lily, "Let's go, Lily. The dog can have the cube. We can find another one."
But Lily is angry. She likes the cube. She does not want to give it to the dog. She says to Ben, "No, Ben. The cube is ours. We have to get it back."
Lily and Ben tug on the cube. The dog tugs on the cube. They make a lot of noise. They do not see the man who owns the dog.
The man hears the noise. He sees the children and the dog. He runs to them. He says, "Stop, stop! What are you doing?"
He takes the cube from the dog. He says to Lily and Ben, "I'm sorry, kids. This is my dog. He likes to play with things. He did not mean to take your cube."
He says to the dog, "Bad dog! You have to share. You have to be nice."
He gives the cube back to Lily and Ben. He says, "Here you go. This is your cube. You can play with it. But be careful. The cube is rough. It can hurt you or the dog."
Lily and Ben say, "Thank you, sir. We're sorry, too. We did not know the dog was yours. We just wanted to pet him."
They say to the dog, "We're sorry, dog. You can play with us. But you have to share. You have to be nice."
The dog wags its tail. It licks Lily and Ben. It says, "Woof, woof! I'm sorry, kids. I just wanted to play with you. I like the cube. But I can share. I can be nice."
Lily and Ben smile. They pet the dog. They say, "It's okay, dog. We like you. You can play with us. And you can play with the cube. But we have to share. We have to be nice."
They all play together in the park. They roll and throw the cube. They jog and run. They have fun. They are friends.
