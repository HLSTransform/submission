Once upon a time there was a boy with blue eyes and blonde hair. He was so excited that he couldn't stop bouncing. He wanted to go to the pond and splash in the warm sunshine.
So the boy ran over to the pond and giggle as he jumped in. The water was so cool and he had so much fun. He made big splashes that reached all the way up to the sky.
Soon, the boy was getting tired, but he couldn't stop. The sun was getting impatient and starting to set. He wanted to keep playing, but his mom said it was time to go home.
So the boy got out of the pond and waved goodbye. Then he ran home, looking forward to having more fun tomorrow.
