Once upon a time, there was a grape. It was purple and it was all alone. One day, it began to rain. The grape was so scared, he wished he had somewhere to hide.
Suddenly, he found a big shelter. It was a cave. He was so happy. He went in and enjoyed the warmth and safety of the cave.
He was still scared of the rain. But he felt better. Then suddenly he heard a loud noise. He looked outside and saw a big lion. The grape was so scared, he couldn't move.
The lion started to come closer. The grape wanted so badly to escape, but he was too scared. He shouted and yelled, but the lion kept coming closer.
The grape felt so helpless. Suddenly, the lion grabbed the grape with his big paws. He ate the grape and the grape was never seen again.
The rain stopped and the world was quiet. The purple grape had been eaten. The end.
