Once, there was a boy named Joe. He liked to go swimming in the river near his home. One day, Joe had a very special surprise. He looked into the water and saw the most amazing image! It was big and healthy and full of life. Joe wanted to get closer to the image. 
He swam closer and closer, but something was wrong. The image was scared and tried to swim away from Joe. Joe quickly realized that the image was actually a beautiful fish, and it was trying to escape from him. 
Joe felt bad and decided not to chase the fish any further. He decided to let the fish swim away in peace. Joe vowed to only admire the fish from a distance, so that it could stay safe and healthy.
