Once there was a little girl who lived in a big house. The house had a very big yard full of colorful flowers, but the little girl was very sad. She had no one to play with.
One day, an old woman passed the yard. The old woman saw the little girl and smiled. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a bright yellow ball. She told the little girl to take it and play with it in the yard.
The little girl smiled. She ran into the yard and started to play with the ball. Every time she passed the ball to herself, she felt a little bit happier.
The girl had lots of fun playing in the yard and soon enough, she had made a new friend: the old woman. The old woman came over often to visit and they played in the yard together. 
The little girl was no longer sad. She was happy and enjoyed her time playing in the yard with her new friend.
