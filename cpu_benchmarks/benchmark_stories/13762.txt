Lila and Tom are playing with paper. They like to fold the paper and make shapes. Lila makes a hat, and Tom makes a boat. They are happy and proud of their work.
But then, a big wind comes and blows their paper away. Lila and Tom are sad and angry. They run after their paper, but they cannot catch it. They start to cry and shout.
"Where is my hat?" Lila says. "Where is my boat?" Tom says.
A nice lady sees them and hears them. She has a big bag of paper. She comes to them and smiles.
"Hello, little ones. Why are you crying?" she says.
"The wind took our paper. We made a hat and a boat, but now they are gone," Lila says.
"That is too bad. But do not worry. I have more paper for you. You can make new shapes. Do you want some?" the lady says.
Lila and Tom look at the lady and her bag. They see many colors and sizes of paper. They feel happy and hopeful.
"Yes, please. Thank you, nice lady. You are very kind," Lila says.
"Thank you, nice lady. You are very good," Tom says.
The lady gives them some paper and helps them fold it. Lila and Tom make new shapes. They make a flower and a plane. They are happy and proud of their work.
They also learn to be grateful for what they have and to share with others. They give the lady a flower and a plane as a gift. The lady is happy and touched.
"You are very sweet, little ones. You made my day. I hope you enjoy your paper. Have fun and be careful of the wind," the lady says.
"Thank you, nice lady. You made our day. We will enjoy our paper. We will have fun and be careful of the wind," Lila and Tom say.
They hug the lady and wave goodbye. They play with their paper and smile. They are grateful for the lady and her paper. They are grateful for each other and their friendship. They are grateful for the wind and its lesson. They are grateful for the day and its beauty.
