Lily and Tom were playing in the garden. They saw a bird on a tree. The bird was red and blue and sang a pretty song.
"Look, a bird!" Lily said. "I want to touch it."
"No, Lily, you can't," Tom said. "The bird is scared of us. If you touch it, it will fly away."
But Lily did not listen. She ran to the tree and tried to grab the bird. The bird was fast and flew away. Lily was sad and angry.
"Bad bird!" she shouted. "Come back here!"
She threw a stone at the tree. The stone hit a branch and made a loud noise. The noise scared the other birds and they all flew away.
Suddenly, they heard their mom calling them.
"Lily! Tom! What are you doing?" mom asked. "Why are you making so much noise?"
Lily and Tom looked at mom. They knew they were in trouble.
"We were playing with the bird, mom," Tom said.
"But the bird flew away, mom," Lily said.
"And you threw a stone at the tree, Lily?" mom asked.
Lily nodded. She felt sorry.
"That was not nice, Lily," mom said. "You could have hurt the bird or the tree. You need to be gentle and quiet with nature. You are punished. You have to go to your room and think about what you did."
Lily started to cry. She did not want to go to her room. She wanted to play with the bird.
"Please, mom, I'm sorry," she said.
"Sorry is not enough, Lily," mom said. "You have to learn your lesson. Go to your room now."
Lily went to her room. She was very sad. She wished she had listened to Tom. She wished she had not thrown the stone. She wished the bird would come back and sing to her.
