Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved getting new things, especially new socks. One day, her mom took her to the store to get some new socks. Lily was so excited! She looked at all the colorful socks and picked out her favorite pair.
When they got home, Lily put on her new socks and showed them to her dad. "Look, Daddy! I got new socks!" she said with a big smile. "Wow, those are really nice socks. You are so lucky to receive them," her dad replied.
Later that day, Lily went to play outside with her friends. One of her friends noticed her new socks and said, "Hey Lily, those are really cool socks! Where did you get them?" Lily replied, "I got them from the store with my mom. I love receiving new things!"
