Once upon a time, there was a humble king who loved to turn around in his garden. One day, he met a little girl who was playing with her doll. The king asked her, "What's your name?"
"I'm Lily," the girl replied.
"What a beautiful name! Do you want to play with me?" the king asked.
"Yes, please!" Lily exclaimed.
The king and Lily played together and turned around in circles. The king felt happy to have a new friend. "Thank you for playing with me, Lily. You are a kind girl," the king said.
Lily smiled and replied, "Thank you, your majesty. I had fun playing with you too."
