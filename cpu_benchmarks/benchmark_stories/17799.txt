Once upon a time there was a poor girl who lived by herself. She had a small hut and a tiny freezer in her home. Every day, she would go out to the river to get fish which she would put in the freezer.
One day, the girl was in a bad mood. She wanted to throw something, so she grabbed the freezer and threw it onto the ground. The freezer broke and all the fish flew out.
The girl felt so bad for what she had done. She quickly scooped up all the fish and put them back into the freezer. But sadly, the freezer was now broken and she had no way to keep her fish fresh.
The girl was so upset. She had been so poor, and now she had nothing to eat. She went to bed with a broken heart, but she knew that one day, things would get better.
