Once upon a time, there was an old man named Mr. Brown. He loved to create things with his hands. One day, he decided to make a toy orange out of wood. He worked very hard and finally, he created a beautiful orange. It was so pretty that he decided to keep it on his shelf. Every day, he would look at the orange and smile. The end.
