Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her soft teddy bear. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a newspaper to read. Lily didn't know what to do with it, so she crumpled it up and threw it on the floor.
Lily's mommy saw what she did and told her that the newspaper was important. It had news about the world and things that were happening. Lily felt bad for crumpling it up and wanted to make it better. So, she searched for the newspaper and found it under her bed.
Lily learned that even though something may seem unimportant, it could be valuable to someone else. She promised to take care of the newspaper and read it every day. From that day on, Lily was more careful with her things and always searched for them when they went missing.
