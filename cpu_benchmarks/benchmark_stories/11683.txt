Once upon a time, there was a kind machine. It was like nothing else anyone had ever seen. It had buttons that lit up, and the people in the town all wanted to try it out.
But when they did, something funny happened. Every time someone pressed one of the buttons, the machine would bow! Everyone laughed and clapped as the machine bowed and bowed.
Soon, word of the bow-ing machine spread all over the land. Everyone wanted to see it and try it out. Even a little three year old girl heard about it. She had never seen a machine bow before, so she decided to go and see it.
When she arrived, the little girl was excited to see the kind machine bow. She watched it bow over and over again with delight. Eventually, the little girl grew tired and went back home, dreaming of the bow-ing machine all the way there.
