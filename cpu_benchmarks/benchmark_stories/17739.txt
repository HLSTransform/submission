Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a little girl named Ella. Ella and Mommy had a special day, it was time to celebrate! 
Mommy and Ella went to the kitchen, and Mommy gave Ella a tray. On the tray were all sorts of yummy treats! There were special cookies, a big cupcake, and a twisty-swirly pink lollipop. Ella was so happy, she wanted to eat all of it right away! 
Mommy said that they should do something special on todayâ€™s celebration and told Ella to put on her party dress. Ella put on her dress and it looked very normal, but inside she was so excited!
Mommy and Ella shared all the goodies on the tray. Ella especially loved the twisty-swirly lollipop and was so full she could hardly move after! 
Mommy and Ella had the best time celebrating together. They laughed and smiled and hugged each other to celebrate their special day.
