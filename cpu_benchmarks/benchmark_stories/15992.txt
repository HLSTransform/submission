Once upon a time, there was a lot of danger in the world. But there was a special palace where people felt safe.
Every day, many people would enter the palace to take shelter from the danger outside. It was always quiet inside the palace, and the big walls kept people safe.
One day, a little boy named Timmy wanted to explore the palace. He ran in and saw the high walls and big doors. He smiled to himself, knowing that he was safe.
Timmy walked around the palace, admiring the decorations and colourful flags. He was fascinated by all the things he had never seen before. 
After a while, Timmy felt tired. He lay down on the soft floor and fell asleep. He had a long day filled with adventure in the safe and peaceful palace.
