Once upon a time, there was a brave giraffe called Jojo who was eager to go on a search.
Jojo was feeling very proud, so she told her friends. “I’m going on a search. Who wants to join me?”
The other animals were scared, so they decided to stay put. But Jojo was determined, so she set off alone.
As she ventured deeper and deeper into the forest, she came across a big rock. Suddenly, a voice came from behind it.
It was a squirrel, and he had an important question for Jojo. “Do you want to discuss something?” he said.
Jojo thought for a moment, then replied, “Yes, I would like that.” So they began to discuss the best way to go on a search together.
Eventually, the pair decided to work as a team. They set off, exploring and searching all around the forest. Jojo felt so proud when they eventually found what they were looking for.
The pair became great friends, and Jojo knew she would always be proud of their search.
