Once there was a cute fox that could applaud with its fingers. It clapped its hands together and everyone was amazed.
The fox said to the people, "Can all of you applaud like me?". Everybody tried and some kept trying and soon everyone could applaud with their fingers like the fox.
Everyone was really impressed and wanted to tell the fox, so they all clapped for the fox. But the fox was a cheeky one and decided it wanted more attention.
So the fox clapped even faster and louder so that everyone had to clap even louder to be heard. The people were getting angry, but the fox kept clapping.
Suddenly, the fox tripped and sat down, the people stopped clapping and all the attention went away. It left the fox feeling embarrassed and sad. The people all laughed and the fox ran away!
