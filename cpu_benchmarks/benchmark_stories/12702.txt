One day, there was a spoiled little boy who wanted to go on an adventure. He asked his mother, "Can I go?" She replied, "No, I can't allow it."
The little boy began to cry and said, "Please mother, please?" His mother felt sorry for him and allowed him to go. He put on his coat and went on his adventure.
He met all kinds of animals. He saw a little orange kitty, a funny looking monkey, and a bunny with long ears. He was so excited! 
The little boy finally returned home after a long day of adventure and told his mother all of the fun things he had seen. She was so happy and hugged him. From that day on, she allowed him to explore all of the wonderful things in nature. 
The end.
