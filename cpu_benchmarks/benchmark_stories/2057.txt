Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy trains. He had a big train set in his room with lots of tracks and trains to play with.
One day, Timmy's mom made him some soup for lunch. She told him to wait until the steam stopped coming out of the bowl before he could eat it. Timmy didn't understand what she meant by "steam", but he saw the hot air coming out of the soup and knew that it was hot.
Timmy's dad came into the room and saw Timmy playing with his trains. He asked Timmy if he wanted to measure how long the train tracks were. Timmy didn't know what "measure" meant, but his dad showed him how to use a ruler to find out how long the tracks were.
Timmy had a fun day playing with his trains and eating his harmless soup. He learned some new words too, like "steam" and "measure".
