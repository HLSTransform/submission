Once there was a popular boy who everyone loved. He had a special talent for measuring things. One day he decided to use his measuring skills to find out how high the fire was. He wanted to see how far away from the fire he could get.
He started to measure it very carefully. Every time he took a step back the fire seemed to get bigger and bigger. It was almost like it was calling out to him. He felt like he had to get closer and closer. But he just kept measuring the fire.
The fire had grown bigger and bigger, until the popular boy was right in the middle of it! He screamed and cried. But it was too late. The fire had grown too large and he couldn't escape it.
The poor boy was never seen again. Everyone was so sad because of what happened to the popular boy. The only thing they could do was remember his brave spirit and his special talents. They will never forget him.
