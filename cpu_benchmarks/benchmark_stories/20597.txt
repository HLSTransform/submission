Once upon a time there was a bridge. It was big and dependable. It was there to help people get from one side of the river to the other.
One day, the bridge was in danger! It was being taken away by the river and it was in danger of disappearing forever.
The people wanted to save the bridge. They worked and worked together to make it strong and safe. They worked hard and together they saved the bridge. 
The bridge was now safe and dependable again. People could use it to get to the other side of the river. They all cheered, because the bridge was saved!
The end.
