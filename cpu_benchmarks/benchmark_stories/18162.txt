Once upon a time, in a little house, there lived a boy. The boy was deaf. He could not hear anything. He had a friend who was a ghost. The ghost was nice to the boy.
One day, the boy and the ghost went out to play. They were having fun. But then, the boy started to suffer. His leg hurt a lot. The ghost tried to help him, but he could not.
The boy was very sad. The ghost was sad too. They could not play anymore. The boy went back to the little house. He was still suffering. The ghost stayed with him, but they could not be happy. The end.
