Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and draw pictures with her crayons. One day, she went to the kitchen to get a cup of juice. She opened the cupboard and saw a green cup. 
Lily said, "Mommy, can I use this green cup?" 
Her mommy replied, "Sure, Lily. But can you please put it back in the cupboard when you're done?" 
Lily nodded and said, "Okay, mommy. I will put it back. Do you have to go to work today?" 
"Yes, I do," said her mommy. "But I will be back soon." 
Lily smiled and sipped her juice from the green cup. She played with her toys until her mommy came back from work. And she remembered to put the green cup back in the cupboard, just like her mommy asked. The end.
