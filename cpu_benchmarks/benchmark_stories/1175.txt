Once upon a time, there was a mint. The mint was round and green. It liked to roll down the hill. Every day, the mint would roll down the hill and have fun. The mint was very happy.
One day, a new mint came to the hill. This mint was red and also liked to roll. The green mint and the red mint started to roll together. They were very competitive. They wanted to see who could roll faster.
The green mint and the red mint rolled down the hill faster and faster. They were not careful. They both rolled into a big hole. They could not get out. The green mint and the red mint were stuck. They were not happy anymore.
