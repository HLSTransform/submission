Once there was a cool room with a funny number. In the room was a happy three year old called Jack. Jack loved to explore and play. He ran around the room, counting the funny numbers.
The numbers were everywhere. Some were big, some were small. Some were blue, some were yellow. It was very cool.
Jack loved playing games with the numbers. He tried to make them look like patterns and shapes. It was a lot of fun.
Jack would stay in the room for hours counting and arranging the numbers. Then he would sit down and relax in the cool room. He was very happy there. 
The end.
