Once upon a time, there lived a little girl called Jenny. Jenny was three years old, and very adventurous. One day, she decided to visit the ocean.
When Jenny arrived at the beach, she was very excited. She saw a big, tight shipwreck in the water, and wanted to have a closer look. Jenny asked her mom if she could visit the shipwreck, and her mom said yes.
Jenny carefully walked down to the beach and stepped into the water. The ocean felt so cool and wet. As she got closer to the shipwreck, she could see all sorts of things inside. It was so fascinating!
Jenny spent a whole hour visiting the wreck, and then it was time to go home. She said goodbye to the wreck and went back up the beach safely with her mom. Jenny had a really fun day visiting the tight shipwreck!
