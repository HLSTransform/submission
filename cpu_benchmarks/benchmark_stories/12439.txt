Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play catch with a ball. They also like to play with flags. They have red flags and blue flags. They make two teams. Tom is on the red team. Sam is on the blue team.
One day, they play catch and flag. They have to catch the ball and run to the other team's flag. If they touch the flag, they win. If the other team catches them, they lose. Tom and Sam run fast and throw the ball. They have fun.
But then, Tom sees a big dog. The dog is black and white. It has a collar. It looks friendly. Tom likes dogs. He wants to pet the dog. He drops the ball and runs to the dog. Sam sees Tom. He is angry. He shouts, "Tom, come back! We have to play catch and flag!"
But Tom does not hear Sam. He reaches the dog. He pets the dog. The dog licks Tom. Tom smiles. He says, "Hello, dog. You are nice. What is your name?" The dog has a tag. The tag says, "Spot". Tom says, "Your name is Spot. I like Spot."
Sam runs to Tom. He is still angry. He says, "Tom, you are not loyal. You left your team. You made us lose. You are a bad friend." Tom looks at Sam. He is sad. He says, "I'm sorry, Sam. I like you. You are my friend. But I also like Spot. He is a good dog. Can we be friends with Spot?"
Sam looks at Tom. He looks at Spot. He sees that Tom and Spot are happy. He feels sorry. He says, "I'm sorry, Tom. I was mean. You are not a bad friend. You are a good friend. And Spot is a good dog. Can we play catch and flag with Spot?"
Tom smiles. He says, "Yes, Sam. We can play with Spot. He can be on our team. He can catch the ball. He can run fast. He can be loyal. He can be our friend." Sam smiles. He says, "OK, Tom. Let's play with Spot. He can be our friend." They hug. They pick up the ball. They run to the flags. They play catch and flag with Spot. They have fun. They are happy. They are loyal. They are friends.
