Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to drive his toy car around the house. One day, he went to the park with his mom and dad. They played on the swings and slides. Timmy loved the rhythm of the swings.
After playing, they went to get ice cream. Timmy wanted a smelly flavor, like stinky cheese. But his mom and dad said no, so he chose chocolate instead. They drove home in their car, singing songs and laughing.
Suddenly, a big truck crashed into their car. Timmy was scared and hurt. His mom and dad were hurt too. They went to the hospital, but the doctors couldn't save them. Timmy was now alone and sad. He missed his mom and dad very much.
