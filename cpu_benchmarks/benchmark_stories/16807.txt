Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went for a walk in the park with her mom. While they were walking, Lily found a shiny rock on the ground. She was so happy to find it!
As they continued walking, Lily's mom told her it was almost noon and time for lunch. Lily was hungry and excited to eat. But then, they heard a loud noise and Lily got frightened. Her mom hugged her and told her it was just a bird flying away.
After they finished lunch, Lily and her mom went home. Lily showed her dad the shiny rock she found and he was proud of her. Even though she got frightened, Lily had a fun day in the park and found a special treasure.
