One bright morning, Daisy went out to the backyard with her mom. Her mom pointed at the well and told her to look. Daisy was mesmerized by the well. It was very big and deep. She thought it was so cool! 
Mom asked her if she wanted to admire it more closely, but Daisy was a bit nervous. She had never seen a well before and felt scared. 
Mom asked her again and Daisy finally mustered up her courage. She cautiously walked up to the well. As she admired it, Daisy asked her mom how it worked. 
"That's a good question," replied her mom. "People put a bucket down below the well and pull up a rope to get the water."
Daisy nodded her head and smiled. She was so happy to learn something new. From that day on, Daisy made sure to admire the well every morning before school.
