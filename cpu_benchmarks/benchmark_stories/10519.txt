A little toddler named Sam watched as his Dad loaded a big laptop into his car. 
"What's that?" Sam asked, feeling curious.
"Oh, that's a laser," Dad replied.
Sam's eyes widened and he imagined a bright beam of light shooting out of the laptop.
"Can I make it work?" Sam asked, pointing at the laptop. 
Dad laughed, "Not yet, but someday you will. For now it's only for grown-ups." 
Sam huffed and followed Dad to the store. Inside they saw a big wall with a mild red light coming from it. 
"Is that the laser?" Sam asked, feeling excited.
Dad smiled and nodded. 
"Come here and I'll show you how to load the laser," Dad said. 
Sam watched carefully as Dad taught him how to turn the laser on and off.
Finally, Sam felt proud that he was able to load the laser by himself. With a smiling face, he thanked his Dad for teaching him something new.
