Once upon a time there was a dancer. He was very sad and he was feeling miserable. He loved to dance and he wanted to be the best dancer in the world.
One day, he was in the park and he met a little girl. She asked him why he was looking so sad. He replied that he wanted to be the best dancer in the world, but he felt stuck.
The little girl smiled and said, "Don't worry, I can help you!"
The dancer was very surprised and he asked her how she could do that. She said, "Just practice hard every day and never give up. You'll end up becoming the best dancer in the world!"
The dancer was so happy and thankful that he gave her a big hug. He thanked her and promised that he will practice hard and never give up until he became the best dancer in the world!
And that's what the dancer did. He became a great dancer and he was very happy in the end.
