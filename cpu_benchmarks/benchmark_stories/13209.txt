Once upon a time, there was a dependable train that liked to speed along the tracks. It was the fastest train on the railway! One day, the train arrived in a town with a big chimney. It was so big, the train had to slow down.
But the train didn't stop. It chugged around the chimney and sped away. It was going so fast, the townsfolk who saw it clapped and cheered.
The dependable train kept speeding around the countryside, running from town to town. No matter how long it ran, the train never got tired. It always kept the same fast speed.
The dependable train kept on going ever day, making the townsfolk smile. And with its fast speed and dependable service, the train will always be known far and wide.
