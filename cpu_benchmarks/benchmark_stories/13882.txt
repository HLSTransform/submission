One day, a little girl named Lily was playing with her toys. She had a big, red ball and a brilliant, shiny car. She loved to play with them both. But then, she saw something strange. A little cat was staring at her from her window. The cat looked sad and scared.
Lily wanted to help the cat. She opened the window and let the cat come in. The cat was very happy and started to purr. But then, Lily's mom came into the room. She saw the cat and said, "Oh no, this is an emergency! The cat should not be in the house."
Lily's mom took the cat outside and talked to Lily. She told her that some cats can make people sick, and it was not safe for the cat to be inside. Lily was sad, but she understood. She went outside to play with the cat and her toys. They had a lot of fun, and Lily learned how to be careful with animals.
