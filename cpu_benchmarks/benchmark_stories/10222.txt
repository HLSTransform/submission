One day, Sam went to the park with his mom. They played with a ball and had a lot of fun. Sam was very hungry after playing. His mom said, "Let's eat something."
Sam's mom had an idea. She said, "I suggest we eat a sandwich from the subway shop." Sam liked the idea, so they went to the subway shop.
At the shop, Sam saw a spicy sandwich. He asked his mom, "Can I try the spicy one?" His mom said, "It might be too hot for you." But Sam wanted to try it. He took a bite and his face turned red. He drank some water and said, "Next time, I will try a different one."
