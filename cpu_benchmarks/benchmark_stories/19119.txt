Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play basketball with his friends every day. One day, when they were playing, it started to rain. Timmy's friend said, "Oh no, we have to go inside now." But Timmy said, "No, let's keep playing in the rain. It's fun!"
So they kept playing basketball in the rain, and it was so much fun. The rain was coming down hard, but it made everything feel calm and peaceful. Timmy's friend said, "I never knew playing in the rain could be so much fun!" Timmy smiled and said, "It's my favorite thing to do."
After a while, the rain stopped and they went inside. Timmy's mom asked him why he was all wet, and he said, "We played basketball in the rain! It was so much fun!" His mom laughed and said, "You're such a silly boy, Timmy." But Timmy didn't mind, because he knew that playing in the rain was the best thing ever.
