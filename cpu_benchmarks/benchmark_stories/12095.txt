Once upon a time, there was a little bee named Buzz. Buzz loved to fly around and collect nectar from flowers all day long. One day, Buzz got very tired and needed a nap. 
He found a cozy flower and took a nap. While he was sleeping, a big gust of wind came and blew him far away from his home. 
Buzz was scared and didn't know what to do. But then, he saw some other bees flying by and asked for help. They were happy to help Buzz and showed him the way back home. 
Buzz learned that it's okay to take a nap when you're tired, but it's also important to ask for help when you need it. And in the end, everything turned out fine. The end.
