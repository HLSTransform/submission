Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Timmy, it's time to go to the park!" Timmy was so excited to go play on the swings and slide. 
When they got to the park, Timmy saw a playful puppy running around. Timmy asked the puppy, "Do you want to play with me?" The puppy barked happily and ran over to Timmy. They played together for a while.
After playing, Timmy's mom said, "It's time to go home and take a nap in your bed." Timmy was a little sad to leave the park, but he knew he would have more fun playing with his toys when he woke up.
