Once upon a time, there was a cop who had a very special job. His job was to make sure everybody was safe and sound. He worked really hard and people really liked him.
One day, the cop decided that he needed to relax for a while and take a break. He ate some ice cream that was very sweet and took a nice long walk.
After his walk, the cop sat down and noticed a park. There were lots of children laughing, playing and having fun. The cop saw a little girl who reminded him of his own 3 year old daughter.
The cop smiled and watched the little girl play with her friends. He saw how happy and carefree she was and it made him feel relaxed and peaceful. He watched until it was time for the little girl to go home.
He said goodbye to the little girl and waved as she walked away. He was thankful that he had chosen to relax and take a break. The cop felt much better and was ready to get back to work.
