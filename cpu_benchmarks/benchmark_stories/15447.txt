The church was big and tall. It was made of wood and stone and it was very heavy. There were lots of people inside, all coming together and singing.
One of the people was a little girl called Emily. She was only three and she was feeling very scared and sad. She wanted to find a friendly face to make her feel better.
All of a sudden, Emily saw a man in the corner who was smiling at her. She ran to him and gave him a big hug. He was so kind and loving and he hugged Emily back.
The man told Emily that she should come to church every Sunday, and that he would take care of her. Emily smiled, feeling happy and safe knowing that she had someone to hug and love her.
