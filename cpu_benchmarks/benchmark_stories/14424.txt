Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her garden. One day, she saw a vine growing on the fence. She thought it looked fun to climb, so she tried to grab it. But the vine was too high for her to reach.
Just then, a foolish rabbit hopped by. Lily asked the rabbit, "Can you help me enter the vine?" The rabbit said, "Sure, I can help you climb the vine!" So, the rabbit hopped onto the fence and helped Lily climb up the vine.
When they reached the top, Lily was so happy! She thanked the rabbit and said, "You are my best friend!" The rabbit smiled and said, "I am happy to help you, Lily." From that day on, Lily and the rabbit played together every day in the garden.
