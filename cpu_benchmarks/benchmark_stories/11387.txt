It was a bright, sunny day and Ben and his mom were getting ready to go on holiday. Ben was so excited and couldn't wait to go. He had so many questions about the holiday, asking his mom every small detail.
"Mom, where will we go?", Ben asked. His mom smiled and replied, "To an amazing place!"
The next day they set off on their journey. As Ben and his mom drove on the highway, Ben looked out the window in awe, taking in the scenery. He could already tell it was going to be an amazing holiday.
As they arrived to the destination, Ben and his mom stepped out of the car. But when Ben saw where they were, he was frightened. It was an old, abandoned hotel. 
Ben was skeptical and said, "Mom, why did we come here? It looks really scary". His mom put on a brave face and said, "Don't worry Ben, just remain with me and everything will be ok." 
Ben reluctantly followed his mom and step by step, they made their way inside the hotel. Suddenly, Ben heard a weird noise and the ceiling started to shake. Ben wanted to run away but his mom said, "Don't worry, remain with me and everything will be ok." 
The moral of the story is that you can't always trust the things you hear or see and you should always listen to the people you trust
