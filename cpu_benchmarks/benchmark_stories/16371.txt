Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty dress that she loved to wear. One day, she saw a big box in her room. She wanted to see what was inside.
Lily found a key and used it to unlock the box. Inside the box, she found a big, sour lemon. She didn't like sour things, but she thought it was fun to find something new.
Lily put the sour lemon in her dress pocket and went outside to play. She showed her friends the lemon and they all made funny faces when they tasted it. They laughed and played all day, and Lily was happy she had unlocked the box.
