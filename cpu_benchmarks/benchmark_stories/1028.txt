Once there was a little girl named Poppy. Poppy was 3 years old and very happy. One day, Poppy was walking in a park and she saw something very special. She saw a big, red poppy! It was so beautiful. Poppy was amazed and she wanted to take it home with her.
Poppy got close to the poppy and she looked at it very carefully. She touched it gently and it felt so soft. Poppy knew the poppy was very special so she picked it up and hugged it with her hands.
When Poppy got home with the poppy, she showed it to her mommy. Her mommy smiled and said,
"That's a very good poppy, Poppy"
Poppy was so happy and smiled very big. She would keep the poppy forever as a special thing to remember. In the end, Poppy learned that some things can be very good when you look carefully.
