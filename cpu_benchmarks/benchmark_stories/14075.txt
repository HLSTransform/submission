Once there was a little girl name Lucy. She loved to kick things around. One day, Lucy saw a point outside in her garden. She thought it looked very interesting! She ran over to it and decided to kick it. 
When Lucy kicked the point, something magical happened! She saw a little fairy appear out of the point. The fairy sparkled in the sunlight and fluttered around with its glittery wings. Lucy was so amazed!
The fairy flew around Lucy's head, and then flew up to the treehouse. She wanted Lucy to follow her up there. So Lucy did, and when she got there she saw something even more incredible - a golden pot full of coins and gems!
Lucy and the fairy quickly gathered up the coins and gems, and the fairy told Lucy she could keep them all. Lucy was so excited that she quickly hugged the fairy and said thank you before running off to show her friends her new stash. 
It was an amazing and very interesting day for Lucy!
