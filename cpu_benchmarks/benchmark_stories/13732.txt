Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to cook with her mommy. One day, they made spaghetti with tomato sauce. The sauce was very hot, but Lily wanted to try it.
"Lily, be careful. The sauce is hot," said her mommy.
"I want to try it," said Lily.
So, her mommy gave her a little bit of sauce to taste. It was too hot for Lily, but she didn't want to admit it. 
"I like it," said Lily.
Later that day, Lily's friend came over to play. She saw Lily's toy car and wanted to borrow it. 
"Can I borrow your toy car?" asked Lily's friend.
Lily didn't want to share her toy car, but she remembered her mommy telling her to be nice to her friends.
"Okay, you can borrow it," said Lily.
But when her friend returned the toy car, it was broken. Lily was very sad.
The moral of the story is that it's important to be honest and not be afraid to say no when we don't want to share something.
