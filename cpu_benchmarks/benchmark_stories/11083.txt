Lily liked to create things with her crayons and paper. She made pictures of flowers, animals, and her family. She was very proud of her creations and showed them to her mom and dad.
One day, she wanted to create something different. She saw her dad's bathrobe hanging in the bathroom. It was big and white and soft. Lily thought it would be fun to make it more colorful. She took her crayons and started to draw on the bathrobe. She made circles, stars, and hearts. She smiled as she saw how pretty it looked.
She ran to the living room to show her dad. "Look, dad, I created a new bathrobe for you!" she said, holding up the robe.
Dad was not happy. He saw the crayon marks all over his bathrobe. He was angry and sad. He liked his bathrobe the way it was. He did not want it to be ruined. He yelled at Lily. "Lily, what did you do? You ruined my bathrobe! This is not creating, this is destroying! Go to your room right now!"
Lily was scared and confused. She did not mean to make dad angry. She thought he would like her creation. She started to cry. She said, "I'm sorry, dad, I just wanted to make you happy."
Dad did not listen. He was too mad. He took the bathrobe and threw it in the trash. He told Lily to go to her room and not come out until he said so.
Lily ran to her room, sobbing. She felt bad and lonely. She wished dad was more polite and understood her. She wished she never touched the bathrobe. She wished she could create something that would make dad happy.
