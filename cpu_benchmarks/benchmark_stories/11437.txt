One day, Ann saw a tall bag. She wanted to peek inside it, so she carefully opened it up. When she looked in, she saw a lot of sweet treats. She couldn't believe her eyes! She reached in to take one, but before she could do so, a big hand covered hers.
Ann looked up and saw a tall man standing in front of her. He said, "Those treats are not for you. You can't have any." Ann was very sad. She wanted the sweet treats, but the tall man said she could not have any. 
Ann started to cry and ran away. Even though she was very sad, she never peeked inside the tall bag again.
