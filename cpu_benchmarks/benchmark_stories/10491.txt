Once upon a time there was a blue duck. The duck lived in a pond and loved to dive. Every day the duck used to dive into the pond and swim around. 
One day, as the duck was diving, he saw something sparkly at the bottom of the pond. He swam closer and closer until he was able to grab it. As soon as he grabbed it he swam to the surface of the pond.
The duck was very excited. He had found a sparkly blue stone! He kept it close to him every time he dove. 
One day, while he was diving, the duck got into trouble. He was too far down and couldn't get back up! The duck started to worry until he remembered the sparkly blue stone. He held the stone close and it gave him the strength he needed to make it back to the surface. 
The duck was very happy when he reached the top. He thanked the blue stone for saving him and vowed never to dive too deep again.
