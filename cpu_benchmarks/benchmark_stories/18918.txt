Tom had a big truck toy. He liked to play with it in his room. He made noises like vroom and beep. He pretended the truck was powerful and could go on any road.
One day, he saw a real truck outside his window. It was red and shiny. It had a big lock on the back. Tom wondered what was inside. He wanted to see.
He put on his shoes and ran outside. He followed the truck to the park. He saw the driver get out and unlock the back. He opened the door and took out a big box. Tom was curious. He ran to the truck and climbed inside.
He saw many boxes and bags. He opened one and found a teddy bear. He opened another and found a ball. He opened another and found a book. He was happy. He thought the truck was full of toys for him.
But then he heard a loud voice. It was the driver. He was angry. He saw Tom in his truck. He shouted, "Hey, kid, what are you doing? Get out of there! That's not your stuff!"
Tom was scared. He dropped the book and ran out of the truck. He ran back to his house. He hugged his own truck toy. He learned a lesson. He should not go inside other people's trucks. He should not unlock things that are not his. He should play with his own toys. He was sorry. He hoped the driver was not too mad. He hoped the driver would find a good home for the teddy bear, the ball and the book.
