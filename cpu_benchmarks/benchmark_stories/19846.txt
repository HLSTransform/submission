Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play games with her friends. One day, Lily and her friend Emily were playing a game of hide and seek. They were both very enthusiastic about the game.
Lily said to Emily, "Imagine if we could play this game forever!" 
But then, Lily got lost and couldn't find her way back to Emily. She started to cry, and Emily had to go find her. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to be careful when playing games and always stay close to your friends.
