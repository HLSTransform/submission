Anna and Jared were very good friends. They liked to do lots of fun things together. One day, Anna and Jared decided to go for a jog. Anna put on her green shoes and grabbed her menu.
They jogged down the street, past the park and around the corner. Then, they stopped for a break. Anna said, "Let's get something from the menu before we go back home."
They looked at the menu and picked out two yummy sandwiches. After they finished eating, Anna and Jared put their menus away and started to jog again. They jogged slowly back home and had a lot of fun.
