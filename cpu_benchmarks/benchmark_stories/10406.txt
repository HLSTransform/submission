Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She was three years old and liked to play games. Today, she wanted to go to the maze. She ran and ran, until she reached the entrance. 
Inside, the maze was very messy. Everywhere she looked, there were walls and pathways tangled together. Amy was a little scared. 
Then, a friendly man appeared and said, "Don't be scared, Amy. I'm here to help you." He took her hand and showed her the way through the maze. Together, they turned and twisted until they reached the exit. 
Amy smiled and thanked the man. "Goodbye," she said. He smiled, waved, and was gone. 
Amy was happy. She felt comforted now that she knew her way out of the maze. She was no longer scared and ran to tell her Mom all about it.
