Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the store with her mom. They bought a can of tuna for their dinner. When they got home, Lily's mom put the can of tuna in the cupboard and locked it.
Lily asked, "Why did you lock the cupboard?"
"Because we don't want the cat to eat the tuna," her mom replied.
Lily nodded her head, but then she saw the cat outside. The cat looked angry because it wanted to come inside. Lily said, "Mom, the cat is angry. Can we let it in?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Okay, but we have to make sure the cat doesn't get the tuna."
Lily and her mom let the cat in and gave it some food. The cat was happy and didn't try to get the tuna. They all had a nice dinner together and the cat even purred. The end.
