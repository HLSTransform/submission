Anna liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls with different names and clothes. She liked to talk to them and make them talk to each other. She used her own language that only she and her dolls knew.
One day, her mom came to her room and said, "Anna, it's time to go to the park. Put on your shoes and coat and come with me."
Anna did not want to go to the park. She wanted to play with her dolls more. She said, "No, mom. I want to play. I want to talk to my dolls. They are my friends."
Her mom said, "Anna, you can play with your dolls later. You need to go to the park and play with other kids. You need to learn their language and make new friends. It's good for you."
Anna was confused. She did not understand why she needed to learn another language. She liked her own language. She said, "But mom, I don't like their language. It's hard and strange. I don't know what they say. They don't know what I say. They are not my friends."
Her mom said, "Anna, I know it's hard and strange at first. But you can learn it. You can learn what they say and they can learn what you say. You can have more friends. You can have fun. Trust me, Anna. It's good for you."
Anna did not want to trust her mom. She wanted to stay with her dolls. She said, "No, mom. I don't want to go. I don't want to learn. I don't want to have fun. I want to play. I want to talk to my dolls. They are my friends."
Her mom was sad and worried. She did not know what to do. She said, "Anna, please. Don't delay. Don't be stubborn. Don't be afraid. Come with me. Let's go to the park. Let's try something new. Let's have fun."
Anna looked at her mom. She looked at her dolls. She was confused. She did not know what to do. She did not know what to say. She did not know what to think. She did not know what to feel.
