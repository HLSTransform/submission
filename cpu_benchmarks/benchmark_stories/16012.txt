Once upon a time, there were two best friends: Steve and Kelly. Both of them were very young and were always playing together. 
One day they were dreaming about what they wanted to be when they grew up. Steve said he wanted to be a firefighter and Kelly said she wanted to be a teacher.
After their talk, Kelly decided to do some exercise. She began running around, skipping and hopping. Steve watched in amazement and decided he wanted to do some exercise too. 
Kelly showed him the correct way to exercise. She tried to make it fun by running gently and slowly around the garden. 
When they finished exercising, Steve said, "Thank you for showing me how to exercise in a gentle way, Kelly. I had so much fun!" 
Kelly smiled and replied, “It’s important to be gentle and have fun with exercise. That’s how it should be.”
This little story teaches us that exercising with gentleness and fun is the right way to do it. Exercise can be enjoyable if we take it slow and lighthearted.
