One day, a little girl named Mia went to a big, wide house. She saw many stairs in the house. Mia liked to play on the stairs. She went up and down, up and down. Mia was very happy.
Mia heard a sound. "What is that?" she asked. She looked around and saw a small cat. The cat said, "Meow! I want to play too!" Mia smiled and said, "Come on, let's play on the stairs together!"
Mia and the cat played on the stairs all day. They went up and down, up and down. They had so much fun. When it was time to go home, Mia said, "Bye, cat! I will come back to play again!" The cat meowed and waved goodbye. Mia went home, excited to play with her new friend again soon.
