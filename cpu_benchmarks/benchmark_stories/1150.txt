Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to play outside in the sun. One day, he went to the park to play with his red ball. He saw a big tree and felt happy.
Tim threw his red ball, and it went up, up, up into the tree. Tim was confused. He did not know how to get his ball back. He looked at the tree and thought for a moment.
Tim had an idea. He found a long stick and used it to poke the ball. Poke, poke, poke! The red ball fell down from the tree. Tim was happy and played with his ball all day long.
