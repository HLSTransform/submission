Once upon a time, there lived a boy called Jack. He was only 3 years old, so he only knew simple words. One day, Jack and his dad were sitting in the backyard, reading a book. All of a sudden, they heard a loud sound. It was a tornado!
Jack looked up at his dad with wide eyes. "What is it, Dad?" he asked in a small voice. "It's a tornado, son. Let's go inside," said Dad.
Jack and his dad ran inside quickly. They both held onto the door as the house shook hard from the tornado. Jack was scared, but he was brave. He read his book to take his mind off it. 
After a while the tornado went away, and everything went back to normal. Jack was relieved. His dad, too. He was so happy that he hugged Jack tight and said, "Good job, Jack! You were so brave."
Jack smiled. He felt proud that he had been brave during the tornado.
