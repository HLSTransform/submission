Once there was a little turtle named Toby. He was very slow but he was always happy.
One day Toby decided to go for a walk. He picked up his shell and went on his way.
As he was walking, he saw a big, tall log. He was curious, so he slowly picked it up. He wanted to see what was inside.
As Toby opened the log he found a cozy little surprise - a family of baby birds! Toby smiled and moved the log back to its original spot.
He was so excited to see the birds that he started to run, but then he remembered he was slow and had to walk. 
As Toby walked home he thought of his special surprise and smiled all the way.
