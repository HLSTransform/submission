Once there was a girl named Mel. She was three years old and she loved to play.
One day, she found a big rubber ball and she was so excited! She wanted to bounce it around and have so much fun.
So Mel took the rubber ball and went outside. She tossed the rubber ball into the air and jumped to catch it. The rubber ball made a loud bouncing noise as it landed on the ground.
Mel kept the game going for a while, but soon she started to get frustrated. No matter how hard she tried, she could not keep the rubber ball in the air for very long.
Mel started to cry, frustrated she couldn't keep the rubber ball bouncing as much as she wanted.
Her mom noticed and walked over to her. She wiped her tears and said, "It's ok Mel, with practice you'll figure it out. I know you can do it!"
Mel nodded, feeling a little bit better. She took a deep breath, looked at her Mom and said, "Let's try this again!"
With a little bit of effort and a lot of support from her Mom, Mel learned to keep the rubber ball bouncing! She was so happy that she was finally able to do it.
