Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint and would spend hours making colorful pictures with her brushes and paints. One day, she went to the store with her mommy and saw a big book called a dictionary. Her mommy told her that it was a book with lots of words and their meanings.
Later that day, Lily's mommy asked her to clean up her toys. Lily didn't want to do it, but she remembered how her mommy said she should be obedient and do what she was asked. So, she obediently cleaned up her toys. As a reward, her mommy said she could paint a picture.
Lily was so happy and excited to paint. She thought about what she wanted to paint and remembered the big dictionary at the store. She decided to paint a picture of the dictionary. Her mommy was amazed at how good it was and gave her a big hug. Lily felt proud of herself for being obedient and for making such a beautiful painting.
