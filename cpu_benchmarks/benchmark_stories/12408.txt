One day, two friends visited the park. The friends were very friendly and smiled often. They had so much fun, running around and playing games.
The two friends decided to go down the slide. They chose the biggest one and promised to be careful. But at the bottom of the slide, one of the friends pushed the other and made them fall.
The friend that was pushed felt scared and upset. She said loudly, "Please don't push me again!" Her friend said sorry but he did not mean it.
The visit to the park ended sadly. The two friends parted ways and not one of them was smiling anymore. 
The moral of this story is that being friendly does not always mean that everything ends well. Even when people are friends, treating each other badly will never be okay.
