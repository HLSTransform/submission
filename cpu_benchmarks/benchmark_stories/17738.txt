One day, a boy went on a walk. He wanted to find something special. He looked around until he saw something unique. It was a pigeon! He had never seen a pigeon before. He watched it walking around, its feathers flapping in the wind. The boy followed the pigeon and soon it flew up into the sky. 
The boy looked up, but the pigeon was gone. He felt sad, but soon he heard a cooing sound above him. It was the same pigeon! He looked up and saw it flying in circles above him. He waved his arms excitedly as the pigeon flew closer and closer.
 
Finally, the pigeon landed on the boy's head! The boy laughed and the pigeon cooed. They stayed there together until the sun began to set. Then the pigeon flew away, leaving the boy with a smile on his face. It was a unique moment he never forgot.
