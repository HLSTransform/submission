Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Jack. He was only three years old and so he liked to explore the world and try new things.
One day, Jack was walking in the park when he saw something special. It was a very big drum. Jack wanted to try it out so he started to bang it. He was so happy and he made lots of noise.
Jack's friends did not like the noise he was making. So Jack's friends ran away. But Jack didn't stop. He was having so much fun making the noise.
Then something very special happened. Jack realized that the sound of the drum made him feel very lucky. That made him smile even more. 
Jack kept banging the drum and he realized that making music was lots of fun!
