One day, a normal cat named Tom went outside to play. He liked to see all the things in his yard. There were trees, flowers, and even some lumber. Tom saw the lumber and had an idea.
Tom went to his friend, a dog named Max. "Max, let's build something with the lumber," said Tom. Max thought it was a great idea. They started to build a small house for them to play in. But soon, they began to argue. Tom wanted the house to be big, while Max wanted it to be small.
In the end, they decided to work together and build a house that was just the right size. They were happy and played in their new house all day long. The lumber that Tom had seen in the yard had turned into a fun place for them to play.
