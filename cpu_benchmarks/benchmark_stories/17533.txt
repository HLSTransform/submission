Tom and Jen are twins. They like to play in the yard. One day, they find a big iron thing. It is brown and hard and has holes.
"What is this?" Tom asks.
"I don't know. Maybe a toy," Jen says.
They try to lift it, but it is too heavy. They try to push it, but it does not move. They try to make noise with it, but it is too quiet.
"It is no fun," Tom says.
"Let's go find something else," Jen says.
But Tom is stubborn. He wants to know what the iron thing is. He notices a wire coming out of it. He follows the wire to the wall. He sees a plug.
"Maybe this makes it work," he says.
He pulls the plug out of the wall. Nothing happens. He puts the plug back in the wall. Nothing happens.
"See? It is no good," Jen says.
But Tom is still stubborn. He notices a button on the iron thing. He pushes the button.
Suddenly, the iron thing makes a hissing sound. Steam comes out of the holes. It is very hot.
"Ow! Ow! Ow!" Tom screams.
He drops the iron thing. It falls on his foot. It hurts a lot.
"Tom! Tom! Are you okay?" Jen asks.
She runs to him. She hugs him. She cries.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to the yard. She sees the iron thing. She sees Tom's foot. She is very angry.
"Who did this?" she asks.
Tom and Jen look at each other. They are very scared.
They say nothing.
