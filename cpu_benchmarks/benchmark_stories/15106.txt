Once there was a little boy named Robby. He loved to go to school and learn new things. One day he came home from school feeling very tired. So his mom suggested he take a nap.
Robby wasn't sure if he wanted to, but eventually he lay down and closed his eyes. Soon he was asleep. As he slept, he felt something magical and tingly all around him. It felt like he was being healed!
When Robby woke up, he felt like a new person. All his tiredness had vanished and he felt energized. He thanked his mom for the healing power of sleep.
"You're welcome, Robby," she said with a smile. "Sometimes all we need is a bit of rest to help us heal."
