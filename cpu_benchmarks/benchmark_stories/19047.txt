Once upon a time, there was a little duck named Ducky. Ducky loved to swim in the river with his friends. One day, Ducky and his friends were playing in the river when they saw a big, mean cat. The cat wanted to catch Ducky and his friends for dinner.
Ducky knew he had to escape from the cat. He quickly swam away, but the cat was fast. Ducky's friends were scared and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, Ducky had an idea. He swam to the other side of the river where there was a good man who always fed the ducks.
Ducky and his friends swam to the good man and told him about the cat. The good man chased the cat away and gave the ducks some bread to eat. Ducky and his friends were safe and happy, and they knew they could always escape from danger if they had a good plan.
