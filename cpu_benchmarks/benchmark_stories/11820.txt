Mum and Dad took their little boy to the park. It was a new park, so the little boy was so excited to explore. He ran over to the slide and laughed as he went down. Dad smiled at his little boy and said, "Let's have lunch now, ok?".
Mum had packed a delicious lunch for them to share in the park. It had all of the little boy's favourite snacks. He said, "Thank you Mum! This looks yummy!"
They all sat down together and enjoyed their lunch. The little boy was so happy. He thanked Mum and Dad for bringing him to the new park. They smiled and thanked him too.
After lunch, they went back to the park and the little boy had so much fun exploring. He pointed out all the new things he saw.
Mum and Dad were very proud and said, "We're glad you had fun! Let's thank the park for giving us this lovely time together!" 
The little boy smiled and said thank you too. They all waved goodbye as they left the park and went back home.
