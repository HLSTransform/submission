Once upon a time there was a little girl. Her name was Rachel. She was only three years old and she loved to play.
One day, she was playing with her toys in the living room when her mom came in.
"It's time to part, Rachel," said her mom. Rachel was a bit sad and asked why.
"It's dinner time, darling. I'm making steak," her mom said.
Rachel was so excited and quickly ran to the kitchen. Her mom had already cut the steak into tiny pieces with her sharp knife.
Rachel thought the steak was very yummy and ate it all. She finished so quickly, so her mom cut her another piece.
When Rachel went to eat it, she couldn't open her mouth - it was too tight!
"Don't worry, darling, I can help you," her mom said. She then gave Rachel a big hug and rubbed her back until her mouth opened wide enough to eat the steak.
Rachel finished the steak and thanked her mom. She was so happy that she gave her mom a tight hug and ran off to play again.
