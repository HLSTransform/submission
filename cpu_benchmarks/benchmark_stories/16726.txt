Tommy was scared of the dark. He hated when his mom turned off the light and said good night. He wanted to see his toys and his books and his teddy bear. He did not like the shadows and the noises in his room.
One night, he heard a loud knock on the door. He heard his mom open it and talk to someone. He heard a stranger's voice. He did not know who it was. He did not like strangers. He wished his mom would come back to his room and hug him.
He got out of his bed and walked to the door. He peeked outside and saw a man with a big bag. The man was wearing a dark coat and a dark hat. He looked mean and scary. Tommy was afraid. He wanted to hide.
He ran back to his bed and pulled the covers over his head. He held his teddy bear tight and closed his eyes. He hoped the stranger would go away. He hoped his mom would come back soon. He hated the dark and the stranger. He wanted to be safe and happy.
