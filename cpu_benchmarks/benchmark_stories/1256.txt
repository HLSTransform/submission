Once upon a time there was a big, tough bear. He liked to go for walks in the woods but he rarely met anyone else.
One day, he was walking in the woods when he saw a big axe. He was really curious and he wanted to pick it up so he did.
When the bear held the axe, he roared very loudly. He was so loud that it made the birds fly away in fright.
The bear held onto the axe because he thought it was so cool. He wanted to keep it forever.
But then, a few days later, a tough lumberjack came into the forest. He saw the axe and knew it belonged to him. He grabbed it back and took it home.
The bear didn't roar this time. He just watched sadly as the lumberjack went away.
