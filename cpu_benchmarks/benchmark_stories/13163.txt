Once upon a time, there lived a little girl. She loved to go for walks in the woods near her house. 
One day she went on a walk. She started to collect branches as she walked along. She found a broken branch and picked it up. She was so excited and ran back home to show it to her parents.
When she got home she showed them the broken branch. Her mom and dad smiled and said that it was very special. They told her that she could use it to make something creative. 
So the little girl went to her room and started to make something with the broken branch. She thought and thought until she finally had an idea. 
She made a dragonfly! It was so pretty, with the broken branch as its wings. The girl's parents were so proud of her that they hung the dragonfly on the wall of the living room. The little girl was so happy and every time she looked at it she thought of her walk in the woods.
