One day, Sammy and his Mommy were walking down the street. Suddenly, Sammy heard a loud noise. He looked around and saw a big, white ambulance.
"Mommy, what is that?" Sammy asked.
"That is an ambulance, Sammy," Mommy said. "It takes people who are not feeling very well to the hospital."
Mommy and Sammy got closer to the ambulance and Sammy waved at the driver. The driver waved back.
"The driver wants to introduce you to the ambulance," Mommy said.
Sammy nodded and took one step forward. He was very excited and couldn't believe his eyes. It was so big and white! He touched the side of the ambulance and smiled.
"Hello, ambulance," Sammy said.
The ambulance revved its engine and Sammy giggled. Then he waved goodbye and they walked away. Sammy was so excited and happy to meet the ambulance!
