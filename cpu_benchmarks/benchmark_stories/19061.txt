Once upon a time, there was a big river. In the river, there was a big alligator. He was very busy swimming and looking for food. 
One day, he saw a little duck swimming in the river. The alligator said, "Hello little duck, what are you doing?" The little duck said, "I am swimming and looking for my family." 
The alligator said, "I can help you find your family. Hop on my back and I will take you there." The little duck hopped on the alligator's back and they swam down the river together. 
Soon, they found the little duck's family. The little duck said, "Thank you, Mr. Alligator, for helping me find my family." The alligator said, "You're welcome, little duck. Have a good day!" And they both went on their way, happy and busy.
