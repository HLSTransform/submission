Once upon a time, there was a strong and brave man named Jim. Jim wanted to go on an adventure but he had never been on one before. So he asked his friends for help. 
His friends said, “We will help you, but first you must show us how powerful you can be.” So Jim looked for a way to prove how powerful he was.
He found a very big rock, so big that he knew no one else could move it. Jim tried and tried to push it, but he couldn't move it. He was so frustrated. But then, he saw a tiny mouse.
The mouse said, “If you move the rock quickly, I know you can succeed.” Jim took the mouse's advice and used his powerful strength to move the rock quickly. He was successful in his task and his friends were so impressed! 
Everyone cheered for Jim and they had a great adventure together. Jim proved that with a little bit of effort and strong will, it is possible to succeed.
