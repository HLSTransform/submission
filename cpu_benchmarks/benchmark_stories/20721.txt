Once upon a time there was a little van. It had purple and yellow spots all over it. The van drove down the street really fast. But then the van had to stop. The driver was in a big messy mess. He spilled his ice cream on the seat and  it was really sticky. He couldn't drive any more. So he got out of the van and went home. He went back later to clean it up but it was too late, the mess was already made. The van didn't go anywhere anymore. 
The end.
