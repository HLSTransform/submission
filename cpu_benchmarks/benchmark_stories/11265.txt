Mommy was at the park with her little girl. The girl was so happy to see her new bicycle. She ran to it, gleeful with excitement.
“Let’s go ride it!” She said, jumping to the seat.
Mommy smiled. “But first, you need to kiss me goodbye!”
The little girl leapt off the seat and puckered her lips. She gave Mommy a big big kiss right on the cheek.
Mommy smiled. “Off you go!”
The little girl went to ride her bicycle, but as soon as she started pedaling, she had a minor accident and fell off. She started to cry.
Mommy ran to her, scooped her up and said, “It’s ok, don’t cry sweetie! Are you ok?”
The little girl nodded.
Mommy kissed her forehead. “I’m so sorry it happened. Let’s try again, ok?”
The little girl smiled and ran to her bicycle. She was now more careful as she rode, enjoying the wind in her hair. 
Mommy watched from a distance, glad that her little girl was happy.
