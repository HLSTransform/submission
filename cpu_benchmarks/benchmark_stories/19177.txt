One day, a little girl named Lucy found some shiny jewelry in her mom's room. She was very excited. Lucy put the jewelry in her pocket and went outside to play.
While playing, Lucy saw a big, scary dog. The dog saw the jewelry in her pocket and wanted it. The dog said, "Give me the jewelry, or I will chase you!" Lucy was scared and didn't want to give the jewelry to the dog.
Lucy tried to escape from the dog, but she tripped and fell. The jewelry fell out of her pocket. The big, scary dog took the jewelry and ran away. Lucy was very sad and cried. She knew she should not have taken her mom's jewelry.
