Once there was a small boy named Tommy. Tommy was very tired and he wanted to go to sleep. So Tommy's mommy gave him some string and told him that if he buried it in the ground, then he will get rest. Tommy was very excited, so he ran outside and started digging in the dirt. 
Soon the hole was big enough and Tommy put the string in it. Then he patted the dirt down on top of the string and stood back to look at his work. It was finished! 
Tommy was so tired that he sat right down in the dirt and fell asleep. Later, when Tommy woke up, he was so happy that he had found a way to get some rest. He picked up the string, thanked his mommy, and went inside. 
The end.
