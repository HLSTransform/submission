Once upon a time, there lived two friends called Ben and Harold.
One day, Ben ordered a uniform for Harold. He wanted it to be pale so he asked for a light blue one. 
They waited for their package to arrive anxious to see how the uniform looked.
When it finally came in, Ben exclaimed "Wow, it looks perfect!". Harold was so happy. He couldn't believe he had a new uniform that was already pale.
He quickly put it on and twirled around to show off. Suddenly, Ben shouted out, "That looks so good on you! Let's go play outside now!" 
And so they raced outside in their new pale uniforms and had a great time!
