Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bake cookies with her mom. One day, they ran out of sugar. 
Lily asked her mom, "Mommy, do we have any sugar available?" 
Her mom replied, "No, we don't have any sugar left. We need to go to the store to buy some more." 
Lily and her mom went to the store to buy sugar. When they got home, Lily helped her mom separate the sugar into smaller bags so they could use it for baking. 
Lily said, "Mommy, I love baking with you. It's so much fun!" 
Her mom smiled and said, "I love baking with you too, Lily. It's always a fun time when we're together."
