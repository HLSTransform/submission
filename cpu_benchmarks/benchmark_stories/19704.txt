Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to explore. One day, she went on an adventure and found a big lake. She saw something fake in the lake and it looked like it was having trouble. She knew she had to rescue it.
The little girl was brave and she quickly put on her life jacket, and then she jumped into the lake to save the thing. When she got closer, she realise that it was a fake duck! She pulled it out of the lake, and it was so happy to be free.
The little girl was so proud of her rescue. She took the fake duck home, and now, it lives happily with her family. They call him Ducky and he loves to swim in the bathtub.
The little girl was so happy to have saved the fake duck's life. She fell in love with her rescue and she would never forget her adventure.
