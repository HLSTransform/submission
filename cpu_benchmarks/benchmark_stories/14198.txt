Once upon a time there was a little boy named Bill. He was always a very happy child. One day, his mommy and daddy hugged him and said they had a special surprise for him.
Bill was so excited to see what it was and his mommy brought out a big cake. The cake was colorful and delicious. But his mommy said it was a very cheap cake and Bill knew it wouldn't be as tasty as a special one.
Bill was sad and wished he had a better cake. He decided he wouldn't even eat cake that was so cheap. But his mommy and daddy hugged him and said they wanted him to be happy. 
So, Bill tried a piece of the cake. It wasn't delicious, but his parents' hugs made him feel better.
The moral of the story is that a hug can make things better, even when things don't turn out the way we expect them to. No matter what, you can always count on the people who love you to make you feel better.
