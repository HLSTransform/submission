Once upon a time, there was a star. The star was so broken that it trembled in the sky. Every night it shook and wobbled, making all the animals around it scared. Every night, a little mouse would come and try to help the star. 
The mouse would carefully brush each of the star's broken pieces back together. Every night, the mouse made the star a little bit brighter, a little bit bigger. But the star still trembled. 
One night, something special happened. The mouse had put all of the star's pieces together and suddenly, the star stopped trembling. It was strong, and bright, and beautiful in the sky! The mouse had done it! 
The mouse jumped and clapped and called all the animals around, so they could see the shining star in the night. All the animals cheered and clapped for the brave little mouse who had saved the star!
