Once upon a time, in a small town, lived a girl named Sue. Sue had long, thin hair. She loved to play with her hair, but it was always messy. Sue wanted to make her hair look nice and clean.
One day, Sue went to the store with her mom. "Mom, can we buy shampoo for my hair?" asked Sue. Her mom agreed and they bought the shampoo. Sue was very happy!
At home, Sue used the shampoo to wash her hair. It looked so nice and clean! Sue's mom was proud of her. "Sue, you look great! You learned that taking care of yourself is important," said her mom. Sue smiled and promised to always keep her hair clean.
