Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a chimney. The chimney was very big and tall. It was also a little clumsy. It would sometimes make the house shake.
One day, the chimney met a fast bird. The bird liked to race with its friends. The chimney wanted to race too, but it was stuck on the house. The bird had an idea. It told the chimney to race with its smoke.
The clumsy chimney was happy. It started to make smoke. The bird and the smoke raced in the sky. The bird was very fast, but the smoke was faster. The chimney won the race. The house did not shake anymore, and the chimney was not clumsy anymore. They all lived happily ever after.
