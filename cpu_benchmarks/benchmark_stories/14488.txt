Once there was a little girl who loved to play pretend. She was only 3 years old, but she was very imaginative. Every day, she would make up different adventures.
One day, she was pretending to be in a boat. She had made a boat out of chairs and pillows, and she was pretending to row. Suddenly, she heard something outside. She peeked out the window and saw a big, purple bike. It had two pedals on the side and it looked perfect.
She wanted to go for a ride on the bike so she ran out of the house and hopped on. She peddled and peddled until she was going really fast. She had never gone so fast before! She laughed and smiled, feeling the wind on her face.
She didn't want the fun to end, so she kept peddling until she was all the way around the block.
When she got back home, she felt so happy. She was so proud that she had pedaled all the way around the block. It was the perfect adventure!
