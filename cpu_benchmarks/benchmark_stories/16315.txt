Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat shrimp, but her mom told her not to eat too much because it could make her sick. One day, Lily went to a party and saw a big plate of shrimp. She ate so much that she felt sick and had to go home early.
The next day, Lily's mom told her a story about a greedy shrimp who ate too much and got very sick. The shrimp didn't listen to his friends who told him to stop eating. Lily felt bad for the shrimp and realized that she was just like him. She promised to listen to her mom and not eat too much shrimp again.
From that day on, Lily covered the shrimp on her plate with a napkin so she wouldn't be tempted to eat too much. She knew that eating too much could be disgusting and make her sick. Lily learned that it's important to listen to your parents and take care of yourself.
