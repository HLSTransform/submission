Once upon a time, there was a cool kite. The kite was special, because it could fly very high. One day, a little boy named Timmy saw the kite. He wanted to play with it. 
Timmy grabbed the kite and ran outside. With a big smile, he screamed as he flew it high in the sky. Everywhere he went, the kite would go too. 
Suddenly, a big gust of wind came. The kite flew up, up, up and was so high in the sky that it looked like a bright star. Timmy shouted and waved his arms, and the kite seemed to roar with joy. 
The kite stayed in the sky the whole day and was only seen when the sun was setting. As the pink and orange colors filled the sky, the kite flew down and back into Timmy's hands. 
The kite was so cool and it was the best day ever!
