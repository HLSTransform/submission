Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the museum with her mommy and daddy. One day, they went to see a big dinosaur exhibit. Lily was so excited to see the big bones, but she was also a little frightened. 
As they walked through the exhibit, Lily saw a little boy who was trying to balance on one foot. She went up to him and asked, "What are you doing?" The boy said, "I'm trying to balance like a flamingo!" 
Lily thought that was funny and tried to balance on one foot too. She wobbled a little bit, but then she found her balance. "Look, Mommy! I can balance like a flamingo!" she said. Her mommy and daddy smiled and said, "Good job, Lily!" 
After they saw all the dinosaurs, they went to get ice cream. Lily told her mommy and daddy all about how she balanced like a flamingo. They were very proud of her. From that day on, Lily loved going to the museum and trying to balance like all the animals she saw there.
