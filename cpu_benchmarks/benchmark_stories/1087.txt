Once, there was a pink wheel that belonged to a little girl. She was so excited to get the wheel, so she quickly put it on and started to ride down the street. As she was riding and having lots of fun, she got very tired. She yawned and her eyes got heavy and all she wanted to do was sleep.
So, the little girl stopped riding and got off the pink wheel. She decided to take a nap right next to the wheel, so she could take it with her when she woke up. She was snoring happily when suddenly the wind started blowing harder. The pink wheel started to move away and the little girl woke up in a shock.
She quickly got up and started running to get her wheel. But before she could reach it, the pink wheel stopped near a small pond. She was so lucky to find her wheel, so she picked it up and put it on again. She was so happy to have her wheel that she yawned with a big smile on her face.
