Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to eat tasty cookies. She always kept her favorite recipe in her notebook. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to bake some cookies for a party. Lily was so excited to bake her favorite cookies, so she got out her notebook and started to make the dough.
But as she was mixing the ingredients, she realized she had made a mistake. Instead of adding sugar, she had added salt. Lily tried to fix the dough, but it just didn't taste right. She knew she had to yield and tell her mommy what had happened.
At the party, everyone tried Lily's cookies. They all made a face and said they tasted funny. Lily felt so embarrassed and sad. She wished she had paid more attention to her notebook. From then on, Lily always double-checked her recipes and never made the same mistake again.
