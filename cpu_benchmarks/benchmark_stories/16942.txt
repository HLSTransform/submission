Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play outside in the sun. But today, the sky is dark and loud. They hear big booms and see bright flashes. They are scared of the storm.
They run inside the house and find Mom. Mom hugs them and says, "Don't worry, my loves. The storm will go away soon. It is just nature's way of making noise and light."
Lily and Ben sit on the couch with Mom. They stare at the window and watch the rain fall. They see the wind blow the trees and the flowers. They see the birds fly away and the squirrels hide.
Mom says, "Look, the storm is also lively. It makes everything move and change. It gives water to the plants and animals. It cleans the air and the ground. It is not so bad, is it?"
Lily and Ben nod. They feel better. They see the storm as a friend, not a foe. They smile and say, "Thank you, Mom. We love you. And we love the storm, too."
