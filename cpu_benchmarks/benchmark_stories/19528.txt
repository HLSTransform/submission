Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jane. She was three years old and very curious. One day she asked her mummy, "Where is the ocean?"
Her mummy smiled and said, "It's very far away!" So, Jane made a plan. She said, "Mummy, I want to see it!"
Her mummy said, "OK, let's go!" So, they both packed their bags and caught a boat. It was a long journey but soon they arrived at the ocean. It was so big and blue. Jane was amazed. She said, "Mummy, it's so beautiful!"
Then they went to the beach and Jane ran straight into the waves. She laughed and shouted, "It's so delicious!" She jumped around in the waves until she was all wet and then they went home. 
Jane will never forget the day she went to the ocean. It was the best day ever!
