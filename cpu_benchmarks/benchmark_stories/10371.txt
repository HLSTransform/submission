Tim was a big boy who liked to march. He marched in his room, he marched in the hall, he marched in the yard. He marched with his feet, he marched with his hands, he marched with his toys. He liked to make loud noises when he marched, like boom, boom, boom.
One day, Tim saw a large crib in his mom's room. He wondered what was inside. He marched to the crib and looked over the edge. He saw a small baby sleeping. He wanted to march with the baby. He climbed into the crib and started to march. He marched on the blanket, he marched on the pillow, he marched on the baby. He made loud noises, like boom, boom, boom.
The baby woke up and started to cry. Tim did not like the cry. He wanted the baby to march with him. He tried to make the baby march, but the baby did not want to. The baby cried louder and louder. Tim got angry and pushed the baby. The baby fell out of the crib and hit the floor. The baby did not move.
Tim's mom heard the cry and the thud. She ran to the room and saw the baby on the floor. She screamed and picked up the baby. She saw blood on the baby's head. She cried and called for help. She did not look at Tim.
Tim did not understand. He wanted to march with the baby. He did not mean to hurt the baby. He felt sad and scared. He climbed out of the crib and marched to his room. He marched with his feet, he marched with his hands, he marched with his toys. He made loud noises, like boom, boom, boom. But he did not feel happy. He felt alone.
