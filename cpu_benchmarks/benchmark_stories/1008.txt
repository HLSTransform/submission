Once there was a frog named Lulu. She wanted to go on an adventure. So Lulu jumped out of her pond and started to bounce down the trail.
Lulu saw a rabbit in the grass and hopped closer to take a look. She was confused - was he her friend or should she be scared? 
Then suddenly - hop, hop - a big frog appeared! "My name is Finny," he said with a smile. "Come play with me!" 
So, Lulu and Finny bounced around and down the trail, laughing and jumping and having lots of fun. 
Lulu was no longer confused, she was happy to have a friend and was excited to go on more adventures with Finny. They bounced off down the trail, into the sunset!
