Once upon a time, there were two friends named Tom and Sally. Tom loved exploring and Sally preferred to stay home and read books. But they were always together and they were very reliable friends. 
One day, they were walking along a river and Tom found a big boat. “Let’s go for a ride!” he shouted. 
Sally shook her head. “No way, it looks too dangerous.”
But Tom was not persuaded by her. “Come on! We’ll keep each other safe.”
Sally sighed and reluctantly agreed. Eventually, they both climbed inside the boat. 
But before either of them noticed, the boat had started to part from the shore. They soon realized that they were drifting down the river and away from their home.
Tom and Sally both tried to escape as fast as they could. But they were too small to push the boat back. 
Just then, they heard the sound of an engine. They looked up and saw a reliable boat coming their way. Tom waved to the boat and it came to their rescue. 
The reliable boat pulled them back to the shore. Tom and Sally were so happy they were back safe, and thanked their rescuer.
