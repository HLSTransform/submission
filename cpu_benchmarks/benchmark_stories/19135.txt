Once upon a time, there was a dog named Spot. Spot was a big and brown dog with a wagging tail. One day, Spot found a bone in the park. The bone was very big and Spot was very happy. He took the bone in his mouth and ran back home. 
When Spot got home, he saw that his bone was filthy. It was covered in dirt and mud. Spot didn't like his bone to be dirty, so he decided to clean it. He licked the bone with his tongue and rubbed it with his paws. After a while, the bone was clean and shiny.
Spot was so happy with his clean bone that he wanted to show it to his owner. He ran to his owner and barked happily. His owner saw the clean bone and clapped for Spot. Spot was very proud of himself and he wagged his tail happily. From that day on, Spot always kept his bone clean and shiny.
