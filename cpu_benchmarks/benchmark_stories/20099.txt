Lily and Sam were best friends in their classroom. They liked to play with the blocks, the dolls and the books. But they did not like the nosy boy named Ben. Ben always wanted to see what they were doing and take their things.
One day, Lily and Sam found a big box in the corner of the classroom. They wondered what was inside. They opened the box and saw many colorful balls. They were very happy and started to play with the balls. They threw them, rolled them and bounced them.
But Ben saw them and came over. He wanted to play with the balls too. He reached for a ball that Lily was holding. Lily did not want to share. She said, "No, Ben, this is my ball. Go away!"
Ben did not listen. He tried to pull the ball from Lily's hand. Lily pulled back. They both pulled hard. The ball flew out of their hands and hit the teacher on the head. The teacher was very angry. She said, "Lily and Ben, what are you doing? You are not supposed to play with these balls. They are for the gym. And you are not supposed to pull and fight. You need to share and be nice."
Lily and Ben felt very sorry. They said, "We are sorry, teacher. We did not know. We will not do it again." The teacher took the balls and put them back in the box. She told Lily and Ben to sit down and calm down. Lily and Sam did not want to play with Ben anymore. They decided to play with the puzzles instead. They hoped Ben would not be nosy again.
