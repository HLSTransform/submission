Once upon a time, there was a chubby little dog named Fido. He was out for a walk with his owners when he found something exciting! He saw a big grill in the park and wanted to take a closer look.
"Fido," his owners said, "Wait for us. We need to make sure it's safe for you."
Fido could hardly contain himself as he stepped slowly towards the grill. He was so curious and he wanted to know what it was.
When he got closer, he could see there was something inside. It looked delicious! He started to bark and wag his tail.
"It's okay Fido," said his owners, laughing. "It's just mommy's dinner. Let's step away and leave it there, okay?"
Fido couldn't believe it! He scratched his head in disappointment, but he did as he was told.
"Good boy," his owners said, patting his chubby head. "Come on, let's go get a nice treat for you instead."
Fido happily followed his owners away from the forbidden grill and towards something much more delicious.
