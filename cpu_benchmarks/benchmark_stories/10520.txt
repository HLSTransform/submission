Once upon a time, there were two best friends. They were called Thomas and Ben. They lived in a very big house with lots of rooms.
One day, Thomas and Ben decided to play a fun game. They wanted to dress up like grown-ups. Thomas found a really cool suit and Ben found a funny hat.
Thomas was very careful as he put on the suit. It was big, but he worked hard and he was soon all dressed up. Then, they both had to rush to the mirror to see how they looked. Thomas and Ben laughed and laughed and laughed. They made funny faces and pretended to be grown-ups.
Thomas and Ben had a great time playing their game. They were so careful to keep their suits neat and tidy. Thomas and Ben were the best of friends and they had so much fun.
