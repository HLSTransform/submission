Once upon a time, in a gloomy forest, a little lizard lived. The lizard was sad because he had no friends. He would walk around the forest, hoping to find someone to play with.
One sunny day, the lizard met a big frog. The frog said, "Hi, little lizard! Do you want to play with me?" The lizard was so happy that he said, "Yes, I would love to play with you!"
From that day on, the lizard and the frog became best friends. They played together every day, and the gloomy forest became a happy place for them. And the little lizard was never sad again.
