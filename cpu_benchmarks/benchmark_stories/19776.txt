Once upon a time there was a little girl called Anna. Anna was only three years old and she liked to cook.
One day, Anna decided to make a tunnel cake. She put some yummy ingredients together and mixed them together. Then she put the mixture into a baking tin and put it into the oven.
When the cake was ready, Anna took it out of the oven and looked at it. She was so excited to eat it. But when she opened the tin she was very frightened. The cake had gone very deep and something had made a big tunnel inside of it.
Anna didn't know what had made the tunnel, but she decided to eat the cake anyway. And it was yummy! Anna never knew what made the tunnel but it was a lovely surprise.
