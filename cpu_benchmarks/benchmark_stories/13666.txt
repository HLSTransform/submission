Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to slide, swing and climb. They saw some new equipment near the fence. It looked like a big board with many colors.
"Let's go and mark on it!" Lily said. She ran to the equipment and picked up a crayon.
Ben followed her. He wanted to mark too. He grabbed a marker.
They started to mark on the board. They made circles, lines and stars. They used all the colors they could find.
"Look, we made a beautiful picture!" Lily said. She was happy.
But then, a man came out of a small house next to the fence. He looked angry. He shouted at them.
"Hey, you two! What are you doing? This is not a board, this is a map! You ruined it with your marks! This is very bad!"
Lily and Ben were scared. They did not know what a map was. They did not know they did something wrong. They were confused.
They dropped their crayons and markers and ran away. They did not want to play in the park anymore. They wanted to go home and hide. They felt sad and sorry. They wished they never saw the equipment.
