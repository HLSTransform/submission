Once upon a time, there was a little car named Zip. Zip was a red car who loved to go zoom down the road. He liked to race with his best friend, a blue car named Zoom.
One day, Zip and Zoom were racing down the street. They were having so much fun! But then, they saw a big, terrible hole in the road. They did not want to fall into the hole, so they stopped very fast.
Zip and Zoom decided to tell their friends about the terrible hole. They all worked together to fix the hole in the road. Now, Zip and Zoom could race again and have fun with their friends. And they all lived happily ever after.
