Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy lived in a big city with his mommy and daddy. One day, Timmy and his mommy went for a walk in the park. It was a rainy day and everything was wet. 
Timmy saw a big puddle and he wanted to jump in it. "Mommy, can I jump in the puddle?" he asked. "No, Timmy. You will get all wet," mommy replied. 
Suddenly, Timmy saw a frog jumping in the puddle. "Look, mommy! A frog! Can we catch it?" Timmy asked. "No, Timmy. We can't catch the frog. It's better if we just watch it," mommy said. 
Timmy was sad that he couldn't catch the frog, but he was happy to see it jumping in the puddle. They continued their walk in the park and Timmy was excited to see what else they could find.
