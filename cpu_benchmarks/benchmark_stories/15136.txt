Once upon a time there was a family who had a little boy. His mummy and daddy wanted to teach him about the world, so one day they decided to take him for a walk. As they walked, they passed by a strange building made of metal. The little boy turned to his mummy and asked, "What's that?". His mummy replied, "That's an old factory". The little boy wasn't sure what a factory was, so his daddy then explained, "That's a place where people raise things to make them better".
As they walked, the little boy saw something bad. It was a big pile of waste and rubbish. His daddy said, "This is why factories are bad. They can make the environment dirty". The little boy was sad so he asked, "Can we do something to make it better?". His mummy smiled and said, "Yes! We can take some metal and help to raise it back up".
So, the little boy and his family gathered some metal and started to raise the factory back up. Little by little, it started to look better. In the end, the factory was as good as new! The little boy was so happy that he had done something to help the environment. From then on, he always knew the importance of raising things up to make them better.
