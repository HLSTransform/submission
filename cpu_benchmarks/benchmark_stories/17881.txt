Once there was a little boy named Jack. He was so excited because his mommy was going to show him something special. She lifted him up and carried him over to a big machine. It was yellow, shiny and very organized. 
Jack was so curious. He looked at the machine and saw that it had lots of buttons. His mommy told him that it was a special carrying machine. She said it could carry him anywhere he wanted to go. 
Jack was amazed. He imagined himself flying around like an eagle. He pushed the buttons and the machine began to move. Suddenly, he was soaring through the air. Later, when he was done, his mommy carried him back safely to the ground. 
Jack was so happy. He couldn't wait to use the machine again. Mommy smiled and said that if he was a good boy she would let him use it whenever he wanted. Jack smiled and gave his mommy a big hug!
