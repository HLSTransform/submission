Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big fountain with water that went up and down. They ran to the fountain and put their hands in the water. It was cold and wet.
"Look, Lily, look!" Tom said. "The water makes mist. Can you see the mist?"
Lily looked up and saw the mist. It was like a thin cloud that floated in the air. She smiled and said, "Yes, I see the mist. It is pretty. Can we touch the mist?"
They tried to touch the mist, but it was too high. They jumped and stretched, but they could not reach the mist. They laughed and said, "The mist is too fast. We cannot catch the mist."
A man was watching them from a bench. He had a big hat and a big coat. He liked to see the children play. He clapped his hands and said, "Bravo, bravo! You are very good at jumping. You make me happy."
Lily and Tom heard the man and turned around. They saw him applaud. They did not know what applaud meant, but they saw he was happy. They smiled and said, "Thank you, thank you! You are very nice. Do you want to play with us?"
The man nodded and said, "Yes, I want to play with you. But first, let me give you something. I have a surprise for you in my coat."
He reached into his coat and pulled out two balloons. One was red and one was blue. He gave the red balloon to Lily and the blue balloon to Tom. They were very happy and said, "Wow, wow! Balloons! We love balloons!"
They took the balloons and ran to the fountain. They held the balloons high and tried to touch the mist. The mist made the balloons shiny and wet. They laughed and said, "Look, look! The mist likes the balloons. The balloons like the mist."
The man watched them and smiled. He was glad he gave them the balloons. He thought they were very good children. He did not see the bad dog that was coming from behind. The bad dog saw the balloons and wanted to pop them. He ran to the children and barked. He jumped and bit the balloons. The balloons popped and made a loud noise. The children screamed and cried. The man shouted and ran to the children. He scared the bad dog away. He hugged the children and said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The bad dog was very mean. He popped your balloons. Are you okay?"
Lily and Tom were very sad. They lost their balloons. They said, "No, no. We are not okay. The bad dog was very bad. He popped our balloons. We liked our balloons. We want our balloons back."
The man felt very sorry. He said, "I know, I know. The bad dog was very bad. He popped your balloons. You liked your balloons. But I cannot give you your balloons back. They are gone. But I can give you something else. I have another surprise for you in my hat."
He took off his hat and showed them what was inside. It was a big cake with frosting and candles. He said, "Look, look! A cake! A cake for you! I made it for you. It is your special day. Happy birthday, Lily and Tom!"
Lily and Tom were very surprised. They did not know it was their birthday. They said, "A cake? A cake for us? You made it for us? It is our birthday? Happy birthday, Lily and Tom!"
They forgot about the bad dog and the balloons. They saw the cake and smiled. They said, "Wow, wow! A cake! A cake for us! You made it for us! It is our birthday! Thank you, thank you! You are very nice. You are our friend."
They blew the candles and made a wish. They wished for more balloons and more mist and more fun. They ate the cake and shared it with the man. They said, "The cake is very good. You are very good. We are very happy."
The man was very happy too. He said, "You are very welcome. You are very good. I am very happy."
They hugged and kissed and said, "We love you. You love us. We are a happy family."
They played and sang and danced. They saw the mist and the fountain and the sun. They did not see the bad dog that was hiding behind a tree. He was very angry and jealous. He said, "Grrr, grrr. I hate them. I hate them. They have a cake. They have a friend. They are happy. I want to make them sad
