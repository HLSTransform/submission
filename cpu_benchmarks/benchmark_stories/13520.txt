Once upon a time, there was a peaceful port where boats would come and go. The people who lived there were happy and kind. But one day, a mean pirate came to the port. He wanted to destroy everything and take all the treasure. 
The people of the port tried to stop the pirate, but he was too strong. He destroyed all the boats and took all the treasure. The people were sad and scared. 
The moral of the story is that we should always try to be kind and help others, even when itâ€™s hard. And we should never let mean people destroy what we love.
