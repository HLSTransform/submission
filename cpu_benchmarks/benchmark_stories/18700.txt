Once upon a time, there was a big party. Lots of kids came to play and eat. The mom had meat for everyone to try. She cut it into small parts so everyone could have some. 
The kids were very happy and organized themselves into groups to play games. They played hide and seek, tag, and duck, duck, goose. When it was time to eat, they sat down at the table and the mom gave them each a part of meat. 
After they ate, the kids played some more until it was time to go home. They all said goodbye and thanked the mom for the yummy meat. They had a great time at the party and couldn't wait for the next one. The end.
