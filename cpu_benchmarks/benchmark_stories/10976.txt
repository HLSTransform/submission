Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toys. One day, he went to the park with his mom. He took his toy equipment with him. He had a toy car, a ball, and a shovel.
At the park, Tim saw a deep hole. He wanted to play in the hole. So, he took his shovel and started to dig. As he dug, he met a little girl named Sue. Sue wanted to play too. Tim said, "Let's play together!"
Sue looked at the deep hole and said, "Okay, but we need to be careful." Tim's mom watched them play and reminded them, "Don't go too deep, kids!" Tim and Sue played with the equipment and had lots of fun. They were very happy to make a new friend.
