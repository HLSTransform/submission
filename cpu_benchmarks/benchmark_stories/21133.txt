Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Daisy. Daisy loved to dream. Every night, she would sleep and dream about big bones and fun toys. One night, Daisy heard a strange sound while she was dreaming. It was a loud "BOOM!" Daisy woke up and felt worried.
Daisy went to her friend, the cat named Whiskers. "Whiskers, I heard a loud sound in my dream. It made me worried," said Daisy. Whiskers looked at Daisy and said, "Don't be worried, Daisy. It was just a big truck outside. It's gone now."
Daisy felt better after talking to Whiskers. That night, Daisy went back to sleep and had a new dream. This time, she dreamed about playing with Whiskers in a big, sunny park. They ran and played all day long. Daisy wasn't worried anymore. She was happy and safe with her friend, Whiskers.
