Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a pet fish named Nemo. Nemo was a very dependable fish, he always swam around his bowl and never made a mess.
One day, Timmy's mom asked him to shut the door to his room. Timmy forgot to shut the door and Nemo jumped out of his bowl! Timmy quickly picked up Nemo and put him back in the bowl. But, the bowl had a small crack and water was leaking out!
Timmy's mom came in and saw the water on the floor. She quickly grabbed some tape and sealed the crack. Timmy was so happy that Nemo was safe and sound in his dependable bowl. From that day on, Timmy always remembered to shut his door and take good care of his fish. The end.
