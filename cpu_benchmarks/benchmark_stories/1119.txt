Once there was a mommy and daddy who wanted to go on a vacation. They talked about it and decided to go. But the mommy was very weak because she was sick. So the daddy said that he would go on the vacation alone.
Before the vacation, mommy and daddy talked about it again. The mommy was feeling better but the daddy said that she should stay home and take care of herself. So the daddy went to the vacation all by himself.
The daddy had lots of fun on his vacation. Every day he would talk to his friends on the phone and tell them all about it. When the daddy came home he was very happy and he told the mommy all about what had happened on his vacation.
The mommy was very happy to hear about the vacation and she was glad the daddy had so much fun. They both agreed that when mommy was feeling better they would go on a vacation together.
