Once upon a time there was a messy room. No one wanted to go in the messy room. It was too scary and no one felt like they belonged there. 
One day two friends, Sammy and Jack, were playing outside in the garden. Jack saw something look funny in the messy room. He asked Sammy if he wanted to go in and have a look. Sammy was scared but Jack said that it would be safe.
So the two friends went into the messy room. Suddenly, a bunny hopped out from under the bed! Sammy and Jack laughed and ran after it, feeling like they belonged in the messy room at last. 
The bunny was having so much fun that it made the messy room look a little bit better. Sammy and Jack laughed and played all day until it was time for them to go home. 
The bunny stayed in the messy room, feeling like it belonged there too. From then on, Sammy and Jack made sure to visit the bunny and the messy room often.
