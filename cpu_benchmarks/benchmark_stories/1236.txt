Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, Lily saw a new boy sitting alone on a bench. She walked up to him and said, "Hi! My name is Lily. Welcome to our park!"
The new boy smiled and said his name was Max. Lily and Max quickly became friends and played together every day. One day, while they were playing, they saw two other kids fighting. Lily and Max went over to them and said, "Stop fighting! Let's all be friends and have peace."
The other kids stopped fighting and apologized. Lily and Max were happy they could help make peace. Later that day, Lily's mom told her that being kind and helping others is hard, but it's always worth it. Lily smiled and thought about how happy she was to have made a new friend and helped bring peace to the park.
