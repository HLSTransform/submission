Lily and Tom were playing with paper. They cut and folded the paper to make animals and hats. They had fun and laughed a lot.
But then Mom came and said, "It's time to go, kids. We have to visit Grandma today." Lily and Tom did not want to go. They wanted to play more.
"Can we delay, Mom?" Lily asked. "Just a little bit?"
"No, we can't," Mom said. "Grandma is waiting for us. She made a cake for us. We have to be nice and not rude."
"But we are not rude, Mom," Tom said. "We just like paper. Paper is fun."
Mom sighed. She knew they liked paper, but they had to learn to respect other people's time. She said, "I know, paper is fun. But you can play with paper later. Now, put on your shoes and coats and get in the car. We have to go."
Lily and Tom were sad. They did not want to leave their paper. But they did what Mom said. They put on their shoes and coats and got in the car. They hoped Grandma would let them play with paper too.
