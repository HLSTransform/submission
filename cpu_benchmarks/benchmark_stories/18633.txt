Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy tanks. He would make them drive around his room and pretend they were in a big battle. 
One day, Timmy's friend came over to play. His friend had a big, fancy tank that could shoot little balls. Timmy's tank was much smaller and more modest. 
Timmy felt a little sad that his tank wasn't as cool as his friend's. But then he remembered that it didn't matter how big or fancy his tank was. He loved his little tank because he had made it himself. 
So Timmy and his friend had a big tank battle, and even though Timmy's tank was smaller, it was still a lot of fun to play with. Timmy realized that sometimes the things we make ourselves are the most special. The end.
