One day, a small red ball was very angry. It did not want to stay in the toy box today. The ball decided to roll out of the box and find a friend to play with.
As the ball rolled, it saw a big brown dog. The ball said, "Hi, dog! Can you play with me today?" The dog wagged its tail and said, "Yes, I can play with you!"
The red ball and the big brown dog played all day. They rolled in the grass and had lots of fun. The angry ball was not angry anymore. It was happy to have a new friend to play with.
