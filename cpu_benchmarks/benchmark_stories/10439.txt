Once there was a brown bear with big feet. He was walking through the woods looking for something. Suddenly he saw a tree full of delicious apples. He was so happy he started to eat one. As he reached in the tree, some of the apples started to yield and fall towards the ground. He quickly bent down and started to pick up the fallen apples. As he ate them, he tasted their sweet juiciness and felt so content. 
He enjoyed picking up the apples and eating them so much that he ended up spending the whole day there. It was so much fun to pick the apples that he ran around trying to get as much as he could. It was the best day ever!
