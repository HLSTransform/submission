Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved playing with his toys and running around outside. One day, he went to the park to play with his friends. 
When he got there, he saw his friend Johnny playing with a toy that Timmy really wanted to play with. Timmy asked Johnny if he could play with the toy, but Johnny said no. Timmy felt sad and didn't know what to do. 
Then, another friend named Sarah came over and offered Timmy her toy to play with. Timmy was happy and thanked Sarah for being so kind. He played with Sarah's toy for a while, but then saw Johnny playing with another toy that he wanted to play with. 
This time, Timmy didn't know what to do. He didn't want to ask Johnny again and get turned down. But then, Sarah pointed out a toy that Timmy hadn't noticed before. It was a cool toy that he had never played with before. Timmy was excited and thanked Sarah again. 
Later, Timmy found out that the toy Johnny was playing with was actually broken and couldn't be played with anymore. Timmy was glad he didn't ask again and was happy with the toy Sarah had offered him instead.
