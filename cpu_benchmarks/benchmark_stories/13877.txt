Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was an adventurous girl who loved to explore. One day, she went to a big park with her mom.
As Lily was playing, she saw a boy named Tim. Tim was sad. Lily asked, "Why are you sad?" Tim said, "I have a big exam at school tomorrow, and I don't know if I can do it."
Lily wanted to help Tim. They sat under a tree and gazed at the sky. "Look at the clouds," Lily said. "They change and move, just like our thoughts. If you believe you can do it, you can pass your exam."
Tim felt better after talking to Lily. They played and laughed until it was time to go home. The next day, Tim took his exam and did well. He was happy and knew that Lily's words had helped him.
