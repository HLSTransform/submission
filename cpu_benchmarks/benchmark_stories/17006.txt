Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in the garden. They have a big box. They pretend it is a house. They draw windows and a door on the box.
One day, they see a post in the garden. It is brown and long. It has a red flag on top. Sara says, "Look, Ben, a post! Maybe it has a letter for us!" Ben says, "Let's go and see!" They run to the post.
They open the post. It has a letter for them. It is from Grandma. They love Grandma. She lives far away. She sends them gifts and sweets. They open the letter. It says, "Dear Sara and Ben, I miss you very much. I hope you are happy and healthy. I have a surprise for you. I made you some cookies. They are in the post. They are yummy. Enjoy them. Love, Grandma."
Sara and Ben are very happy. They love cookies. They look in the post. They see a bag. It has cookies in it. They smell good. They take one each. They say, "Thank you, Grandma!" They bite the cookies.
But the cookies are not yummy. They are yucky. They taste bad. They taste like dirt and worms. Sara and Ben spit out the cookies. They make a face. They say, "Ew, ew, ew!" They feel sick. They feel sad.
They look at the letter again. They see something they did not see before. It says, "P.S. April Fools!" They do not know what that means. They do not think it is funny. They think Grandma is mean. They cry. They do not want to play anymore. They go inside the box. They close the door. They do not want to see the post ever again.
