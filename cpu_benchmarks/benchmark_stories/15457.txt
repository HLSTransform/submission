Ferdie was sitting in his chair. He felt a mosquito on his arm. It was uncomfortable. He tried to swat it away but it kept coming back. He tried moving around but it didn't work. Suddenly, Ferdie had an idea. He put on his hat and the mosquito flew away. Ferdie smiled. He felt relieved to be free of the uncomfortable mosquito. From then on, Ferdie always put on his hat when he went outside to keep all the mosquitoes away.
