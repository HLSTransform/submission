Once upon a time, there was a mother and her three year old daughter. One day, the daughter had a problem she was facing. She didn't know what to do and was very worried. 
The mother told her, "I will support you and make the case easy for you."
The little girl listened to her mother and followed her directions. She soon found the problem easier to solve. 
We all need support from our family and friends to make things easier. We should never be afraid to ask for help whenever we have a problem. This is the moral value of this story.
