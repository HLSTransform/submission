Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside on her porch. One day, Lily was holding her favorite toy, a big red ball. Suddenly, she accidentally dropped the ball and it rolled away.
Lily was sad because she loved her ball so much. But then, her good friend Timmy came over to play. Timmy saw that Lily was sad and asked her what was wrong. Lily told Timmy that she dropped her ball and it rolled away.
Timmy was a good friend and wanted to help. He looked all around the porch and finally found the ball hiding under a chair. Lily was so happy and thanked Timmy for helping her find her ball. From then on, Lily made sure to hold her ball tight so she wouldn't drop it again.
