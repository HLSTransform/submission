Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and he had a big toy box where he put them all. One day, Timmy's mom told him that they were going to clean the house. Timmy didn't like cleaning, but he knew it was important to help his mom.
While they were cleaning, Timmy's mom told him a story about a big war that happened long ago. She said that people fought with each other and it was very scary. Timmy didn't like the sound of that, but he listened carefully to his mom's story.
After they finished cleaning, Timmy was very tired. He went to his toy box and put all his toys away. As he was putting them away, he thought about his mom's story and how he didn't want to fight with anyone. Timmy decided that he would always try to keep things clean and peaceful, just like his toy box.
