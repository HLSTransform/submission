Oliver was grumpy. He wanted to go for a drive, but his mom said no.
"Mom," asked Oliver, "can I drive the car to the planet?"
His mom sighed. "No, Oliver. You're not big enough to drive a car."
"But I'm grumpy," he said.
"I know you are," she said. "But you can't drive to the planet. That's too far away."
"OK," he said. He thought for a minute. "Mom, can I drive my toy truck to the park?"
His mom smiled. "That's a great idea. Let's go!"
So Oliver drove his toy truck to the park with his mom. He drove around and around and had a lot of fun. When they were finished, they drove home and Oliver was happy again.
