Ben and Jen are twins. They like to play in the garden. They find a big bag of beans. They want to know how many beans are in the bag.
"Let's weigh the bag," Ben says. He finds a scale in the shed. He puts the bag on the scale. The scale says ten.
"Wow, that's a lot of beans," Jen says. She wants to see the beans. She opens the bag. The beans are dry and hard. She picks one up and throws it in the air.
"Look, Ben, I can make the beans fly," she says. She throws more beans. Ben laughs and joins her. They throw beans all over the garden.
But they do not see the dog. The dog is hungry. He smells the beans. He runs to the garden. He sees the beans flying. He thinks they are food. He jumps and catches the beans in his mouth.
"Hey, stop that, dog," Ben shouts. He tries to get the bag back. But the dog is stronger. He bites the bag and tears it open. He eats all the beans.
Ben and Jen are sad. They have no more beans. They have no more fun. They cry and go inside. The dog is sick. He ate too many beans. He feels bad and throws up. The garden is a mess. The end.
