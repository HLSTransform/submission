Lily liked to make things with thread. She had many colors of thread in her box. She made bracelets, necklaces, and flowers with thread. She gave them to her friends and family.
One day, she found a shiny thread in her box. It was silver and sparkled in the sun. Lily thought it was very pretty. She wanted to make something special with it. She decided to make a star with the shiny thread.
She cut a piece of the shiny thread and bent it into a star shape. She used tape to keep the ends together. She was very happy with her star. She hung it on her window with a string. She wanted to see it shine every day.
But the next day, when she woke up, she saw that her star was gone. She looked around her room, but she could not find it. She was very sad. She asked her mom, "Mom, where is my star?"
Her mom said, "I'm sorry, Lily, but your star was bad. It was not a real thread. It was a wire. It was sharp and dangerous. It could have hurt you or someone else. I had to throw it away."
Lily felt angry and confused. She did not understand why her star was bad. She liked it very much. She said, "But mom, it was so shiny and pretty. I made it with love. Why did you throw it away?"
Her mom hugged her and said, "I know, Lily, I know. But sometimes, things that look shiny and pretty are not good for us. They can trick us and hurt us. You have to be careful with what you find and what you make. You have many other threads that are safe and beautiful. You can make another star with them. I will help you if you want."
Lily nodded and wiped her tears. She still missed her shiny star, but she understood that her mom was right. She went to her box and picked a yellow thread. She said, "Mom, can we make a sun with this thread? It is also shiny and pretty, but it is not bad."
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, Lily, we can. A sun is a wonderful idea. It will shine every day and make you happy. Let's make a sun with this thread."
