Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to run, jump and slide. They saw a big hill with many rocks. They wanted to climb it.
"Let's go up there!" Tom said.
"OK, but be careful!" Lily said.
They started to climb the hill. They saw many different rocks. Some were round, some were sharp, some were shiny, some were dull. They picked up some rocks and put them in their pockets.
When they reached the top of the hill, they saw something very bright. It was a big rock that looked like a star. It had many colors and sparkles. It was a diamond.
"Wow, look at that!" Lily said.
"It's so pretty!" Tom said.
They ran to the diamond. They wanted to touch it. But when they got closer, they heard a loud noise. It was a roar. It came from behind the diamond.
They turned around and saw a big animal. It had wings, scales, claws and teeth. It was a dragon. It was guarding the diamond. It was angry that the children came near it.
"Go away!" the dragon said.
Tom and Lily were scared. They dropped their rocks and ran down the hill. They did not look back. They did not want to see the dragon again.
They reached the bottom of the hill and ran to their mom. She was sitting on a bench. She saw them and smiled.
"Did you have fun?" she asked.
"Yes, but we saw something very mysterious!" Tom said.
"What was it?" she asked.
Tom and Lily looked at each other. They did not know if they should tell her. They did not know if she would believe them.
They decided to keep it a secret. They only said, "It was a big rock that looked like a star. It was a diamond."
Mom nodded and hugged them. She did not know about the dragon. She did not know about the roar. She did not know about the danger.
She only knew that her children were happy and safe. She was happy too.
