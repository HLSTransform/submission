Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play at the beach and build sandcastles. One day, Timmy and his mom went on a boat ride. Timmy saw a big anchor on the boat and thought it was really cool.
As they sailed, Timmy's mom noticed that the boat was moving too fast. She told the captain to slow down, but he didn't listen. Suddenly, they hit a rock and the boat started to sink. Timmy was scared and didn't know what to do.
But then, he realized something. He remembered seeing the anchor earlier and knew that it could help them. He told his mom and they quickly grabbed the anchor and threw it overboard. The anchor stopped the boat from sinking and they were saved!
Timmy learned that even though he was small, he could do something important and save the day. The moral of the story is that everyone can be a hero, no matter how big or small they are.
