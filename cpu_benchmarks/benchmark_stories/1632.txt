One day, a young boy named Tom went to the park with his mom. He saw a big slide and wanted to go on it. But there was an old man sitting on the slide. He looked sad and angry.
"Mom, can I go on the slide?" Tom asked.
"Sure, honey, but you have to ask the man nicely if he can move," Mom said.
Tom walked up to the man and said, "Hello, sir. Can I please go on the slide?"
The man did not answer. He just frowned and looked away.
Tom felt bad. He wondered why the man was so unhappy. He decided to try again.
"Sir, I'm sorry if you are sad. Do you want to talk to me?" Tom said.
The man looked at Tom with surprise. He saw that Tom was not mean or rude. He saw that Tom was kind and curious.
The man smiled a little and said, "Well, hello, young man. You are very polite. I'm sorry I was rude to you. I'm just feeling lonely and bored. I used to love going on the slide when I was your age, but now I can't."
Tom felt sorry for the man. He had an idea.
"Why don't you go on the slide with me?" Tom said. "It will be fun. I can help you."
The man thought for a moment. He felt a spark of joy in his heart. He nodded and said, "Okay, why not? Let's go on the slide together."
Tom and the man got up and climbed the stairs to the top of the slide. Tom held the man's hand and said, "Ready, set, go!"
They slid down the slide, laughing and screaming. They felt the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They felt happy and free.
Mom watched them from the bench. She smiled and thought, "What a wonderful thing. A young boy and an old man became friends on the slide."
