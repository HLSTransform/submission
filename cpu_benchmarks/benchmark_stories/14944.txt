Once upon a time there was a naughty boy. He did horrible things, like sticking his fingers in other people's food. It was disgusting. 
One day, the naughty boy was looking inside his mother's folder. What he saw made him freeze in shock! But he kept looking, despite knowing he shouldn't. Suddenly, his mother caught him looking inside the folder. She was so mad at him that she sent him to his room without any food. 
The naughty boy was really hungry, but he did not dare to leave his room. He was too afraid his mother would scold him again. 
The naughty boy had a bad ending - he was too scared to ever leave his room again!
