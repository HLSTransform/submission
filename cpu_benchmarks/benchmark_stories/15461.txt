One day, Lucy and her mommy went to visit a lab. They saw lots of funny things there. Lucy saw beakers filled with different coloured liquids and she saw scientists wearing white coats. They were all busy looking through big books.
Lucy watched as the scientists worked hard. One scientist was mixing special potion in a bowl. He even sang as he worked. Lucy thought his singing was funny.
Then Lucy and her mommy went to see another part of the lab. It was filled with all sorts of cool toys and materials, and there was even a big, white desk. The scientists here were really creative. They made robots, puzzles and cool contraptions. 
At the end of the visit, Lucy and her mommy said goodbye to the scientists. They thanked them for showing them around the lab. Lucy was sad to leave but excited to come back and visit soon.
