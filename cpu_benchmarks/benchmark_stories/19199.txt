Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to watch television every day. She sat in front of the television for hours and hours until her mommy told her to stop. 
One day, Lily's mommy told her to go outside and play. But Lily didn't want to. She wanted to watch television. "Please, mommy, can I watch just one more show?" she begged. 
Her mommy said no and told her to go outside. Lily was so sad. She sat outside for a little while but then she got bored. She tried to go back inside but the door was locked. She banged on the door and shouted for her mommy, but no one came. 
Lily started to feel dizzy and tired. She tried to remain standing, but she fell down and hit her head. She was all alone and no one came to help her. The end.
