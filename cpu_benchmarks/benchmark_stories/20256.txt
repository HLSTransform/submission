Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a wide smile and loved to draw. One day, she drew a big, happy sun. She was very proud of her image.
Lily wanted to show her new friend, Ben, her drawing. So, she went to his house to introduce her sun to him. Ben saw the image and smiled wide too. He thought the sun was very pretty.
Ben asked Lily if they could draw together. They sat down and drew many more images. They made a wide sky full of stars and a big, green tree. Lily and Ben had lots of fun drawing together.
