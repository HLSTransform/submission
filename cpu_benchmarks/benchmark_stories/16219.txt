John was playing with his toys outside on the lawn. His mom watched from the kitchen window with a smile. Suddenly, something disturbed John. He heard a loud noise coming from behind the fence.
John walked closer to the fence and said, “Who’s there?”
He looked over the fence and saw a rough line that was drawn in the dirt.
“What’s this?” asked John.
A voice from behind the fence replied, “That’s my line. I’m not allowed to cross it.”
John said, “That’s not nice. You need to play with me. Come over and play!”
The voice said, “Okay. I can come over, but I have to stay on this side of the line. We can have lots of fun, okay?”
John smiled and said, “Okay!” 
The two kids played together, having lots of fun, while staying on their own side of the rough line.
