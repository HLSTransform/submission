Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mia. Mia had an adventurous spirit and enjoyed exploring. Whenever Mia found something new she would wonder about it.
One day, Mia was walking in the woods and noticed a big tree. It was so tall that Mia couldn't even measure it. "Wow," she said, "how could this tree be so big?"
Mia asked a friendly bird sitting nearby, "How tall is this tree?" The bird replied, "The bossy butterfly says it is forty feet tall but I think it's even more."
Mia was surprised and looked around for the bossy butterfly. Soon enough, she spotted a colorful butterfly sitting nearby. She noticed the butterfly was very bossy and looked like it was in charge.
Mia thanked the bird for the information and kept exploring. As she was walking, she continued to wonder about the giant tree.
