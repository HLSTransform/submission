There was a girl named Lucy. She loved to peek into places and didn't want to wear her blouse. Lucy was so excited to look around. She peered into a room and saw something unexpected. 
A grown-up man was inside the room. He wore a red cape and looked very serious. Lucy was a little bit afraid, but she still wanted to peek. Suddenly, the man saw her and said something in an angry voice. Lucy was so scared that she ran away really fast. 
The man was ignorant of Lucy's presence and did not understand why she ran away. He sighed and sat in his chair to take a nap. 
Lucy was relieved that she didn't have to wear her blouse. The grown-up man never saw her again, but she always remembered the like-in-the-room adventure.
