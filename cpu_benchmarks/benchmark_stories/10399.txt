Once upon a time, there was a small puppy named Hugo who wanted to explore the world. One day, Hugo decided to take a walk in the park. As Hugo was walking along, he stumbled upon a goose. The goose was quite polite and said hello to Hugo. Hugo was so excited to have made a new friend and smiled back.
The two new friends decided to play hide-n-seek together. Hugo counted while the goose ran off to hide. Hugo looked everywhere but couldn't find his new friend! Finally, Hugo found the goose behind a big tree and shouted "found you!"
The goose was so happy and thanked Hugo for being polite and not giving up. Hugo realized that being polite was very important and even when things get difficult, he should never give up and be kind.
The two friends had so much fun and when the sun began to set they said goodbye - the small puppy and the new goose.
