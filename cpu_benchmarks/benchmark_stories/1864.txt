John was playing in the park. He loved to play and explore. Suddenly he heard sirens in the distance. He looked up to see a big truck driving quickly toward him. It was the police.
The police entered the park. They were wearing blue uniforms. John watched them with wide eyes. They stopped and started to talk to some of the other people in the park.
John was a little scared. He had heard adults talk about the police before and he was not sure what they were doing. Should he stay and watch, or should he run away? He decided to stay and watch, but he stayed back a little, just in case.
The police were talking to the adults for a long time. John could see that some of the adults were upset. He could hear the police talking about something, but he couldn't understand what they were saying. He was starting to feel a bit better when one of the police spoke loudly and said something about an ignorant person.
John started to feel scared again. What did ignorant mean? He decided it was best to leave the park. He quickly went home without looking back. The next day he asked his mom what "ignorant" meant. She told him it meant someone who didn't know something.
John was relieved. He would never forget the policemen and their visit to the park. He had learned an important lesson: It is important to be careful and to learn things.
