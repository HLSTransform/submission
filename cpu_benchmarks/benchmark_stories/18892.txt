Sara liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Lily. Lily had long hair, a pink dress, and a friendly smile. Sara took Lily everywhere she went.
One day, Sara and Lily went to the park with Mom. It was a sunny day, and Sara and Lily had fun on the swings, the slide, and the sandbox. Sara made a big castle with sand and put Lily on top of it. She was very proud of her castle.
But then, the sky turned dark and cloudy. Sara heard a loud noise. It was thunder. She saw a bright flash. It was lightning. Sara was scared. She grabbed Lily and ran to Mom. Mom hugged Sara and Lily and said, "Don't worry, it's just a storm. It will pass soon."
But when Sara looked at Lily, she saw something strange. Lily was smaller than before. She was as small as Sara's hand. Sara gasped. "Mom, look! Lily shrank!"
Mom looked at Lily and smiled. "Oh, Sara, it's not Lily who shrank. It's your castle. The rain washed away the sand and made it smaller. Lily is still the same size as before."
Sara looked at her castle and saw that Mom was right. It was a tiny pile of wet sand. Sara felt silly. She laughed and hugged Lily. "I'm sorry, Lily. I thought you shrank. You are still my big and friendly doll."
Mom laughed too and said, "It's okay, Sara. It was a funny mistake. Let's go home and dry off. Maybe we can make another castle tomorrow."
Sara nodded and said, "Yes, Mom. Let's go home. I love you and Lily."
The end.
