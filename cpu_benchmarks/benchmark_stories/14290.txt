Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She was three years old. One day, her mom said: "Amy, it's time to take a bath!"
Amy grabbed her pan and ran to the bathroom. She splashed water everywhere. Then, she got into the water and started washing her hair. It was so funny, because her hair was very hairy!
When she was done, she ran downstairs. She was dripping wet but she was so excited. She said: "Mom! I took a bath! It was so much fun!"
Her mom smiled and said: "Great job, Amy! Now go put some dry clothes on."
The end.
