Once upon a time, in a wide green park, there lived a little bird. The bird loved to whistle all day long. The bird had a friend, a small dog. The dog liked to play with a ball.
One day, the dog found a weight in the park. The weight was heavy for the dog. The dog wanted to play with the weight, but it was too big. The dog felt sad.
The bird saw the dog feeling sad. The bird wanted to help. So, the bird started to whistle a happy song. The dog heard the song and felt happy too. The dog forgot about the weight and played with the ball again. The bird and the dog played together and had a fun day in the wide green park.
