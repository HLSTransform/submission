Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to run and play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy and his friends were playing catch when Timmy accidentally broke his friend's toy car. His friend was very upset and started to cry.
Timmy felt bad and wanted to make it up to his friend. He went to his mom and asked if they could give his friend an avocado from their garden as a gift. His mom agreed and they picked a nice ripe avocado.
When Timmy gave the avocado to his friend, his friend's tears turned into a smile. "Thank you, Timmy!" his friend said. "You're a good friend."
From that day on, Timmy learned that when he makes a mistake, he can make it right by doing something kind for others. And he continued to run and play with his friends, always remembering to be careful with their toys.
