Nina was walking home from the shops. She had a box of waffles in her hands, which she had just bought. Suddenly, she slipped and the box of waffles flew up into the air! She tried to catch them but it was so difficult.
"Oh no!" she said.
Just then, a little dog came racing by. The dog saw the waffles and tried to catch them. He jumped and jumped but he couldn't reach them. The waffles were getting further and further away.
"Help me catch the waffles!" Nina shouted to the dog.
The dog ran faster and finally he caught one of the waffles and brought it back to Nina. She praised him and gave him a hug.
"You saved the day!" she said. "Thank you so much!"
The little dog looked so proud of himself, and Nina was so happy to have her waffle back. They both went on their way, smiling.
