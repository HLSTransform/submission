Ben and Mia were playing in the park. They saw a big crane lifting things up and down. They wanted to see it closer.
"Can we go there?" Ben asked his mom.
"No, it is not safe. The crane is for workers, not for kids. Stay here with me," his mom said.
But Ben and Mia did not listen. They ran away from their mom and went to the crane. They climbed on the fence and tried to touch the crane.
"Wow, it is so big and strong!" Ben said.
"Look, it can move this way and that way!" Mia said.
They did not see the worker who was driving the crane. He did not see them either. He moved the crane and it almost hit Ben and Mia. They screamed and jumped off the fence.
"Help, help!" they cried.
Their mom heard them and ran to them. She was very scared and angry.
"What are you doing here? You could have been hurt! I told you to stay with me!" she shouted.
Ben and Mia were sorry. They knew they did a bad thing. They hugged their mom and said they were sorry.
"We are sorry, mom. We were curious. We wanted to see the crane," they said.
"I know, but you have to listen to me. I want you to be safe and happy. The crane is not a toy. It is a tool for workers. You have to respect their work and their space. Do you understand?" she said.
Ben and Mia nodded. They understood. They said they would not do it again.
The worker who was driving the crane saw them and came to them. He was not angry. He was glad they were not hurt. He smiled and said hello.
"Hello, kids. I am sorry I almost hit you. I did not see you. You should not be here. It is dangerous," he said.
"Hello, sir. We are sorry too. We were curious. We wanted to see your crane. It is very cool," they said.
"Thank you. It is cool, but it is also hard work. I have to be careful and follow the rules. Do you want to learn more about my crane?" he said.
Ben and Mia looked at their mom. She nodded. She thought it was a good idea. They said yes.
The worker showed them his crane. He told them how it worked and what it could do. He let them wear his helmet and his gloves. He even let them bow to the crane and say thank you.
Ben and Mia were happy. They learned a lot. They thanked the worker and said goodbye.
They went back to their mom. She hugged them and said she was proud of them.
They learned a lesson. They learned to listen to their mom, to respect the workers and their tools, and to be curious and polite. They also learned that cranes are cool, but not toys. They had a warm feeling in their hearts. They had a good day.
