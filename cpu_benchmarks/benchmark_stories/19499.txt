Once there was a family who wanted to play together. They were very happy. The sun was hot and the sky was blue. They ran outside and laughed in the warm sunshine. 
The family played tag and catch and other fun games. They laughed and cheered when their team won. They also helped each other and worked as a team. 
When they felt tired, they took a break. They sat together in the shade and sang and danced together. Everyone felt at peace and happy. 
As the day went on, they started to feel hot, so they decided to go and play in the cool river. They splashed and laughed, and each time they came back out they felt refreshed and relaxed. 
When they were done playing they lay on their blankets and watched the clouds drift by in the sky. They felt peaceful and content with the day, and thanked the sun for its warmth. 
The family all hugged each other before going inside, happy to have spent the day playing together.
