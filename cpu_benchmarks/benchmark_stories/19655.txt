Molly wanted to paint. She found a journal and a brush. The journal was orange.
Molly started to paint on the paper. She used the brush to make orange circles. Molly smiled when she saw the orange circles. Then she started to make orange lines.
Molly was so proud when she finished her painting. She showed her mom the orange journal with her special painting. Mom smiled and said it was beautiful.
Molly put the journal away. She wanted to paint again soon.
