One day, a little boy named Tim lost a tooth. He was very happy because the tooth fairy would come at night. Tim put the tooth under his pillow and went to sleep.
In the dark, a tiny fairy named Lily came to save the tooth. She looked under the pillow and found it. But it was so dark that she could not see well. Lily bumped into a toy and made a loud noise.
Tim woke up and saw Lily. He said, "Who are you?" Lily said, "I am the tooth fairy. I came to save your tooth." Tim smiled and went back to sleep. In the morning, he found a shiny coin under his pillow.
