Lily loved to play with her mom's jewelry. She liked to put on the shiny rings, the pretty necklaces, and the sparkly earrings. She felt like a princess when she wore them. She wondered how her mom got so many beautiful things.
One day, when her mom was out, Lily sneaked into her bedroom and opened the jewelry box. She saw a new bracelet that she had never seen before. It was silver and had many colorful stones. It was the most adorable bracelet ever. Lily wanted to try it on.
She reached for the bracelet, but then she heard a loud noise. It was her dad coming home. He was early today. Lily got scared. She knew she was not supposed to touch her mom's jewelry without asking. She quickly closed the jewelry box and ran out of the bedroom. She hoped her dad did not see her.
But her dad did see her. He saw her running with something shiny in her hand. He followed her to the living room. He saw her hiding behind the couch. He smiled. He knew what she had.
He walked over to the couch and said, "Lily, what are you doing? Do you have something to show me?"
Lily peeked out from behind the couch. She saw her dad's kind eyes. She felt guilty. She held out the bracelet and said, "I'm sorry, daddy. I just wanted to see it. It's so pretty. Is it for mommy?"
Her dad took the bracelet and hugged her. He said, "Yes, it is for mommy. It's a surprise for her birthday. I bought it for her today. Do you like it?"
Lily nodded. She said, "I love it. It's the most adorable bracelet ever. Can I help you give it to mommy?"
Her dad smiled. He said, "Of course you can. But first, we have to put it back in the jewelry box. And we have to keep it a secret. Can you do that?"
Lily nodded again. She said, "Yes, daddy. I can keep a secret. I'm sorry I took it. I won't do it again."
Her dad kissed her forehead. He said, "It's okay, Lily. I know you love your mom's jewelry. But you have to ask before you touch it. It's very special to her. And so are you."
Lily smiled. She said, "I love you, daddy. And I love mommy. And I love her jewelry. Can we go give her the bracelet now?"
Her dad laughed. He said, "Not yet, Lily. We have to wait until her birthday. It's only two days away. Can you wait that long?"
Lily nodded. She said, "Yes, daddy. I can wait. But I'm very excited. I can't wait to see mommy's face when she sees the bracelet. She will be so happy. And so will I."
