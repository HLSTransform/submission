Once upon a time there was a little girl in a dark forest. The little girl was scared, because of the darkness. But she decided to be brave and try to succeed. 
She started to walk, but it was hard because the dark was so deep. Then she saw something pale in the dark. She moved closer and saw it was a flower. She smiled, because it was so beautiful even in this dark place. The little girl tried to pick it, but it was too high. 
She was determined to succeed, so she looked around and found a big stick. With her new stick, she was able to reach the flower and pick it. She looked at the pale flower in her hands and smiled. She had succeeded and the dark forest didn't seem so scary anymore.
