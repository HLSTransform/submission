Once upon a time, there was a little boy who was feeling very anxious. He was scared about a big lift, and didn't know how to go up it. 
His mom saw how anxious he was, and she said, "It will be OK, sweetheart. Let's feel the lift, and it will be more comfortable." 
The little boy tentatively stepped on the lift, and his mom showed him the shiny, smooth buttons. He pressed one, and the lift began to move. 
The little boy was still nervous, but he noticed that the different textures of the walls and floor were calming him down. He said to his mom, "It feels like a soft blanket." 
His mom smiled. As the lift travelled higher and higher, the little boy soon relaxed, and by the time the doors opened at the top, he was no longer anxious. 
The little boy looked out, and saw a bright world of wonderful possibilities.
