Tom and Jen were twins who liked to play at the shore. They liked to dig in the sand, splash in the water, and look for shells and rocks. But one day, they found something else on the shore. It was a big fish that was not moving or breathing. It had a bad smell and flies around it.
"Look, Jen, a fish!" Tom said. He ran to the fish and touched it with his hand. "It is soft and squishy."
"Yuck, Tom, don't touch it!" Jen said. She stayed away from the fish. "It is not a good fish. It is a rot fish. It is sick and dead. It can make you sick too."
Tom did not listen to Jen. He thought the rot fish was fun and interesting. He poked it with a stick, pulled its fins, and opened its mouth. He laughed and said, "This is not boring like the shells and rocks. This is a cool fish."
Jen shook her head and went to play with the shells and rocks. She did not want to be near the rot fish. She knew it was not good to play with things that were rot.
The next day, Tom and Jen went to the shore again. But Tom did not feel well. He had a fever and a rash on his hand. He felt tired and sick. Jen felt sorry for him and said, "Tom, you are sick because you played with the rot fish. You should have listened to me. Rot things are not good to play with. They can hurt you."
Tom nodded and said, "You are right, Jen. I was silly and wrong. I should have listened to you. Rot things are not fun or cool. They are bad and boring. I will not play with them again. I will play with the shells and rocks like you."
Jen smiled and said, "That is good, Tom. I hope you get well soon. I love you, brother."
Tom smiled and said, "I love you too, sister."
The moral of the story is: Do not play with things that are rot. They can make you sick and unhappy. Listen to your sister or brother when they tell you something is not good. Play with things that are clean and healthy. They can make you happy and well.
