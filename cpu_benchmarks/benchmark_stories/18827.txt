Lily and Ben were playing with blocks. They wanted to make a big tower. They worked hard and put many blocks on top of each other. They were almost done.
"Look, Lily, our tower is so tall!" Ben said.
"Yes, Ben, it is. We just need one more block to complete it," Lily said.
She reached for the last block, but it was too far. She stretched her hand, but she could not get it. She saw a chair near the block. She had an idea.
"I know, Ben. I can climb on the chair and get the block," she said.
She ran to the chair and climbed on it. She was careful not to fall. She grabbed the block and smiled. She was ready to finish the tower.
But she did not see that the chair was next to the kitchen table. And on the table, there was a bowl of soup. It was very hot and spicy. Mama had made it for lunch.
As Lily moved the block, she bumped the bowl. The soup spilled over the edge. It landed on Lily's hand.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lily cried. "The soup is spicy! It hurts my hand!"
She dropped the block and jumped off the chair. She ran to Mama, who was in the living room. She showed her hand to Mama.
"Mama, Mama, help me! The soup is spicy! It hurts my hand!" she said.
Mama saw Lily's hand. It was red and wet. She felt sorry for Lily. She hugged her and kissed her hand.
"Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. You burned your hand. Come, let me put some ice on it. It will make it feel better," she said.
She took Lily to the bathroom. She got some ice from the freezer. She wrapped it in a cloth and put it on Lily's hand. Lily felt the cold. It was nice. It made the pain go away.
"Thank you, Mama. You are the best," Lily said.
"You're welcome, Lily. I love you. But next time, be careful. Don't climb on chairs. And don't touch the soup. It is spicy. It is not for little hands," Mama said.
"I know, Mama. I'm sorry. I won't do it again," Lily said.
They hugged and smiled. They went back to the living room. They saw Ben. He was still playing with the blocks. He had completed the tower. It was very tall and beautiful.
"Wow, Lily, look at our tower. We did it!" Ben said.
Lily looked at the tower. She was happy. She forgot about the soup. She clapped her hand. Well, one hand. The other hand still had ice on it.
"Yay, Ben, we did it! Our tower is the best!" she said.
