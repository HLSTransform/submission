Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go to the beach with his family. One day, he saw a seal on the shore. The seal was amazing! Timmy wanted to carry the seal back to the water, but he knew he couldn't do it alone. So, he asked his dad to help him. Together, they carried the seal to the water and watched it swim away. Timmy felt happy that he helped the seal. From that day on, Timmy always looked for seals on the beach and hoped he could help them too.
