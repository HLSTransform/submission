Mummy and Daddy took John to the museum. John loved the museum. He saw big bald statues and tiny figurines. He even saw a dinosaur skeleton and scribbled pictures on the walls.
John was tired after exploring the museum, so Mummy put him in the pram and rocked him until he fell asleep. He rested the whole way home, dreaming of the things he had seen.
At home, Daddy put John to bed. But before he closed the door, Daddy smiled and said, "Goodnight John. Sleep well and rest."
John snuggled down among his pillows and soon drifted off, dreaming of big bald statues and tiny figurines.
