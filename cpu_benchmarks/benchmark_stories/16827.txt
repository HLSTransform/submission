Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily's mommy asked her if she wanted to go on an adventure. 
"Where are we going?" Lily asked.
"We're going to the park in the east," her mommy replied.
Lily was excited to go on an adventure with her mommy. When they got to the park, they saw a man with a sharp knife cutting some fruits. 
"Look, Lily! Those fruits look so tasty!" her mommy said.
"I want to try some!" Lily exclaimed.
The man with the sharp knife smiled and gave them some fruits to taste. They were very tasty, and Lily was happy that she went on an adventure with her mommy.
