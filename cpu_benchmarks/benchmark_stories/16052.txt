Once upon a time, there was a hidden minute. No one had ever seen it. But it was always there, waiting for someone to discover it.
One day, a three year old girl called Lucy was walking through the woods. Suddenly, in the middle of a big sunny meadow, something caught her eye. It was the hidden minute, lying in the grass.
Lucy picked it up and took it home. She put it on the kitchen window sill. As the sun shone on it, the hidden minute began to melt.
When Lucy woke up the next day, she couldn't believe her eyes. Instead of a hidden minute, there was a beautiful shimmering puddle of sunshine in the kitchen window sill. She smiled and laughed with delight.
From then on, every morning Lucy would wake up and watch the minute melting. She enjoyed watching it change shape and glimmer in the sun.
