Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play in the garden. They have a big tree with a swing. They take turns to swing high and low.
One day, they see a bird in the tree. The bird has a red wing and a blue wing. It is very pretty. Anna and Ben want to see it better. They climb the tree and get closer to the bird.
"Hello, bird," Anna says. "You have nice wings. Can we touch them?"
The bird looks at Anna and Ben. It does not like them. It is a naughty bird. It pecks at Anna's hand. "Ow!" Anna cries. "That hurts!"
"Go away, go away!" the bird says. "This is my tree. You are bad kids. You cannot touch my wings."
Ben gets angry. He tries to grab the bird. But the bird is fast. It flies away and laughs. "Ha ha ha! You are silly kids. You cannot catch me."
Anna and Ben are sad. They climb down the tree. They do not want to play with the bird anymore. They spend the rest of the day on the swing. They are careful not to bother the bird again. They hope the bird will be nicer next time.
