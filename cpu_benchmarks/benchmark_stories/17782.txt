Once upon a time, there was a boat. The boat wanted to go sailing. It had never gone sailing before and was very excited! So, it found some friends and they went on an adventure.
The boat, with its friends, sailed far and wide. They sailed and saw lots of different places. Eventually, they stopped at a place called the Festival. It was big, bright and very happy.
At the Festival, all the friends had lots of fun. There were lots of sweet treats to eat, and things to play with. They played games and laughed until the sun started to set.
Before they had to go sailing home, the friends said goodbye. The boat waved goodbye to all its friends. Then, it set off and sailed away. It had a fun day and felt very happy.
