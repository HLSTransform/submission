Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. Jack was very restless and couldn't sit still for long. One day, Jack's mom took him to the toy store to buy him a new toy. Jack was very happy and excited.
At the store, Jack saw a toy car that he really liked. He asked his mom to buy it for him. But his mom said, "Jack, you already have so many toys. Maybe we should save our money for something else."
Jack was disappointed and started to cry. He didn't understand why he couldn't have the toy car. But then, a kind old man who was standing nearby said, "Hey there, young man. You don't need to score more toys to be happy. Sometimes, it's better to rest and appreciate what you already have."
Jack thought about what the old man said and realized that his mom was right. He didn't need more toys to be happy. He hugged his mom and said, "Thank you for taking me to the store, Mom. I'm happy with what I have."
