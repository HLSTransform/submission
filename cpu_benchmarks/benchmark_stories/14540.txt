Once there was a young boy called Jack. Jack was very excited because he had a new toy - a recording machine. He loved it because he could record things he liked. 
One day, he went outside in the park to explore. He saw the sky and felt so happy. He used his recording machine to capture it.
Then he saw something careless. He saw some birds flying high and low without any worries. He recorded them too. 
He went back home with lots of recordings and showed it to his family. Everyone was so delighted by his recordings. 
Jack was so proud of his recordings and he always looked at the sky and smiled.
