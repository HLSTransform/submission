Once upon a time, there was a little train. The train loved to go to the park. It liked to see the kids play and hear them laugh. One day, the train saw a new, unknown friend at the park. The unknown friend was big and blue.
The train wanted to say hi to the unknown friend. It went up to the big blue friend and said, "Hi! I am a train. I like the park. Do you like the park too?" The big blue friend smiled and said, "Hi train! I am a bus. I like the park too. We can be friends and play together."
So, the train and the bus played together at the park. They had lots of fun. The kids at the park liked to watch the train and the bus play. They all became friends and had many happy days at the park.
