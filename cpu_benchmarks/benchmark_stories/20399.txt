Once upon a time, there was a famous dog named Max. Max loved to play fetch with his owner, Sarah. One day, Max went on a walk by himself and got lost. Sarah was very sad and wanted to prevent Max from getting hurt. She put up posters with Max's picture and asked everyone if they had seen him.
After a few days, a kind man found Max and called Sarah. She was so happy and went to pick him up right away. When Max saw Sarah, he wagged his tail and licked her face. Sarah was so happy to have Max back, and it was true that she loved him very much. From that day on, Sarah made sure to always keep Max on a leash when they went for walks, to prevent him from getting lost again.
