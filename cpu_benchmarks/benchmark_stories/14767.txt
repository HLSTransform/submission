Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and eat yummy food. But sometimes they fight over things. One day, they have soup for lunch. Mom gives them each a bowl and a spoon.
Lily likes her spoon. It is shiny and pink. She says, "This is my spoon. It is pretty and good."
Ben likes his spoon too. It is bright and blue. He says, "This is my spoon. It is lively and fun."
But then Ben sees Lily's spoon. He thinks it is nicer than his. He says, "I want your spoon. Give it to me."
Lily says, "No, this is my spoon. You have your own spoon. Go away."
Ben does not listen. He tries to grab Lily's spoon. Lily holds it tight. They pull and tug. The spoons clink and clank. The soup spills and splashes.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to the kitchen. She sees the mess and the twins. She is not happy. She says, "Stop it, Lily and Ben. You are making a big mess. You should share your spoons and be nice to each other."
Lily and Ben feel sorry. They say, "Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Lily. Sorry, Ben."
Mom smiles. She says, "It's okay. I love you both. But you need to clean up the mess and finish your soup. And next time, be happy with what you have."
Lily and Ben nod. They hug Mom and each other. They swap their spoons and say, "Thank you." They eat their soup and enjoy their spoons. They are friends again.
