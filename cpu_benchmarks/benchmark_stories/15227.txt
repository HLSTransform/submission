Once upon a time, in a small garden, there was a little green plant. The green plant was very thirsty. It needed a drink of water to grow big and strong.
One sunny day, a kind girl named Lily saw the thirsty green plant. She said, "Oh no! You need water!" Lily ran to her house and got a big cup of water. She gave the green plant a drink.
The green plant was so happy. It grew taller and more green. The green plant said, "Thank you, Lily!" And from that day on, Lily and the green plant were the best of friends.
