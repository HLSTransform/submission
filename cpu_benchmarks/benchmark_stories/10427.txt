Once upon a time there was a mysterious square. Nobody knew where it came from. Every day the square would shake and some people thought it was magic!
One day a little girl called Anna wanted to see the mysterious square. She took her teddy bear and went to the square. When she got there, she saw that it was shaking!
Anna was scared. She hugged her teddy bear tight and waited. Then, suddenly, the shaking stopped. Anna was very brave so she decided to take a closer look.
When she got close to the mysterious square, she could see that it was a box. Inside the box there were lots of toys!
Anna was so happy. She looked around and saw that the square had been shaking because a butterfly was inside the box, flapping its wings.
Anna was so excited to open the box and play with the toys. She had such a fun day!
