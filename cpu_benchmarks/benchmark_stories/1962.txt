Once upon a time there was a boy. His name was Jake. Jake was three-years-old. One day, he wanted to explore so he entered a big room. He saw a long, comfy couch. It looked so cozy that he lay down on it.
Suddenly, he felt something cold! He jumped off the couch. He looked under the couch and saw a small, white kitten.
"Hi," said the kitten, "I'm so cold. Can I come stay with you?"
Jake smiled. He said, "Yes! You can stay with me. Come up here and warm up next to me on the couch."
The kitten curled up on the couch next to Jake and they snuggled together until they were both nice and warm again. From that day on, Jake and the kitten were best friends.
