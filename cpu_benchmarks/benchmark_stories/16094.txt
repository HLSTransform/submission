Once upon a time, there was a small kid named Joe. Joe was very happy and fit. He loved to explore and run around.
One day while he was running around in the park, Joe found a box. Inside the box was a special memory. It was very old and dusty.
Joe was curious. He opened the box and the memory flew out! It was so sparkly and bright. Joe felt so happy and excited.
He released the memory back into the world. The bright sparkles flew around and made Joe smile.
Joe felt fit and happy as his special memory was now released. He enjoyed watching it fly away and laughed. Joe felt happy and content.
