Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mom made her a peanut butter and jam sandwich for lunch. Lily loved the sandwich, but she got some jam on her shirt. 
Lily's mom said, "Oh no, Lily! You got jam on your shirt. We need to change it."
Lily replied, "I understand, Mommy. I'm sorry I was naughty and got jam on my shirt." 
Lily and her mom went to her room to change her shirt. They picked out a pretty pink one and Lily felt much better. From that day on, Lily made sure to eat her sandwich carefully so she wouldn't get jam on her clothes again.
