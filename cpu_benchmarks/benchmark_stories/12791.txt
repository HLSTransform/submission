Sam was walking down to the church. He felt excited. He wanted to get a good view of the rolling hills. When he got there, he climbed up the steps to the door.
"Good morning!" said the churchkeeper.
Sam smiled. "Hello," he said.
The churchkeeper opened the door and Sam stepped inside. But as he went in, he noticed an awful smell. It was smelly.
Sam quickly left the church and started to roll down the hill. He was having fun. But then, he heard a loud noise. He looked up and saw that the church was tumbling down behind him. The churchkeeper was screaming.
Sam was scared. The church was not only smelly, but it was now destroyed. Sam kept rolling until he was safe. He was very sad. The church was gone.
