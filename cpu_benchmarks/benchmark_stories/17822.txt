Once upon a time there was a kind girl named Penny. Penny loved to go for walks in the forest. On this day, she was walking and came across a big tree. Suddenly, she heard a noise! There was a little squirrel and it was looking for a snack. 
Penny was so kind and knew just what to do. She ran back home and found some food from her kitchen. She grabbed some nuts and ran back to the tree. 
The squirrel was so happy! It scampered down the tree and thanked Penny for the snack. Penny said goodbye to the squirrel and returned home. 
From then on, anytime Penny went for a walk in the forest, the squirrel would come back looking for another snack. They quickly became friends and would share snacks every time they saw each other.
