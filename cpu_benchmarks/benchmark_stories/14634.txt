Once there was a goose named Pete. Pete was very organized and he always wanted to put on a show.
One day Pete found out about a big show in the nearby town. He wanted to go so badly! So he gathered up all his things, and flew off to the town.
When he got there, Pete was so excited to display his things. He set up everything neatly and had a big show. People came from all around the town to see the things Pete had to show. People even came from nearby towns and cities to watch!
Everyone was so impressed by the way Pete was so organized. He put on such a great show, and everyone was amazed!
From then on, Pete was known as the organized goose, who always put on an amazing show. He was so proud of himself for doing such a good job!
