One day, a boy named Tim found a big red button. The button was next to a sign that said "laser." Tim didn't know what a laser was, but he thought it looked fun. He saw a man walk by and asked, "What does this button do?"
The man said, "Don't push that button! It is very dangerous!" But Tim didn't listen. He wanted to see what would happen.
Tim waited until the man left, then he pushed the button. A bright light came out of the laser. The light was so strong that it broke a big tree. The tree fell down and made a loud noise. Tim was very scared and ran away. But he learned that he should have listened to the man and not pushed the dangerous button.
