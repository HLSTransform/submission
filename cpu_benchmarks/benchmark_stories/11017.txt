Sara and Ben were playing with their dolls in the living room. They had a big box of clothes and accessories for their dolls. Sara liked to dress her doll in wool sweaters and hats, because they were soft and warm. Ben liked to dress his doll in spicy colors, like red and yellow, because they were bright and fun.
"Look at my doll, Sara," Ben said. "She is wearing a spicy dress and a spicy scarf. She is ready to go to a party."
"I don't like your doll, Ben," Sara said. "She is too spicy. She hurts my eyes. My doll is wearing a wool sweater and a wool hat. She is cozy and cute. She is ready to go to bed."
Sara and Ben started to argue about whose doll was better. They raised their voices and pulled each other's dolls. Sara was so angry that she slapped Ben's doll in the face. Ben was so shocked that he slapped Sara's doll in the head.
"Ow!" Sara and Ben cried at the same time. They dropped their dolls and rubbed their hands. They realized that slapping was not nice. It made them and their dolls feel bad.
"I'm sorry, Sara," Ben said. "I shouldn't have slapped your doll. She is cozy and cute. I like her wool sweater and hat."
"I'm sorry, Ben," Sara said. "I shouldn't have slapped your doll. She is bright and fun. I like her spicy dress and scarf."
Sara and Ben hugged and made up. They decided to share their clothes and accessories. They dressed their dolls in wool and spicy outfits. They agreed that their dolls were both beautiful and happy. They played together nicely and had a lot of fun.
