Lily liked to dress up as a princess. She had a pink dress, a shiny crown and a wand. She put on her dress and crown and looked in the mirror. She smiled and said, "I am a pretty princess!"
She wanted to make her wand more sparkly. She found some glitter and glue in her drawer. She put some glue on her wand and sprinkled glitter on it. She waved her wand and said, "Magic, magic, make me fly!"
But the glue was not dry yet. Some of it dripped on her dress and her hair. The glitter stuck to the glue and made a mess. Lily felt sad and said, "Oh no, I am a messy princess!"
She heard her mom call her for lunch. She ran to the kitchen, hoping her mom would not see her dress and hair. She was very hungry and wanted to eat. She saw a sandwich, a banana and a glass of milk on the table. She said, "Thank you, mom, this looks yummy!"
Her mom saw her dress and hair and smiled. She said, "You are a very creative princess, Lily. But you need to wash your dress and hair after lunch. And next time, wait for the glue to dry before you use it." She gave her a hug and a kiss and said, "I love you, Lily, you are my special princess!"
