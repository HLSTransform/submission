Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars. One day, Timmy's mommy said they were going to bake cookies. Timmy was so excited! 
They went into the kitchen and Timmy helped his mommy measure the flour and sugar. Then, they put the cookies in the oven and set the timer for 10 minutes. Timmy watched as the timer counted down to zero. 
Finally, the timer beeped and Timmy's mommy took the cookies out of the oven. They turned out so yummy! Timmy felt very successful because he helped his mommy make the cookies. And that night, Timmy went to bed with a happy tummy and a big smile on his face.
