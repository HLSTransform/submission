John was a kind and gentle boy. He always liked to make his friends laugh with silly jokes and games. One day, John and his friends were playing together at the park when they noticed a hang glider in the sky. It was long and colourful, and they began to giggle.
John said, “Let’s see who can jump the highest! Then we can go hang gliding too!” 
His friends agreed, so they all started jumping. But soon, someone started to climb the hang glider’s cable and jump on it!
John cried out, “Wait! That’s our hang glider!”. It was their teacher, Ms. Jones.
Ms. Jones said in a stern voice, “What are you doing? I can’t trust my pupils to be so silly.”
John quickly apologised and told Ms. Jones that he was just trying to show his friends how to hang glider. Ms. Jones replied, “I can see that, but please be more careful next time. Now, off you all go!” 
John and his friends thanked Ms. Jones for understanding and waved goodbye as she took off on the hang glider. From then on, John and his friends made sure to only play silly games when it was safe and without breaking any rules!
