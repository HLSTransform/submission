Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing basketball. One day, Timmy's mom told him they were going to the park to play basketball. Timmy was so happy, he started jumping up and down. 
When they got to the park, Timmy saw that it was very cold outside. The ground was icy and slippery. Timmy's mom told him to be careful and not to slip. Timmy tried to walk carefully, but he was too excited to play basketball. 
Timmy's mom said they had to hurry and play quickly because it was getting even colder outside. Timmy and his mom played basketball for a little while, but then they had to go back home. Timmy was sad to leave, but he knew he would come back to play basketball again soon.
