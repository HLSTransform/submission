Once upon a time, there lived a powerful peach tree in the middle of a meadow. Every day, a playful little girl named Lola went to visit the tree. She loved gazing up at it's beautiful leaves, wondering if the tree knew how special it was. One day, Lola decided to talk to the tree. "Hello!" she said, "Do you feel powerful, like I do when I look at you?"
The peach tree did not answer her. In awe, Lola watched as a gentle breeze blew through it's branches, sending a shimmer of light onto her face. She got so lost in the moment that she almost forgot to ask the tree her most important question: "Can power also be kind?"
The peach tree stayed silent, almost as if it were waiting for an answer from Lola. Then she realized. True power comes from kindness. As she gave the tree one final hug, Lola smiled and said "Thank you, powerful peach tree. I will always remember our special friendship." 
Lola then went back home feeling more powerful than ever. She learned that day to be kind to all creatures, even if they cannot speak.
