Once upon a time there was a boy called John. John was three years old, and he loved playing outside. Every day he would start his day with a big smile on his face.
One day, John's mum said, "John, it's time to have dinner. We're having spaghetti tonight." John was so excited, but he was also a bit surprised that his mum had cooked spaghetti for dinner.
John started to eat the spaghetti slowly. "Mum, this spaghetti is boring!" he said.
His mum laughed. "Sometimes when we do the same thing over and over again it can be boring, John. But if you keep trying new things you'll never get bored," she said.
John was a bit sad but he tried to enjoy his dinner. But as the days passed, he kept eating the same boring spaghetti. After a while, he stopped having fun and began to get really bored.
The moral of the story is that it's always important to try new things, even if they're a bit scary. Otherwise you risk getting too used to the same old routine and it can get really boring.
