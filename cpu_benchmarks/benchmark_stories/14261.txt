Once upon a time there was a man who was very sick. He hurt a lot and wanted to feel better. He looked around the universe for something to help him heal.
The man found a special healthy thing that could make him feel better. So he took it and quickly felt stronger. He was so happy and thanked the universe.
But then the man's sickness came back and he was even sicker than before. He tried to use the healthy thing again but it didn't work. He was sad and desperate. No matter what he did, he could not heal.
The man was very sad. He never found a way to feel healthy again. His sickness stayed with him forever and the universe could do nothing to help him.
