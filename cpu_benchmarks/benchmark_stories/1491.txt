Once there was a boy called Max. He was three years old and he liked to watch movies. One day he was at the park with his family. He was feeling fine and he ran around and chased the birds.
Suddenly, he felt his foot slip and he fell to the ground. He started to cry, but his dad came over and helped him get up. He was all right and his dad was happy too.
They all went to the movies that evening. Max liked the movie because it was fine. He didn't even think about falling. He just enjoyed the movie and all the fun with his family.
