Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big tree with a long trunk. They want to touch it.
"Look, Sue, a big tree!" Tom says. "Can we touch it?"
"Yes, let's touch it!" Sue says. They run to the tree and touch the trunk. It is rough and hard.
But then, they hear a loud noise. It is a man with a big saw. He wants to cut the tree.
"Hey, kids, get away from the tree!" the man says. "It is bad. It has bugs and it is sick. I have to cut it."
Tom and Sue are scared. They do not want the man to cut the tree. They like the tree.
"Please, do not cut the tree!" Tom says. "It is not bad. It is nice. We like to touch it."
"Sorry, kids, but I have to," the man says. "The tree is bad for the park. It can fall and hurt someone. It is better to cut it and plant a new one."
Tom and Sue are sad. They do not understand. They hug the tree and say goodbye.
The man cuts the tree. It falls to the ground. Tom and Sue cry. They do not want to play in the park anymore. They go home.
