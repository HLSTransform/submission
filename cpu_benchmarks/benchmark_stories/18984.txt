Once upon a time, there was a rich man named Bob. He had a big house and many toys. One day, Bob saw a book at the store. It was a very nice book with many colorful pictures. He wanted to buy the book, but he did not have enough money with him.
Bob went home and looked for his money. He could not find it. He was sad because he wanted the book. He thought, "I will go back to the store and see if the book is still there. Maybe I can find money on the way."
Bob began to rush to the store. As he ran, he saw a coin on the ground. He picked it up and kept running. When he got to the store, the book was still there. Bob was happy. He gave the coin to the store man and got the book.
Bob went home with the book and sat down to read it. The pictures were so pretty, and he felt happy. The book made him forget about the lost money. In the end, Bob learned that even though he was rich, it was the simple things that made him happy.
