Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play outside, but one day it started to rain. Lily's mom gave her an umbrella to keep her dry. 
Lily loved her umbrella! It was her favorite color and she felt very popular when she used it. She twirled and danced in the rain with her umbrella, feeling happy and safe. 
But then, Lily saw a bird that was stuck in a puddle. She tried to help the bird, but she accidentally let go of her umbrella. It flew away in the wind and she couldn't catch it. 
Lily was sad and wet. She wanted her umbrella back, but it was gone forever. She went home and tried to write a letter to her umbrella, but it didn't help. She missed her umbrella very much and wished she could have it back.
