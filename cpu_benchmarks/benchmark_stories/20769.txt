One day, a little girl named Alice was walking with her basket in the park. She was so excited for the adventure ahead. There were lots of trees, and she wanted to explore them all.
Suddenly, Alice saw a big, yellow flower. She knew that she wanted to pick it, but it was too far away. She was determined to reach it, so Alice moved closer and closer. Even though it was very hard, she was too stubborn to give up.
Alice's friends were watching, and they were so proud of her. At last, Alice was able to pick the yellow flower from the branch. She was so happy to have achieved her goal, and put the flower in her basket.
Alice had learned a valuable lesson that day. Just because something seems hard, doesn't mean it's not possible. With determination and hard work, she could do anything. Alice was smiling as she walked away with her basket.
