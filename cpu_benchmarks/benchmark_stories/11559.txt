One day, a cute little girl named Lily went to the park with her mom. The sky was gray, and it looked like it might rain. Lily saw a small bird on the ground. She wanted to feed the bird, so she asked her mom, "Can I feed the bird, please?"
Her mom said, "Yes, but we need to find some food for the bird first." They looked around the park and found some small seeds on the ground. Lily picked up the seeds and went back to the bird. She said, "Here, bird. Eat these seeds."
The bird ate the seeds and chirped happily. Just then, the rain started to fall. Lily and her mom ran to a big tree for cover. The bird followed them and sat on a branch above their heads. Lily smiled and said, "The bird is happy we fed it. Now it's safe from the rain too!"
