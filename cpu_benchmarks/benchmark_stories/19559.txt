Once upon a time, there was a long motorcycle. It was like nothing anyone had ever seen before. One day a little girl and her dog came to see the long motorcycle. 
The little girl was so excited, so she ran up to the motorcycle and started to poke it with her fingers. 
The dog barked and barked and the little girl kept on poking the motorcycle. 
Suddenly, the long motorcycle started to move. To the little girl's surprise, it started to roll around in circles. 
The little girl and her dog were so amazed. They laughed and laughed. 
The little girl poked the motorcycle one more time and it stopped moving. 
From then on, the little girl and her dog made sure to visit the long motorcycle everyday!
