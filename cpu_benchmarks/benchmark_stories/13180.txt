Once upon a time there was a powerful winter. The wind was blowing so hard that it felt like it was never going to stop!
Everyone in the village was worried and they wondered how they would manage. But then, something amazing happened! A strong, brave girl came to help. 
She put on a warm coat and managed the cold. Everywhere she went she brought joy and hope. She worked so hard that soon the winter became warmer.
The people were so grateful and thanked the brave girl for helping them manage the powerful winter. From then on, it was always warm when winter came. 
The end.
