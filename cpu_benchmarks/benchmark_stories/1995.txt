Once upon a time, there was a strong girl who was getting ready for a big trip. She went to her bedroom and started to pack her things. She put her clothes and some games into her bag. Then she picked up her pass. She saw it was all ready for her trip.
On the day of her trip the girl grabbed her bag, her pass, and headed out the door. She was so excited to start her journey! She walked to the station and got on the train. She felt brave and strong. 
The girl's journey took her far away. When she finally reached her destination she was amazed by the beautiful sights! All of her packing had been worth it. 
The girl enjoyed her trip and had lots of fun. When she got back home, she unpacked her things and tucked her strong pass safely away.
