John had a big job to do. He had to sort all of the pieces. First, he grabbed the waffles. He was careful to make sure they were strong. He stacked them on top of each other, one after the other. 
But then he made a mistake. He accidentally mixed the pieces together. He tried to keep going, but it was too hard. The pieces were mixed up and it was confusing. He felt so sad and he knew he couldn't finish the job. 
His mom was mad at him for not finishing the job. She had counted on him and he couldn't do it. He ran out of the room and went to bed. He was sad that the job wasn't finished and that his mom was angry. 
John's efforts had not been enough. He tried hard, but he wasn't strong enough to sort all the pieces. He would just have to try harder another time.
