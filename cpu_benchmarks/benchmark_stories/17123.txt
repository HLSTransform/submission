Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play hide and seek with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends went to a big castle. They found a secret chamber and decided to hide there. 
Lily's friend Emma said, "Let's count to ten and then go find each other!" Lily said, "Okay, I will count first!" 
Lily started counting, "One, two, three..." but she stopped when she heard a loud noise. It sounded really bad! Lily was scared and ran out of the chamber. Her friends followed her and they all went home. 
When they got home, Lily's mom asked her what happened. Lily said, "We found a secret chamber and played hide and seek, but then we heard a bad noise and got scared." 
Lily's mom hugged her and said, "It's okay. Sometimes things can be scary, but you were brave to run away and keep yourself safe." Lily felt better and went to bed with a smile on her face.
