Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. She loved to play outside and swing on the swings. One day, she fell off the swing and hurt her arm. It was a mild injury, but Sarah began to complain.
Her mom gave her a bandage and told her to rest, but Sarah kept complaining. She didn't want to rest, she wanted to play. So, she went back outside and started swinging again. But, she didn't listen to her mom's advice and soon her arm hurt even more.
Sarah learned that it's important to listen to grown-ups and take care of our bodies. She had to stay in bed for a few days and couldn't play outside. She realized that complaining doesn't solve anything and it's better to ask for help when we need it.
