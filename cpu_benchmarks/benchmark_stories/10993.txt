Lily and Max were playing in the park. They saw a big box with some toys inside. Lily wanted to play with a shiny crown. She put it on her head and said, "I am a queen. You have to do what I say."
Max did not like that. He wanted to play with a car. He said, "No, you are not a queen. That is a fake crown. It is not real. It is made of plastic."
Lily was angry. She said, "It is not fake. It is real. It is very pretty. You are just jealous. I hate you."
Max was sad. He said, "I don't want to play with you anymore. You are mean. You are not my friend."
He took the car and ran away. Lily was left alone with the crown. She felt sorry. She did not really hate Max. She liked him. She wanted to play with him. She took off the crown and ran after him. She said, "Max, wait. I am sorry. I don't hate you. You are my friend. Can we share the toys?"
Max stopped and looked at her. He saw that she was sorry. He smiled and said, "Okay. I am sorry too. You can be a queen if you want. And I can be a king. We can play together."
They hugged and went back to the box. They found a car and a crown that matched. They put them on and played happily. They were friends again.
