Molly was sitting on her comfortable chair in the living room. She was thirsty and wanted to drink some juice. She looked around the room and spotted a bright red box on the counter. She walked over and opened it to find many delicious juice boxes.
Molly took out a piece and quickly unscrewed the top. She took a big sip, and smiled as the sweet taste filled her mouth. She gulped the rest down and licked her lips.
"yum! That was a good drink," Molly exclaimed.
Just then, her mom walked into the room. She smiled at Molly and said, "Would you like another piece of juice, honey?"
Molly grinned and nodded her head. She couldn't believe how lucky she was to have found such a delicious drink to enjoy. She settled back into her comfortable chair and enjoyed her second piece of juice.
