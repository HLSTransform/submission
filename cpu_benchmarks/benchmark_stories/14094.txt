Once upon a time, there was a boy called Joe. Joe was 3 years old and loved to explore and discover new things. 
One day, Joe was playing in his bedroom. He was looking around and discovered his bed. His bed was big and fluffy and made Joe happy. 
Joe decided to get on the bed and see what it was like to sit on it. As he did, he felt something moving beneath him. It was soft and moved like water. Joe was curious and lifted the bed covers. Much to his surprise, he discovered a small, harmless animal beneath the bed. 
It was a little mouse, who had been living there for a while. Joe was so happy to have found his new friend! They became good friends and the mouse even helped Joe to tidy up his room. 
Joe had a lot of fun discovering the new mouse and playing together. 
The end.
