The sun was shining and it was a lovely day. Timmy saw something zip by very fast. He looked around and saw a toy on the grass in the garden. It was unknown to him, but he wanted to play with it. He ran to it and he picked it up. He started pressing the buttons excitedly. Suddenly, the toy began to zip around the garden in circles! Timmy was surprised and delighted. He followed it around the garden until it zipped back to the same spot where he had first spotted it. He picked it up and realized that it was a special toy that zipped around the garden! From that day on, he always looked forward to playing with his special toy and zipping around with it in the garden.
