Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a silly rabbit. The rabbit liked to wake up early every morning. He would hop around the forest and play with his friends.
One day, the rabbit saw a group of animals getting ready to perform a dance. They were all excited and happy. The rabbit wanted to join them, but he didn't know how to dance.
The rabbit's friends helped him learn some simple dance steps. They practiced together, and soon the rabbit was ready to perform with the group. All the animals in the forest came to watch their dance. The silly rabbit was so happy that he could dance and make his friends smile.
