Once upon a time, there was a furry bear. He wanted to go outside to play, but it was raining. He was sad.
He grabbed his umbrella and opened it. But the wind was very strong, and the umbrella struggled against the wind. The wind blew the umbrella into the air! 
The furry bear was scared, but he didn't give up. He grabbed onto the umbrella and held on tight. He struggled to keep the umbrella close to him, and the wind made it hard.
But finally, the furry bear won! He was able to keep the umbrella close to him and the wind stopped blowing. He smiled and happily went outside to play. 
The End.
