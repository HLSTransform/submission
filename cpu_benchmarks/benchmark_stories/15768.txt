Peter was very excited. He was on vacation and his parents had promised him a special treat.
“Come on, Peter!” his Dad said. “We’re going to test something new!” 
Peter hopped and skipped as he followed his Dad. They arrived in front of a big, thick door. 
“Just give it a push,” Dad said.
Peter pushed the door and it opened with a loud creak. Inside was a room with lots of toys. 
“Oh, wow!” He shouted. His Dad smiled and said, “Let’s test them and see what happens. Go ahead!” 
Peter started testing each toy with curiosity and excitement. He was having so much fun that he didn't want his vacation to end. 
Dad said, “Let’s go home now, Peter. We can come back another day and test the toys some more.” 
Peter smiled and then said, “Ok Dad!”
They said goodbye to the big, thick door and walked happily back home.
