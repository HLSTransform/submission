Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dream about being a powerful princess who could do anything she wanted. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. They were having so much fun on the swings and slides.
Suddenly, Lily heard someone shout. It was a big, mean dog that had gotten loose from its owner. The dog was growling and barking, and everyone was scared. Lily remembered her dream of being a powerful princess and decided to try and stop the dog.
She bravely walked up to the dog and shouted, "Go away, dog!" But the dog didn't listen and started to chase Lily. She tried to run away, but the dog was too fast. Sadly, Lily got bitten by the dog and had to go to the hospital. From that day on, Lily knew that dreams don't always come true and that sometimes it's better to listen to grown-ups and stay safe.
