Once upon a time there was a famous man named Joe. Joe loved to count stuff. He could count anything, from trees to toys. Every morning he would hop out of bed and count the stars in the sky. He would count the toys in his room, too. 
One day Joe decided to count something even biggerâ€”all the trees in the park! He went over to the park and began counting the trees. Then he counted the flowers, the rocks and the bugs. He even counted the people who were visiting the park! 
Joe was so proud of what he had done. He was famous for counting stuff. He told all of his friends about his counting adventures and soon everyone in the town knew about Joe and his famous counting!
The End.
