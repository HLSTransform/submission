Once upon a time, there was a little sheep named Lucy. She was a humble sheep who lived on a big farm. Lucy had many friends like cows, pigs, and chickens. They all played together every day.
One day, Lucy went for a walk in the forest near the farm. As she walked, she saw something new. Lucy discovered a big, shiny rock. She was very excited and wanted to show her friends.
Lucy ran back to the farm to tell her friends about the big, shiny rock. They all went to see it together. The humble sheep and her friends had a great day exploring the forest and playing with the big, shiny rock. And from that day on, they had even more fun on their big farm.
