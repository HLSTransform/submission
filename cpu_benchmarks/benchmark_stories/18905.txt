Lily and Ben are in the car with Mom. They are going to the park. Lily is happy. She likes the park. She likes the swings and the slide. Ben is bored. He does not like the car. He wants to play.
"Mom, are we there yet?" Ben asks.
"Soon, honey. Just a few more minutes," Mom says.
Ben sighs. He looks at Lily. She is singing a song. She is smiling. Ben is annoyed. He wants to make her stop. He pokes her arm.
"Ow! Ben, stop it!" Lily says.
"Stop what?" Ben says. He pokes her again.
"Stop poking me! It hurts!" Lily says.
"I'm not poking you. I'm tickling you," Ben says. He pokes her harder.
"Mom, Ben is poking me!" Lily cries.
"Ben, leave your sister alone. She does not like it," Mom says.
"But she is too happy. She needs to be sad like me," Ben says.
"That's not nice, Ben. You should be happy for her. And you should be happy too. We are almost at the park," Mom says.
Ben does not listen. He pokes Lily again. Lily is angry. She pokes him back.
"Hey, that's not fair!" Ben says.
"Yes, it is. You started it," Lily says.
They poke each other more and more. They do not see the big puddle on the road. Mom does not see it either. She drives into it. Splash! Water goes everywhere. The car is wet. Lily and Ben are wet. Mom is wet.
"Oops!" Mom says.
Lily and Ben stop poking. They look at each other. They look at Mom. They look at the water. They start to laugh. They are not angry anymore. They are wet and silly.
"Sorry, Mom," they say.
"It's okay, kids. It was an accident. But now we need to dry off. And maybe change our clothes," Mom says.
She pulls over to the side of the road. She gets out of the car. She opens the trunk. She takes out some towels and some spare clothes. She helps Lily and Ben get out of their wet seats. She wraps them in towels. She gives them new clothes.
"There, that's better. Now we can go to the park," Mom says.
"Yay!" Lily and Ben say.
They hug Mom. They are happy. They like the park. They like the car. They like each other. They do not poke anymore. They are good.
