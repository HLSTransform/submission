Once upon a time, there was a boy named Max. Max loved to ride his bike, but his mom always told him to wear his helmet. Max didn't like his helmet because it was big and made his head hot. 
One day, Max went to the store with his mom. He saw a shiny new helmet that he really wanted. He asked his mom if he could get it, but she said it was too expensive. Max was sad, but he understood. 
Later that day, Max went for a bike ride with his friends. They all had their helmets on, but Max didn't want to wear his old one. His friends told him he had to stay safe and wear his helmet. Max realized they were right and put his helmet on. He felt proud that he was staying safe like his friends.
