Once upon a time, there was a truck. It was bright and shiny, with a clear coat of paint. Every day, the truck went for drives around town.
One day, the truck went to the woods. The woods were very beautiful and quiet. The truck wanted to spend the day there.
So the truck drove through the woods and stopped by a big lake. The lake was clear, and the sun was shining. The truck decided to sit there and spend the day.
The truck spent the day in the sunshine by the lake. The sun made the lake sparkle, and the bird sang in the trees to keep the truck company.
At the end of the day, the truck said goodbye to the lake and drove back home. What a lovely day it had spent at the lake in the woods!
