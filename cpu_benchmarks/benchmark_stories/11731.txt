Once there was a bad man. He wanted to steal something. He went to the store and saw a beautiful toy. He was very happy. He only had to pay a small price for the toy.He took the toy and ran away. He was so happy that he laughed and laughed.
But then he was caught. The police saw him and took him away. They were mad and told him he had to pay. The bad man was very scared. He had no money and the price was very big.
In the end, the bad man was dead. He did not live to see the toy again.
