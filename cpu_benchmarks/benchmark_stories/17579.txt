Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run, jump and slide. They saw a big house with a fence. The house was dark and scary.
"Let's go see the house," Ben said. He was brave and curious.
"No, Ben, don't go," Lily said. She was scared and careful. "Mom said there is a witch in the house. She is mean and ugly. She can do bad things to us."
Ben did not listen to Lily. He ran to the fence and climbed over it. He wanted to see the witch. He thought it was fun and exciting.
Lily followed Ben. She did not want to be alone. She wanted to help Ben. She hoped the witch was not home.
Ben and Lily walked to the door of the house. They knocked on the door. No one answered. They opened the door and went inside. The house was dark and dirty. There were spiders, rats and bats. There were pots, books and candles. There was a smell of smoke and herbs.
"Hello, hello, who is there?" a voice said. It was the witch. She was in the kitchen. She was making a potion. She heard Ben and Lily. She was angry and hungry.
Ben and Lily were afraid. They tried to run away. But the witch was fast and strong. She caught them and put them in a cage. She laughed and said, "You are my dinner. You will make a tasty soup. I will gain a lot of power from you."
Lily and Ben cried. They wished they had listened to Mom. They wished they had stayed in the park. They did not want to be soup. They wanted to be free.
Then they heard a noise. It was Mom. She had followed them to the house. She had seen the witch. She was brave and smart. She had a plan.
She knocked on the door. She said in a calm voice, "Hello, witch, I am here to help you. I have some herbs and spices for your potion. They will make it better and stronger. Can I come in?"
The witch was greedy and foolish. She wanted the herbs and spices. She opened the door and let Mom in. She did not see Mom had a stick and a net.
Mom saw Ben and Lily in the cage. She winked at them. She said to the witch, "Here, take these herbs and spices. They are very special. They will make you happy and sleepy."
The witch took the herbs and spices. She put them in her potion. She stirred the potion. She smelled the potion. She drank the potion.
The potion was not good. It was bad. It made the witch sleepy and dizzy. She fell to the floor. She could not move or talk.
Mom used the stick and the net. She tied up the witch. She freed Ben and Lily. She hugged them and said, "I am so glad you are safe. I love you. Let's go home."
Ben and Lily said, "We are sorry, Mom. We were wrong. We love you. Thank you for saving us."
Mom, Ben and Lily left the house. They went back to the park. They did not look back. They did not want to see the witch again. They were happy and grateful. They learned a lesson. They never went to the house again.
