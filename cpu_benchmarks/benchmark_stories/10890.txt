Once upon a time, there was a player named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy and his friends were playing tag. Timmy was running really fast, but he got tired. 
His friend, Sally, noticed that Timmy was tired and said, "Timmy, let's take a break." Timmy agreed and they sat down on the grass. Suddenly, Sally said, "Look, Timmy! The leaves on the trees are starting to freeze!" 
Timmy was confused and asked, "What does freeze mean?" Sally explained, "It means that the leaves are turning into ice because it's getting really cold outside." Timmy was amazed and they both watched as the leaves froze. 
After a few minutes, Timmy felt better and said, "Let's go play again!" Sally smiled and they ran off to play tag once more. Even though it was cold outside, they had a great time playing together.
