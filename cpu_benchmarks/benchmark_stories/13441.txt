Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy box that was closed tight. Lily wanted to play with her toys, but she couldn't open the box. She tried and tried, but it wouldn't budge. 
Suddenly, her big brother came in and saw her struggling. He knew just what to do. He used his strong muscles to open the box for her. Lily was so happy! 
She took out her favorite doll and gave her a big kiss on the lip. Lily noticed that the doll's dress didn't fit quite right anymore. It was too small! So, Lily decided to find a new dress that would fit her doll perfectly.
