Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily was eating a yummy cookie when she felt a strange pain in her tooth. She screamed and her mommy came running to see what was wrong. 
Lily's mommy looked at her tooth and saw that it was just a harmless little cavity. She told Lily that she needed to brush her teeth every day to keep them healthy. 
Lily learned her lesson and started brushing her teeth every day. She never wanted to scream again because of a toothache! The end.
