Once there was a big turkey. He was so big and tall that he could see over the trees. He had many friends in the forest, but he was careful to watch out for foxes.
One day, he saw something very special. It was a farmer who had a basket of food. The farmer was being very careful - he was setting up a feast!
The turkey was so excited. He had never seen a feast before. He was so happy to have found it and he wanted to share it with his friends. He quickly spread the news to his friends so that they could all share the feast together.
They all had a wonderful meal of turkey, vegetables, and sweet treats. It was the best feast the turkey had ever had! He was so thankful to have shared the special feast with his friends.
