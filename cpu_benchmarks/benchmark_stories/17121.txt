Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to pick flowers in the meadow near her house. One day, as she was picking flowers, she saw an unusual bug on one of the flowers. It had bright colors and long legs.
Lily was curious about the bug and wanted to pick it up, but her mom had told her not to touch strange bugs. However, Lily had an urge to touch it and see what it felt like.
As she reached out to pick up the bug, it suddenly flew away, and Lily was left feeling disappointed. She realized that sometimes it's better to listen to her mom and not give in to her urges, especially when it comes to unusual bugs.
