Once upon a time, there was a selfish boy who had a tire. Every day, the boy would ride on his tire, but he would never let anyone else have a turn. The other kids were so sad - they wanted to ride on the tire, too.
One day, the boys' mom said, "It is not nice to be selfish! It's time to share the tire with your friends." The boy did not want to share, but his mom was very firm so he finally agreed. 
The other children were so excited - they jumped on the tire and had many turns. They laughed and smiled, and the boy was soon smiling, too. 
After that, the boy read a book with his mom. It was about sharing and being kind. The boy learned that it was much more fun when everyone played together. 
So from then on, the boy was no longer selfish. He shared the tire with his friends, and they all had a great time together.
