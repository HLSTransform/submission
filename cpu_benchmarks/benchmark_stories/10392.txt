One day, a little girl named Lisa was playing in her garden. She saw a mysterious hippo and said, "Hi, hippo!"
The hippo said, "Hi, Lisa. Would you like to stay and play with me?" Lisa was excited and said, "Yes! I would love to stay and play with you."
So, the two of them stayed and played together for the rest of the day. Every time Lisa wanted to go, the hippo would encourage her to stay a little longer and play. 
At the end of the day, the hippo said, "Remember, Lisa, it is important to spend quality time together and have fun. Don't be so hasty to run away if you have an opportunity to stay and play." 
Lisa understand the hippo's advice and realized that it was precious. She thanked the mysterious hippo for the wonderful day and they said goodbye.
The moral of the story is that it is important to always find time to play and enjoy good company. Don't be so quick to move away if someone invites you to stay and have fun.
