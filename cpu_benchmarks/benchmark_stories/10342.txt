Tim and Mia love their pet dog, Max. Max is big and brown and has thick fur. He likes to run and play and bark. Sometimes he makes Tim and Mia laugh with his funny tricks.
One day, Tim and Mia's mom says, "We have a surprise for you. We are going to the park and we can take Max with us." Tim and Mia are very excited. They put on their coats and hats and shoes. They get Max's leash and his ball. They say, "Come on, Max, let's go!"
At the park, there are many other dogs and people. Max is happy to see them. He wags his tail and sniffs the air. He runs and jumps and chases his ball. Tim and Mia throw the ball for him and he brings it back. They say, "Good boy, Max, you are so smart and fast!"
But then, Max sees a squirrel. The squirrel is small and gray and has a long tail. It runs up a tree and makes a noise. Max is curious. He wants to catch the squirrel. He forgets about his ball and his leash. He runs after the squirrel and barks.
"Max, no, come back!" Tim and Mia shout. They try to catch him, but he is too fast. He follows the squirrel from one tree to another. He does not listen to Tim and Mia or their mom. He is too busy with the squirrel.
Tim and Mia are worried. They do not want to lose Max. They do not want him to get hurt. They hope he will come back soon. They love their pet dog, Max. He is big and brown and has thick fur. He likes to run and play and bark. Sometimes he makes them laugh with his funny tricks.
