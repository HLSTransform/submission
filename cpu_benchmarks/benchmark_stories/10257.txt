Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny was very shy and didn't like to talk to other animals. One day, his mommy bunny told him that he had to go to a meeting with all the other bunnies in the forest. Benny was scared, but he didn't want to make his mommy bunny sad, so he agreed to go.
When Benny got to the meeting, he saw all the other bunnies hopping around and having fun. He felt very modest and didn't want to join in. Suddenly, a butterfly flew by and landed on Benny's nose. "Hello there!" said the butterfly. "Don't be shy, come play with us!"
Benny was surprised that the butterfly wanted to play with him. He started to hop around and have fun with all the other bunnies. But when he turned around to thank the butterfly, it had vanished! Benny was sad that his new friend had disappeared, but he was happy that he had made some new friends at the meeting.
