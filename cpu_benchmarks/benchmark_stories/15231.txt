Once upon a time, there was a playful dove. She loved to fly high in the sky. The dove had a friend, a big dog. The dog loved to run and play with the dove.
One day, the dog said, "Let's go play near the big tree!" The playful dove agreed, and they went to the big tree. But near the tree, there was a mean cat. The cat did not like the dove and the dog playing near her tree.
The dove and the dog played near the tree, but the mean cat was watching them. The cat thought, "I will not let them play near my tree." She jumped out and tried to catch the dove. The dog saw the cat and barked loudly to scare her away. The cat ran away, and the dove and the dog were safe.
The dove and the dog learned that they should not play near the big tree. They found a new place to play, far away from the mean cat. They played and had fun together, and they were happy.
