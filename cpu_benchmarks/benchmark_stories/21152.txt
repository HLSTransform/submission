Once there were two friends, David and Jenny. They both wanted to own something special, so they decided to buy a hedge. 
They worked hard and saved up their money until they had enough to buy their hedge. They were so excited to be independent and own something together.
When they went to the garden centre to buy the hedge, they saw the most beautiful hedge they had ever seen. But they didn't have quite enough money to buy it. 
So they decided to borrow some money from their friends to buy the hedge, even though they knew it was a bad idea. 
They had the hedge planted and even decorated it with little stones. But soon after, their friends started to ask for their money back.
David and Jenny had to give all their money to their friends, and sadly the hedge had to be taken away. They were very sad and all the independence they had felt was gone, too.
