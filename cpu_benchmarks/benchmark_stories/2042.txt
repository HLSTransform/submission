Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He liked to play with his toy guns and pretend to shoot bad guys. One day, Timmy's dad took him to the gas station to fill up their car. Timmy saw a man with a confused look on his face trying to figure out how to pump gas into his car. Timmy's dad helped the man and they all drove away happy. Later that day, Timmy played with his toy gun and pretended to shoot the bad guys, but he knew that helping people like his dad did at the gas station was the real way to be a hero.
