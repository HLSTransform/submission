Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she went to the park with her mom. They sat down on a bench to eat some yummy snacks. Suddenly, Lily felt very cold and started to shiver.
"Mommy, I'm cold," Lily said.
"Let's go home and get you a warm sweater," her mom replied.
As they walked home, Lily's stomach started to rumble. "Mommy, I'm hungry," she said.
"Let's make some soup when we get home," her mom said.
When they got home, Lily's older brother was being very rude. "Stop being rude," Lily's mom scolded him.
After they had some warm soup, Lily felt much better. She snuggled up in a cozy blanket and fell asleep, dreaming of playing outside in the sunshine.
