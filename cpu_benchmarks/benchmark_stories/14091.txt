Once upon a time, there was a small girl who liked to explore the ground. One day she went exploring, but when she returned she was really angry. She had discovered that someone had taken away all the beautiful things she had found on her adventure. 
She couldn't understand why anyone would do such a thing, so she started to cry. Just then, a kind old man saw what had happened. He told the little girl he would do his best to restore the ground to its former glory.
The old man worked hard, replacing all the things the little girl had found on her adventure. After some time, the ground was restored. The little girl was so happy to see all the things on the ground as they had once been. 
She thanked the old man for his kindness and promised never to forget it. From then on, the little girl was always careful not to upset the ground, so nobody ever had to restore it again.
