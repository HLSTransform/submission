Lily liked to talk to her notebook. She drew pictures of her friends, her toys, and her dreams. She gave names to her notebook pages, like Anna, Ben, and Coco. She told them stories and secrets and jokes.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She brought her notebook and a crayon. She saw a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. She wanted to play with them all. She ran to the slide and climbed up. She slid down fast and laughed. She left her notebook on a bench.
When she came back, she saw a boy holding her notebook. He was looking at her pictures. He had unknown hair and eyes. Lily felt angry and scared. She ran to the boy and shouted.
"Hey, that's mine! Give it back!"
The boy looked at her and smiled. He said.
"Hi, I'm Sam. I like your notebook. It's very pretty. Can I be your friend?"
Lily stopped shouting. She looked at him and his smile. She felt curious and shy. She said.
"Hi, I'm Lily. This is my notebook. I talk to it. It's my friend."
Sam nodded. He said.
"That's cool. I talk to my teddy bear. He's my friend. Can I see your pictures?"
Lily nodded. She said.
"Okay. But be careful. They are very special."
She took her notebook and opened it. She showed Sam her pictures and told him their names. Sam listened and asked questions. He liked her pictures and her stories. He said.
"You are very good at drawing. Can you teach me?"
Lily smiled. She said.
"Sure. I have a crayon. Do you want to draw with me?"
Sam smiled. He said.
"Yes, please. That sounds fun."
They sat on the bench and drew together. They talked and laughed and shared. They became friends. Lily was happy. She said.
"Sam, you can talk to my notebook too. It likes you."
Sam was happy. He said.
"Thank you, Lily. You are very nice. Your notebook is lucky to have you."
They hugged and smiled. They kept drawing and talking. They had a good time.
