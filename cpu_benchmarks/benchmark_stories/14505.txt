One day, the sun was shining and the sky was blue. Two friends, Jack and Sally, were walking together down a rocky dirt trail. They were taking their time, walking slow.
Jack stopped and said, “Do you know what I see?” He pointed off the trail, to a small pool of water. “It’s a pond!” he said. Sally smiled.
They sat down on a big rock and watched the pond. They saw minnows swimming around, chasing each other in circles. Then they heard a little noise.
Out of the water came a brown frog. He hopped up on the rock and looked straight at them. Jack said, “Hello there! What’s your name?” The little frog wiggled his nose and said, “Ribbit!” He didn’t have a name yet.
So Jack and Sally decided to name him Jumpy. Jumpy hopped back down the trail with them and along the way, the three of them sang songs together. They all had so much fun together!
