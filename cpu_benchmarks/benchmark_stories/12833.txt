Once upon a time, there was a poor little girl called Mia. She was three years old and she wanted to learn as much as she could.
Every day, she went to the library and tried to load her brain with as much knowledge as possible. One day, when she was looking for a new book, a librarian asked her: “Little girl, what are you doing here?” 
Mia smiled and said: “I am trying to load my brain with knowledge.” The librarian smiled back and said: “That is very admirable for someone so young. Here, take this book and you might learn something new.” 
Mia thanked him and happily read the book. Even though she was poor, her big mind was never limited by her resources.
