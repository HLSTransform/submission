Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a doll named Rosie. Lily loved Rosie very much and played with her every day. One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. She was playing on the swings when she heard a loud noise. It was an emergency! The ambulance came and took a lady to the hospital. 
Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. She prayed for the lady to be okay. Her mommy told her that praying can help when you are feeling scared or sad. Lily felt better knowing that she did something to help. 
When they got back home, Lily saw her friend playing with a new toy. She felt jealous because she wanted a new toy too. But then she remembered how she prayed for the lady and felt happy that she helped someone in need. From that day on, Lily learned that helping others is better than being jealous of them.
