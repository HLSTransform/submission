Once upon a time, there was a chubby cat. The cat lived on a farm with lots of hay. The cat liked to play in the hay every day.
One day, the cat found a big pile of hay. The cat wanted to remove some hay to make a bed. The cat started to remove the hay with its paws. The cat was very happy.
After the cat removed the hay, it had a soft bed. The chubby cat lay down in the bed and took a nap. The cat had a good sleep and was very happy. The end.
