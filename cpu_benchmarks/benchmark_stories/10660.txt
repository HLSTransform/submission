Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lisa. Lisa was three years old and loved exploring. One day, she decided to go outside and explore. 
As she was walking, she noticed something mysterious. It was a building she had never seen before! Lisa crept close to it and realized it was an operation. She had never seen one before and it made her very curious. 
Lisa bravely knocked on the door. But no one answered. She peered in the windows and noticed a lot of people in strange clothes. They were working on something mysterious. 
Lisa wanted to know more, so she decided to explore the building some more. She slowly opened the door and tip-toed inside. But then she heard someone coming and quickly ran away! 
Lisa never found out what the mysterious operation was all about, but she sure had a lot of fun exploring.
