Once upon a time, in a big tree, there lived a mighty bird. The bird was very strong and could fly very high. All the other animals liked the mighty bird.
One day, a little mouse came to the mighty bird and said, "Please, let me ride on your back. I want to see the world from up high." The mighty bird thought for a moment and then said, "Okay, little mouse. I will let you ride on my back."
So, the little mouse climbed onto the mighty bird's back, and they flew up into the sky. The little mouse was so happy to see the world from up high. They flew over the trees and the river. The little mouse said, "Thank you, mighty bird, for letting me see the world from up high."
When they were done flying, the mighty bird let the little mouse down gently onto the ground. The little mouse was very grateful and said, "You are the best, mighty bird!" From that day on, the mighty bird and the little mouse were the best of friends, and they had many more adventures together.
