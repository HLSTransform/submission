Sam was walking home from school, feeling happy. He noticed some tiny, smooth rocks on the ground that looked interesting. He bent down to take a closer look, and saw the texture of the rocks was very strange. He picked one up and decided to take it home with him.
When he got home, he showed his family the rock he had found. They all agreed it was a strange looking, even a little scary. But Sam was very excited. He wanted to repeat his discovery!
With his family in tow, Sam went back to the same spot, hoping to find more smooth rocks. After some searching, he found one that excited him even more. His family had a feeling of worry, but Sam was just excited to find another strange rock.
Suddenly the ground started to shake, and the sky turned black. Sam's family yelled for him to run with them, but he was too focused on the rock. He just wanted to repeat his discovery one more time! When the family turned to look for him, he was gone.
The earthquake had taken him, and the rock he wanted to repeat. It was a bad ending, and the family was very sad. They should have listened to the warning signs and listened to their fear - if only they had, they wouldnâ€™t have to say goodbye.
