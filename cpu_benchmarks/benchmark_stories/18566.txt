Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and make them dance around. One day, she went outside to play with her friends. They ran around and had a lot of fun.
After a while, Lily's mom called her inside for dinner. She told her to clean up her toys first. Lily didn't want to stop playing, but she knew she had to listen to her mom. She quickly cleaned up her toys and went inside to eat.
Later that night, Lily couldn't sleep. She kept thinking about her toys and how much fun she had playing with them. Suddenly, she had an idea. She stood up and went to her toy box. She took out her favorite toy, a playful teddy bear. She hugged it tight and fell asleep with a big smile on her face.
