Once there was a girl named Jill. She was a very shy girl who never said much. One day she was feeling very lonely. She decided to go sit on a bench by the park.
As she sat there, she saw a big pie. It was a delicious looking cherry pie, and it made her mouth water. She slowly reached out and grabbed the pie. She started to eat it, feeling happier as she took each bite. 
After she finished eating the pie, she heard some children laughing and playing in the park. She was still a bit shy but she decided to go join them. As she walked closer, all the children stopped to look at her. But instead of feeling scared, Jill just smiled and waved, and the children smiled back.
Jill sat down on the grass with the children and they all had lots of fun together. Every time she felt shy, she would just take a bite of the pie in her pocket for some courage. 
The children never stopped smiling and laughing, and neither did Jill. And they all had a great day, filled with fun and pie!
