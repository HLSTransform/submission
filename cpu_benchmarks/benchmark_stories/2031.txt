Once upon a time there were two friends, John and Ann. They went outside to play in the cold weather.
John said to Ann, "Let's crawl together!"
Ann said, "No, I want to do some work. I'm too cold to crawl!"
John didn't want to listen. He kept crawling and said, "C'mon Ann, it's so much fun!"
Ann stayed still and said, "No, I'm cold and want to do something else!"
John got really angry. He said, "Fine, I'm going to crawl by myself then!" He crawled away angrily.
But he quickly got cold and lonely. He realized he missed Ann! He crawled back to her and said, "Can we play together now, Ann? I'm sorry I was so mad."
Ann smiled, and said, "Yes, let's play together!"
They crawled back to the house, laughing and having fun!
