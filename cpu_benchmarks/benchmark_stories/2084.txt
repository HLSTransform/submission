Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. One day, she found a big, red apple on the ground. It looked delicious, but when she took a bite, she realized it was rotten.
Lily's mom saw her making a face and asked what was wrong. "The apple is yucky and rotten," Lily said. "Maybe we can find a better one," her mom replied. But Lily was stubborn and wanted to keep looking for a good apple. 
They walked around the orchard, but all the apples were either too high or too small. Finally, they found a tree with a perfect apple. "Yay, we found it!" Lily exclaimed. She took a big bite and smiled. It was juicy and sweet, just like the sun shining down on them.
