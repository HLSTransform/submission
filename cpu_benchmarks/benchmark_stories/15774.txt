One day, Jack and his mom went to the park. Jack saw a big hill and he wanted to climb it. His mom said, "That's too high, Jack! You'll fall down!" But Jack was determined to climb it.
He started to kick the hill. His mom laughed and said, "Jack, that's not the way to climb it! You need to be careful!" But Jack kept on kicking, his mom shook her head and said, "Jack is too ignorant to listen!"
Finally, Jack made it all the way up the hill! He screamed, "I did it!" His mom replied with a smile, "I'm so proud of you, Jack. You did it!" Jack was so happy, he ran back down the hill and shouted, "I'm the best climber ever!"
