Once upon a time there were two friends, Tom and Mary. Tom was old and Mary was young but they were best friends. One day, Tom was very sad because he didn't have an invitation to a party.
Mary saw that Tom was sad and wanted to help him. She went to the party and asked if Tom could come too. The people at the party said "yes!" and gave Tom a special invitation.
Tom was very excited. He put on his best clothes and went with Mary to the party. Everyone smiled when they saw him and he felt very special.
When the party was over, Tom thanked Mary for helping him feel so happy. He looked at her with a big smile and said, "Thanks for the invitation. You are the best friend ever!"
The moral of this story is that friends should help each other in times of need, and should always welcome an old friend with a special invitation.
