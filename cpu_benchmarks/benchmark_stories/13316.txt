Once upon a time, in an ordinary town, there lived a cat named Max. Max was tired of following the law. He wanted to escape and have fun. One day, Max saw a small hole in the fence. He thought, "This is my chance to escape!"
Max went through the hole and found a big world outside. He met another cat named Sam. Max said, "I escaped from my ordinary home. Let's play and not follow the law." Sam agreed, and they played all day long.
But, as the sun went down, Max and Sam got lost. They could not find their way back. They were very sad and scared. Max wished he had not escaped and followed the law. Now, Max and Sam were lost, and they could not go back to their ordinary homes.
