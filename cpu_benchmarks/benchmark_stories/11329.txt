John sat on the furniture. His mom put him there to be quiet. He was bored, so he decided to explore. He saw something dull and brown. He was curious about why it was here and what it was. He asked his mom, "What is this?"
His mom replied, "That's my chair. Don't touch it. It's very dull."
John began to get frustrated. He wanted to explore, but his mom wouldn't let him. "Why can't I touch it?" he asked.
His mom put her hand on his shoulder and said, "It might not look like much, but it's very special to me. It belonged to your grandfather."
John was amazed. He sat there and thought about his grandfather and all the stories he heard about him. He knew he had to be careful with the furniture, so he gently touched it. He was glad his mom had let him explore after all.
