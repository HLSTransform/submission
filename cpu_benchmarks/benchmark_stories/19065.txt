Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books and had a big bookcase in her room. One day, her mom came in and said, "Lily, it's time to clean your room." Lily didn't want to clean her room, but she knew she had to. 
As she was cleaning, Lily found a book she had never seen before. She picked it up and started to read. Suddenly, a fairy appeared and said, "That book belongs to me. You have to surrender it." Lily was scared, but she knew she had to give the book back. 
Lily gave the book back to the fairy and the fairy said, "Thank you for being honest. I will give you a special book for being so kind." The fairy gave Lily a book that was even better than the one she had found. Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you, fairy!" 
From that day on, Lily always kept her room clean so she could find more special books. And every time she read a new book, she remembered the fairy who taught her to be honest and kind.
