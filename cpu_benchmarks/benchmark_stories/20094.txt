Lily and Tom were twins who loved to play outside. They had a big yard with many trees and flowers. One day, they saw a new tree that was very different from the others. It was green all year and had sharp needles instead of leaves. It was a pine tree.
"Wow, look at that tree!" Lily said. "It is so big and pretty!"
"Can we climb it?" Tom asked. He liked to climb trees and see the sky.
"I don't know," Lily said. "It looks very high and hard. Maybe we should ask Mom first."
They ran to the house and found Mom in the kitchen. She was making cookies for them.
"Mom, Mom, can we climb the pine tree in the yard?" Tom asked.
"The pine tree?" Mom said. "That's a special tree, my dears. It's a Christmas tree."
"A Christmas tree?" Lily and Tom said. They had heard of Christmas, but they did not know much about it.
"Yes, a Christmas tree," Mom said. "It's a tree that we decorate with lights and ornaments to celebrate the birth of Jesus. He is the son of God, who loves us very much."
"Who is Jesus?" Lily asked.
"Jesus is our friend and savior," Mom said. "He came to the world to teach us how to love and be kind. He also died for us, so we can be with him in heaven."
"What is heaven?" Tom asked.
"Heaven is a wonderful place, where there is no pain or sadness, only joy and peace," Mom said. "We can go there after we die, if we believe in Jesus and follow his ways."
"How do we follow his ways?" Lily asked.
"We follow his ways by praying to him, reading his words, and doing good deeds," Mom said. "Praying is talking to him in our hearts, and telling him what we are thankful for, what we need, and what we are sorry for. Reading his words is learning from the Bible, which is his book. Doing good deeds is helping others, sharing, and being honest."
Lily and Tom listened to Mom with wonder and curiosity. They wanted to know more about Jesus and heaven.
"Can we pray to Jesus now?" Tom asked.
"Of course, my loves," Mom said. "We can pray anytime, anywhere. He always hears us and answers us. Let's pray together."
Mom held their hands and closed her eyes. Lily and Tom did the same.
"Dear Jesus, thank you for this day, and for this beautiful pine tree that reminds us of you. Thank you for our family, and for our cookies. Please help us to learn more about you, and to follow your ways. Please forgive us when we make mistakes, and help us to be better. Please bless us and keep us safe. We love you, Jesus. Amen."
"Amen," Lily and Tom said.
They opened their eyes and smiled. They felt a warm and happy feeling in their hearts.
"Mom, can we still climb the pine tree?" Tom asked.
Mom laughed and hugged them.
"Sure, you can climb the pine tree, but be careful. It's an enormous tree, and you are still little. And don't forget to thank Jesus for the fun you have."
"Okay, Mom," Lily and Tom said.
They ran to the yard and climbed the pine tree. They felt the needles prick their fingers, and the wind blow their hair. They saw the birds and the clouds, and the sun shining bright. They thanked Jesus for the pine tree, and for everything else. They had a wonderful time.
