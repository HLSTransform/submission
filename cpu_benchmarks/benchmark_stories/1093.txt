Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She wanted to study and learn lots of things. So every day, she would get her stuff, like her books and pencils, and sit down to study.
Sometimes it would hurt her. The numbers and letters looked hard. But she kept studying and eventually she got better and better.
After awhile, she had learned lots of stuff. She was so proud of herself. Then, she started to teach her friends what she had learned. They all liked learning from her.
The end.
