Samson was happy to go to the park with his mummy and daddy. He saw the park had lots of trees and a big pond. He was so excited. He jumped in the pond, splashing everyone with water. 
His daddy shook his head and said, “Samson, we regret that you decided to do that. Why didn’t you think first?” 
Samson felt an urge to be good and apologised. “Sorry, Daddy,” he said. 
His mummy smiled and said, “It's alright, Samson. I understand your impatience. As long as you learn from this, mummy and daddy will always be compassionate.” 
Samson smiled, happy that his mummy and daddy were still so kind. He promised to think before he acted in future.
