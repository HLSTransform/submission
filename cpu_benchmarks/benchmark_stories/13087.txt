Once upon a time there was a little girl who found a special jewel. It was bright and sparkly, so she thought it must be special. She put it in her pocket and went to show her mom. Her mom was so excited that she knew just what to do. She urged the little girl to go to the birthday party next door.
At the party the little girl pulled out the jewel and showed it to all of the other children. They all gasped in amazement and begged her to give it to them. She smiled and quietly shook her head no. She knew the jewel was to special to share. 
The little girl made a mild move to put the jewel away, when an older boy came running up. He pleaded with her to let him have it, but she didn't change her mind. In the end, the boy was so mad he stormed off. 
The little girl saved her special jewel and kept it in her pocket all the way home. She was happy to have something so special all of her own. And she had learned an important lesson - never to urge away something so special.
