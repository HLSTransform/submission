Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, Lily went to the park and saw a giant tree. It was so big and tall! Lily recognized the tree from the last time she was at the park. 
As she walked around the park, Lily noticed that the swings were empty. She wondered where all the children had gone. Suddenly, she saw her friends running towards her. They had been playing hide and seek! 
Lily was happy to see her friends and they all played together. They ran around, climbed the giant tree, and went down the slide. Lily had so much fun that day at the park. She couldn't wait to go back and play with her friends again.
