Once upon a time there was a boy named Tom. He was very energetic and curious. One day while walking around in the woods he saw a rough club lying on the ground. He decided to take a closer look and examine it.
Suddenly a giant man appeared in the distance. He was the owner of the club and he was very angry. He shouted: "That club is mine!"
Tom was scared and started to cry. He didn't know what to do. But then he heard a gentle voice from behind. It was a wise old lady.
She said: "Tom, don't be scared. You shouldn't take what doesn't belong to you. You should respect other people's belongings and treat them with care." 
Tom learned something valuable that day. He understood that even though he was curious and wanted to find out more about the club, it was not his to take. Even if something looks interesting, it is not polite to touch it without the permission of the owner.
