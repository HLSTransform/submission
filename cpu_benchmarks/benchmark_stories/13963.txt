Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read the newspaper with her mommy every morning. One day, she saw a unique bird outside her window. It had bright colors and a long tail. Lily couldn't stop looking at it, and she blinked a few times to make sure it was real. 
The next day, Lily went for a walk with her daddy. They saw a puppy with a big tongue and wagging tail. It was so cute and unique! Lily blinked again, and the puppy licked her face. 
Later that week, Lily went to the park with her friends. They played on the swings and slides. Suddenly, Lily saw a shooting star in the sky. She blinked and made a wish. She wished for more unique and wonderful things to see in the world.
