Once upon a time, there was a little penguin named Pippin. Pippin loved to play with his friends and slide on the icy ground. One day, Pippin noticed that the world was getting colder and colder. He felt sad because his friends were starting to leave and go somewhere else. 
Pippin's mom told him that soon the world would settle into winter, and that it would be very icy. Pippin didn't know what that meant, but he trusted his mom. 
As the days went by, Pippin noticed that the ground was getting harder and harder. He started to slip and slide, but he didn't mind because he was having fun. Then one day, Pippin's mom told him it was time to go. Pippin didn't want to leave, but he knew he had to. 
When Pippin and his family arrived at their new home, Pippin was surprised to see that everything was covered in snow and ice. He realized that his mom was right, the world had settled into winter and it was very icy. But Pippin wasn't scared anymore, he was excited to explore his new icy world with his family.
