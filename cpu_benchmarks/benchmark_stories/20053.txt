Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go fishing with her dad. One day, they went to a pond to catch some fish. Lily put her hook in the water and waited patiently. Suddenly, she felt a tug on her line. She pulled it up and saw a big, shiny fish on the end! She was so excited.
But then, a group of kids came over and started making fun of Lily's fish. They called it an "unknown" fish and said it wasn't worth anything. Lily felt sad and wanted to go home. But her dad told her to ignore the other kids and be proud of her fish. So, she held her head up high and showed off her catch to her dad. He was very proud of her. From that day on, Lily didn't care what anyone else thought about her fish. She knew it was special to her and that was all that mattered.
