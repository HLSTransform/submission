Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mommy went to the store to buy a toy. Lily saw a doll that she really wanted, but her mommy said it was too expensive. 
Lily asked, "Mommy, why can't we buy the doll? I really like it." 
Her mommy replied, "I know you like it, but it costs a lot of money. We need to value our money and spend it on important things." 
Lily understood and they left the store. As they walked home, it started to get dark outside. Lily held her mommy's hand tightly because she was scared of the dark. 
Suddenly, they heard a terrible noise coming from a nearby alley. Lily's mommy said, "Let's go the other way, it's not safe." They quickly walked away and made it home safely. 
Lily was happy to be home and snuggled up with her favorite blanket. She told her mommy, "I value you for keeping me safe." Her mommy hugged her and said, "I value you too, my sweet Lily."
