Once upon a time, there was an old tree. It had a big hook on it. The tree would stand tall in the sun every day.
One day, a little bird came to the tree. The bird saw the hook and said, "Can I sit on your hook, old tree?" The tree nodded and said, "Yes, little bird, you can sit on my hook."
The little bird sat on the hook and sang a happy song. The old tree was happy too. They became good friends and would talk every day. And so, the old tree and the little bird stood tall and happy together.
