Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lizzie. She went out for a walk in the woods one day. She looked up in the sky and saw a beautiful raven. She wondered why the raven was there. 
Lizzie continued walking and soon heard some noises in the trees. She was starting to feel a little scared, but she was brave and decided to go and take a look. As she walked closer, she saw a big black raven. It was calm and still looking at her. Lizzie was so scared she wanted to run away. 
Suddenly, the raven flew down from its perch in the tree and attacked Lizzie. Lizzie screamed and ran away. She ran as fast as she could until she was safe. She was so scared and scared of the raven she never went near the woods again. 
The raven screeched behind her, and the bad memory always stayed in her mind.
