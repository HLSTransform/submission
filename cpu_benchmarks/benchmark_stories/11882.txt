Once upon a time, there was an old lady named Mrs. Bean. She had an idea in her head that she wanted to try. She went to her neighbour's house, intent on putting a plan into action. 
Mrs. Bean knocked on the door. When her neighbour answered, she asked if he would like to guess what her idea was. The neighbour agreed, and Mrs. Bean said, "I think that if you give me food you have in the house, the feeling of guilt will go away".
The neighbour was about to turn her away, but then he realised that Mrs. Bean's idea was generous. He agreed to help and invited her into his home. He gave her a plate of food from his kitchen and Mrs. Bean exclaimed, "Oh, thank you! My idea worked perfectly".
The moral of this story is that kindness can solve problems. Looking after others is important, and when it comes to helping those in need, we should never feel too guilty to give assistance.
