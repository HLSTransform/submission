Lila and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big slide. It is purple. They want to go on the slide.
"Let's go on the slide!" Lila says.
"OK!" Ben says.
They run to the slide. They take turns. Lila goes first. She sits on the slide. She zips down. She makes a happy sound. She likes the slide.
"Wow, that was fun!" Lila says.
"My turn!" Ben says.
He sits on the slide. He zips down. He makes a loud sound. He does not like the slide. He is scared. He cries.
"Help! Help!" Ben says.
Lila runs to Ben. She tries to help him. But it is too late. Ben hits the ground. He hurts his head. He bleeds. He is sad.
"Ow! Ow!" Ben says.
Lila is sorry. She hugs Ben. She calls for help. A grown-up comes. He takes Ben to the doctor. He tells Lila to be careful.
"Slides are not for everyone. You should ask before you go on them. You should be gentle and slow. You should not push or rush. You should be safe and kind." The grown-up says.
Lila learns a lesson. She is sad for Ben. She hopes he will be OK. She says sorry to Ben. She says she will not go on the slide again. She says she will be a good friend.
