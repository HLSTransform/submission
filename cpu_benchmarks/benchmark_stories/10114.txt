Tim and Lily are twins. They like to play with their toys in their room. One day, their parent says, "We have to move to a new house. You can bring your toys, but we have to pack them in boxes first."
Tim and Lily are sad. They do not want to move. They like their room and their friends. They ask their parent, "Why do we have to move?"
Their parent says, "We have to move because I have a new job. The new house is bigger and nicer. You will have your own rooms and a big yard. You will make new friends too."
Tim and Lily are not sure. They do not like change. They say, "Can we stay here?"
Their parent says, "No, we have to go. But I have a surprise for you. Do you want to see it?"
Tim and Lily are curious. They say, "Yes, what is it?"
Their parent takes them to the car. In the back seat, there is a big cage with a puppy inside. The puppy is brown and white and has floppy ears. It wags its tail and barks.
Tim and Lily are happy. They love the puppy. They say, "Wow, a puppy! Can we keep it?"
Their parent says, "Yes, it is yours. It is a gift for moving. You can name it and take care of it. It will be your new friend."
Tim and Lily hug their parent and the puppy. They say, "Thank you, parent. You are the best. Moving is not so bad after all. Maybe it will be fun."
Their parent smiles and says, "You are welcome, Tim and Lily. I love you. Moving will be fun. We will have a new adventure together."
