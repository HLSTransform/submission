Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play with their toys. They had many toys because their parents were wealthy and loved them very much. They had dolls, cars, trains, books, puzzles, and a big plane that could fly in the air.
One day, Tom and Lily decided to play with the plane in the backyard. They took turns to make the plane zoom and soar and loop in the sky. They pretended they were pilots and passengers and had fun.
"Look, Lily, I can make the plane go very high!" Tom said, holding the remote control.
"Wow, Tom, that's amazing! Can I try?" Lily asked, reaching for the remote.
"OK, but be careful. Don't make the plane crash!" Tom warned, handing her the remote.
Lily smiled and pressed the buttons. She made the plane go up and down and left and right. She was having a blast.
"Look, Tom, I can make the plane do a flip!" Lily said, making the plane spin in the air.
"Wow, Lily, that's awesome! But watch out for the tree!" Tom shouted, pointing to a big tree in the corner of the yard.
Lily looked and saw the tree. She tried to steer the plane away, but it was too late. The plane hit the tree and fell to the ground. It broke into pieces.
"Oh no, Lily, you broke the plane!" Tom cried, running to the plane.
"I'm sorry, Tom, I didn't mean to!" Lily sobbed, following him.
They both looked at the plane and felt very sad. They loved the plane and had so much fun with it. They wondered if their parents would be angry with them.
"Tom, Lily, what happened?" their mother asked, coming out of the house. She saw the plane and the twins.
"Mommy, we were playing with the plane and Lily made it crash into the tree and it broke!" Tom explained, pointing to the plane.
"Mommy, I'm sorry, I didn't see the tree and I couldn't stop the plane and it broke!" Lily repeated, hugging the plane.
Their mother looked at them and smiled. She hugged them both and said, "It's OK, my loves. I know you didn't mean to break the plane. It was an accident. Accidents happen sometimes. The plane is just a toy. It can be fixed or replaced. But you are my children. You are more important than any toy. I love you very much."
Tom and Lily felt better. They hugged their mother and said, "We love you too, Mommy. Thank you for being so nice to us. You always provide us with everything we need and want. You are the best mommy in the world."
Their mother kissed them and said, "You are welcome, my loves. You are the best twins in the world. Now, let's go inside and have some cookies and milk. How does that sound?"
Tom and Lily nodded and smiled. They followed their mother inside, leaving the plane behind. They knew they would play with it again someday, but for now, they were happy to have their mother and each other.
