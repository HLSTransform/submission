One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mommy. They sat on a bench and watched the birds fly. Suddenly, Lily saw a whistle on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her mommy.
"Look mommy, I found a whistle!" Lily exclaimed.
"That's great, Lily. Can you pull the string and make it whistle?" her mommy asked.
Lily tried to pull the string, but it was too hard. "It's not working, mommy. The string is not flexible," she said.
Her mommy smiled and helped her pull the string. The whistle made a loud sound that scared the birds away. Lily giggled and said, "I love my new whistle!"
