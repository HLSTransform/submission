One day, Jane and her family went on a picnic. She was very excited, and ran ahead to find the perfect spot.
Suddenly, Jane heard a loud noise. She felt frightened and looked around. She saw a big, furry animal in front of her. She screamed and started to run back to her family, who heard her and ran to help. 
The animal was a big bear! Jane's father bravely walked towards it and tried to scare it away. He stamped his feet and shouted, and the bear ran away. Everyone was happy and relieved. 
The family all hugged Jane tightly, and they sat down to enjoy the rest of their picnic. 
Jane and her family decided to never go on a picnic again without a grown up leading the way as she had been frightened earlier by the bear. Every time her father told the story, Jane would giggle and repeat, "be careful of bears".
