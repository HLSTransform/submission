Once upon a time, there was a big, wide space. In that space, there was a bird. The bird loved to fly. Every day it would fly up, up and away.
It flew so high, that it could look down on the ground below. It could see the big, wide world from up there. It was so fun!
Sometimes, the bird even flew higher. It flew high enough that it could look up and see the big, wide sky. It was so big and bright!
Then, one day, the bird flew even higher. It flew into space. The sky was black, but the stars were so bright and pretty.
The bird seemed to fly forever in the big, wide space. It loved exploring up there.
And that's how the bird learned that the sky was full of wonders and wonders to explore.
