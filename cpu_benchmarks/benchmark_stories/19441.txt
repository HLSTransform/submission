Once upon a time there was a boy called Sam. He was three years old and very alert. He lived happily with his mum and dad in a nice house. One day, mum was cooking dinner for Sam and his family. She left the kitchen for a moment, but when she returned she saw that Sam had broken the plate!
Mum was very angry and scolded Sam. He started to cry and his mum felt bad so she hugged him and said "It's okay Sam, don't worry". Then she kissed his forehead and asked him to be more gentle when he touched things.
Sam was an alert boy and promised he would be. Since then he's been very careful and always listens to his mum. He knows that it's important to not break things because it hurts others and makes them sad.
