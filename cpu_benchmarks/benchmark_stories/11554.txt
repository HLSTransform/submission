Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily got sick and had to stay in bed. Her mom gave her some medicine to help her feel better. The medicine was not her favorite, but it was the only one available.
While Lily was in bed, she heard her friends playing outside. She wanted to join them, but her mom said she needed to rest. Lily decided to peek out of her window to see what her friends were doing. She saw them playing with a big, bouncy ball.
After a few days, the medicine started to work, and Lily began to feel better. She was so happy that she could go outside and play with her friends again. They all played with the big, bouncy ball and had lots of fun. Lily was glad that the medicine was available to help her get better.
