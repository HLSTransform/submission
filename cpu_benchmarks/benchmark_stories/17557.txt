One day, a brown bunny named Mark went to the park with his mom. He liked to hop on the grass and look for flowers and bugs. He saw a big yellow slide and wanted to try it.
"Mom, can I go on the slide?" he asked.
"Sure, Mark, but be careful. It is very high and fast," his mom said.
Mark hopped to the slide and climbed up the steps. He felt excited and scared at the same time. He sat on the top and looked down. He saw other kids laughing and sliding.
"Ready, set, go!" he said to himself and pushed off.
He slid down very fast and felt the wind in his ears. He closed his eyes and screamed. He landed on the soft sand and opened his eyes. He felt happy and proud.
"Wow, that was fun!" he said.
He looked up and saw his mom smiling and clapping.
"Good job, Mark! You are very brave!" she said.
Mark hopped to his mom and hugged her.
"Thank you, mom. Can I go again?" he asked.
"Of course, Mark. But first, let's have a snack. I brought some carrots and water for you," she said.
Mark nodded and followed his mom to the bench. He ate his carrots and drank his water. He felt full and thirsty.
"Mom, I love you. You are the best," he said.
"I love you too, Mark. You are my sweet bunny," she said.
They cuddled and watched the other kids play. Mark felt happy and safe. He liked the park and the slide. He liked to hop and explore. He liked his mom and himself. He was a brown bunny named Mark.
