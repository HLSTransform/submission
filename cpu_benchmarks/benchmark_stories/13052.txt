Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Penelope. One day, Penelope wanted to paint something special. She had lots of paint, but she only had an old brush. Penelope's mom saw her and said, "Don't worry, I have something that can help." Penelope's mom took her to her ears. Penelope happily said, "What did you bring me?" Her mom replied, "I brought you my reliable paintbrush." Penelope said, "It looks perfect! Now I can start painting!"
Penelope began to paint. She started with red, then moved to blue, green, and yellow. She created a beautiful painting. When she finished, Penelope said, "Mom, I made something special with your reliable paintbrush." Penelope's mom smiled and hugged her. She said, "You did a wonderful job. I'm proud of you." Penelope smiled and said, "Thanks, Mom!"
