Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a cat and a dog. They did not like each other. They would always fight and make noise. The cat would hiss and the dog would bark. They hated being close to each other.
One day, a big, mean dog came to their house. He was a threat to the cat and the dog. They knew they had to work together to make the big dog go away. But they were foolish and did not want to help each other.
The cat tried to fight the big dog alone, but he was too small. The dog tried to fight the big dog too, but he was not strong enough. The big dog won and stayed in their house. The cat and the dog were sad because they did not work together, and now they had to live with the big, mean dog.
