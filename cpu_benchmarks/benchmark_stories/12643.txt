Once upon a time, there was a playful bunny named Benny. Benny loved to hop around in the grass and play with his friends. One day, Benny saw a hedge and decided to hide behind it. His friends couldn't find him, so they started to tease him by saying "Where's Benny? Where's Benny?" 
Benny thought it was funny and started to hop out from behind the hedge to surprise his friends. They all laughed and played together. As the sun started to set, Benny and his friends went back to their burrows to rest. Benny was happy that he had such fun friends to play with and he couldn't wait to do it again tomorrow. The end.
