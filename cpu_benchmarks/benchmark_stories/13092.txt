Once upon a time, there was a girl who wanted a special piece. She looked everywhere for it, but she couldn't find it. She asked her friends if they had seen it, but they all said no.
She was so envious of her friends, who had the special piece. One day, she found some more pieces. They all fit together to form the special piece she was looking for.
The girl was so happy! She showed it to her friends, who were envious. She wanted to share her joy, so she gave them a piece. They all played with the pieces together until the sun went down.
The day had to end, but the girl was happy. She had found the special piece she had been looking for, and she was very glad.
