Once upon a time, in a big, dark house, there lived a stubborn little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around the house. One day, while playing, she heard a loud roar coming from the basement. Lily was scared but also very curious.
She went down the stairs to see what made the roar. In the basement, she saw a big, white ghost! The ghost said, "Boo! I am the ghost of this house. Leave now or I will scare you more!" Lily was very brave and said, "No, I live here too. We can be friends and play together."
The ghost didn't want to be friends at first, but Lily was very stubborn. She kept asking the ghost to play with her. Finally, the ghost agreed and they played together all day long. The ghost wasn't scary anymore, and they both had lots of fun. From that day on, Lily and the ghost became best friends, and the house was never scary again.
