Once upon a time, there was a fierce little girl named Mia. She had big dreams and was always looking for ways to make them come true.
One day, Mia found a note on her doorstep. It said that if she could balance a special ball on her finger for one whole minute, her dream would come true. Mia was so excited!
Mia quickly set to work. She tried and tried to balance the ball, but she just couldn't. Mia was getting frustrated, so she asked her mom for help.
Mia's mom said, "Try to focus on the ball and take a few deep breaths. With some practice, you can do it. I believe in you."
Mia tried again, and this time she managed to balance the ball for one minute. When the time was up, Mia cheered in excitement.
From that day on, Mia never stopped believing in her dreams. As long as she worked hard and kept her balance, she knew she could make them come true!
