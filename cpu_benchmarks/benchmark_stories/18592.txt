Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mom took her to the office where she worked. Lily was very excited to see where her mom worked. 
When they got to the office, Lily saw lots of people working on computers and talking on phones. She asked her mom what they were doing. 
Her mom said, "They are working hard to add up numbers and make important things for people to use." Lily was amazed and said, "I want to work here too when I grow up!" 
Her mom smiled and said, "You can be anything you want to be, Lily." Lily felt very happy and excited to think about her future.
