Lily likes peaches. She likes to eat them when they are sweet and juicy. She likes to feel the fuzz on the skin. She likes to spit out the pit.
One day, Lily goes to the park with her mom. She sees a big tree with many peaches on it. She wants to pick one, but they are too high. She asks her mom to help her, but her mom says no. She says the peaches belong to someone else.
Lily is sad. She walks around the park and plays on the swings. She sees a dog and a cat. She sees a flower and a bee. She sees a bird and a worm. She forgets about the peaches.
Then, she sees something shiny on the grass. She runs to it and picks it up. It is a coin. It has a picture of a man and a number. Lily does not know what it means, but she thinks it is pretty. She shows it to her mom. Her mom says it is a lucky coin. She says Lily can buy something with it.
Lily is happy. She thinks of what she can buy. She sees a man with a cart. He has many fruits on it. He has apples and bananas and oranges. And he has peaches. Lily runs to the cart and gives the man the coin. He gives her a peach. Lily says thank you and smiles.
Lily eats the peach. It is sweet and juicy. She feels the fuzz on the skin. She spits out the pit. She thinks she is lucky. She lies on the grass and looks at the sky. She sees a cloud that looks like a peach. She closes her eyes and dreams of more peaches.
