Once there was a good girl named Amy. She was three years old and loved the holidays.
Amy wanted to make all of her friends happy, so she thought of a special holiday gift to give them. She made special cards and put them in pretty boxes.
Her friends thought the cards were wonderful. They showed her lots of love and appreciation.
But one of the boys still wanted to have some fun. He started to tease Amy about her cards. She didn't like it and started to cry.
Her friends comforted her and chased the boy away. They told her that the boy didn't mean it, he was just trying to be silly. 
Amy smiled and felt better. She knew that holidays were about being good and sharing love with others.
