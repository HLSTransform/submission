Once upon a time, there were two friends who lived in the same yard. Their names were Sam and Alex. Sam loved to play in the yard while Alex liked to sit and relax.
One day there was a toy in the yard that both Sam and Alex wanted to play with. "It's my turn to play with the toy!" shouted Sam. "No, it's my turn!" yelled Alex. They started arguing back and forth because they were both very selfish.
Suddenly, Sam shouted, "I know! We can take turns and value each other's turn." Alex agreed and they started taking turns with the toy. 
When it was time for Sam's turn, he couldn't find Alex. He called him multiple times but Alex didn't show up. After some time Sam realized Alex was not coming back to value his turn. Sam felt very sad and never saw Alex again in the yard. 
The end.
