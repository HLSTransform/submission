Sara and Ben were friends who liked to play outside. One day, they decided to wake up very early and see the sunrise. They set their alarm clock and put on their warm clothes.
They sneaked out of their houses and met at the park. It was still dark and cold, but they were excited. They ran to the top of the hill, where they could see the sky. They waited for the sun to come up.
"Look, Sara, the sun is coming!" Ben said, pointing at the horizon. "It is so pretty and bright!"
"Yes, it is, Ben!" Sara said, smiling. "I'm so happy we did this!"
They hugged and watched the sun rise. It was a beautiful sight. They felt warm and happy.
But then, Sara started to feel dizzy. She had not eaten anything since last night, and she had run too fast. She felt sick and weak. She fell to the ground.
"Sara, are you okay?" Ben asked, worried. He tried to help her up, but she was too heavy. He did not know what to do.
"Ben, I don't feel good," Sara said, faintly. "I need to go home. I need my mom."
Ben felt scared and sad. He wanted to encourage Sara, but he did not know how. He looked around, but there was no one else. He felt alone and helpless.
He started to cry. He wished they had never seen the sunrise. He wished they had stayed in bed. He wished Sara was not sick. He wished he could make her better. But he could not. He could only cry.
