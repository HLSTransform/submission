Once upon a time there were three friends. They were called Joey, Celina, and Eva. They were very good friends and loved spending time playing together.
One day they were playing when they hit a big number. It was a secret number that nobody had ever seen before! They were so excited they quickly looked inside the number.
To their surprise, they saw a jar full of oil. It was very shiny and they all wanted to pick it up. Since they were so excited, they all reached for it at the same time and accidentally knocked it over.
The oil spilled everywhere! They were so deaf they didn't hear their parents calling for them. Joey, Celina, and Eva spent the next few hours cleaning up the oil. 
When they were done, their parents praised them for their hard work and the friends shared a big hug before going home.
