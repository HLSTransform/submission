Once there was a generous ant. The ant always helped others, even though he was very small. He loved helping out his friends. 
One day, he saw a candle in the middle of the forest. He wanted to give it to his friends. So, he grabbed it and took it away.
But when he came close to it, he heard something. It was his friends saying, "We don't want that candle. It will bite us."
The generous ant was surprised. He asked his friend, "What do you mean it will bite you?" 
His friend replied, "Sometimes candles bite when you touch them!"
The generous ant was sad. He didn't want his friends to get hurt. So, he decided to bring the candle back to where he found it. 
He hoped his friends would understand that even though he was generous, it was important to keep them safe.
