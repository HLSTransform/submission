Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, while playing in the park, she fell down and hurt her knee. It was very sore and she couldn't walk properly. 
Lily's mommy came to help her and gave her a big hug. She told Lily that she needed to rest her knee and let it heal. Lily's knee felt better after a while, but it was still a little stiff. So, her mommy helped her stretch her leg gently. 
Lily thought that her mommy was very kind and gentle, not harsh like some people can be. She was happy to have her mommy there to help her and make her feel better. From that day on, Lily was more careful when playing outside, but she still loved to explore and have fun.
