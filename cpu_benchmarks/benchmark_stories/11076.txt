Tom and Lily are playing with paper. They like to fold the paper and make different shapes. Tom folds a paper into a long and thin strip. He says, "Look, Lily, I made a snake!"
Lily likes the snake. She wants to make one too. She folds a paper like Tom. But her paper is not long and thin. It is short and wide. She says, "Oh no, my snake is fat!"
Tom laughs. He says, "That's not a snake, Lily. That's a worm!" He shows her how to fold the paper again. He says, "You have to fold it like this, and this, and this."
Lily tries to fold the paper like Tom. She folds it once, twice, three times. But she still can't make it long and thin. She says, "It's too hard, Tom. I can't do it."
Tom has an idea. He says, "Don't worry, Lily. I have something to help you." He runs to his room and comes back with a button. He says, "Look, Lily, this is a button. You can use it to make your snake longer."
He gives the button to Lily. She puts it on the end of her paper. She says, "Wow, Tom, you're right. The button makes my snake longer. Thank you, Tom!"
Tom and Lily are happy. They play with their paper snakes and button. They make them slither and hiss. They have fun.
