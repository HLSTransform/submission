Once upon a time, there was a small boy. His name was Joe. Joe was a very sad and miserable boy. He had a big hole in his backyard. He called it the pit.
Joe never knew what to do with the pit. He was tired of feeling so sad and miserable. One day Joe had an idea. He decided to tie some colorful ribbons around the sides of the pit. He used his favorite colors - red, yellow, and blue.
After he tied the ribbons to the pit, Joe stood back and smiled. Something incredible had happened. His pit had been transformed into something beautiful. He was so happy!
Joe called the pit his rainbow pit. Whenever he felt sad or miserable, he would come out to the pit and look at all the different colors.
The end!
