There was a package on the table. It was weird and shiny. The little girl wanted to grab it. She wanted to know what was inside. She reached for it, but it was too high for her to reach. 
The girl was sad. She stood on her tippy-toes but she still couldn't stretch far enough. Then she had an idea. She grabbed a chair and used it to help her reach the package. 
She was so excited when her fingers touched the package. She cradled it in her hands and pulled it close to her chest. 
She was also very curious. She carefully lifted the lid and peeked inside. It was full of candy! The girl's eyes lit up with excitement. She quickly snatched one and popped it in her mouth and enjoyed it. 
She felt so happy. She couldn't wait to share her sweet surprise with all her friends.
