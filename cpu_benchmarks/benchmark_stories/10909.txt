Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One night, Lily was very tired and she yawned a lot. Her mommy told her it was time to brush her teeth and go to bed. 
Lily brushed her teeth with her pink toothbrush and then climbed into her cozy bed. She was so tired that she fell asleep right away. 
Suddenly, she heard a noise outside her window. It was a little bird who had fallen out of its nest. Lily felt very compassionate towards the bird and decided to help. She gently picked up the bird and put it back in its nest. 
The bird chirped happily and Lily smiled. She was happy to have helped the little bird. Then, she yawned again and fell asleep, dreaming of all the animals she could help one day.
