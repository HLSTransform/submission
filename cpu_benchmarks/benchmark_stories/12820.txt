A little girl named Sarah was playing in the backyard. She had a bright red whip that her Daddy had bought her. She love to play with it and was having lots of fun. She spun it and twirled it around, feeling like she was a real cowboy! 
Suddenly, Sarah heard a noise coming from behind the big tree. She wondered who it was and so she crept closer to the tree and peeked around the corner. 
It was her Daddy! He was trying on the new hat that he had just bought. He turned to Sarah and said, "What do you think? Do you think this hat fits me?" 
Sarah nodded her head and said, "It's perfect, Daddy! You look fit in it!" She giggled and ran around him, still playing with her whip. 
Sarah and her Daddy spent the rest of the day together, pretending that they were cowboys riding the wild west, and they both had a lot of fun!
