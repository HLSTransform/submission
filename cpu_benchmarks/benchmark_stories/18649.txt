Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pet raven named Jack. Jack was different from other birds because he had shiny feathers that shone in the sun.
One day, Lily and Jack were playing in the park when they met a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a shiny toy car that he was playing with. Lily asked Timmy if she could play with the car, but Timmy said no.
Lily was sad, but Jack had an idea. He flew up into the tree and grabbed a shiny acorn. He brought it back down and gave it to Timmy. Timmy was so happy with the shiny acorn that he gave Lily his toy car to play with.
Lily and Jack played with the toy car all day, and they were very happy. They learned that sometimes being different can be a good thing, and that shining bright can make others happy too.
