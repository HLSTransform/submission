Once upon a time, there was a large queen. She lived in a big castle, with lots of people. 
One day, the queen decided to split up her kingdom. She said that each person would have their own piece of land. 
Everyone was so happy, they celebrated with a big party. They ate lots of food, and danced all day. 
But soon, all the people became sad. They missed being together, and wanted all the land to be back together as a big kingdom. 
The queen smiled and said, "I have an idea". She used her magic powers to join all the pieces back together. 
The people cheered and thanked the queen for bringing them back together. They celebrated again and had lots of fun. 
The queen and her people all lived happily ever after.
