Once upon a time, there was a wild creature who wanted to heal a sick animal. He found a magical pillow which he believed would help. 
He took it to the animal, who lay there weak and helpless. The wild creature spoke softly to the animal: "Take this pillow, it will make you feel better." 
The animal looked at the pillow and asked, "Will it heal me?" 
The wild creature smiled and said, "Yes, it will heal you. Trust me." 
The animal curled up with the pillow and after a few minutes, slowly he began to feel better. Soon he was up and running around the meadow, happy and healed.
The wild creature cheered and was so happy that the animal was healed. He hugged the animal and smiled with relief. 
From then on, the wild creature travelled all around with his magical pillow, helping to heal any sick animals he could find.
