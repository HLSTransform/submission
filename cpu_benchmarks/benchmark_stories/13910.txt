Once upon a time, there was a sleepy cat named Tom. Tom lived in a small house with his best friend, a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to draw on her big blackboard.
One sunny day, Sue and Tom played a fun game of kick the ball. They laughed and had a great time. But Tom was very sleepy. He yawned and stretched, then lay down by the blackboard.
Sue saw that Tom was sleepy, so she drew a picture of him on the blackboard. Tom opened his eyes and saw the drawing. He smiled and purred, then went back to sleep. Sue was happy that her sleepy cat liked the picture, and they both had a good nap.
