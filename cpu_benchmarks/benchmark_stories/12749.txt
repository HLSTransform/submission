Once upon a time there was a family of bears who lived in the forest. The bear family loved going on long walks together and collecting different things they found during their walk.
One day during their walk the bear family stumbled upon an empty picnic basket. Dad bear said, “Oh! What a nice surprise! Let’s collect that and take it home with us.”
When they got home, the family of bears opened the picnic basket with excitement. To their surprise there was a big steak in the basket!
Mom bear said, “Let’s not eat the steak. We don’t know who it belongs to and it’s not nice to take something that does not belong to us. We should take it back and put it in the basket where we found it.” 
So the bear family put the steak back into the picnic basket, and headed back to where they had found it. 
When they got there, they saw another family of bears who looked very happy. They had found the steak that the bear family had put back in the picnic basket. 
The moral of the story is that it’s important to always respect other people’s things and think of others before ourselves.
