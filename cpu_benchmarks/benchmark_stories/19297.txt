Once upon a time there was a foolish cat. He was always getting into trouble. One day he decided he wanted to change his ways. He went to the pond and wanted to catch a fish. But he was too silly and the fish laughed at him. Instead of catching the fish, he met a little frog. 
The frog hopped up the the cat and said, "What are you trying to do, silly cat?" The cat responded, "I was planning to change my ways and do something nice. I thought I would try to catch a fish." The frog smiled and said, "I understand, but why don't you help me instead?" 
The foolish cat agreed and he spent the rest of the day helping the frog. Every time he did something good the frog sang, "Well done, foolish cat!" 
When it was time to go home, the cat was happy. He left the pond feeling proud. From that day on the foolish cat always remembered the frog's advice and was very careful to do nice things and make the right changes.
