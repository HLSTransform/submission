Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park with their mom. One day, they see a big bus on the street. The bus is yellow and has many windows.
"Look, mom, a bus!" Sara says. She points at the bus.
"Yes, that's a bus. It takes people to different places," mom says.
"Can we go on the bus, mom?" Ben asks. He likes to ride on things that move.
"Not today, Ben. We have to go home soon. Maybe another day," mom says.
The bus stops at a red light. Sara and Ben see some people inside the bus. They wave at them. Some people wave back. Sara and Ben smile.
"Hello, people!" Sara says.
"Hello, kids!" a lady says. She has a red hat and glasses.
The light turns green. The bus starts to move. Sara and Ben keep waving. The lady waves too.
"Bye, people! Bye, bus!" Ben says.
"Bye, kids! Have a nice day!" the lady says.
The bus goes away. Sara and Ben stop waving. They look at mom.
"Mom, that was fun!" Sara says.
"Yes, it was. You are very friendly and persistent. You made the people happy," mom says.
"Can we wave at more buses, mom?" Ben asks.
"Sure, Ben. But only when we are in the park. Not when we are on the street. That's dangerous," mom says.
"Okay, mom. We understand," Sara and Ben say.
They hug mom. Then they run to the swings. They have more fun in the park.
