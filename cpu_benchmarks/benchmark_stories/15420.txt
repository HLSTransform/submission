Once upon a time there was a man and a little girl. The man wanted to support the girl and make her happy. 
One day the man saw a apple tree. He thought this might make the little girl smile. He picked a apple for the girl and gave it to her. 
The little girl was so excited to have the apple! She took a bite, expecting it to be sweet, but quickly found out it was sour. She made a yucky face and handed it back to the man.
The man laughed and said "Don't worry. I'll support you no matter what." He threw the apple away and gave the little girl a big hug.
The little girl smiled and they went on their way. She knew that the man would always be there to support her, even when things didn't go as planned.
