Little Tommy was very anxious. He wanted to be a musician, like his mom and dad. Every day, he practiced playing the drum. 
One day, Tommy was having lots of fun playing his drum when suddenly the ground started to shake. He heard a loud crash and looked up to see that a big monster had destroyed the house! 
Tommy started to cry, begging the monster to stop. But the monster was determined to destroy everything. "I'm sorry, little boy," said the monster, "but I must destroy." 
But then, something amazing happened. A bright light filled the room, and Tommy's mom and dad came out of it. They were holding a magical drumstick that made even the most powerful monsters crumble. 
Tommy's parents used the drumstick to force the monster away. They saved the day!
Tommy was no longer anxious. He was proud to be a musician, and heroes too!
