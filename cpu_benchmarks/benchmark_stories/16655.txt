Once upon a time, there was a big gorilla named George. George lived in a jungle with lots of other animals. One day, George saw a nosy monkey peeking through his window. George didn't like it and said, "Why are you looking at me, monkey?"
The monkey replied, "I just wanted to see what you were doing, George. You always look so serious."
George was upset and said, "It's not nice to spy on others. Please don't do it again."
The monkey apologized and promised not to be nosy anymore. From that day on, George and the monkey became good friends and spoke to each other every day. They learned that it's important to be respectful of others and their privacy.
