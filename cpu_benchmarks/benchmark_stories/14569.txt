Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Daisy. Daisy was three years old and very clever. Everyone who knew her said that she was reliable. 
Every day, Daisy's mum would give her a challenge to help her learn and grow. One day mum said, "Daisy, can you manage to bring me a vegetable from the garden?" Daisy smiled and said, "Yes!"
Daisy went to the garden and looked around. She found tomatoes, peppers, and carrots. She tried to pick a tomato, but it was too heavy. Eventually, she managed to pick up a carrot. She took it back to her mum and said, "I found a vegetable". 
Mum smiled and said, "Well done Daisy, you did a great job. You are such a reliable little girl". Daisy smiled and said, "Thank you, mum!".
