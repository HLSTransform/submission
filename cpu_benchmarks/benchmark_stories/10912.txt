Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very happy because her birthday was coming soon. Her mommy told her she would receive lots of presents.
One day, Lily and her family felt a big shake. It was an earthquake! Everyone was scared, but they were all okay. The next day, some helpful people came to their house to check if everything was okay.
Lily was very thankful for the helpful people. She asked her mommy if she could make them a thank you card. Her mommy said yes and they made a card together. The helpful people were very happy to receive the card from Lily.
