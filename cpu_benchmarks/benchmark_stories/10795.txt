Once upon a time, there was a cute little mouse who lived in a house. The mouse loved to display all of its shiny things on a shelf. One day, a big cat came to the house and saw all the shiny things on the shelf. The cat wanted to take all the shiny things for itself.
The mouse was scared and tried to hide, but the cat found it. The cat chased the mouse all around the house. The mouse tried to escape, but the cat was too fast. In the end, the cat caught the mouse and took all of its shiny things.
The mouse was sad and had to start all over again. It learned that sometimes it's best to keep things hidden and safe from others who might want to take them away.
