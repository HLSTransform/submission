Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy figure that she loved to play with every day. One day, Lily accidentally dropped her toy figure under the couch. She tried to reach it, but her arms were too short. She felt helpless and sad. 
Suddenly, her big brother came into the room. He saw Lily's sad face and asked her what was wrong. Lily told him about her toy figure under the couch. Her brother knew just what to do. He got down on the floor and pulled the toy figure out from under the couch. 
Lily was so happy and grateful to her brother for helping her. She hugged him and thanked him for being so kind. From that day on, Lily made sure to keep her toy figure in a safe place where it wouldn't get lost again. The end.
