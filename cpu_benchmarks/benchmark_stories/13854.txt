Once upon a time, in a large house, there lived a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to read big books with many pages. Every day, she would sit in her room and read the pages one by one.
One day, Mia found a very special book. It had a picture of a large tree on the cover. She opened the book and started to read the pages. In the story, the large tree was a wishing tree. Mia wished she could have a tree like that.
That night, Mia went to bed and prayed. She prayed for a large wishing tree to grow in her backyard. The next morning, she looked out her window and saw a large tree in her yard. Mia was so happy! She ran outside to the tree and made a wish.
