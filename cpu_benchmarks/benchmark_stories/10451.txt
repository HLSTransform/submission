Once upon a time, there was a brave bird called Woody. Woody wanted to fly to the highest mountain to look around. All of Woody's friends told him to be careful. 
Woody asked his friend, Dexter, "How do I get to the top of the mountain?". Dexter replied, "To get to the top, you will need to climb."
So, Woody spread his wings and began to climb. As he climbed, Woody noticed a yellow, sticky liquid on the rocks. Woody knew this was poison and he had to be careful. He carefully stepped around the poison and kept climbing. 
After a few hours, Woody reached the top of the mountain. He jumped off a cliff and enjoyed the beautiful view. Woody was so proud of himself and he knew his friends would be too!
