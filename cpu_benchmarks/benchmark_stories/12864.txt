Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Paul. He was three years old and he owned a nice scooter. He liked playing with it in the garden and he would use it every day.
One day, his mum called him into the house. She asked him, "Would you like a new scooter Paul? It's very nice!" Paul was so excited. He smiled and said, "Yes please!"
So, Paul went to the shop and picked out a new scooter. It was red and it had flashing blue lights at the front. He was so happy to own it. 
He took it home and showed his mum. She said, "It's very nice Paul. You look like you're having so much fun already!" Paul nodded and stayed out in the garden playing with his scooter until it was dark.
