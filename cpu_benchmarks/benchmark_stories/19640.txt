Once upon a time there was a boy. His name was Jack and he was three years old.
Today, Jack had a baseball. He was so happy that he put it on the floor and started to play. He curled his little fingers around it and began to roll it around.
Suddenly, Jack lost his grip and the baseball slipped away from him. It rolled across the room and stopped at the feet of his Dad.
Jack's Dad picked up the baseball and took it to the backyard. He put it down in front of Jack and said, "Let's see if this baseball fits in your hand."
Jack smiled and reached for the baseball. It felt just right and he beamed with pride. 
Jack thanked his Dad and grabbed the baseball. He ran around the yard with it, feeling a deep sense of joy and satisfaction. His Dad smiled and watched him play.
