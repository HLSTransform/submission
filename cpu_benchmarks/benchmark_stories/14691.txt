Mommy was very organized. She had a plan for everything she did. When she came home from work, she would sit on the couch and question if everything was done.
One day, there was a new couch in the living room. It was a big red one, with lots of fluffy pillows. Mommy smiled and sat down to question if it was comfortable. 
Before long, 3-year-old Tommy came running into the living room. He jumped on the couch, and screamed out with joy. Mommy laughed and the two of them soon settled into the comfortable sofa. 
Tommy asked Mommy lots of questions, and every once in awhile Mommy would answer them. She also asked Tommy questions and he answered them carefully and accurately. Soon, the couch was cozy and the two were happily organized.
