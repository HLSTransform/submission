Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her colorful dress. One day, her mom noticed that Lily's dress was dirty and had a stain on it. 
Mom said, "Lily, we need to improve your dress. Let's wash it with soap and water." 
Lily replied, "Okay, Mommy. Can I help you wash it?" 
Mom said, "Of course, you can help me. First, we need to take off the dress and put it in the water with soap." 
Lily took off her dress and put it in the water. They washed the dress together and hung it up to dry. When the dress was dry, it looked clean and colorful again. 
Lily said, "Thank you, Mommy. My dress looks so pretty now." 
Mom replied, "You're welcome, Lily. Remember to take care of your clothes, so they stay colorful and clean."
