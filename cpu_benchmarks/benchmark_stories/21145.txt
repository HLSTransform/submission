Once there was a small puppy who was so playful. She loved to run around and have fun. One day, the puppy wanted to explore and find something new. She trotted through the forest, sniffing and snorting at the different plants and animals she found. 
Suddenly, she heard a strange tapping noise coming from the ground. She looked all around but couldn't see where it came from. She slowly crept closer and found a small rock trying to get away. The puppy chased the rock and managed to catch it. She happily raced back to her family with the rock in her mouth.
Once she returned, the puppy proudly showed her family the rock. Her family weighed it in their hands and noticed it was very light. They explained to her that the rock wasn't valuable. The family told her that in life, not everything that looks special will be important or turn out to be what you thought. 
The puppy nodded and thought about this for the rest of the day. Later on, the puppy found a large bone and picked it up. This time she remembered what her family said and decided to carefully check it before getting too excited. After a quick inspection, the puppy was happy to find out that the bone was very valuable. She happily snuggled up with it.
The playful puppy learned that day that sometimes not everything that looks special turns out as expected, and it pays to weigh up the risks before taking too much excitement
