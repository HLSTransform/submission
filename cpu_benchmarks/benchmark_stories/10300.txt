Anna loved her bear. She called him Brownie. He was soft and cuddly. She took him everywhere. She liked to polish his fur with a brush. She said, "You are the best bear in the world, Brownie."
One day, Anna and her mom went to the park. Anna brought Brownie with her. She saw a big slide. She wanted to try it. She said, "Mom, can I go on the slide?" Mom said, "Yes, but be careful. And don't forget Brownie."
Anna ran to the slide. She put Brownie on her lap. She slid down fast. She laughed. She said, "That was fun, Brownie. Let's do it again." She climbed up the ladder. She did not see a boy behind her. He was bigger than her. He had a fierce face. He said, "Give me that bear. He is mine."
Anna was scared. She said, "No, he is not. He is mine. I love him. Go away." The boy grabbed Brownie. He pulled hard. Anna held on tight. She said, "Help, mom. He is taking Brownie."
Mom heard Anna. She ran to the slide. She said, "Stop that, boy. That is not your bear. That is Anna's bear. Give it back to her." The boy was angry. He said, "No, I want it. It is a nice bear. I will polish it." Mom said, "That is not nice. That is mean. You cannot take things that are not yours. Say sorry to Anna and give her back her bear."
The boy saw mom's face. He was afraid. He said, "Sorry, Anna. Here is your bear." He gave Brownie to Anna. Anna hugged Brownie. She said, "Thank you, mom. You saved Brownie. He is my best friend." Mom said, "You are welcome, Anna. I am proud of you. You are brave. Now, let's go home and polish Brownie's fur. He deserves a treat." Anna smiled. She said, "Yes, mom. Let's go home. I love you and Brownie."
