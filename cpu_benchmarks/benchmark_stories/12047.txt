Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, her mom said it was time to take a bath in the bathtub. Lily wasn't very enthusiastic about taking a bath, but she knew she had to be clean. 
So, she got in the bathtub and started to splash around. But then, her mom asked her to wash her hair. Lily didn't want to, so she just shrugged her shoulders. 
Her mom said, "Come on, Lily, it's important to be clean!" Lily thought about it and decided to wash her hair after all. She felt proud of herself for being a good listener.
