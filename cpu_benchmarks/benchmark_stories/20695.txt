Once there was a little boy named John. He was just three years old, but he loved to jog. Every day, he would jog around his neighborhood. 
One day he was jogging, when he saw a gray thing on the ground. He wasn't sure what it was, but he decided to pick it up. He held the gray thing in his hands, and he couldn't figure out what to do with it. 
He decided to take the gray thing to his mom. When he showed it to her, she smiled. She said, "It's a rock! I'm so glad you found it." She put the rock somewhere safe, and John smiled. He vowed to always keep an eye out for interesting things while he jogged!
