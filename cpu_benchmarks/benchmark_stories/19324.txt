Once upon a time there was a pony. He was very healthy because he ate good food and went outside to run a lot.
One day, he was walking through the field when he saw a big bee. The bee flew too close and the pony tried to slap it away. 
He tried to use his tail, but his tail was too short. Then he tried to use his hoof, but he was too slow. So he took a deep breath and used his nose to slap the bee away. 
The bee flew away and the pony was happy. He started running around the field, enjoying the fresh air and yummy grass. He smiled and thanked his nose for saving him from the bee. 
The end.
