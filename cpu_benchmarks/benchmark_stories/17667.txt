Once upon a time there was a fat cat. He was very hungry, so he wanted to go find some food. He looked around and noticed a thermometer next to a supply house. He thought it would be a great place to get a meal. 

So the fat cat walked over to the supply house. He peered through the window and saw that there were lots of things inside. He saw cans of food, boxes of treats, and even some milk. He was really happy.
He leapt up to the window and meowed. Suddenly, the door opened and the fat cat went inside. There were all kinds of goodies to choose from. He chose a can of tuna and a thermometer. With these items, he was sure to have a full stomach.
The fat cat took his supplies and went home. He was so excited that he had found a supply house and gotten a thermometer for free! He decided to measure the temperature of his room so he would know if it was too hot or cold. 
He was so pleased with his findings and delighted with his supply. He never had to worry about food again!
