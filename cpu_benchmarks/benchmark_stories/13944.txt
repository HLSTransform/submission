Once upon a time, there was a cat named Mittens. Mittens was a nice cat who liked to play with balls of yarn and take naps in the sun. One day, Mittens went on a walk and met a big lion. The lion was very scary and roared very loudly. Mittens was scared and ran away.
Mittens realized that she needed to be more reliable and brave. She went to her friends and asked for help to learn how to be more reliable. Her friends taught her how to be brave and how to stand up for herself. 
The next time Mittens saw the lion, she was not scared anymore. She stood up tall and roared back at the lion. The lion was surprised and impressed by Mittens' bravery. From then on, Mittens was known as a reliable and brave cat. The moral of the story is to always be brave and stand up for yourself, even when you are scared.
