Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play with boats. They made boats from paper, wood, and plastic. They took their boats to the pond and watched them sail on the water. They pretended they were sailors and pirates and explorers.
One day, Lily and Tom found a big boat in the park. It was red and white and had a sail and a flag. They climbed on the boat and looked around. They saw a cake, a dress, and a ring. They wondered who left them there.
Then they heard a voice. It was a man who said he was the owner of the boat. He said he was going to get married on the boat, but his bride did not come. He was sad and angry. He saw Lily and Tom and asked them what they were doing on his boat.
Lily and Tom were scared. They said they were sorry and they just wanted to play. They said they liked his boat and his cake and his dress and his ring. They said they were polite and did not touch anything.
The man looked at them and smiled. He said they were cute and brave. He said he did not need his cake and his dress and his ring anymore. He said he would give them to Lily and Tom if they wanted. He said they could play on his boat as long as they liked.
Lily and Tom were happy. They thanked the man and said they were sorry for his marriage. They said they hoped he would find a new bride soon. They said they would share his cake and his dress and his ring. They said they would sail on his boat and have fun. They said they were friends.
