Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Snowy. Snowy was very white and fluffy. She lived in a big field with her family and friends. Snowy loved to play and hop around in the sunshine.
One day, the sun didn't shine and the sky turned very dark. Snowy felt sad because she couldn't play with her friends. She tried to hop around but she couldn't see where she was going. Snowy's family and friends tried to help her but it was too dark.
Suddenly, a bright light shone in the sky. Snowy looked up and saw a shooting star. She made a wish that the sun would come back and shine again. But the wish didn't come true. The sky stayed dark and Snowy got lost. She couldn't find her way back home and she was very scared.
Snowy never saw her family and friends again. She was all alone in the dark field. Snowy was very sad and wished she could go back to when the sun shone and she was with her loved ones. But that day never came.
