Once upon a time there were two friends named Carl and Grandma. Grandma was very curious and every day she would come up with an exciting new adventure.
Today Carl and Grandma were going to the mall. Carl was so excited! 
"Let's go solve something exciting today! What do you think it could be?" Grandma asked Carl.
Carl thought for a moment and then said, "Let's go solve why the mall is so big!"
So off they went to the mall. Grandma was very curious and asked questions about why there were so many stores. Everywhere they went, Carl and Grandma were trying to solve the mystery. 
Eventually, they discovered why the mall was so big - it had many different stores which people visited to buy things!
Carl and Grandma were very proud of themselves for solving the mystery of why the mall was so big. They had a lot of fun and made many more discoveries on their adventure!
