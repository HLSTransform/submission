One day, a little cat named Kitty went for a walk. She saw a big tree and wanted to climb it. She jumped up and started to climb. The tree had many branches and it was fun for Kitty.
Kitty climbed very high and saw a small hole in the tree. She wanted to enter the hole and see what was inside. When she entered the hole, she found a soft bed of leaves. It was so soft that Kitty wanted to take a nap.
As Kitty slept, the wind blew and the leaves started to fall. The leaves fell all around Kitty, making her feel warm and cozy. When she woke up, she saw the beautiful fall leaves everywhere. Kitty was happy and went back home to tell her friends about her fun day in the tree.
