Once upon a time, there was a clever dog named Max. Max loved to play with his toys and his friends. One day, Max's friend Billy came to play with him. Billy had a toy that Max really wanted, but Billy wouldn't give it to him. Max got really sad and didn't know what to do.
Max's owner, Sarah, noticed that Max was sad and asked him what was wrong. Max told Sarah that he really wanted Billy's toy, but Billy wouldn't give it to him. Sarah told Max that sometimes we can't always get what we want, but that's okay. She also told Max that when she was older, she went to a place called university to learn more about the world.
Max thought about what Sarah said and realized that he didn't need Billy's toy to be happy. He was grateful for his other toys and his friends. Max learned a valuable lesson that day and was happy again.
