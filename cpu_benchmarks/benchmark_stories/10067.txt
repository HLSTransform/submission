Lily and Tom were brother and sister. They liked to play outside in the garden. One day, their mom said, "Tomorrow, we will go to the park. But you have to wake up early, before the sun rises."
Lily and Tom were excited. They wanted to see the sunrise and have fun at the park. They went to bed early and set their alarm clock.
The next morning, the alarm clock rang. Lily and Tom opened their eyes and saw the sky was still dark. They felt sleepy and cold. They wanted to stay in bed.
"Come on, Lily, let's get up," Tom said. "We don't want to miss the sunrise and the park."
"But it's so dark and cozy here," Lily said. "Can we sleep a little more?"
"No, Lily, we have to be ready. Mom said the sunrise is very beautiful and we can see many colors. And the park has swings and slides and animals. Don't you want to see them?"
Lily thought for a moment. She did want to see the sunrise and the park. She remembered how mom said it was a special day. She decided to get up and get ready.
"Okay, Tom, you are right. Let's get up and get ready," Lily said. She put on her clothes and brushed her teeth. Tom did the same.
They went downstairs and saw mom waiting for them. She smiled and hugged them.
"Good morning, Lily and Tom. You are ready. I'm proud of you. Let's go to the park and see the sunrise."
They got in the car and drove to the park. They arrived just in time to see the sun rise. It was very beautiful. They saw many colors: red, orange, yellow, pink, purple. They felt happy and warm.
They played at the park and saw many animals. They had a lot of fun. They thanked mom for taking them to the park.
They learned that waking up early can be hard, but it can also be rewarding. They learned to appreciate the beauty of nature and the joy of spending time with family. They learned to be ready for new adventures.
