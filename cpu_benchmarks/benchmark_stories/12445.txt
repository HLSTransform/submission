Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big truck. The truck has ice-cream. Sara and Ben love ice-cream.
"Let's go and get some ice-cream," Sara says.
"OK," Ben says.
They run to the truck. The truck man is friendly. He smiles and says, "Hello, kids. What do you want?"
"I want a cone with chocolate ice-cream," Sara says.
"I want a cone with vanilla ice-cream," Ben says.
The truck man gives them their ice-creams. They say, "Thank you."
They lick their ice-creams. They are yummy. They sit on a bench and enjoy their ice-creams.
"Hey, Sara," Ben says. "Do you dare to do something?"
"What?" Sara says.
"Do you dare to put some ice-cream on your nose?" Ben says.
Sara laughs. She thinks Ben is funny. She says, "OK, I dare. But you have to do it too."
"OK, deal," Ben says.
They put some ice-cream on their noses. They look silly. They giggle and make faces.
The truck man sees them. He laughs too. He says, "You kids are very brave. Do you want some more ice-cream?"
Sara and Ben say, "Yes, please."
The truck man gives them more ice-cream. They say, "Thank you."
They eat their ice-cream. They are happy. They are friends.
