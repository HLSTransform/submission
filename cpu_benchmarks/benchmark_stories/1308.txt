Once upon a time there was a little girl called Louise. Louise loved to act and she was very impatient. Every day Louise would pretend to be different things, like a Princess or a rocket.
One day Louise spotted something very special in the sky. It was a long, white missile! Louise jumped up and down in excitement and acted like a rocket, flying around the house.
Louise flew around the house and out of the garden. She just had to get closer to the missile. She flew into a field and saw hundreds of missiles ready to be launched. Louise was very excited and wanted to act like them. So she flew around the missiles acting like one too.
Unfortunately, the Missiles' guards caught her acting and Louise had to go home sadly. Louise had a great time acting and was very impatient to do it again.
