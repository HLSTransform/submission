Once upon a time there was a fountain in a big park. The park was full of kids who liked to play there. But the fountain was empty. The kids wanted to fill it to play in the water. 
So the mommies and daddies of the kids told them the plan. They said, "Let's fill the fountain! We'll bring buckets, fill them up and empty them into the fountain. That way it won't be empty anymore." 
But one of the mommies said, "Wait! Let's make sure the fountain is safe before we fill it. We don't want anyone to get hurt!" 
So they put a fence around the fountain so the kids couldn't get too close. That way they could prevent an accident. 
They filled the fountain with buckets and when they finished it was full! All the kids cheered and ran to enjoy playing in the water. 
The mommies and daddies were so happy that they prevented an accident and made the fountain full again!
