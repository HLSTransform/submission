One day a little girl was looking for something to do. She saw a green basket near her house and decided to investigate. She walked closer and saw that it was full of pretty flowers. She picked one and put it in her pocket. She wanted to pick more but the basket had disappeared!
The little girl was very sad. She wanted to find the green basket so she ran to the park. When she arrived, she saw the basket had reappeared! She was so glad and filled her pockets with more flowers. But then the basket disappeared again.
The little girl began to search all over. She looked in the woods and at the beach. Then she came to a lake and noticed something green near the water. When she got closer, she could see it was the basket!
The girl was overjoyed! She filled her pockets with the beautiful flowers and skipped home, happy that she had found the mysterious green basket.
