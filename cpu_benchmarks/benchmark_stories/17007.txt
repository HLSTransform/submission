Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in the living room. One day, they see a shiny chain on the table. It is their mom's chain. She wears it when she goes out.
"Wow, look at this chain!" Lily says. "It is so pretty and sparkly. Can we play with it?"
Ben shakes his head. "No, we can't. Mom said it is expensive. It is not a toy. We might break it or lose it. She will be mad at us."
Lily pouts. "But I want to play with it. It looks like a necklace for a princess. Please, Ben, just for a little bit."
Ben thinks. He likes to make Lily happy, but he also wants to obey mom. He decides to say no. "Sorry, Lily, but no. We have many other toys to play with. How about we play with the blocks or the cars?"
Lily sighs. She knows Ben is right, but she still wants the chain. She decides to wait until Ben is not looking. Then she quickly grabs the chain and puts it around her neck. She feels like a princess.
But then, something bad happens. The chain gets caught on a button on her shirt. She tries to pull it off, but it only gets tighter. She starts to cry.
"Help, Ben, help! The chain is stuck on me!"
Ben hears Lily's cry. He turns around and sees her with the chain. He is shocked and scared.
"Oh no, Lily, what did you do? Mom will be so angry! Let me help you!"
He runs to Lily and tries to untangle the chain. But it is too hard. He can't do it.
They hear the door open. It is mom. She comes in and sees them with the chain. She is surprised and angry.
"What are you doing with my chain? How did you get it? Do you know how expensive it is? You could have broken it or hurt yourself!"
She takes the chain from Lily and Ben. She checks it for damage. She is relieved that it is not broken. But she is still upset.
She scolds Lily and Ben. She tells them that they should not touch things that are not theirs. She tells them that they should listen to her and to each other. She tells them that they should say sorry.
Lily and Ben feel bad. They decide to say sorry. They hug mom and each other. They promise to be good and not touch the chain again.
Mom forgives them. She hugs them back. She tells them that she loves them. She tells them that they can play with their toys, but not with her chain.
Lily and Ben nod. They decide to play with the blocks and the cars. They decide to share and have fun. They decide to be good twins.
