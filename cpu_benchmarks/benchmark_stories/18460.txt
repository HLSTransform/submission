Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore. One day, he wanted to go to the park, but he didn't know the way. His mom was busy cleaning the house, so he decided to go by himself.
Timmy walked and walked, but he couldn't find the park. He saw a man and shouted, "Excuse me, can you help me find the way to the park?" The man smiled and showed him the way.
When Timmy got to the park, he saw some big kids playing with a toy he wanted. He asked if he could play too, but the big kids said no and shouted at him. Timmy felt sad and wanted to leave.
But then, a kind girl came up to Timmy and shared her toys with him. They played together and had so much fun. Timmy learned that it's always better to be kind and share, and that asking for help when you're lost is okay.
