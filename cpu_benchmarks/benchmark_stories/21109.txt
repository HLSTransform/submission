One day, a thin cat named Lily was playing outside. She liked to jump and run. Lily had a friend, a dog named Max. They loved to play together.
Suddenly, they felt the ground shake. It was an earthquake! Lily and Max were scared. They did not know what to do. They looked at each other and decided to ask for help.
Lily said, "Max, let's request help from our friend, the wise owl." Max agreed and they went to find the owl. They found the owl in a tree.
The owl listened to Lily and Max. He said, "Don't worry, my friends. The earthquake is over now. Just be careful when you play outside." Lily and Max thanked the wise owl and went back to play, feeling safe and happy again.
