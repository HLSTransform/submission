Once upon a time there was a brave boy. His name was John and he was 3 years old. One day, he decided to take a walk down the street. 
As he walked past a tall mountain he saw a little hot pool. He was very curious so he asked himself, "What is that pool?". He quickly realized that it was very hot and thought it might be dangerous for him to jump in. 
Suddenly, he noticed that a nearby pond had very smooth stones. He instantly knew what he wanted to do. He asked the pond if he could take some of the smooth stones for himself. The pond replied yes and gave him the stones. 
John took the stones and went back to the hot pool. He used the smooth stones to build a bridge to the other side. He was now able to cross the hot pool safely. 
John learned a valuable lesson that day - if you take the time to think carefully, you can find a way around any problem.
