Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her cat. One day, her mommy told her that it was a new year. Lily didn't understand what that meant, but her mommy explained that it was like a birthday for the whole world.
Lily loved birthdays, so she was excited about the new year. She asked her mommy how they could celebrate. Her mommy said that they could make a flexible plan. Lily didn't know what that meant, but her mommy explained that it was a plan that could change if they needed it to.
Later that day, Lily's mommy had to mail a letter. Lily wanted to help, so her mommy let her put the letter in the mailbox. Lily was so happy to help her mommy and she felt like a big girl. She knew that it was a good start to the new year.
