Once upon a time there was a kind guard. He lived in a big castle and his job was to watch over it. Every day he would stare at the walls and check everything was safe.
One day, walking around the castle, the guard noticed three small children. They were lost and scared, but the guard smiled at them and said it was okay. He looked after the children, making sure they were okay.
The children were so grateful they thanked the guard. They hugged him and said they would never forget him.
That night the guard stared at the castle walls and thought about the children. He knew he had done a good thing and he felt really happy.
