Once upon a time there was a frog named Jumpy. He loved to jump and he was always looking for new things to jump over. One day he saw a hoop lying on the ground. He looked at it curiously and hopped over to it.
He tried to jump over it but he kept bumping into it! He was very frustrated and he was about to give up. Then he heard a voice, it said: "Be careful Jumpy, that hoop is very fragile!". 
Jumpy thought and he realized the voice was right. He knew he had to be gentle. He carefully teetered to the edge of the hoop, he held his breath and he hopped!
He made it! He had jumped over the hoop without breaking it! He was joyous and he did a happy dance around the hoop.
Jumpy learnt that day that if he took care and was gentle, he could do anything he wanted. Every time Jumpy wanted to do something tricky like jump over the hoop, he remembered to be gentle and he succeeded every time! 
The moral of the story is that gentle actions can help us achieve amazing things, just like Jumpy's gentle spring helped him jump over the fragile hoop.
