Once upon a time, there was a big rug in a room. It was a very pretty rug with many colors. A graceful cat named Fluffy liked to sit on the rug. Fluffy loved how soft and warm it felt under her paws.
One day, Fluffy saw a toy on the other side of the room. She wanted to play with it. So, she said to the rug, "Rug, can you move so I can get my toy?" The rug did not move. Fluffy tried again, "Please, rug, move for me." This time, the rug moved a little bit.
Fluffy was happy and started to walk on the rug. But then, the rug moved too much! Fluffy fell off the rug and bumped her head. She cried and her toy was still far away. The rug did not help Fluffy, and she felt sad. The end.
