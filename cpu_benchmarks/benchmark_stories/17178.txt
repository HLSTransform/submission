Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a new pair of boots that she loved to wear every day. One day, Lily went outside to play in the rain. Her boots got all wet and she didn't like it. 
So, Lily went inside and took off her wet boots. She put them by the door and asked her mom to help her dry them. Her mom got a towel and wiped the water off of the boots. 
After a while, Lily's boots were dry again! She was so happy and put them back on her feet. Now, she could go back outside and play without getting her new boots all wet again. The end.
