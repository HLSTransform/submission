Once there were two friends, Tom and Jill. They were both 3 years old. One day they decided to play in the park.
When Tom and Jill arrived at the park, Tom started running around the playground. Jill stayed by Tom's side.
Suddenly, Tom heard someone calling his name. It was a boy from school. The boy asked if Tom wanted to play.
Tom looked at Jill. He asked her if they should go and play with the boy. Jill said yes and they went to the other side of the park where the boy was.
The boy was being very rude to Tom and Jill. Tom asked the boy to behave nicely. The boy didn't listen and continued to be rude.
Tom was very angry so he turned to Jill and said, "Let's go home. We don't want to stay with this rude boy."
Jill and Tom said goodbye to the boy and left the park.
Tom and Jill vowed to never play with the rude boy again.
