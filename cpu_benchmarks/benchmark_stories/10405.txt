Sandy was walking along the beach when she spotted a reef in the water. She was excited to explore and started running across the sand.
Suddenly, a big wave came up to the shore and Sandy got scared. She yelled and started running back towards the beach. She knew she should have been careful.
When Sandy reached the beach, she saw a crab crawling around in the sand. She knew it was stupid to mess around with a crab, so she turned around and ran away.
Over the sound of the waves, Sandy heard a loud yell. She noticed a man in the reef, trying to catch a fish. Sandy was scared and started to yell for help.
The man came over and helped Sandy out of the reef. He explained that it was dangerous and she should not have been there. Sandy thanked the man, understanding how stupid she had been.
