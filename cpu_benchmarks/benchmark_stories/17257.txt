Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play basketball with his friends. He had a hoop in his backyard where they would play every day. Timmy wanted to be the best at basketball, but he couldn't catch the ball very well.
One day, Timmy saw a squirrel trying to catch a nut. The squirrel was very intelligent and kept trying until he finally caught the nut. Timmy realized that he needed to be persistent like the squirrel and keep practicing until he could catch the ball.
Timmy practiced every day and soon he became very good at catching the ball. His friends were impressed and they all wanted to be like Timmy. Timmy learned that if he kept trying, he could do anything he wanted to do. The moral of the story is that practice makes perfect.
