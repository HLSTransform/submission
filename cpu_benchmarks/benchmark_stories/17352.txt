Sam and Ben like to play with their dad's old record player. They like to put on different records and dance and sing along. Sometimes they pretend they are on a radio station and talk into a microphone.
One day, when dad is at work, they sneak into his room and find his record player. They see a big red button that says "record". They wonder what it does.
"Let's press it and see what happens!" Sam says.
"OK, but be careful. Dad might get mad if we break it." Ben says.
They press the button and hear a beep. Then they start talking into the microphone.
"Hello, hello, this is Sam and Ben on the record station! We are going to play some music for you. Here is our favorite song!" Sam says.
He puts on a record and turns up the volume. They dance and sing and have fun. They do not notice that the record player is making a loud noise and smoke is coming out of it.
Suddenly, the record player stops working. The music stops and the record is scratched. The smoke fills the room and sets off the fire alarm.
"Oh no, what did we do?" Ben says.
"We broke dad's record player! He is going to be so angry!" Sam says.
They hear sirens outside and see fire trucks and police cars. They run out of the room and see dad coming home. He sees the smoke and the record player and his face turns red.
"Sam! Ben! What have you done?" He yells.
They try to explain, but dad does not listen. He is very mad and sad. He takes away their toys and sends them to their room. He says they are in big trouble and they have to pay for a new record player.
Sam and Ben cry and wish they had not pressed the button. They say they are sorry, but dad does not hear them. They have no more fun and no more music. They have a bad ending.
