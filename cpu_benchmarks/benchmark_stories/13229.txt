Jack and Jill were two very proud kids. One day Jack wanted to make something special. He asked Jill if she had any clay. Jill said she had a nice blue clay. Jack was so happy.
He took the clay and started to make something. Little by little, he started to shape it. When Jill saw it she shouted, "That's a dog!" Jack was so proud of his dog. He called it Spot.
Spot was a good dog. He wagged his tail when Jack took him for walks. He protected Jack from any danger. He was a very special dog.
One day Jack called on his friends to come see Spot. They all started to pet him. They said Spot was the best dog ever. Jack was so proud. He was happy he made Spot out of clay.
