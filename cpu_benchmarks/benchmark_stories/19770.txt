Jane was feeling very scared on Wednesday. She had to get on a heavy bus. She had never been on a bus before.
The bus driver was very friendly but Jane was still scared. He showed her the big yellow seat and said, “This seat for you Jane.”
Jane felt better when she saw her friend by the window. But when the bus started to move, she got scared again. Too scared to speak.
But after a while, Jane and her friend had a lot of fun. They laughed and waved and looked out of the window.
When it was time to get off, Jane was no longer scared. She said goodbye to the bus driver and hopped off the bus. 
Jane was happy she had been brave and done something new on Wednesday.
