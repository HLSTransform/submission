Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was three years old and loved to explore the world around her. One day she went outside to play and felt the heat of the sun on her skin. She liked how it felt and wanted to know more.
She looked around and saw lots of rough rocks and stones. She wanted to touch them to find out if they were as rough as they looked. She slowly touched one of the stones and it was very rough. She was surprised!
The little girl enjoyed learning about the rough rocks and decided to take some home with her.
When she arrived home, she showed her mommy the rocks and told her all about the heat she felt in the sun. Her mommy smiled and said, "That's wonderful sweetheart. You know so much!"
The little girl smiled and ran off to play. She was proud of herself for learning new things outside.
