Once upon a time, there was a musician. He was a regular musician who played music every day. One day, he went outside to see the pretty flowers. He saw a butterfly flying and it made him happy. The musician loved to see the beautiful things in nature. He went back inside and played his music again. The music was so pretty that even the butterfly came to listen. The musician was happy that his music made others happy too. The end.
