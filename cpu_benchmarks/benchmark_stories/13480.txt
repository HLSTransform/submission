Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore her house and find new things to play with. One day, she found a cobweb in the corner of her room. She didn't like it because it looked yucky.
Lily's mom came into the room and saw her looking at the cobweb. "What's wrong, Lily?" she asked.
"I don't like the cobweb. It's yucky," Lily said.
"Oh, that's just a cobweb. It won't hurt you. Don't be ignorant," her mom replied.
Lily didn't understand what "ignorant" meant, but she knew her mom didn't like the cobweb either. So, they got a broom and swept it away. "That's better. The cobweb won't disturb us anymore," Lily's mom said.
Lily was happy that the cobweb was gone and she could play in her room without feeling yucky. She hugged her mom and said, "Thank you for helping me, Mommy."
