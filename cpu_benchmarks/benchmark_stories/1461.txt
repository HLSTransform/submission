Once upon a time there was a brilliant oyster. It lived in the sea with many other oysters. Each day it was filled with joy and it loved to play and explore with its friends. 
One day, the oyster decided to clean its shell. It wanted to make sure it was shiny and sparkly. So, it scraped and scrubbed with all of its might. It worked so hard that it was soon finished and its shell was the shiniest in the sea. Everyone admired its brilliant shell.
The oyster was so happy with its work. From that day on, it always kept its shell clean and sparklyâ€”just like a brilliant oyster should.
