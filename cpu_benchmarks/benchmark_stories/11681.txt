Once upon a time, there was a man who had very soft skin. He loved to soak in the bathtub. Every day he would fill the tub with warm water and get in. He would splash the water and play with bubbles. 
One day, it was raining outside. He decided to take a longer soak outside. He went to the garden and laid down in the wet grass. He felt so happy and relaxed. He could almost feel the raindrops. 
The man stayed outside until he was totally soaked. There were puddles of water all around him. When he finished, he got up and felt so good! He knew that a nice long soak was just what he needed.
