Once upon a time, there was a chubby pigeon who needed to complete a very important task. He needed to get to the top of the highest mountain. But the pigeon wasn't very strong, and the mountain was very big.
The little pigeon tried and tried again, but he just couldn't make it. He got so tired, he had to take a break.
So, the pigeon started to look around and found a big, chubby bee. The bee said, "I see that you are trying to complete a big task. Let's work together!"
So, the bee and the pigeon flew up the mountain together. Every time the pigeon got tired, the bee would carry him the the rest of the way.
Finally, after a lot of work, the bee and the pigeon made it to the top! The pigeon was so happy and proud that he had been able to complete his task. He thanked the bee for his help and they both flew off, ready for their next adventure!
