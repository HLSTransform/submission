One day, Sally and her brother stood in front of a large shelf full of books. “What shall we do?” asked Sally. “Let’s play a game!” exclaimed her brother. He picked out a chubby dictionary and opened it up. “Let’s split it and make it two books!” he said.
So, the two children began to split the dictionary in half. They took each piece and carefully ripped the pages apart. Sally couldn’t remember what the words meant, so her brother told her the stories behind them.
Pretty soon, the dictionary was turned into two thin books. The siblings gazed at their creations, feeling very proud. 
They hugged each other and said, “We’re so smart!”
