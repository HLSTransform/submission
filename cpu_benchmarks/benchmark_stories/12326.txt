One day, there was a brilliant deer. He was walking around in the forest, and it was a beautiful day. The deer stopped suddenly as he heard a noise. He saw a small boy on the other side of the clearing. The boy was recording something in the forest with a big machine. The deer wasn't sure what was happening, but the boy had a big smile on his face. 
The deer watched with curiosity as the boy continued to record. After a few minutes, the boy was done and the deer couldn't help but feel proud of himself. He had just been recorded! The deer was so excited and ran off to tell all his friends. 
The deer thought it was so brilliant that he had been recorded! He was sure that he was now famous. He couldn't wait to tell all the other animals in the forest about his new adventure. 
From then on, the deer was determined to put his best foot forward. He was excited and eager to be recorded again!
