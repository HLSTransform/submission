Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. One day, Jack went to the store to pick out something yummy. He saw a big green melon and knew it must be tasty.
Jack picked up the melon and brought it to the cashier to pay. However, the cashier said it was too expensive.
Jack started to feel sad. He wanted to eat the melon so badly. Then, an idea came to him.
"Can I trade something for the melon?" he asked.
The cashier thought for a minute then said, "Yes, if you can find something that weighs the same, you can change it for the melon!"
Jack looked around for something that weighed the same as the melon. Suddenly, he saw a terrible old blanket. Jack was sure it weighed the same. He ran over to the cashier and asked, "Can I change this blanket for the melon?"
The cashier looked and said, "Yes, that looks like it weighs the same. You can change the blanket for the melon."
Jack was so excited. He quickly traded and said goodbye. Then he ran home with his melon and enjoyed a yummy and juicy snack.
