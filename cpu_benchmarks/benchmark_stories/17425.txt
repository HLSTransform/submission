Sara and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big cooler near a bench. The cooler was brown and had a picture of a bear on it.
"Let's see what's inside the cooler!" Sara said. She ran to the cooler and opened it.
Ben followed her. He looked inside the cooler and saw some sandwiches, some juice boxes, and some cookies.
"Wow, look at all the yummy food!" Ben said. He reached for a cookie.
"Stop, Ben!" Sara said. "This is not our food. This is someone else's food. We can't take it."
"But I'm hungry!" Ben said. He ignored Sara and took a cookie.
Sara was angry. She closed the cooler and ran away from Ben.
"Hey, Sara, wait for me!" Ben said. He followed Sara with the cookie in his hand.
Suddenly, they heard a loud roar. They turned around and saw a big, brown bear coming out of the woods. The bear smelled the food in the cooler and the cookie in Ben's hand.
The bear growled and ran towards them.
Sara and Ben were scared. They dropped the cookie and ran away from the bear.
They ran to their mom, who was sitting on a blanket. They hugged her and told her what happened.
Mom was shocked. She said, "You should never take food that is not yours. And you should never ignore your sister. She was trying to protect you. The bear could have hurt you."
Sara and Ben felt sorry. They said, "We're sorry, Mom. We won't do it again."
Mom said, "I'm glad you're safe. Next time, listen to each other and be careful."
Sara and Ben nodded. They learned their lesson. They said, "We love you, Mom."
Mom said, "I love you too, Sara and Ben."
