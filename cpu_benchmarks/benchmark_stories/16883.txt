Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play dress up with her friends. One day, Lily's mom brought her a new dress. It was pink and had a zigzag pattern on it. Lily thought it was very interesting.
Lily put on her new dress and showed it to her friends. They thought it was pretty too. They played dress up all day and had so much fun. They even made a game where they had to zigzag around the room without touching the floor.
At the end of the day, Lily's mom told her it was time to take off her dress and get ready for bed. Lily didn't want to take it off because she loved it so much. But she knew she could wear it again tomorrow and have more fun with her friends. The end.
