Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily was very happy. She had a huge bag of clay that she could make into whatever she wanted!
One day, Lily wanted to turn the clay into a car. She got an old box and put the clay in it. Then she rolled the clay with her hands and made it thin. She cut out some circles and squares and then formed them into a car shape.
The car looked really cool! Lily was so happy. She took the car outside and put it on the ground. She got a stick and began to turn the clay car around and around. It spun around very fast!
Lily kept turning her car around until she was all tired out. She was so happy with what she had made. She took the car to show her friends and they all played with it. What a fun adventure!
