Once there was a little girl called Molly. Molly was three years old. Every day her parents would tidy her room and make it very clean.
One day, her Aunt came to visit. Auntie brought a present for Molly. It was an extra special present that made Molly very happy. Auntie hugged Molly and she felt so comforted.
After the visit, Molly's parents were very pleased. They said to Auntie that she was so tidy. Then Molly gave her a big hug and thanked her for her visit.
Molly and Auntie spent the rest of the afternoon playing together and Molly felt very comforted by her Aunt's presence. 
When it was time to say goodbye, Molly's parents thanked Auntie for her visit. Molly hugged her again and gave her a big smile. Auntie was so happy that she had come to visit. 
Molly's parents said that they would like her to visit them again soon. Before she left, Auntie promised Molly that she would come and visit soon. 
Molly was feeling so comforted as she said goodbye to her Aunt. She couldn't wait until the next visit.
