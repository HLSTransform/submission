One day, Sarah was ready to play with her puzzle. She was feeling very excited so she ran to her mommy and requested the puzzle. Her mommy gave her the puzzle and smiled. She said to Sarah, "Let's work on the puzzle together".
Sarah was ready to start but her mommy said, "Let's move slowly". Sarah nodded in agreement. They started placing the pieces one by one. It was a little difficult at the beginning, but they kept going.
They both smiled when they finished. Sarah said proudly, "We did it mommy!" Her mommy hugged Sarah and said, "That's great! We worked together and finished the puzzle". Sarah was very pleased. 
The end.
