Once upon a time there was an ancient vest. It was small and brown and had been passed down throughout generations.
One day, a little girl found it. She was very curious and wanted to learn more about it. So she decided to record what she knew.
First, she said the vest was brown. Then, she added that it was ancient. Finally, she added that it had been passed down.
The girl was very excited and she took the vest everywhere with her. Everywhere she went, she would tell people about it. This way, she could make sure that the ancient vest was recorded for future generations.
The end.
