Once upon a time, there was a small mouse. The mouse lived in a small house near a big chimney. The mouse liked to chew on cheese. 
One day, the mouse heard a loud noise coming from the chimney. The mouse was scared and hid in his small house. But then, the mouse remembered that he had seen a big cat near the chimney earlier that day. 
The mouse knew that the cat loved to chew on mice. So, the mouse quickly ran to the chimney and found a small hole to hide in. Just as the mouse predicted, the cat came down the chimney and tried to catch the mouse. But the mouse was too clever and safely hid in the small hole. 
From that day on, the mouse knew to always be careful near the chimney and to never forget the importance of being small and quick.
