Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved animals. Every day she would take care of her animals, feeding them and playing with them. One day as she was feeding them, a strange gate appeared in the middle of the field. It was unusual, like nothing she had ever seen before. 
The little girl was curious and walked up to the mysterious gate. She grabbed the latch and opened it. To her surprise, inside the gate there were lots of new animals that she hadn't seen before. 
The little girl was so excited. She started to feed all of the new animals and was amazed at how gentle and friendly they were. She spent the rest of the day playing with and feeding the animals.
When she was done, the little girl closed the gate and waved goodbye to her new animal friends. She was glad she had found the unusual gate and even happier that she had made some new animal friends.
