Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She went to the park with her mommy and daddy. She loved playing on the swings and the slide. But today, she fell off the slide and hurt her knee.
Lily started to cry and complain about the pain. Her mommy and daddy hugged her and said they would take her to see a nurse. The nurse was very kind and put a bandage on her knee. 
After seeing the nurse, Lily felt much better and was happy again. She thanked the nurse and her mommy and daddy for taking care of her. From that day on, Lily was more careful when playing on the slide.
