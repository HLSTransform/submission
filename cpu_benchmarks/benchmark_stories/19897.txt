Once upon a time, there was a rabbit named Bun. Bun loved to eat celery. One day, Bun's mom brought home an orange carrot. Bun didn't like it at first, but then he tried it and it tasted good. Bun's mom said the orange carrot would increase his energy. Bun felt happy and ate all his veggies. The end.
