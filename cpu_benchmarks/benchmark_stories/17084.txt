Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his orange toy car. He would make the car go "zoom" all around the room. He liked to make the car go fast and slow.
One day, Tim's friend, Lily, came to play. She brought her toy dog that could chew on a bone. Tim showed Lily his orange car and said, "Look, my car can go zoom!" Lily smiled and said, "Wow! My toy dog can chew on this bone."
Tim and Lily had so much fun playing together. They made the car go "zoom" and the dog chew its bone. They laughed and played all day long. And from that day on, Tim and Lily became the best of friends.
