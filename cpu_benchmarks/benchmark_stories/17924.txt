Once upon a time, there was a mommy, a daddy, and a little girl. The little girl wanted to go on an adventure. So, the mommy and daddy said "let's go" and they went to the elevator. 
The elevator was easy and the little girl was brave. They stepped in and the doors closed. The elevator started moving up and up and stopped. Then, the doors opened and it was very exciting. 
The little girl and her parents stepped out and they came to a big park. There was a river with ducks swimming in it, lots of trees, and a merry-go-round with bright colors. The little girl was so excited that she ran and ran around the park. 
The mommy and daddy watched the little girl play. After a while, they said it was time to go home. They went back to the easy elevator and went down to the ground. 
The little girl said "bye" to the park and they went home, happy and laughing.
