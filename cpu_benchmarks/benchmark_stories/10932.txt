Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. One day, Benny was hopping through the forest when he saw his friend, a little bird named Billy.
"Hi, Billy!" said Benny.
"Hi, Benny!" said Billy. "What's wrong? You look sad."
"I lost my eraser," said Benny. "It's terrible! I need it for school tomorrow."
"Don't worry," said Billy. "I can help you find it. Let's hop around and look for it together."
So, Benny and Billy hopped all around the forest, looking for the eraser. After a while, they found it under a tree.
"Yay!" shouted Benny. "Thank you, Billy. You're the best friend ever."
"I'm happy to help," said Billy. "Now, let's hop back to your house and celebrate."
