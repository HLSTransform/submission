Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a pretty butterfly and wanted to catch it. She tried to take it, but it flew away. She felt frustrated and sad.
Lily went to her friend Timmy's house to play. They decided to play hide and seek. Timmy hid behind a fence and Lily tried to find him. She looked everywhere but couldn't find him. She felt frustrated again.
Suddenly, Timmy jumped out from behind the fence and scared Lily. She laughed and felt happy again. They played together until it was time to go home. Lily realized that even though she couldn't take the butterfly or find Timmy at first, she still had fun playing with her friend.
