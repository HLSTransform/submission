Lily liked to help her mom in the garden. She liked to dig, water, and plant seeds. She liked to watch the flowers bloom in different colors. Her mom said flowers made people happy.
One day, a man came to the garden. He had a big bag of money. He said he wanted to buy all the flowers. He said he would give mom a lot of money for them. Mom looked sad. She said she loved her flowers and did not want to sell them.
Lily had an idea. She ran to the hose and turned it on. She sprayed water all over the man and his bag of money. The man got very wet and angry. He dropped his bag of money and ran away. The money got wet and dirty.
Mom hugged Lily and thanked her. She said Lily was very brave and smart. She said she was proud of her. Lily smiled. She said she loved mom and the flowers. They picked some flowers and put them in a vase. They looked very pretty and made them happy.
