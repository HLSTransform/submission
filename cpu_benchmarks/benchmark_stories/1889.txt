Mama bear was getting ready for the big race. She put on her helmet which was very expensive. She said goodbye to her little bear cub and told him to cheer for her.
The race started and Mama bear was going very fast. At the same time, her cub started looking around the room. He found an expensive chocolate bar.
He was so excited he started to chew it up!
Mama Bear had finished the race and was very happy. But when she got home, she saw what the cub had done. He had chewed the chocolate bar and it was all gone!
Mama bear looked at the cub sadly and said, “You should never chew anything without asking first! We have to respect things, even if they are expensive.”
The cub nodded and promised to remember the lesson. He learned he should always think before he chews!
