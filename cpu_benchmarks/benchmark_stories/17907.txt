Once upon a time there were two friends, Rose and Jack. They went to the park to play.
When they got there, they saw a big box. It was full of fun things! Inside, they saw bright strips of fabric. Rose picked a yellow one and Jack chose a red one.
They ran and spun until they were very dizzy. They laughed and everything looked funny.
Suddenly, an ugly creature jumped out from behind a tree. It was holding a dark strip of fabric. Rose grabbed Jack's hand and they ran. They were scared!
Eventually, they were safe. Rose and Jack hugged each other. They had made the right choice to run away!
