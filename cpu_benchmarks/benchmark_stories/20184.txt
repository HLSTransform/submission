Lena and Sam were friends who liked to play with their toys. Lena had many toys, but her favorite was a shiny red car. Sam had only one toy, a humble wooden truck. Lena always wanted to use Sam's truck, but Sam did not want to share. He said, "This is my only toy, please let me have it."
One day, Lena and Sam went to the park with their toys. They saw a big hill and decided to race their vehicles down the hill. Lena said, "My car is faster than your truck, I will win for sure." Sam said, "Okay, let's try, but be careful." They put their vehicles on top of the hill and pushed them down.
Lena's car zoomed down the hill, but it hit a rock and flipped over. It broke into pieces and Lena cried. Sam's truck rolled down the hill slowly, but it reached the bottom safely. Sam ran to Lena and said, "I'm sorry your car broke, are you okay?" Lena said, "No, I'm not okay, I lost my favorite toy." Sam said, "You can have my truck, it's not much, but it's yours." Lena said, "Really? You would give me your only toy?" Sam said, "Yes, because you are my friend, and friends share."
Lena hugged Sam and said, "Thank you, Sam, you are very kind. I'm sorry I was greedy and wanted to use your truck. I learned that it's not how many toys you have, but how you treat others that matters." Sam said, "You're welcome, Lena, I'm glad you learned that. I learned that it's not how fast your vehicle is, but how careful you are that matters." They smiled and played with the truck together, happy to be friends.
The moral of the story is: Be generous and careful, not greedy and reckless.
