One day, they see a new girl in the park. She has long hair and a big hat. She has a bike with many colors. She looks different from Lily and Ben.
Lily and Ben are curious. They want to talk to the new girl. They go near her and say hello. The new girl smiles and says hello back. She tells them her name is Mia.
Lily and Ben admire Mia's bike. They think it is pretty and cool. They ask Mia if they can try it. Mia says yes. She lets Lily and Ben ride her bike. They take turns and share.
Lily, Ben and Mia become friends. They play in the park. They slide, swing, run and bike. They have fun together. They like each other. They do not care if they look different. They are happy.
