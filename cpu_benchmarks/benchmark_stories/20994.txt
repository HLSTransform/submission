Timmy was walking with his mommy in the forest. He saw a cobweb in a tree. He asked his mommy, 'What is that?' She smiled and said, 'That is a cobweb.' Timmy said, 'Can I borrow it?' His mommy smiled and said, 'Yes, but be careful. It is weak and can easily break.'
Timmy carefully reached out and he borrowed the cobweb. He held it in his hands and said, 'Thank you, Mommy.' He was amazed at how light and silky the cobweb was between his fingers. His mommy said, 'Be gentle with it. We have to give it back.' 
So Timmy took the cobweb home, and he kept it safe in a jar. Later, they went back to the forest, and they returned the cobweb back to its home in the tree. Timmy was so happy to have been able to borrow the cobweb, but he was also glad to give it back.
