Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily was playing in her backyard. She saw a butterfly flying under the light. She ran to catch it but it flew away. 
Lily asked her mom, "Where did the butterfly go?"
Her mom replied, "It flew away, but don't worry, more butterflies will come. You can remain here and wait for them."
Lily sat under the tree and waited. Soon, she saw a group of butterflies flying towards her. She was so happy and started to chase them. 
"Look, Mom! I caught a butterfly!" Lily exclaimed.
Her mom smiled and said, "It's so beautiful under the light. You did a great job catching it."
