Once upon a time, in a lively little town, there lived a boy named Tim. He loved to ride his bike up and down the streets. One day, Tim found a tool on the ground. It was a big wrench. Tim was very happy and put the tool in his pocket.
Tim wanted to show his friends the tool he found. He rode his bike very fast to his friend's house. On the way, his bike hit a big bump. Tim fell off his bike and the tool fell out of his pocket. The tool broke into pieces.
Tim was very sad. He could not show his friends the tool he found. He walked back home with his broken bike and broken tool. The lively little town was not so lively for Tim that day.
