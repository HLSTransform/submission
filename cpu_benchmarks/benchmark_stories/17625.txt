Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a friend named Max, who was very careful. They loved to play together in the park and go on adventures. One day, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to bake some cookies. Lily was very excited and asked Max if he wanted to help. Max was careful not to spill any flour or sugar while they baked. They made yummy cookies and shared them with their friends. Lily and Max had so much fun baking together and being careful. They knew they would always be good friends. The end.
