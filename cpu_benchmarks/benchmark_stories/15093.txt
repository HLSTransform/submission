Once upon a time there was a little boy named George. He lived in a small house with his mom and dad. His mom was deaf and George wanted to understand what she couldn't hear.
One evening, George asked his dad why mom couldn't hear them. His dad explained that Mom was deaf and that it was hard for her to understand things.
George thought for a moment, feeling sad for Mom. Then he had an idea!
He went to the kitchen, grabbed some paper and markers, and drew a picture of their house. Then he wrote "Mom loves this house!" underneath it.
George took the picture and showed it to Mom. When she saw it, she smiled and hugged George tightly. "Now I understand!" she said. 
George was glad he could help Mom understand. Even though she was deaf, he could still show her how much he loved her.
