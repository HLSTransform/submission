One day, Jim saw an old mosquito flying above his head. He called his mom and said, "Mom! I see an old mosquito! What should I do?"
His mom replied, "Don't worry son, just stay still and be careful not to touch it."
Jim nodded and watched carefully. He saw the old mosquito buzzing around the room, looking for food.
Suddenly, Jim noticed that the old mosquito was getting close to him. He got scared and closed his eyes tight.
But then, he heard a noise. When Jim opened his eyes, the old mosquito was gone! 
His mom put her hand on his shoulder and said, "It's okay, the old mosquito is gone now."
Jim smiled and said, "That's good! I'm glad it's gone."
