Once upon a time, there was a noisy bird who lived in a big tree. Every day, the bird would sing loudly and wake up all the animals in the forest. They were very upset with the bird because they couldn't sleep. 
One day, the animals had a plan. They decided to talk to the bird and ask him to sing softly. They went to the bird's nest and talked to him about how they felt. The bird listened and understood how he was bothering everyone with his loud singing.
From that day on, the bird changed his ways and sang softly. The animals were happy and could finally sleep. The bird also realized that it's important to listen to others and be considerate. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to be mindful of others and to listen to their needs. Even small changes can make a big difference, like singing softly instead of loudly.
