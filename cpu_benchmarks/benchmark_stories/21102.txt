Once upon a time, there was a funny little dog named Spot. Spot loved to play and run all day. One day, Spot saw a big hill and wanted to climb it.
Spot took a step and started to climb the hill. As he went up, he met a big bird. The bird said, "Hi Spot, do you want to play with me?" Spot said, "Yes, let's play!" They played together and had a lot of fun.
After a while, Spot felt tired. He sighed and said, "I need to go home now." The big bird was sad and didn't want Spot to leave. So, the bird hid Spot's toy so he couldn't find it. Spot looked and looked, but he couldn't find his toy anywhere.
Spot was very sad and cried. The big bird felt bad and gave Spot's toy back. Spot was still sad because he didn't like the big bird's mean trick. He walked back down the hill and went home without saying goodbye to the big bird.
