Once upon a time there was a chick called Henry. He lived in a nice cozy nest with his mummy and daddy. Every day Henry loved to fly high in the sky and soar very high above the clouds. One day, Henry decided to fly even higher and it got colder the higher he flew. He was so cold and the air was so bitter!
He looked down and in the snow he saw a mitten. Henry flew lower to look at the mitten and realised it was lost on the ground. He thought about the small girl who had lost it in the snow, and he suddenly felt so sad. He decided he wanted to make the girl happy and flew back to the nest to tell mummy and daddy what he had seen.
Mummy and daddy were so proud of Henry. They promised they would help him make the girl happy again by making a new mitten. Henry and his parents made a beautiful mitten and Henry flew it back up to the sky, so the little girl would find it.
The little girl was very happy when she found the mitten, and hugged Henry. Henry had taught everyone an important lesson that day â€“ that being kind and helping others makes everyone happier. He knew that even the littlest things can make someone's day.
