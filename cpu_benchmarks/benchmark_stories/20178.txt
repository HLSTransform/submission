Anna was a girl who liked to play in the park. She had a ball, a doll and a bike. She liked to share her toys with other kids. One day, she saw a new boy in the park. He had a big hat, a red coat and a book. He looked sad and lonely.
Anna wanted to meet the new boy. She took her ball and walked to him. She said, "Hi, I am Anna. Do you want to play with me?" The boy looked up and smiled. He said, "Hi, I am Ben. Thank you for asking. I would like to play with you."
Anna and Ben played with the ball for a while. Then they sat on a bench and looked at the book. It was a book of stories. Ben said, "This is my favorite book. It has many stories. Some are funny, some are scary, some are sad. Do you like stories?" Anna said, "Yes, I love stories. Can you read me one?" Ben said, "Sure, but we have to be quiet. This is a secret book. My grandma gave it to me. She said it is very special and I should not show it to anyone. Can you keep a secret?" Anna said, "Yes, I can keep a secret. I promise I will not tell anyone about your book."
Ben opened the book and read a story to Anna. It was a story about a brave knight, a beautiful princess and a fierce dragon. Anna listened with wonder and excitement. She asked questions and made comments. Ben answered and explained. They laughed and gasped and clapped. They forgot about the time and the park and the other kids. They were happy and friends.
The moral of the story is: You can meet new friends by being kind and curious. You can share secrets with friends by being quiet and trustworthy. You can have fun with friends by playing and reading together.
