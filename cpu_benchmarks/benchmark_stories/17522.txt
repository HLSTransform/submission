Lily liked to play with her cricket. She named him Hoppy and kept him in a jar with some grass and water. She liked to watch him jump and make noises. She wanted to show him to her friends at school.
But her mom did not allow her to take Hoppy to school. She said crickets were not good pets and they might escape or bother the other children. Lily was sad and angry. She loved Hoppy and wanted to share him.
One day, she had an idea. She put Hoppy in her pocket and sneaked out of the house. She ran to the bus stop and got on the bus. She was very careful not to let Hoppy out of her pocket. She felt him move and tickle her.
When she got to school, she waited for recess. She found a quiet spot under a tree and took Hoppy out of her pocket. She smiled and whispered to him. She wanted to play with him and let him hop on the grass.
But she did not see the big cat that was hiding behind the tree. The cat saw Hoppy and licked his lips. He jumped out and pounced on the cricket. Lily screamed and tried to save Hoppy, but it was too late. The cat ran away with Hoppy in his mouth.
Lily cried and cried. She had lost her cricket. She wished she had listened to her mom. She learned that taking Hoppy to school was not a successful idea. She hoped Hoppy was happy in cat heaven.
