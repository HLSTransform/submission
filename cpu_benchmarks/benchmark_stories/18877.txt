Sam and Mia are twins. They like to crawl and play in the big house. One day, they find a map in a box. The map has pictures of toys and candy. Sam and Mia want to find them.
They crawl and follow the map. They go up and down, left and right, in and out. They see many rooms and things. They are playful and happy. They think the map is fun.
But the map is not fun. The map is bad. The map is a trap. The map leads them to a dark and scary place. There is a big door with a lock. The map says the toys and candy are behind the door. Sam and Mia crawl to the door. They try to open it. But they can't. The door is too heavy and hard.
They hear a loud noise. They turn around. They see a mean and angry man. He has a big stick. He is the one who made the map. He wants to hurt Sam and Mia. He laughs and says, "You are mine now. You will never get out."
Sam and Mia are scared and sad. They cry and scream. They wish they never found the map. They wish they stayed with Mom and Dad. They wish they could go back to the big house. But they can't. The end.
