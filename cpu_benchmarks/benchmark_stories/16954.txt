Ben and Mia were playing in their room. They had many toys and books, but they wanted to find something new. They saw the closet door and opened it. Inside, they saw many clothes and shoes, but also a big box.
"What is in the box?" Mia asked.
"Let's see!" Ben said. He pulled the box out of the closet and opened it. Inside, there were many hats of different colors and shapes.
"Wow, look at these hats!" Mia said. She picked up a red hat with a flower and put it on her head. "I am a lady!"
Ben picked up a blue hat with a star and put it on his head. "I am a hero!"
They tried on different hats and pretended to be different people. They had fun and laughed a lot.
But they did not see that their dad was watching them from the door. He smiled and walked in. He was bald and had no hair on his head.
"Hello, my little hat lovers!" he said. "You look very funny and cute!"
Ben and Mia saw their dad and ran to him. They hugged him and gave him a hat.
"Here, dad, you can have this hat!" Ben said. He gave him a green hat with a feather.
"Thank you, Ben, this is very nice!" dad said. He put on the hat and made a silly face.
"Here, dad, you can have this hat too!" Mia said. She gave him a yellow hat with a bow.
"Thank you, Mia, this is very pretty!" dad said. He put on the hat and made another silly face.
Ben and Mia giggled and clapped. They liked their dad's hats. They spread them on the floor and played with them together. They were happy.
