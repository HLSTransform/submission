Once upon a time, there was a fish named Nemo. He loved to swim in the ocean all day long. One day, Nemo heard about a lovely event happening in the ocean. He was so excited to go and see it.
Nemo asked his friend, a crab named Sebastian, to come with him. Sebastian said, "No, I can't come with you. I have to stay here and take care of my home." Nemo was sad but he decided to go to the event alone.
When Nemo arrived at the event, he saw many other fish there. They were all having fun and swimming around. Nemo was having a great time too. Suddenly, a big shark came and started chasing all the fish. Nemo tried to swim away but the shark caught him.
Nemo was very scared and he wished he had listened to his friend Sebastian. He learned that it's always better to be safe than sorry.
