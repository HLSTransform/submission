Once upon a time, there was a young dove who lived in a tree. Every day, he would shake his feathers and fly around the tree. One day, the young dove met a little girl who was very kind. She gave him some seeds to eat and the young dove was very happy. From that day on, the young dove would visit the little girl every day and they became good friends. They would play together and shake their arms and wings. The young dove was very grateful to have such a good friend.
