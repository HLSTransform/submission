Mum and Dad were very careful in their bedroom. They were getting ready for an important day. 
Mum was putting on her shoes, but she had forgotten something very important. She put down the shoes and rushed to the kitchen. 
Dad went to his bedroom but he couldn't remember what he was looking for. He looked around carefully and then he saw it - he had forgotten his wallet. 
Mum was back in the bedroom. She was careful to pick up her wallet and put it back in her bag. Then they both smiled - they had remembered in time!
