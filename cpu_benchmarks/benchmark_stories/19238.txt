Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they were playing hide and seek when Lily heard her mom calling her. She stopped to listen and heard her mom say it was time to come inside for lunch.
Lily quickly left her hiding spot and ran back to her house. She was so hungry and couldn't wait to eat. Her mom had made her favorite sandwich with clear tomato soup. It was delicious!
After lunch, Lily went back outside to play with her friends. They decided to play a game where they had to listen for birds chirping. Lily was very good at this game because she had sharp ears. She heard a bird chirping from the left side of the park and they all ran over to see it.
They had so much fun playing and listening to the birds. When it was time to go home, Lily was tired but happy. She couldn't wait to tell her mom about all the fun she had and the birds she listened to.
