Once upon a time, in an ordinary house, there was a boy named Tom. Tom loved to eat food with pepper. One day, Tom's mom told him that they were out of pepper. Tom was sad because his food would not taste good without pepper.
Tom's mom went to the store to buy more pepper. Before she left, she told Tom not to lose his toy car while she was gone. Tom played with his toy car, but he was still thinking about the pepper. He was so excited for his mom to come back with the pepper.
While Tom was playing, he accidentally lost his toy car under the sofa. He looked and looked, but he could not find it. When his mom came back with the pepper, she saw Tom was sad. She asked him what was wrong, and Tom told her he lost his toy car. Tom's mom looked under the sofa and found the toy car. Tom was so happy, and they both laughed. Then, they put pepper on their food and enjoyed their meal together.
