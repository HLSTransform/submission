Once upon a time there was a little girl named Ella. She loved to play outside and today she wanted to make a wish. She stood in her garden and closed her eyes as she made a wish. Suddenly, a small green card appeared in her hand.
Ella was so excited and she ran to her mom to show her the card.
"Mommy, what's this?" Ella asked.
"It's a wishing card," said her mom. "You have to be careful when you make a wish. Be sure to ask for something kind and for something that won't be bad for anyone."
Ella thought for a moment and then said, "I wish for a castle!" 
Her mom sighed and said, "I'm sorry, Ella, but that's a very rough wish. Someone else would have to lose their home for you to get a castle."
Ella was sad, but then she had an idea. She asked her mom to send her wish to the stars. Her mom nodded and Ella watched as her wish sailed away on a small green card.
But instead of a castle, something horrible happened. All the stars disappeared from the sky and the night became very dark. Ella was filled with regret and sadness.
And that is why we should be careful when we make a wish, because you never know what will happen when you send it away.
