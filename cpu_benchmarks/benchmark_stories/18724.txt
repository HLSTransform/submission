Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the theater with her mommy and daddy. One day, they went to see a long movie about a princess and a dragon.
During the movie, Lily saw a man bow to the princess. She turned to her mommy and asked, "Why did that man bow?" Her mommy explained that it was a way to show respect and honor.
After the movie, they went to get ice cream. Lily told her daddy that she wanted to be a princess when she grew up. Her daddy smiled and said, "You already are a princess to us."
Lily smiled and hugged her daddy tight. She felt happy and loved. She couldn't wait to go back to the theater and see more princesses and dragons.
