Once upon a time there was a smart bear. He was walking in the forest and he saw a newspaper lying in the grass. He stopped and picked it up. He looked at it and thought "this looks interesting”. 
Bear then turned it over and saw a picture of a balloon on the other side. He smiled and said "oh what fun, I'd like to fly in one of those one day". 
Suddenly, he heard a voice from above. He turned and saw a bird high up in the trees. The bird said, "I fly in my balloon all the time, it's so much fun. You should give it a try Bear!"
Bear smiled and nodded his head. He said, “yes, I think I will. I will be smart and give it a try!”
The bird said, “Good choice! Tomorrow I'll come back and bring my balloon. We can go for a ride together.”
Bear was delighted and excited. He could hardly wait for tomorrow. He said goodbye to the bird and ran off to tell his friends.
The next day, the bird came back and they took off on the balloon ride. Bear loved it, he was so happy and amazed. He had a really fun day and learned that being smart and trying new things is really exciting.
