Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three years old and loved to tell stories. 
One day, Lucy was walking in the park when she saw an old lady. The lady was waving her hand, so Lucy waved back. The old lady had a big smile.
"Hello, would you like to hear one of my stories?" the old lady asked. Lucy was so excited and nodded her head. 
The old lady began to tell her a tale about a flexible prince. He used his flexible body to do amazing things. Lucy clapped her hands in delight throughout the story. 
When the old lady finished the story, she gave Lucy a wave. Lucy said goodbye, waved back, and ran off to tell her own stories.
