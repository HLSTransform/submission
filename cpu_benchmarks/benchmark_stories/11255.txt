Once upon a time, there was a naughty but tiny little monkey called Mike. Mike had a very special drum that was brown. Whenever Mike played with this drum, he was the happiest monkey around!
One day, Mike was feeling very adventurous and he decided to crawl up a tree. He carefully crawled up and up until he came across an old cocoon. Mike was so curious and he wondered what was inside.
Suddenly, the cocoon opened up and out came a butterfly. A little voice said “Hello Mike! Do you want to play with my drum?” Mike looked up and saw that the voice was coming from the butterfly. He was so excited!
Mike said “Yes please!” The butterfly gave Mike the drum and Mike crawled back down the tree with his new toy. They said goodbye and Mike brought it back home.
He happily played with his new brown drum all day long. Mike had lots of fun and he never forgot that special day.
