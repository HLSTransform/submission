Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play outside in the sunshine and run through the grass. One day, Benny saw a spark in the woods and went to investigate. He found a shiny rock and decided to keep it as his treasure.
But as Benny walked back home, the sky turned gloomy and dark clouds covered the sun. Benny started to feel scared and worried. He tried to relax and tell himself everything was okay, but he couldn't shake the feeling of unease.
Suddenly, a big storm came and lightning struck a tree near Benny. He was so scared that he dropped his treasure and ran back to his burrow. When he got there, he realized that his treasure wasn't worth risking his safety for.
The moral of the story is that sometimes things may seem important, but it's not worth risking your safety or happiness for them. It's important to stay safe and relaxed, even when things seem scary.
