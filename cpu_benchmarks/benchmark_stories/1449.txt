Once there was a girl named Sarah. She was three years old and loved to dance. On a sunny day, Sarah found an object that she really wanted to play with. It was big and round and blue. Sarah held it tight and started to dance. She smiled as she jumped up and down and twirled in circles. She was dancing so fast that the object flew up into the air! Sarah caught it and continued to dance. She held it tight again and moved her arms and legs up and down. She danced around the whole house, having lots of fun. Sarah was so happy that she kept on dancing until it was time for dinner.
