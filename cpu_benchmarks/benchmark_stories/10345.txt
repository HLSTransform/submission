Tim and Mia like to play in the park. They like to swing, slide and run. One day, they see something new in the grass. It is long and thin and has scales. It is a snake!
Tim and Mia are curious. They want to touch the snake. They go closer and closer. The snake does not move. It is very still. Tim and Mia think it is sleeping.
Tim reaches out his hand. He wants to poke the snake. Mia says, "No, Tim, don't do that! The snake might bite you!" But Tim does not listen. He pokes the snake with his finger.
The snake wakes up. It is angry. It hisses and shows its teeth. It starts to coil around Tim's hand. Tim is scared. He screams and cries. Mia is scared too. She runs to get help.
A man hears Tim and Mia. He comes to the park. He sees the snake on Tim's hand. He is brave. He grabs the snake and pulls it off. He throws it away. The snake slithers away. It is not happy.
The man checks Tim's hand. He is lucky. The snake did not bite him. He only has a red mark. The man tells Tim and Mia, "You should never touch a snake. Snakes are dangerous. They can hurt you. You should stay away from them."
Tim and Mia nod. They say, "We are sorry. We did not know. Thank you for saving us." The man smiles. He says, "You are welcome. Be careful next time." He takes Tim and Mia to their mom. Their mom hugs them. She is glad they are safe.
Tim and Mia learn a lesson. They do not play with snakes anymore. They play with other things in the park. They play with balls, bikes and dolls. They have fun. They are happy.
