Lily and Ben were playing in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They gave him a carrot nose and two buttons for eyes. They were very happy.
But then, a big dog came running. He saw the snowman and wanted to play with him. He jumped on the snowman and knocked him down. He bit the carrot nose and the buttons. He tore the hat and the scarf. Lily and Ben were very sad.
"Stop it, dog! You are bad!" Lily shouted. "You broke our snowman!"
But the dog did not listen. He barked and wagged his tail. He thought it was fun.
Then, a nurse came by. She saw the dog and the snowman. She saw Lily and Ben crying. She was very kind.
"Hello, children. What happened here?" she asked.
"That dog broke our snowman!" Ben said. "He is mean!"
The nurse looked at the dog. She saw a tag on his collar. It had a name and a phone number.
"Oh, I know this dog. His name is Rex. He belongs to Mr. Jones. He must have run away from his yard. He is not mean, he is just playful. He does not know that the snowman is not a toy. He needs to learn to be gentle and respectful." she said.
She took out her phone and called Mr. Jones. She told him to come and get Rex. She also gave Lily and Ben some cookies and hot chocolate. She hugged them and said sorry.
"Thank you, nurse. You are nice." Lily said.
"Yes, thank you. You are helpful." Ben said.
Mr. Jones came and took Rex. He apologized to Lily and Ben. He said he would fix the fence and keep Rex inside. He also gave them a new hat and scarf for their snowman.
Lily and Ben smiled. They thanked Mr. Jones and Rex. They learned that sometimes, people and animals make mistakes. They learned to forgive and be kind. They also learned to be careful and not freeze in the snow. They went home with their nurse and had a warm and cozy night.
