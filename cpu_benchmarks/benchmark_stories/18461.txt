Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a sister named Rose. They both loved to play together. One day, Lily accidentally broke Rose's toy. Rose got very upset and started to cry. 
Lily said, "I'm sorry, I will replace your toy with a new one." 
Rose stopped crying and said, "Okay, thank you." 
Later that day, it got very dark outside. Lily and Rose were scared. They hugged each other and said, "We will always protect each other." 
From that day on, Lily and Rose never fought again. They always shared their toys and protected each other from the dark.
