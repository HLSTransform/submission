Tom and Lily were playing in the woods. They liked to find new things and have fun. They saw a big hole in the hill. It was a cave. They wanted to see what was inside.
"Let's go in the cave!" Tom said.
"OK, but be careful. It might be dark and scary," Lily said.
They took a flashlight and stepped into the cave. It was very dark and cold. They saw some rocks and some bats. They heard some water dripping. They walked deeper into the cave.
Suddenly, they heard a loud roar. It was a bear. The bear was angry. It did not like visitors in its home. It saw Tom and Lily and ran towards them.
"Run!" Tom shouted.
They turned around and ran back to the cave entrance. They stepped as fast as they could. The bear was behind them. It was very big and very fast.
They reached the cave entrance and ran out. They saw their mom and dad waiting for them. They were worried.
"Tom! Lily! Where were you? We were looking for you!" Mom said.
"We were in the cave. There was a bear. It was angry. It chased us. We were scared," Lily said.
"Oh, you poor things. You are safe now. Come here and give us a hug," Dad said.
They hugged their mom and dad. They were glad they were out of the cave. They learned a lesson. They would not go into caves again. They would stay with their mom and dad. They would play in the woods, but not in the caves.
