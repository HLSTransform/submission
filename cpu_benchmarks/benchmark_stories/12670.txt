Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her toys. One day, she found a shiny piece of metal on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her friend, Timmy.
"Look what I found!" said Lily.
Timmy looked at the piece and said, "Wow, that's really cool! I wish I had found it first. I'm envious of you."
Lily smiled and said, "You can have it if you want. It appeared out of nowhere, so maybe it's meant for you."
Timmy was very happy and thanked Lily for her kindness. From then on, they played together with the shiny piece and had lots of fun. The end.
