Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very tired because he had been playing outside all day. He went to his mom and said, "Mommy, I'm so tired. Can we go inside and rest?"
His mom said, "Of course, Timmy. But first, let's have a snack. How about some blueberries?"
Timmy smiled and said, "Yes, please!" He loved blueberries. As they were eating, Timmy's dad came home from work. He saw Timmy and said, "Hey, Timmy! What do you call a blueberry that tells jokes?"
Timmy looked confused and said, "I don't know, Daddy. What?"
"A blueberry joker!" his dad said, laughing.
Timmy giggled too and said, "That's a funny joke, Daddy." Then he yawned and said, "But I'm still tired. Can we go rest now?"
