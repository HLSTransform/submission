Once there was a rabbit. He loved carrots that grew in the garden. One day he was very lucky, he found the biggest carrot he had ever seen. But he was warned not to eat it.
He was sad, but he did not eat the carrot. Instead, he put the carrot on his doorstep. He hoped that one of his friends would be lucky enough to find the carrot.
The next morning, a little bird was lucky enough to find the carrot. He was so happy! He thanked the rabbit for his gift and flew away.
 
The rabbit felt happy that his friend was so lucky. He knew he had done the right thing by not eating the carrot. He promised himself to always remember to listen when people warn him.
