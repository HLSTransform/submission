Once upon a time, there was a big animal named rhinoceros. He had a big horn on his nose and he lived in a big forest. One day, he met a little boy who asked him, "What is your name?" The rhinoceros replied, "My name is Rhino."
The little boy saw that Rhino's home was messy and not tidy. So, he decided to help him clean it up. They worked together and made Rhino's home very tidy. Rhino was so happy and he thanked the little boy for helping him.
From that day on, Rhino and the little boy became friends. They would play together in the forest and have lots of fun. Rhino was very grateful to have such a kind friend who helped him make his home tidy.
