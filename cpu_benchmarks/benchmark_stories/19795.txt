Once upon a time, there was a naughty toy. The toy wanted to have some fun all by itself. So it decided to go exploring.
The toy went all around the house, looking for something interesting. Soon, it found a yummy cookie. But before it could eat it, a big hand caught the toy. It was Mama!
Mama said, "Naughty toy, you need to stay in your room!" The toy was very sad and tried to explain it just wanted to have some fun. But Mama was not happy.
Finally, Mama said, "Okay. But if you want to go explore, you need to take your Teddy bear friend. Then you won't get into trouble!"
The toy was so excited and nodded. Soon, the naughty toy and Teddy bear were having a great time exploring the house. They needed each other to stay out of trouble!
