Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to eat oranges, and he always had orange juice for breakfast. One day, Tim's mom took him to the barber to get a haircut. Tim was scared because he didn't like haircuts. 
The barber asked Tim what kind of haircut he wanted. Tim said he wanted a haircut like his favorite superhero. But when the barber was done, Tim didn't like his haircut. He regretted telling the barber what he wanted. 
Tim's mom tried to cheer him up by giving him an orange to eat. But Tim didn't want it. He was still sad about his haircut. His mom asked him what was wrong, and Tim told her he didn't like his haircut. His mom said it would grow back soon, and that it was just hair. Tim felt better and ate his orange happily.
