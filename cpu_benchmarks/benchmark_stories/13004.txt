The sun was shining, and the birds were singing. It was spring. Ben was feeling sad. He didn't know why. He asked his dad: "Why am I sad?" His dad said: "Sometimes life is difficult, but remember it's spring. Spring is a happy time. We can all feel better by spending time together".
So, Ben and his dad took a walk outside. They jumped in puddles and chased the butterflies. It was fun! Ben smiled and forgot why he was feeling sad. He laughed and felt happy and free. His dad smiled too. Ben was so glad his dad helped him feel better again. 
Then, they saw a bright yellow flower. It was so pretty! Ben picked it for his mum, as a surprise. Ben's dad said: "That was very kind of you. I'm so proud of you". Ben felt proud too. 
The sun was starting to set. Ben was feeling content and happy. He waved goodbye to spring, knowing that he had enjoyed it and that he felt better.
