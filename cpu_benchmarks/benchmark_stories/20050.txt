Once upon a time, there was a little chicken named Chickie. Chickie lived on a farm with her family and friends. One day, Chickie found a big, shiny egg. She was so excited and wanted to show it to everyone. 
But when Chickie tried to show the egg to her friends, they were all too loud and didn't listen to her. Chickie felt sad and didn't know what to do. 
Then, Chickie saw her mama kneel down beside her. Mama listened to Chickie and helped her solve the problem. They decided to have a quiet picnic and show the egg to each other one by one. 
Chickie learned that sometimes it's better to talk quietly and that her mama will always be there to help her. And the egg? It hatched into a cute little chick, just like Chickie.
