Anna and Ben were playing on the beach. They liked to dig in the sand and find shells and stones. They saw a large crab walking on the rocks. They wanted to catch it and look at it.
"Let's go get the crab!" Ben said. He ran towards the rocks with a bucket in his hand.
"Wait for me!" Anna said. She followed him with a net in her hand. She was afraid of the crab. It had big claws and eyes on stalks.
The crab saw the children coming. It did not like them. It wanted to be left alone. It hid under a rock and waited.
Ben reached the rock first. He put his bucket down and lifted the rock. He saw the crab and smiled. He reached for it with his hand.
"Stop!" Anna shouted. She saw something shiny under the sand. She thought it was a shell. She bent down and picked it up.
It was not a shell. It was a whistle. It made a loud noise when she blew it.
The noise scared the crab. It snapped its claws at Ben's hand. Ben screamed and dropped the rock. He ran away from the crab.
The noise also scared a seagull. It was flying over the beach. It saw the crab and thought it was food. It swooped down and grabbed the crab in its beak.
Anna and Ben watched the seagull fly away with the crab. They were sad and surprised. They had lost the crab and the whistle.
They went back to their parents. They told them what happened. Their parents hugged them and gave them ice cream. They said they were brave and lucky.
Anna and Ben felt better. They decided to play with their sandcastle instead. They did not want to catch any more crabs.
