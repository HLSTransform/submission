Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was her doll. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help her mix some ingredients in a bowl. Lily was so excited to help her mom. She mixed the ingredients with a big spoon and it made a funny sound. Lily laughed and said, "I'm mixing, I'm mixing!"
After they finished mixing, Lily's mom asked her to put on her suit. Lily didn't know what a suit was, but her mom showed her a pretty dress to wear. Lily put on the dress and felt like a princess. She twirled around and said, "Look, Mommy! I'm wearing a suit!"
Later that day, Lily's dad came home from work and he smelled really smelly. Lily wrinkled her nose and said, "Daddy, you're smelly!" Her dad laughed and said, "I know, Lily. I need to take a shower." Lily's mom sprayed some perfume and it smelled much better. Lily said, "Now you smell good, Daddy!" and gave him a big hug.
