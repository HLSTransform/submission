Ben and Lily were playing in the garden. They saw a big pile of leaves. They wanted to make a fire with the leaves.
"Let's pick some leaves and put them in a circle," Ben said.
"OK, I will pick the red ones and you pick the yellow ones," Lily said.
They picked many leaves and made a circle. They found a stick and a match. Ben tried to light the match, but it did not work.
"Let me try," Lily said. She took the match and rubbed it on the box. It made a spark and a flame.
"Wow, look at the flame! It is so colorful!" Ben said.
They put the match on the leaves. The leaves started to burn. They made a small fire.
"Be careful, the fire is hot," Lily said.
They sat next to the fire and watched the colorful flame. They felt warm and happy. They sang a song and roasted some marshmallows. They had fun in the garden.
