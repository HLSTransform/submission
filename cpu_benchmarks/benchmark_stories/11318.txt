John was very excited. He got dressed and helped to open the window. He peeked outside and took a deep breath. The sun was shining brightly. 
John was happy and decided to go out into the garden. He took two steps outside, but suddenly he fell. He had stepped into a hole and was stuck. 
John tried to get out but he couldn't. He started to cry. No one came to help him. He stayed there for hours until the sun started to go down. He was sad and scared. 
John was never able to leave the hole. He was stuck there forever. He never returned to the window.
