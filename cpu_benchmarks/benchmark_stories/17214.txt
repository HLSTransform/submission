Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was going to a party with her mommy and daddy. Lily was very excited because she was going to see her friends and eat cake.
In the car, Lily sat in her seat and looked out the window. She saw the trees and the birds. But then, she started to worry. "Mommy, where is my favorite toy?" she asked. "Don't worry, sweetie," said her mommy. "We'll find it when we get home."
When they arrived at the party, Lily saw her friends and ran to play with them. She forgot all about her toy. She ate cake and danced with her friends. Lily was so happy that she didn't even remember to worry anymore.
