Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park near their houses. One day, they see a big ball on the street. It is red and shiny. They want to play with it.
"Let's get the ball!" Anna says.
"No, it is not safe. The street has cars. They are fast and loud. They can hurt us," Ben says.
"But I want the ball. It is pretty. Please, Ben, come with me," Anna says.
She runs to the street. Ben is scared. He does not want to lose his friend. He runs after her. He tries to tell her to stop. But she does not listen. She reaches the ball. She picks it up. She is happy.
But then, a car comes. It is very fast. It does not see Anna and Ben. It honks. It is very loud. Anna and Ben are scared. They drop the ball. They run back to the park. They are safe.
They hug each other. They are sorry. They say sorry to each other. They promise to never go to the street again. They are happy. They are friends.
