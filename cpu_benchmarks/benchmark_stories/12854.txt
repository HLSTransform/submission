Once there was a little girl named Mary who loved exploring. One day, she decided to head west to find something new.
Mary walked and walked, but the western landscape seemed to stay the same. She became thirsty and found a little hut with a spicy drink inside. She gulped it down quickly, but soon realized it was too spicy. Mary's mouth and throat felt like they were on fire. 
Mary was worried. She didn't know how to calm down the burning in her throat. Then she saw a pond nearby and quickly ran over and put her face in the cool water. Relief flooded over her as the burning sensation disappeared.
Mary sat back, happy to have realized that the pond could help her. From then on, she only drank mild drinks when she was thirsty.
