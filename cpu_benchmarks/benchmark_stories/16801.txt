Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to surf in the great big ocean waves. He would ride the waves and feel the wind in his hair. 
One day, Timmy saw a big boat in the distance. He wanted to see it up close, so he leaned over the edge of his surfboard. But then, a giant wave came and knocked him off his board. 
Timmy tried to swim back to his board, but the waves were too strong. He got tired and couldn't swim anymore. Sadly, Timmy never made it back to his surfboard and was lost in the ocean forever.
