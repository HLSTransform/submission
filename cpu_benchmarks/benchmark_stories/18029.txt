Once upon a time, there was a green rhinoceros named Remy. Remy loved to eat leaves and play with his friends in the jungle. One day, Remy met a little bird named Bobby. Bobby was sad because he lost his favorite toy.
Remy asked Bobby what was wrong. Bobby said, "I lost my toy and I can't find it." Remy said, "Don't worry, I'll help you find it." They searched all over the jungle, but they couldn't find the toy.
Suddenly, a mean lion appeared and demanded that Remy give him all his leaves. Remy said, "No, these are my leaves." The lion got angry and chased Remy and Bobby. They ran and ran until they reached a cliff. Remy tried to jump over it, but he couldn't. The lion caught up to them and pushed Remy off the cliff. Remy fell to the ground and hurt himself badly. Bobby was very sad and didn't know what to do without his new friend.
