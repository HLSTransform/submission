Once upon a time, there was a shy mouse named Max. Max lived in a maze and he was scared of everything. He always stayed in his hole and never went out to play.
One day, Max met a friendly cat named Tom. Tom said, "Hi Max, why are you so shy? Do you want to play with me?" Max was scared at first but then he said, "Okay, I will play with you."
Tom and Max played a game of hide and seek in the maze. Max was very good at hiding and Tom couldn't find him. But then Max accidentally bumped into a lever and it released a trap door. Tom fell down the trap door and Max was worried. "Are you okay, Tom?" Max asked.
Tom said, "Yes, I'm okay. Thank you for releasing me from the trap." From that day on, Max was not shy anymore and he played with Tom every day.
