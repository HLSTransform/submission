The sun was shining brightly and Jenny was outside in the garden. She loved to watch the birds singing and the flowers growing.
Jenny saw a beautiful chair in the garden and she wanted to sit on it. She ran across the garden and climbed up on the chair. It was so comfortable and she loved it.
Jenny sat there for a few minutes and then she remembered that her Mom had asked her to leave the chair alone. Feeling sad, Jenny got off the chair and walked away.
As Jenny left the chair, she turned around to take one last look and smiled. Even though she wasn't allowed to sit on it, she still thought it was beautiful.
