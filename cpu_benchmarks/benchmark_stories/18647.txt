Once upon a time, there was an old lady who lived in a big house. She had a lucky cat named Mittens. Mittens was always by her side and they liked to play together. 
One day, the old lady's clothes shrunk in the dryer and she couldn't wear them anymore. She was sad because she didn't have any money to buy new clothes. But then, she remembered something lucky. 
Mittens had a special collar that could grant wishes. The old lady made a wish to have new clothes that fit her. Suddenly, her clothes grew back to their old size and she was so happy! She hugged Mittens and thanked him for being so lucky.
