Lily was shy. She did not like to talk to new people. She liked to play with her toys and her cat. But today, she had to go on a trip with her mom and dad. They were going to visit her grandma and grandpa in another town.
Lily was scared. She did not know her grandma and grandpa very well. She had only seen them in pictures. She wondered if they would be nice to her. She wondered if they would have toys and a cat for her to play with. She held her mom's hand tightly as they got in the car.
The trip was long. Lily looked out the window and saw many things. She saw cows and horses and trees and flowers. She saw big trucks and small cars and buses and bikes. She saw signs and lights and buildings and bridges. She asked her mom and dad many questions. They answered her and smiled.
When they arrived, Lily saw a big house with a garden. She saw her grandma and grandpa waiting for them. They looked like the pictures, but older and bigger. They waved and smiled. Lily hid behind her mom. She was shy.
"Hello, Lily!" her grandma said. "We are so happy to see you! Come here and give us a hug!"
Lily did not move. She was shy.
"It's okay, Lily," her dad said. "They are very nice. They love you very much. They have a surprise for you."
Lily looked up. She was curious.
"What is it?" she asked.
Her grandpa smiled. He took her hand and led her to the garden. There, she saw a small house with a door and a window. It was a playhouse. It was pink and white and had flowers and butterflies on it. It had a table and chairs and a tea set and a doll and a teddy bear inside.
"This is for you, Lily," her grandpa said. "This is your playhouse. You can play here whenever you want. Do you like it?"
Lily's eyes grew wide. She loved it. She forgot to be shy. She ran to the playhouse and opened the door. She hugged the doll and the teddy bear. She smiled.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you!" she said. "I love it! I love you!"
She came out and hugged her grandma and grandpa. They hugged her back. They smiled.
Lily was happy. She was not shy anymore. She had a playhouse and a new family. She had a great trip.
