Once upon a time there was a boy named Will. He was walking through the forest looking for his friends when he heard a loud noise. It was a scary sound. Will was scared and ran away as fast as he could.
As he ran, Will came across something strange. It was a big word on the floor. He was curious, so he stopped to take a closer look. Suddenly, out of the blue, an old man popped up in front of him.
The old man said that he would give Will something special if he could guess the meaning of the word. Will thought for a moment, then he said that he thought the word meant “Pay”. The old man was very happy and he paid Will with a bag of sweets!
Will was so happy. He had figured out the scary word, made a new friend and got a surprise reward. Will ran back home with a smile on his face.
