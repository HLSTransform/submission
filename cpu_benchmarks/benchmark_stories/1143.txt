Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to eat her food with sauce. One day, she felt uncomfortable because her favorite sauce was all gone. She was very sad.
Lily's mommy saw that she was unhappy. So, she went to the store and bought more sauce for Lily. When Lily saw the sauce, she felt so much better. She was very happy and excited to eat her food with the sauce again.
Lily said, "Thank you, mommy, for getting me more sauce!" Her mommy smiled and gave her a big hug. They both enjoyed their meal with the yummy sauce. From that day on, Lily always remembered to thank her mommy for the things she did for her.
