Ben and Lily went to the zoo with Mom and Dad. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and giraffes. But Ben's favorite was the ostrich. He liked its long neck and big eyes.
"Can I touch it?" Ben asked Mom.
"No, Ben, you can't. The ostrich is behind a fence. It might bite you or kick you. It is very strong," Mom said.
But Ben did not listen. He ran to the fence and reached his hand to the ostrich. The ostrich saw Ben and got angry. It pecked at Ben's hand and made him cry.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Ben shouted. "It broke my skin! It hurts!"
Mom and Dad ran to Ben and took him away from the fence. They put a band-aid on his hand and hugged him.
"I'm sorry, Ben. You should have listened to Mom. The ostrich is not a toy. It is a wild animal. You are lucky it did not hurt you more," Dad said.
Ben felt bad. He was sorry for being naughty. He learned his lesson. He said sorry to Mom and Dad and to the ostrich. He decided to be more careful and respectful of the animals. He also decided to use his words and not his hands when he wanted something. He was still a little weak, but he was also brave and smart. He enjoyed the rest of the zoo trip with his family.
