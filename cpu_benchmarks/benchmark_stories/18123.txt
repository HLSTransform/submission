Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play on her couch. It was big and soft, but sometimes it felt rough on her skin.
One day, Lily's mom brought home a beautiful vase. Lily admired it so much, she wanted to touch it. But her mom said, "No, it's fragile. You might break it."
Lily was sad, but she still loved looking at the vase. That night, Lily fell asleep on her couch. Suddenly, she heard a loud crash! She woke up and saw the vase had fallen off the table and broke into pieces.
Lily felt bad, but her mom said, "It's okay, accidents happen. I'm just glad you're safe." Lily learned to admire things from a distance and to be careful around fragile things.
