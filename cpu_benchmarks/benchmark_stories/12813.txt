Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to help her mom.
Her mom was busy trying to organize food for dinner and the little girl wanted to help her.
The mom gave the little girl a big onion and asked her to separate it into small pieces.
The little girl tried her best and managed to separate the onion.
The mom was proud of the little girl and was happy to see that she was organized and neat.
The moral of the story is that there is no task too big or too small. Even the little girl could help her mom by separating the onion. Working together can become big achievements and it will give us a sense of pride and satisfaction.
