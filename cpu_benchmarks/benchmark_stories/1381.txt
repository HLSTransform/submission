Once upon a time there were two friends. They were intelligent because they both knew a lot. One friend had a very smooth texture, like a fluffy cloud. The other friend had a rough texture, like a tree trunk.
Whenever these two friends got together, they would have lots of fun. They would play games, run around, and tell each other funny stories. They would also have long conversations, talking about their adventures and the things they had seen.
The two friends were so intelligent that, over the years, they learned about an amazing secret. No one else knew about it, so they kept it a secret between them. They had so much fun exploring this secret together.
No matter what happened, these two friends always had each other. And that made them both very happy.
