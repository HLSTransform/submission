Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat with his fork. He had a silver fork that he used every day. One day, Timmy's mommy said they were going to have a fancy dinner. She said they needed a gold fork to eat with. Timmy was so excited!
When they went to the fancy dinner, Timmy saw that everyone had a gold fork. He felt happy that he had one too. The food was very yummy and Timmy felt very full. He told his mommy that he felt rich because he had a gold fork to eat with.
After the dinner, Timmy's mommy told him that he did a good job using his fork. She said he could improve even more by practicing every day. Timmy promised to practice using his fork so he could be even better at eating. The end.
