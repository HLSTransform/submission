Once there was a small worm called Bob. Bob was very playful and loved running around and exploring. One day, Bob found himself in a brand new garden. He wriggled around and explored all the colourful flowers. 
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a little girl appeared. She bent down and looked into Bob's eyes. Bob hoped he wouldn't be squished.
The little girl smiled and said, “You’re so cute! I’m going to love you!”
Bob was so happy and bounced around in joy. The little girl laughed and decided to pick him up carefully and take him home with her. From then on, the little girl and Bob were the best of friends and played together every day.
