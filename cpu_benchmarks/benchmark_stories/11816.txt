Once, there was a little girl who saw a purple creature. The creature was very dangerous. She wanted to introduce herself and asked it what its name was. But when she tried to do this, the creature got angry. It tried to attack the girl. She was so scared that she ran away as fast as she could.
The little girl never saw the purple creature again. She was so lucky that she had escaped from it. The creature was too dangerous for her and she thought it was best to stay away from it. But she always remembered the day she tried to introduce herself to the purple creature. She never forgot how dangerous it was.
