Once upon a time there was a little girl named Grace. Grace was three years old and she had a mom and dad who loved her very much. One day, Grace and her parents went on an adventure to the park.
Grace was so excited! She ran around the park and played with all the other kids. Suddenly, Grace noticed that her coat was missing. Where could it be? Grace was starting to get scared.
Just then, she saw her dad running towards her with her coat in his hands. He had rescued it from getting caught on a bush! Grace was so happy that her dad had rescued her coat. She hugged him tightly and thanked him.
Grace was so excited to have her coat back that she skipped around the park for the rest of the day! She had a wonderful time with her mom and dad and was never so happy to be reunited with her coat.
