Once upon a time there was a man. He was walking very fast. He didn't slow down, until he saw something shining in the grass. He looked closer, and he saw a big, pink Stop sign. He stopped so he wouldn't hit it. He looked around, but nothing was there. He scratched his head and looked normal.
Then he heard some noise. He looked in every direction, and then he saw another man. The other man was holding a shiny red ball. Suddenly, the man holding the ball started running away. The other man started to run after him.
He ran and ran, until he caught up to the other man. Then he stopped and said, "Hey, why are you running away so fast?"
The other man looked a bit scared and said, "I'm sorry, I was just trying to have some fun!"
The other man smiled and said, "That's OK. Let's just have a normal game of catch instead."
