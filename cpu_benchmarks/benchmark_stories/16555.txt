Tom and Lily were having lunch with their mom. They liked to eat chicken nuggets with sauce. Mom gave them two kinds of sauce: red sauce and brown sauce. Tom liked red sauce because it was sweet. Lily liked brown sauce because it was salty.
"Can I have more red sauce, please?" Tom asked mom.
"Sure, here you go," mom said and gave him a little cup of red sauce.
"Thank you, mom," Tom said and dipped his nugget in the sauce.
Lily saw that Tom had more sauce than her. She wanted more sauce too. She reached for the bottle of brown sauce on the table. But she was not careful. She knocked over the bottle and the sauce spilled on the tablecloth.
"Oh no!" Lily said. "I'm sorry, mom. I made a mess."
Mom came over and saw the sauce on the tablecloth. She was not happy. She took a napkin and tried to wipe the sauce off.
"It's okay, Lily. Accidents happen. But you have to be more careful next time. You don't want to lose all your sauce, do you?" mom said.
"No, mom. I don't want to lose my sauce. I like my sauce," Lily said.
"Me too. I like my sauce," Tom said.
"Then let's finish our lunch and enjoy our sauce. But don't spill any more, okay?" mom said.
"Okay, mom," Tom and Lily said.
They ate their nuggets and sauce and smiled at each other. They were happy. They liked their sauce.
