Lily was hungry. She wanted to eat her pasta with cheese. She looked for a fork in the kitchen, but she could not find one. All the forks were dirty in the sink. Mom was busy on the phone. She did not hear Lily.
Lily saw a big spoon on the table. She thought maybe she could use it to eat her pasta. She reached for the spoon, but it was too high for her. She tried to climb on the chair, but she slipped and fell. She hurt her knee and started to cry.
Mom heard Lily cry and ran to the kitchen. She saw Lily on the floor with a red knee. She put down the phone and hugged Lily. She said, "Oh, Lily, what happened? Are you okay?"
Lily sobbed and said, "I want pasta. I need fork. No fork. Spoon too high. I fall. Ouch."
Mom kissed Lily's knee and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was busy on the phone. I didn't know you were hungry. Let me get you a fork and a plate. You can eat your pasta with cheese. It's yummy."
Lily nodded and said, "Thank you, Mom. I love you. Please, can I have some water too?"
Mom smiled and said, "Of course, Lily. I love you too. You are a good girl. Here is your fork and your water. Enjoy your pasta."
Lily took the fork and the water and went to the couch. She ate her pasta with cheese and felt better. She said, "Mmm, pasta good. Mom good. Fork good. Spoon bad."
Mom laughed and said, "Spoon is not bad, Lily. Spoon is for soup. Fork is for pasta. Next time, ask me for a fork, okay?"
Lily said, "Okay, Mom. I will ask you. I'm sorry I made a mess."
Mom said, "It's okay, Lily. I'm not mad. I'm glad you are happy. Now, finish your pasta and we can read a story together."
Lily said, "Yay, story! I love story. Can we read the one with the bear and the honey?"
Mom said, "Sure, Lily. We can read that one. It's your favorite. Come on, let's go to your room."
Lily and Mom went to Lily's room. They read the story with the bear and the honey. Lily laughed and clapped. She hugged Mom and said, "You are the best, Mom. I love you so much."
Mom said, "You are the best, Lily. I love you so much too."
They kissed and cuddled. They fell asleep together. They had a good day.
