Sara and Ben were twins. They liked to play with their toys in the living room. One day, they saw a big vase on the table. It was shiny and pretty. They both wanted to touch it.
"I want to see the vase!" Sara said.
"No, I want to see it!" Ben said.
They both reached for the vase. They pulled and pulled. The vase was heavy. It slipped from their hands. It fell on the floor. It split into many pieces.
"Oh no!" Sara and Ben said.
Mom heard the noise. She came into the living room. She saw the broken vase. She was angry.
"Who did this?" Mom asked.
Sara and Ben looked at each other. They were scared. They did not want to tell the truth.
"It was Sara!" Ben said.
"No, it was Ben!" Sara said.
They both blamed each other. They were selfish. They did not want to get in trouble.
Mom shook her head. She was sad.
"That vase was a gift from Grandma. She loved it very much. You should not have touched it. You should not have lied. You should have shared. You are both naughty. You need to say sorry and clean up the mess." Mom said.
Sara and Ben felt bad. They knew they did wrong. They said sorry to Mom. They said sorry to each other. They helped to clean up the mess. They learned to be more careful and more kind. They hugged Mom and each other. They promised to do better. Mom forgave them. She loved them very much.
