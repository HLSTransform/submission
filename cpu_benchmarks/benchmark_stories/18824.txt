Lily was a big girl who liked to learn new things. She wanted to go to university when she grew up, like her mom and dad. They told her that university was a place where people studied many things and had fun with their friends.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and saw some kids playing with a ball. She wanted to join them, so she ran to them and said, "Hi, can I play with you?"
But the kids did not answer her. They ignored her and kept playing with the ball. They did not want to share or be nice. Lily felt sad and confused. Why did they ignore her? Did they not like her?
She went back to her mom and told her what happened. Her mom hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. Some kids are not very friendly or honest. They do not know how to treat others with respect. But you are a kind and smart girl, and you will find many good friends at university. There, people will appreciate you and your ideas. You will have a lot of fun and learn many things."
Lily smiled and felt better. She knew her mom was right. She did not need to play with the mean kids. She had her mom and her books and her dreams. She looked forward to going to university and meeting new friends. She hoped they would be honest and friendly, like her.
