Once upon a time, there was a nosy parrot. He loved to watch everything that was happening around him. One day, the parrot flew away from his cage and went outside. He saw many things that made him happy, but he didn't mind going back to his cage.
The parrot loved to talk and sing. He had many friends who liked to listen to him. One day, the parrot saw a boy walking by his cage. The boy stopped and looked at the parrot. The parrot said hello and the boy was very happy.
The boy visited the parrot every day and they became good friends. The parrot didn't mind being in his cage because he had a friend to talk to. They would talk and sing together all day long. The parrot was happy and so was the boy. The end.
