Once there was a very good man. He wanted to go on a walk, so he started walking. But then he stopped - because he saw a big colorful butterfly! He watched it fly and sparkle in the sun.
Then the man stopped again. This time he heard a loud noise, like a big truck! He looked around, but all he saw was a puppy playing with a red ball.
The man thought the puppy looked very good, so he said "hello!" to the puppy. The puppy barked and ran around. Then it stopped and the man smiled.
The man and the puppy both laughed. They had a lot of fun together. Then the man said goodbye and started walking again. He waved goodbye to the puppy and kept walking. 
The good man enjoyed his walk and he was happy for the rest of the day.
