Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his guitar. He would strum it gently and sing songs. One day, Timmy's guitar string got twisted. Timmy didn't know what to do, so he asked his mommy for help. His mommy gently untwisted the string and Timmy was happy again. From that day on, Timmy made sure to take gentle care of his guitar. The end.
