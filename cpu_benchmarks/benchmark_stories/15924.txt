One day, a red fisherman went fishing in the ocean. He wanted to improve his skills so he could catch more fish.
Suddenly, a fish appeared and the fisherman was so excited. He casted his fishing rod and quickly pulled on the line. But the fish was too strong for him and wriggled away.
The fisherman looked very disappointed and he said, “Oh no! I must improve my skills if I ever want to catch that fish. I need to practice, practice, practice!” 
He sat by the beach, relaxing and dreaming of a big catch. All of a sudden, the same fish appeared again, jumping out of the water.
The fisherman was determined to catch the fish this time, so he tried very hard and used his best techniques. After a long battle, the fisherman finally pulled up the line and the fish was in his net!
The fisherman cheered and he declared, “Yes! I have improved my fishing skills!”
