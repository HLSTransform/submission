Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was walking in the park with her mom when she saw a pretty balloon. She wanted it so much! But her mom said they didn't have enough money to buy it from the vendor.
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "Mommy, can we buy the balloon tomorrow?" Her mom smiled and said, "Sure, we can decide to come back tomorrow and buy the balloon."
The next day, they went back to the park and found the vendor. Lily pointed to the pretty balloon and said, "I want that one, please!" The vendor smiled and gave the balloon to Lily. She was so happy and held onto it tightly as they walked away.
