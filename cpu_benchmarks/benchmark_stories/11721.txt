Once upon a time there was a little girl named Daisy. Daisy loved rockets! She would look up to the sky and watch the rockets fly by.
One day, Daisy decided to follow the rockets. She put on her shoes, grabbed her hat and ran outside. She walked and walked until she saw a big rocket.
Daisy said, "I want to fly with that rocket!". She ran to the rocket and it began to fly. She went higher and higher. Soon she saw delicious looking candy and cookies floating by.
Daisy was so excited, she shouted, "Yum! I want to eat that delicious candy!". She grabbed one and it was the sweetest treat she had ever tasted.
Daisy smiled and said, "That was the most delicious candy I have ever tasted. I will always follow the rockets from now on!".
