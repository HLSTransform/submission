Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she went for a walk in the forest and saw a bunny. "Hello bunny!" she said. The bunny spoke and said "Hello Lily! I am in trouble. I am stuck in a trap." 
Lily felt troubled too. She didn't want the bunny to be stuck. "Don't worry bunny, I will help you!" she said. She followed the bunny to the trap and saw that it was a big metal cage. "How can we get you out?" she asked. The bunny said "If you speak to the farmer, he might let me go." 
Lily went to the farmer's house and knocked on the door. The farmer answered and Lily said "Hello, Mr. Farmer. There is a bunny stuck in a trap. Can you let him go?" The farmer smiled and said "Of course, I don't want to trap any animals." He went to the forest and let the bunny go free. The bunny hopped away happily and Lily felt proud that she helped him.
