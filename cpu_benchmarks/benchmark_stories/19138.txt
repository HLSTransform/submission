Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends and learn new things. One day, Lily's mommy told her about hurricanes. Hurricanes are big storms with lots of wind and rain. They can be very scary.
Lily was curious and wanted to learn more about hurricanes. Her mommy showed her pictures and explained how they form. Lily was amazed by the power of nature, but also a little scared. 
Later that day, Lily and her friends played outside. The wind was blowing gently and they pretended they were in a hurricane. They laughed and had fun, but also remembered to be careful. Lily learned that even though hurricanes can be scary, they can also be gentle sometimes.
