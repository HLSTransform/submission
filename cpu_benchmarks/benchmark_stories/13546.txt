Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with cardboard boxes. He would make houses and castles out of them. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean up his room. Timmy didn't like cleaning, but he knew it had to be done. So, he began to tidy up his toys. He put his cars in one place and his stuffed animals in another. He was very organized.
Suddenly, Timmy felt a tickle in his nose. He knew what was coming - a sneeze! He sneezed so hard that all the cardboard boxes fell down. Timmy's mom came into the room and saw the mess. She asked Timmy if he was okay. Timmy nodded and said, "I sneezed and the boxes fell down". His mom smiled and helped him clean up the mess. From then on, Timmy made sure to keep his cardboard boxes organized so they wouldn't fall down again.
