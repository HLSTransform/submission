Once upon a time, there was a bear who was feeling very confused. He didn't know what to do. He thought and thought but couldn't think of anything. 
Then he had an idea. He remembered seeing a steak in the kitchen earlier. He decided to go and get it. 
He found the steak and was very excited. He took it to his bedroom and placed it on his bed. Then he looked for something to match it. He couldn't find anything that he liked. 
Suddenly he heard his mum's voice. "What are you looking for, dear?" His mum asked. 
The bear explained that he was looking for something to match his steak. "Oh, I know just the thing!" his mum said. She went and got a bright red napkin and gave it to the bear. 
The bear thanked his mum and placed the napkin with the steak. Now everything matched and he was no longer confused.
