Once upon a time, there was a curious little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to explore the forest near his house. One day, he saw an alligator in the river. Timmy wanted to touch the alligator, so he rubbed his hand on its rough skin.
The alligator didn't like being touched, and it snapped its jaws at Timmy. Timmy ran away as fast as he could. Later that day, Timmy saw his friend Billy and told him about the alligator. "I saw an alligator in the river!" Timmy said. "I touched it, but it didn't like it."
Billy was scared and said, "Don't touch the alligator again, Timmy. It's dangerous!" But Timmy didn't listen. The next day, he went back to the river and tried to touch the alligator again. This time, the alligator bit Timmy and hurt him very badly. Timmy learned a lesson that day: it's not safe to touch wild animals.
