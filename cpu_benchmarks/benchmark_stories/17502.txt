Lily wanted to make a cake for her mom. She liked to help in the kitchen, but she did not know how to bake. She asked her dad for help. He smiled and said, "Sure, we can make a cake together. But first, we need to get some things from the store."
They went to the store and bought flour, sugar, eggs, butter, and chocolate. Lily was happy. She loved chocolate. She hoped her mom would like it too. On the way home, her dad said, "Now, we have to follow the recipe. Baking is like a science. We have to measure and mix everything right. Can you help me with that?"
Lily nodded. She wanted to be a good helper. They got home and put on aprons. They washed their hands and got out a big bowl. Her dad read the recipe and told her what to do. She cracked the eggs, poured the flour, scooped the sugar, and cut the butter. She stirred everything with a big spoon. It was hard work, but fun. She licked the spoon and smiled. It tasted sweet.
They poured the batter into a pan and put it in the oven. Her dad set the timer and said, "Now, we have to wait. The cake needs to bake for a while. Do you want to play a game while we wait?"
Lily said, "Yes, let's play hide and seek." They took turns hiding and seeking in the living room. Lily giggled when her dad found her behind the couch. She squealed when she found him under the table. They had a lot of fun.
The timer beeped. The cake was done. They took it out of the oven and let it cool. Then they spread chocolate frosting on top. Lily sprinkled some colorful candies on it. She wrote "Mom" with a red candy. She was proud of her cake. It looked beautiful.
They put the cake on a plate and covered it with a cloth. They waited for her mom to come home. When they heard the door open, they ran to greet her. They hugged her and said, "Surprise! We made you a cake!"
Her mom was surprised and happy. She lifted the cloth and saw the cake. She said, "Wow, what a beautiful cake! Thank you so much, Lily and dad. You are so sweet and thoughtful. I love you both."
She cut a slice for each of them and they ate it together. It was delicious. Lily felt warm and happy. She had made her mom smile. She had helped her dad bake. She had learned something new. She had a success. She was a good girl.
