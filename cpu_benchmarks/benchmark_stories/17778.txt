Once upon a time, there was a dependable mom. She went to the store and bought some glue. When she returned home, she found her child very excited. The child was about to do something.
The mom asked the child what he was doing, and the child said he wanted to make a picture. The mom permitted him to make the picture.
So, the child carefully opened the glue and started to make his picture. He spread the glue on some paper and put different coloured pieces of paper on top. He pressed them down to make sure they stuck. 
Once the picture was finished, the mom saw that it was very pretty. The child beamed with pride. The dependable mom smiled too. She was so pleased that her child was able to make something special.
