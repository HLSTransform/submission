Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a nosy neighbor who always wanted to know what was happening in Lily's house. One day, Lily's mom got a message on her phone. The neighbor asked what it was about, but Lily's mom didn't want to share. The neighbor disagreed with Lily's mom and kept asking questions. 
Lily didn't like the neighbor being so nosy. She wished the neighbor would mind her own business. Lily's mom told the neighbor that the message was private and not meant for anyone else to see. The neighbor finally understood and apologized for being nosy. From that day on, she tried to respect Lily's family's privacy.
