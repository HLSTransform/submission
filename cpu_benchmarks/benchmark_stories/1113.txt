Once upon a time, there lived two good friends - Joe and Will. One day, the two friends went to the opera. On the way, Will saw something unusual. It was a big pile of shiny things. Joe wanted to take them, so he started to pinch some of the shiny things.
Will saw this and he said, "Joe, don't pinch them! They don't belong to us!" Joe agreed and put them back. But when Joe stepped away, Will saw an even more unusual shiny thing. He couldn't help himself and he pinched it. 
Joe was surprised and he said, "Will, what are you doing? You shouldn't pinch things that don't belong to us." Will was embarrassed and put the shiny thing back. He said, "Sorry, Joe. I just wanted to see what it was." 
Joe smiled and said, "That's OK. Let's enjoy the opera now." So the two friends entered the opera and had a wonderful evening. The end.
