Once upon a time, there was a girl. She loved her bracelet. It was made of thin threads and tiny rocks. It was very pretty, and the girl wore it all the time.
One day, the girl was playing in the garden. Suddenly, she saw a small butterfly and tried to follow it! The butterfly flew so quickly and she ran fast, but the bracelet on her arm kept getting in the way.
The girl looked down at her beautiful bracelet, and decided to make it smaller so she could chase the butterfly more easily. She took out a pair of scissors and carefully cut the threads until the bracelet fit perfectly. 
The girl was very happy with her new bracelet, and she raced around the garden, chasing after the butterfly. She was thrilled that her bracelet was so small and she could play without it getting in her way.
