Tim and Sam were best friends. They liked to play in the park and look for bugs and rocks. One day, they found a big rock that was shiny and smooth. They picked it up and saw that it had many colors inside.
"Wow, this rock is so pretty!" Tim said.
"Maybe it is a magic rock," Sam said. "Maybe it can glow in the dark."
They decided to take the rock home and see if it could glow. They put it in a box and ran to Tim's house. They went to Tim's room and closed the door and the curtains. They opened the box and waited.
At first, nothing happened. The rock was still shiny and smooth, but it did not glow. Tim and Sam felt sad. They thought they had found a magic rock, but it was just a normal rock.
But then, they heard a soft sound. It was like a humming or a singing. They looked at the box and saw that the rock was glowing! It was glowing with many colors, like a rainbow. It was making the sound with its colors.
"Wow, it is a magic rock!" Tim said.
"It is a famous rock!" Sam said. "Maybe it is from space or from a fairy land. Maybe it has a story to tell us."
They moved closer to the rock and listened to its sound. They felt happy and curious. They wondered what the rock would say. They hoped it would be their friend. They smiled at the rock and the rock glowed brighter.
