Lily and Tom were playing in the park with their toy soldiers. They liked to pretend they were in a big war and had to protect their base from the bad guys. They made noises like guns and bombs and ran around the grass.
"Bang! Bang! You're dead, Tom!" Lily shouted, pointing her soldier at Tom's soldier.
"No, I'm not! You missed me, Lily!" Tom said, hiding behind a tree. "I'm too fast for you!"
Lily ran after him, trying to catch him. She was fast too, but Tom was faster. He ran to the other side of the park, where there was a big slide. He climbed up the slide and put his soldier on top.
"Ha! I have the high ground, Lily! You can't get me now!" Tom said, smiling.
Lily was not happy. She wanted to get Tom and his soldier. She looked around and saw a big rock. She picked it up and threw it at the slide. The rock hit the slide and made a loud noise. Tom and his soldier fell down the slide and landed on the ground.
"Ow! Ow! Ow! That hurt, Lily!" Tom cried, holding his soldier and his head.
Lily ran to him and saw that he was hurt. She felt sorry for him. She put down her soldier and hugged him.
"I'm sorry, Tom. I didn't mean to hurt you. I just wanted to play." Lily said, softly.
"It's okay, Lily. I'm sorry too. I shouldn't have run away from you. I just wanted to have fun." Tom said, hugging her back.
They looked at each other and smiled. They were friends again. They picked up their soldiers and decided to play something else. They liked to play with their soldiers, but they liked to play with each other more. They were happy.
