One night, Jake was walking through the woods alone. He felt very scared as the woods were very quiet. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise from the bushes and a huge tiger came out. Jake was so scared he started to shiver.
"Don't be afraid," said the tiger. "I just wanted to have a look around and make sure no one else was here."
Jake was very surprised, he had never talked to a tiger before. He was so scared but he managed to answer.
"Yes, I was passing by and I am the only person here," he replied.
The tiger smiled and said, "That's good, then I can carry on exploring. Have a good night!"
The tiger disappeared into the bushes and Jake continued to walk, but now he was walking faster, still feeling scared but relieved that the tiger wasn't mad. He was glad to make it out of the woods and get home safely.
