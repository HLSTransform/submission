Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very persistent. Every day, she would take off her vest right after school and hang it up in the sun. She was determined to make her vest dry!
One day, the little girl went outside and placed her vest in the sun. She watched it carefully, but it stayed wet. She was not giving up. She tried again the next day.
This time, she stayed outside and watched her vest until it was dry. She was so happy. Suddenly, she felt the wind blowing on her face and she looked up. There was a rainbow in the sky! 
The little girl felt so proud of herself. She had worked hard and her vest was now completely dry. She smiled and said, "I am so persistent!"
