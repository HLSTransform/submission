Once upon a time, there was a little girl that lived on a beautiful lake. One day, the girl was walking around the lake when suddenly she saw something magical. It was a big white swan! The girl was so excited that she immediately wanted to introduce herself to the swan.
The girl introduced herself to the swan in a very friendly and kind way. She was amazed by the beauty of the swan and was so happy to have found it. 
The swan happily accepted the girl's introduction and said hello back. It flew around the lake, showing the girl its amazing grace and beauty. The girl was so mesmerized by the swanâ€™s beauty that she thought to herself, "I want to be like that swan, graceful and kind."
The moral of the story is that you should always be kind, graceful, and accepting. Be like the swan - open and welcoming to new people and things.
