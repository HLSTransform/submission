Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside in the dirt. One day, he found a long, wiggly worm. The worm was very friendly and liked to play with Tim.
"Hi, worm!" said Tim. "Do you want to play with me?" The worm wiggled and danced, and Tim knew that it wanted to play too. They played together all day, digging in the dirt and making new friends with the other worms.
Tim had an expensive toy car. It was big, red, and shiny. Tim liked to play with his car, but he was always careful not to break it. One day, while playing with his worm friend, Tim accidentally drove his car too fast and it hit a big rock. The car broke into pieces.
"Oh no!" said Tim. "My car is broken. What should I do?" The friendly worm wiggled and danced, and it gave Tim an idea. Tim picked up the pieces of his car and put them back together. With the help of his worm friend, Tim fixed his expensive toy car.
Tim was so happy that his car was fixed. He thanked his worm friend and they continued to play together. From that day on, Tim knew that he could always count on his worm friend to help him when things got tough. And they lived happily ever after.
