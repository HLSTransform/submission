Once there was a little boy named Tom who wanted to play outside. He asked his mom if he could go on an adventure in his jeep. His mom said he could, but only if he kept his jeep clean.
Tom happily ran outside and hopped into his jeep. He revved up the engine and the jeep started to move. Tom drove around the backyard, around the trees and down the driveway, going faster and faster.
But, as he drove around, Tom didn't care about keeping his jeep clean. Soon it was covered with mud and dirt. Tom's mom saw him from the kitchen window and demanded that Tom stop driving and clean up his jeep. Tom grumbled, but went to get the hose and some soap.
Tom worked hard with the hose and soap, and soon his jeep was no longer dirty. With his jeep clean and shiny, Tom could go outside and have more adventures.
