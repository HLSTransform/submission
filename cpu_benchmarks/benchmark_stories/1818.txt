Once there was a little boy named Joe. One day Joe went to a garden and saw a big apple tree. He was so excited and couldn't wait to eat an apple. As he approached the tree he heard a voice say "stop". Joe looked up and saw a purple bird perched on the branch.
The bird said "That apple is mine! Don't you even think about taking it." Joe was very upset by the bird's words. He tried to reason with the bird but the bird was very stubborn.
In the end, Joe had a great idea. He offered the bird another apple in exchange for the one on the branch. The bird was delighted with this and accepted the deal. Joe got the apple, and the bird got the one Joe had offered.
They both smiled and went their separate ways. Joe was very happy that he got to have the apple. He was even more happy that he was able to solve the conflict in a friendly way.
