Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. One night, Tim saw a candle on the table. He did not know what it was, so he was ignorant about it. He gazed at the candle and thought it was pretty.
Tim's mom came into the room and saw him looking at the candle. She told him it was a candle and that it could be hot if it was lit. Tim listened to his mom and learned about the candle.
From that day on, Tim was not ignorant about candles anymore. He was careful around them and always remembered what his mom told him. Tim and his mom were happy and safe with the candles in their home.
