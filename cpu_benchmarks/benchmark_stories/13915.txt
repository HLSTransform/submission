Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Sue. Sue loved to design things. One day, she wanted to design a pot. She found some clay and started to work.
Sue's friend, Tim, came over. He saw Sue's pot and said, "I want to design a pot too!" But Tim was not kind. He took Sue's pot and broke it. Sue was very sad.
Sue tried to fix her pot, but it was too broken. Tim did not say sorry. Sue was sad and her pot was gone. In the end, Sue learned to be careful with her things and not let mean friends like Tim play with them.
