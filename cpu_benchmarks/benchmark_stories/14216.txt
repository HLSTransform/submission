Once upon a time, there was a thin frog. He loved to jump, high and low. But he was getting tired of jumping in the same place. He wanted something new to try his jumps on. 
So he hopped away and looked for something new. He came to a big measure. It was so big, he couldn't see the top. He jumped to see how high he could go. He jumped higher and higher, but he couldn't reach the top.
He decided to try something else. He hopped around the measure and tried to build a staircase out of stones. He stacked the stones one on top of the other until he reached the top! He was so proud of his work.
He jumped from the top of the measure and was amazed. He had never jumped so high before. He thanked the measure and hopped away happily, knowing he would never forget this amazing jump!
