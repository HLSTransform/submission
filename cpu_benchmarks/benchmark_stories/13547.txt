Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars and trucks. One day, Timmy saw a big, red fire truck driving down his street. He thought it looked different than the other cars.
Timmy ran outside to see the fireman. The fireman smiled at Timmy and showed him his shiny helmet. Timmy thought the fireman was really cool, so he asked if he could ride in the fire truck. The fireman said no, because it was dangerous.
Timmy was sad, but he knew he could trust the fireman because he was a hero who helps people. Later that day, Timmy saw smoke coming from his neighbor's house. He remembered the fireman and called 911. The fireman came to put out the fire and Timmy felt happy that he helped save the day.
