Lily and Tom are playing in the park. They see a big pile of waste near the bin. It is dirty and smelly. Lily and Tom do not like it.
"Who put this waste here?" Lily asks. "It is bad for the park and the animals."
"I do not know," Tom says. "Maybe someone was lazy and did not use the bin."
Lily and Tom decide to help. They find a big stick and start to push the waste into the bin. It is hard work, but they are strong and brave.
"Push, push, push!" Lily and Tom say together.
Suddenly, they hear a loud bark. A big dog comes running towards them. It is angry and wants the waste. It shows its teeth and growls.
"Run, run, run!" Lily and Tom say together.
They drop the stick and run away from the dog. They find a quiet place behind a tree and hug each other. They are scared and sad.
"Why did the dog do that?" Lily asks. "We were only trying to help."
"I do not know," Tom says. "Maybe it was hungry and did not know better."
Lily and Tom wait until the dog is gone. Then they go back to the bin. They see that the waste is still there, but some of it is in the bin. They smile and clap.
"We did it!" Lily and Tom say together. "We made the park a little cleaner."
They are proud and happy. They go to find their mums and tell them what they did. Their mums are proud and happy too. They give them a hug and a treat. Lily and Tom are good friends. They love the park and the animals.
