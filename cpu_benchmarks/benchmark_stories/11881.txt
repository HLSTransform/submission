Once upon a time there was a princess who was very sad. Her jewelry was very messy and filthy. She asked her mom what to do and her mom said she should pray. So the princess got down on her knees and prayed. She prayed for her jewelry to become sparkly and nice again. 
Suddenly, a magical fairy appeared. She waved her wand and the princess' jewelry sparkled and shone like new! The princess was so happy. The princess thanked the fairy and hugged her tight.
The fairy smiled and gave the princess a hug back. Then she flew away. The princess was so happy that she did not have dirty jewelry anymore! She thanked God for the miracle and promised that she would always pray for help.
