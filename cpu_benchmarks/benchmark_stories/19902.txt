Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One morning, Lily's mom made her some toast for breakfast. She put some butter and jelly on it and gave it to Lily. Lily thought the toast was very yummy and told her mom, "Thank you for the useful toast!"
After breakfast, Lily went to play outside. She saw her friend Timmy and said, "Hi Timmy! Do you want to come to my house and play?" Timmy said, "Yes, please!" So, Lily and Timmy went to her house.
When they got there, Lily said, "Let's enter my room and play with my toys!" They went to her room and played with her dolls and blocks. They had so much fun together!
