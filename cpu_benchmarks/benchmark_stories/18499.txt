Anna and Ben are playing in the sand. They make a big hill and dig a pit. They put their toys in the pit and pretend they are pirates.
"Arrr, this is our treasure!" Ben says. He holds a red car and a yellow ball.
"Arrr, and this is our ship!" Anna says. She has a blue boat and a green dinosaur.
They laugh and have fun. But then they hear a loud noise. It is the dryer. Mom is drying their clothes.
"Oh no, the dryer is noisy!" Anna says. She covers her ears.
"It is too noisy, we can't play!" Ben says. He looks sad.
"Maybe we can go inside and play something else?" Anna says. She picks up her toys.
"OK, let's go!" Ben says. He picks up his toys too.
They run to the house and leave the pit and the hill. They find Mom and show her their toys.
"Look, Mom, we were pirates!" Anna says.
"That's nice, sweeties. But why are your toys so sandy?" Mom says.
"We played in the sand, Mom. We made a pit and a hill!" Ben says.
"I see. Well, you can play with your toys, but first you have to wash them. They are dirty and sandy!" Mom says.
"OK, Mom, we will wash them!" Anna and Ben say.
They go to the bathroom and wash their toys. They dry them with a towel. Then they go to their room and play some more. They are happy. The dryer is not noisy anymore.
