Tom likes to print pictures of animals. He has a big stack of paper and a printer in his room. He prints a lion, a monkey, a giraffe and a zebra. He is very happy with his pictures.
He wants to show his pictures to his mom. He picks up the stack of paper and runs to the kitchen. But the stack is too heavy for him. He is weak and he trips on the rug. The paper falls on the floor and the pictures get mixed up.
"Oh no!" Tom cries. He is sad and he starts to pick up the paper.
"Tom, what happened?" his mom asks. She sees the paper and the pictures on the floor. She comes to help him.
"I wanted to show you my pictures, mom. But the stack was too heavy and I fell. Now they are all messed up." Tom says.
"It's okay, Tom. I'm sorry you fell. But your pictures are still beautiful. You did a great job printing them. Can you tell me what animals they are?" his mom says.
Tom smiles. He likes his mom. He shows her his pictures and tells her the names of the animals. His mom praises him and hugs him. She helps him put the paper back in the stack. Then they go to the living room and hang the pictures on the wall. Tom is happy again. He loves his pictures and his mom.
