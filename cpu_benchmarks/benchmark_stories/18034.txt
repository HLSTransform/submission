Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweet. Tweet loved to fly high in the sky and gaze at the clouds. One day, while Tweet was flying, he saw a shiny wire on the ground. Tweet was curious and flew down to investigate.
As Tweet got closer, he saw that the wire was tangled around a little mouse. The mouse looked anxious and scared. "Please help me," said the mouse. "I'm stuck in this wire."
Tweet knew he had to help the mouse. He carefully pecked at the wire until it came loose. The mouse was grateful and thanked Tweet for his help.
From that day on, Tweet and the mouse became good friends. They learned that even though they were different, they could still help each other and be kind. The moral of the story is that helping others is always a good thing to do.
