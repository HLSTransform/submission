Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the garden. One day, he saw a big, bossy bird trying to grab some food from his mother's garden. Timmy didn't like that. He wanted to protect his mother's garden.
So, Timmy decided to set a trap for the big bird. He grabbed some string and made a trap with it. The bird fell into the trap and couldn't get out. Timmy felt proud of himself for protecting his mother's garden.
But then, the bird started to cry. Timmy realized that the bird was just trying to feed its babies. He felt bad for trapping the bird. So, he let the bird go and promised to never be bossy again. The bird flew away, and Timmy learned a valuable lesson about being kind to others.
