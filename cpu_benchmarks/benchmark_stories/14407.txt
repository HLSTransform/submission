Once upon a time, there was a man who liked to surf. He lived near the beach and would go surfing every day. He also had a job, where he would work in an office. 
One day, the man woke up feeling grumpy. He didn't want to go to work or surf. He decided to stay home and watch TV instead. 
As the day went on, the man realized he had made a mistake. He should have gone to work and surfed. He felt sad and wished he had made better choices. 
Unfortunately, because he didn't go to work, he lost his job. And because he didn't go surfing, he missed the biggest wave of the year. The man was very unhappy and learned to always make good choices. The end.
