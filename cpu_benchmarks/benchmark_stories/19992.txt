Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big mushroom under a tree. It was red and white and looked like a hat.
"Wow, look at that mushroom!" Lily said. "It is so cool!"
"Can we touch it?" Ben asked.
"I don't know. Maybe it is not safe. Some mushrooms are bad for you," Lily said.
They went closer to the mushroom. It smelled nice. They wanted to touch it, but they were afraid.
"Let's skip around it," Lily said. "That will be fun!"
"OK, let's skip!" Ben said.
They held hands and started to skip around the mushroom. They sang a song:
"Skip, skip, skip around the mushroom,
Skip, skip, skip, we are happy,
Skip, skip, skip, don't touch the mushroom,
Skip, skip, skip, it might be snappy!"
They skipped and sang and laughed. They had a lot of fun. The mushroom did not mind. It was happy too. It liked to have friends.
