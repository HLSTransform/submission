Once upon a time, there was a shy little girl named Lily. She loved to eat sweet things, especially sugar. One day, Lily found a big jar of sugar in the kitchen. She was very happy and wanted to eat some.
Lily tried to open the jar, but it was too tight. She asked her big brother, Tom, for help. "Tom, can you open this jar for me, please?" Tom was strong and opened the jar easily. "Be careful, Lily. Don't break the jar," he warned her.
Lily was so excited to eat the sugar that she didn't listen to Tom's warning. She took a big spoon and tried to get some sugar out. But she was not careful, and the jar slipped from her hands. It fell to the floor and broke into many pieces. Sugar was everywhere! Lily was sad and knew she should have listened to Tom. From that day on, she promised to be more careful and listen to her big brother.
