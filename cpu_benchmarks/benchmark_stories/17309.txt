Once upon a time, there was a clever rabbit named Benny. Benny liked to eat carrots and cauliflower. One day, Benny's friend, a mouse named Mickey, came to visit him.
Mickey said, "Benny, can we play together?"
Benny replied, "Sure, but first let's eat some cauliflower."
Mickey said, "I don't like cauliflower. Can we eat something else?"
Benny said, "No problem. Let's eat carrots instead."
Mickey said, "Okay, that sounds good."
After they finished eating, Mickey said, "Benny, I'm tired. Can we quit playing now?"
Benny said, "Sure, let's rest and play again later."
