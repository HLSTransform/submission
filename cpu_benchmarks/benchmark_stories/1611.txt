Bella loved to bounce on her big red ball. She bounced up and down, left and right, all over the yard. She liked to pretend that she was a rocket, flying to the moon and the stars.
One day, she saw a new boy in the house next door. He had a small blue rocket in his hand. He looked troubled. He did not smile or wave at Bella.
"Hi, I'm Bella," she said, bouncing over to him. "What's your name?"
"Tommy," he said, looking at his rocket. "I just moved here with my mom and dad."
"Do you like rockets?" Bella asked. "I do. I have a big red ball that I bounce like a rocket."
Tommy nodded. "I like rockets too. But mine is broken. It won't fly. It just falls down."
Bella felt sorry for Tommy. She wanted to help him. She had an idea.
"Maybe we can fix your rocket," she said. "Or we can make a new one. We can use some cardboard and tape and paint. And we can bounce on my ball together. It will be fun."
Tommy looked at Bella. He saw her big smile and her bright eyes. He felt a little better. He liked her idea.
"Okay," he said. "Let's try it. Maybe we can be friends."
Bella nodded. She took his hand and led him to her yard. She bounced on her ball and he followed her. They laughed and talked and played. They made a new rocket and bounced it to the sky. They became friends. They were happy.
