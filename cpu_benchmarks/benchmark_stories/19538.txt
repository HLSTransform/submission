Once upon a time, there was a little boy who liked to go on adventures. He was very curious, and he wanted to explore the world around him.
One day, he wondered what was beyond the trees. He heard a lot of strange, loud noises and he thought it sounded like something from a fairy tale.
He ran up to the trees and he saw a big steel fence. It was tall and he couldn't find a way to climb over it, so he wondered what was beyond it.
He noticed a charming little cottage at the other side of the fence. The cottage had bright green shutters and a pretty flower garden. The little boy wanted to get closer, but he couldn't because of the fence. He closed his eyes tight and wished he could get inside.
Suddenly, the fence opened magically and then he heard a voice telling him to come inside. He ran inside and looked around. There was a secret room full of books and toys, and he spent the whole day playing happily with all the things in there.
He had lots of fun and he never forgot his adventure to the charming cottage.
