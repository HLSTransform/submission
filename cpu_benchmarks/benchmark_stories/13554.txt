Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys in her room. One day, she was playing with her favorite toy, a square block. She accidentally dropped it and it broke into pieces. Lily was sad because her toy was broken.
Her mom came into the room and saw Lily's sad face. "What happened, Lily?" she asked. "My toy broke," Lily said sadly. "Don't worry, we can fix it," her mom said with a smile.
Later that day, Lily and her mom went to the store to buy some glue. They reached for the glue on the top shelf and Lily's mom accidentally knocked over a box. Out fell a new toy, a square puzzle. Lily's eyes lit up with excitement. "Can we buy it, Mommy?" she asked. Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, we can. And we can have fun putting it together when we get home." And they did.
