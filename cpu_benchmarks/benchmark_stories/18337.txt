Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Mittens. Mittens was black and fluffy, and loved to play with her toy mouse. One day, Mittens saw a pepper on the kitchen counter. She thought it looked like a fun toy, so she batted it around with her paw. But then, the pepper fell on the floor and opened up. Mittens sneezed and sneezed because the pepper was so spicy.
Mittens' owner came into the kitchen and saw the mess. She was very angry and told Mittens to go outside. Mittens was sad and didn't understand why her owner was mad. She went outside and climbed a tree to hang out. But then, Mittens slipped and fell from the tree. She hurt herself very badly and couldn't move. Her owner found her and took her to the vet, but it was too late. Mittens had died.
Mittens' owner was very sad and realized that she shouldn't have been so angry with Mittens. She missed her little black cat very much. The end.
