Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside, but one day she lost her boot in the mud. She was worried that she wouldn't be able to find it. 
Lily's mom told her to try looking for it, so she did. She searched high and low, but couldn't find her boot anywhere. Just when she was about to give up, she spotted it stuck in the mud. 
Lily was so happy to have found her boot and ran back to her mom. From then on, she always made sure to tie her boots tight so she wouldn't lose them again.
