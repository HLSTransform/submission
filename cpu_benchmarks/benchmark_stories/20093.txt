Sara and Tom like to play music. They have a band. Sara plays the drum and Tom plays the guitar. They make loud and fun sounds.
One day, they want to play a new song. They hear it on the radio. It is a cover. That means someone else made the song first, but they play it in their own way. They try to learn the words and the notes.
But the song is hard. It has many words and notes. Some are fast and some are slow. Some are high and some are low. Sara and Tom get confused. They make mistakes. They get frustrated.
They see their mom in the kitchen. She is making a cake. It smells good. She puts icing on the cake. It is white and smooth. She says the cake is delicate. That means it can break easily. She tells them to be careful.
Sara and Tom have an idea. They go to their room. They get a sheet. They cover their drum and guitar with the sheet. They pretend they are playing the song. They sing the words they know. They make up the rest. They have fun.
Their mom comes to their room. She sees the sheet. She smiles. She says they are clever. She says they can have some cake. She says they can play the song later. She says they can practice more. She says they can do it. Sara and Tom are happy. They hug their mom. They love their band.
