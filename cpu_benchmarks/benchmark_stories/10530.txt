Once upon a time, there were two best friends, Tommy and Sarah. Tommy had a toy car and Sarah had a toy truck. Every day, Tommy and Sarah would drive around in their toys and explore the world. 
One day, Tommy and Sarah were feeling extra happy, so they decided to drive their toys to the park. They took turns driving and soon arrived at the park. 
At the park, Tommy and Sarah played with their toys until they were too tired to play anymore. That's when they had their favorite thing to do: give each other a big hug! They hugged and hugged until they couldn't hug anymore.
When it was time to go home, the wealthy park gave the two friends a gift - a brand new toy car and truck. Tommy and Sarah were so excited for their new toys. Now they could drive even more and explore the world even further! 
The two friends hugged each other one last time and drove back home, excited for what the next day would bring.
