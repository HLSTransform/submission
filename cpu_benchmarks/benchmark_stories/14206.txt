Once there was a family who liked to celebrate together. One night, it was Grandpa's birthday and the whole family was gathered around him. Grandma had a big birthday cake and everyone was wearing funny hats. Grandpa was very happy.
Grandpa said, "Let's all celebrate!" The family cheered and began to sing. Grandpa opened his presents, one of which was a watch. He held it up and thanked everyone. 
Suddenly a grumpy old man appeared. He said, "I don't think it's right to celebrate." Grandpa smiled and said, "It's my birthday, why don't you join us?" 
The grumpy old man sat down and began to smile. He said, "I'll be happy to stay, thank you." Grandpa smiled and said, "Now let's tell stories and eat cake." 
The family enjoyed the stories, ate the cake, and celebrated Grandpa's birthday. At the end of the night, Grandpa put on his watch and said, "Thank you for celebrating with me." Everyone smiled and said goodbye to the grumpy old man. They all went home happy.
