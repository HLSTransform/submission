Once upon a time there was a generous boy named Tom. He loved to play at the stream. One day he went to the stream to play but saw a kitten who was hurt and couldn't move.
Tom kneeled down beside the kitten and said, "I will take care of you". Tom was very gentle as he carefully picked up the kitten and carried it home.
When Tom was back home, he took a bowl and filled it with food. He kneeled down and he slowly put the food close to the kitten. The kitten started to eat, like it was famished.
Tom knew what he had to do. The next day he went down to the stream and asked for help from the people there. He told them about the kitten and soon everyone was giving kind words and generous donations for its care.
Tom was so grateful for the help and was determined to keep the kitten safe and healthy. He kneeled down and thanked everyone for their help.
The kitten was with Tom for many years to come, and it always made the stream a happier place.
