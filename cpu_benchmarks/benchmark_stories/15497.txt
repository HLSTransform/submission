Once there was a little girl who loved to play. She enjoyed playing with her friends and her toys. One day, she was feeling very anxious. She had a lot of thoughts bouncing around in her head and was not sure what to do.
She walked up to her mom and said, "I want to quit playing". Her mom looked down at her with a look of surprise on her face. She put her hand on her daughter's shoulder and said, "It's okay, sweetheart. Why don't you take a break and try to relax?".
The little girl nodded and went to find a quiet spot. She curled up in a ball and took a few deep breaths. After a few minutes, she felt much better. She stood up and smiled. Then she ran off to go find her friends and keep on playing.
She realized that it was alright to take a break and that it was best to stay calm when she was feeling anxious. She was reminded of the importance of a break and that it's okay to quit playing for a bit.
