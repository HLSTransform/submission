Once upon a time, there was a bald man and he was very patient. One day, he decided to settle in a new town. He looked at all of the houses and stores and found one he liked. He took his time and unpacked his things carefully.
Once he was done, he admired his new home. He liked all of the new things he saw and could not wait to start his day. He quickly set out to explore the new town. He visited all of the shops and talked to the people there.
All of the people were so friendly and welcoming. He felt like he was a part of the town already. Everyone made him feel so comfortable and at home. He was so happy in his new place and knew he could settle there forever.
