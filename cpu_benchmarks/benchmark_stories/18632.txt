Once there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to run and play all day long. But one day, Max got very tired and needed to rest. He found a cozy spot under a tree and lay down to take a nap.
While Max was resting, he saw a bird flying above him. The bird accidentally dropped some ink on Max's nose! Max was surprised and didn't know what to do. He tried to lick the ink off, but it didn't come off fast.
Max's owner came over and saw the ink on his nose. She gently wiped it off with a cloth. Max was happy to be clean again and went back to resting under the tree.
