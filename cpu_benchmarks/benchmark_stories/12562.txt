Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They like to swing, slide and run. They also like to learn new things. They have a book of math. It has numbers and shapes. They try to count and match them.
One day, they see a big hill in the park. They have never been there before. They are curious and adventurous. They want to explore the hill. They take their book of math with them.
"Let's go to the hill," Anna says.
"OK, but be careful," Ben says.
They walk to the hill. They see flowers, bugs and rocks. They also see a big tree. It has a hole in it. They look inside the hole. They find a treasure. It is a box of crayons and stickers.
"Wow, look at this," Ben says.
"Someone left it here," Anna says.
"Maybe they forgot it," Ben says.
"Or maybe they wanted to share it," Anna says.
They are happy and excited. They open the box. They use the crayons and stickers to decorate their book of math. They make it colorful and fun. They learn more numbers and shapes. They also make a card for the person who left the box. They write "Thank you" and draw a smiley face. They put the card in the hole. They hope the person will find it.
They go back to the swing, slide and run. They have a great day in the park. They are friends. They like to play and learn. They are adventurous.
