Once upon a time, there was a happy little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy's daddy came home with a razor. Timmy asked his daddy what it was for. His daddy told him it was to shave his beard. Timmy was glad his daddy was happy.
The next day, Timmy's daddy changed. He didn't smile as much and he didn't want to play with Timmy anymore. Timmy asked his daddy what was wrong, but his daddy just looked sad. Timmy didn't know what to do.
One day, Timmy's daddy left and never came back. Timmy was sad and didn't understand why his daddy had changed. He missed his daddy and wished he could play with him again. The end.
