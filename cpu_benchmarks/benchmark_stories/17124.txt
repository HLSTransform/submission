Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. One day, Timmy went to the beach with his mom. They saw a pirate ship with a big white sail. Timmy was so excited to see a real pirate! 
Suddenly, a pirate came out of the ship and said, "Ahoy, little matey! Would you like to help me find my treasure?" Timmy was scared, but he wanted to be brave like a pirate. So, he said yes.
The pirate and Timmy walked along the beach, searching for the treasure. After a while, they found a big chest. The pirate told Timmy to lay his hand on the chest and make a wish. Timmy wished for a pirate hat like the one the pirate was wearing.
The pirate opened the chest and inside was a pirate hat just like Timmy wished for! The pirate said, "Remember, matey, sometimes the treasure we seek is not gold or silver, but something we already have inside us." Timmy learned that sometimes the best treasure is something you already have.
