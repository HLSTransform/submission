Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily. She loved to cook with her mom in the kitchen. One day, they decided to make a colorful cake for Lily's birthday. They mixed all the ingredients together and put it in the oven to bake. 
While they waited, Lily's mom asked her what she wanted for her birthday. Lily said she wanted a puppy. Her mom said they would have to wait until they had more money. 
Suddenly, the oven started to smoke and the cake burned. Lily's mom was upset, but Lily didn't mind. She said, "It's okay, Mommy. We can still have fun on my birthday." 
But when Lily woke up on her birthday, there was no cake and no puppy. She was sad and cried. Her mom hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. We'll try again next year."
