Once upon a time, there was a fast race. Many people came to watch the race. An old man wanted to race too. He was very old, but he thought he could win.
The old man had a toy gun. He thought the gun would help him win the race. He put the gun in his pocket and got ready to run.
The race started, and the old man ran as fast as he could. But he was too old and slow. The other racers were faster. The old man fell down and lost the race. The toy gun did not help him. The old man was sad.
