Lily and Anna are sisters. Lily likes to play with her toys. Anna likes to watch TV. Lily thinks Anna is lazy.
One day, Lily wants to play with Anna. She goes to the living room and sees Anna on the couch. She says, "Anna, come and play with me. I have a new doll and a tea set. It is fun."
Anna says, "No, thank you. I want to watch TV. It is interesting."
Lily says, "But TV is boring. You always watch TV. You never play with me. You are lazy."
Anna says, "I am not lazy. I am tired. TV makes me happy. You are noisy. You always play with your toys. You never watch TV with me. You are silly."
Lily and Anna start to argue. They say mean words to each other. They make each other sad.
Mom hears them and comes to the living room. She sees Lily and Anna on the couch. She says, "Lily and Anna, stop fighting. You are sisters. You should love each other. You should share and take turns. You should play together and watch TV together. You should make each other happy."
Lily and Anna look at Mom. They feel sorry. They say, "Sorry, Mom. Sorry, sister."
Mom says, "It's OK. I love you both. Now, why don't you hug and make up? Then you can choose what to do together. You can play with your toys or watch TV or do something else. But you have to agree and be nice."
Lily and Anna hug and make up. They say, "Thank you, Mom. Thank you, sister."
They decide to play with their toys and watch TV together. They have fun. They are not lazy or silly. They are happy.
