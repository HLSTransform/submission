Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had many blocks to play with. He liked to fill a big box with his blocks. One day, a new girl named Sally came to play with Tim.
Sally said, "Can I play with your blocks, Tim?" Tim was a spoiled boy and did not like to share. He said, "No, these are my blocks. You can't play with them." Sally was sad and went to play alone.
Tim kept playing with his blocks, but then they all fell down. He tried to fill the box again, but the blocks would not fit. Tim was sad and wished he had shared with Sally. Now, he had no friends to play with and his blocks were broken. The moral of the story is to always share with others.
