Once upon a time, in a little house, there was a wise old owl. The owl lived near a big fireplace. Every day, he would gather wood to keep the fire burning.
One day, a little girl came to visit the owl. She said, "Mr. Owl, can you help me find my way home?" The owl looked at her and said, "Yes, little girl, I can help you. But first, let's gather some wood for the fireplace."
They went outside and picked up wood. The little girl was happy to help. They put the wood in the fireplace, and the fire grew big and warm.
As they sat by the fire, the wise owl told the little girl how to find her way home. "Follow the path by the big tree, and you will find your house," he said.
The little girl thanked the owl and went on her way. She followed the path and found her house. She was happy to be home and grateful for the wise owl's help.
