Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Mittens. Mittens was playing outside when she saw a bird fly high in the sky. "Wow, that bird is so high!" she said.
Mittens started to chase the bird, but then she got an itch on her back. "Oh no, I have an itch!" she said. She tried to scratch it with her paw, but it didn't help.
Suddenly, Mittens heard a loud noise. It was a dog barking! Mittens was scared and wanted to escape. She ran as fast as she could and finally found a tree to climb. "Phew, I escaped!" she said.
As she sat in the tree, she saw the bird fly by again. "Hello bird, did you see me escape from the dog?" she asked. The bird chirped back, "Yes, I saw you! You're very brave, Mittens."
