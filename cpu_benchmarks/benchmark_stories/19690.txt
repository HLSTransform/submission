Once there was a bald man who lived in a house by the sea. The man loved to look out the window and watch the waves. But one day, he was having trouble seeing the waves. A big curtain was in his way!
The man tried and tried to get the curtain to move. He grabbed it, he pulled it - nothing was working. He was about to give up when he had an idea. He tried standing on his chair and pushing the curtain aside. This time it worked!
The man smiled as he saw the waves out the window again. He was so happy that he wanted to show his friends. He opened his door and took one step out - but was stopped by a big curtain! He couldn't believe it.
But he didn't give up. The man tried and tried, and eventually he was able to get the curtain out of the way. He stepped outside and showed his friends the beautiful view. From then on, the man was never bothered by curtains again.
