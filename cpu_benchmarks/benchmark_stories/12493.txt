Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play hide-and-seek with her friends. One day, Lily's favorite teddy bear went missing. She searched everywhere, but she couldn't find it. 
Lily's mom asked, "What's wrong, Lily?" 
"My teddy bear is gone," Lily replied. 
"Don't worry, we'll find it," said her mom. 
They searched high and low, under the bed and in the toy box. Finally, Lily pulled back the curtain and there was her teddy bear, hiding behind it. 
Lily was so happy to have her teddy bear back. "Thank you for helping me search, Mom," she said. 
"You're welcome, Lily. I'm glad we found your teddy bear," her mom replied. 
From that day on, Lily learned to not be so nosy and to always check behind the curtain when things go missing.
