Once upon a time, there were two best friends, Lucy and Jack. They loved playing together every day. One day, Jack decided to share a brilliant idea.
Jack said, “Let’s go to the barn and share some fun."
Lucy smiled and said, "Let’s go!"
So they ran to the barn and they discovered lots of new things. They saw a box with some squirmy worms and a barn full of hay.
Jack said, “Let’s share the worms together.”
And so they did. They shared the worms and played with them until they were worn out. Then they shared some of the hay and jumped on it.
Once they had enough fun, Jack looked at Lucy and said, “That was a brilliant idea.”
Lucy smiled and said, "Yes, it was! Let's do it again soon.”
And so they did. For many days to come, they would go to the barn and share the brilliant fun.
