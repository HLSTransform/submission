Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He loved to play his violin, and he was very persistent. Every day he practiced and practiced, and soon he was getting better and better.
One day, he went to the store. He saw a beautiful violin, and he wanted it so badly. But he did not have enough money to buy it.
The boy was determined, so he went home and thought about ways to make money. He made a plan and worked hard. In no time, he had saved enough money to go back to the store and buy his violin!
He was very happy, and he thanked all the people who had helped him. From then on, he practiced and played his violin even more. He was very persistent, and soon he became a great musician!
