Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her toys and her cat, Mr. Whiskers. One day, Lily's mommy said they were going to the beach. Lily was very happy and started to plan what toys to bring.
When they got to the beach, Lily's mommy put on some lotion to protect her from the sun. Lily thought the lotion smelled nice and asked if she could have some too. Her mommy put some on her and said it would keep her skin safe.
Lily had a perfect day at the beach. She built sandcastles, played in the water, and even found some pretty shells. When it was time to go home, Lily felt tired but very happy. She hugged her mommy and said it was the best day ever.
