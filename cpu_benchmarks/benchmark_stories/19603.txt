Once there was a beautiful gray bird. Everywhere the bird went, it would mark the places with a special song. 
One day, the bird flew away and went on an adventure. But the gray bird was sad because it was alone. 
Suddenly, it saw another beautiful gray bird flying close by. The two birds said hello and were soon friends. 
Each bird would mark their new adventures with their special song. Together, they had lots of fun and flew around the world. 
The two beautiful gray birds were together forever and always marked special moments with their song.
