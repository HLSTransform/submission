Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys. One day, she found a loop of string on the ground. She picked it up and looked at it. It was so pretty! She decided to make a necklace out of it. 
Lily went to her room and got some beads. She put the loop around her neck and started to push the beads onto it. It was hard work, but she did it! When she finished, she looked in the mirror. She felt so proud of her beautiful necklace. 
Later that day, Lily showed her necklace to her mom. Her mom said, "Wow, Lily! You are so creative and talented! You made a beautiful necklace. You are so rich in imagination." Lily smiled and felt happy. She loved her new necklace and was proud of herself.
