Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. She was playing in the park on a cold day. She saw something special on the ground. It was a potato! 
She happily picked it up and brought it home. When she entered her house she was greeted by her mom.
"Where did you get the potato, Sarah?" her mom asked.
"I found it in the park," Sarah replied. "It was all alone, so I brought it home."
Her mom smiled and said, "Let's make it into a big, delicious meal!"
So Sarah and her mom peeled the cold potato. Then they chopped it into pieces and boiled it in a pot. When the potato was done cooking, they enjoyed it with a big plate of vegetables.
It was the best meal ever!
