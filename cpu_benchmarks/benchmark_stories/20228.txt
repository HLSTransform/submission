Lily and Max were playing in the park with their toy cars. They liked to make them zoom and crash on the grass. They heard a loud noise in the sky. They looked up and saw a big helicopter. It was impressive. It had a long tail and a spinning thing on top. It was flying very fast and low.
"Wow, look at that!" Max said. "It's a helicopter!"
"I want to fly in a helicopter!" Lily said. "It looks fun!"
The helicopter flew over the park and then turned around. It was coming back. Lily and Max waved at it. They hoped the pilot would see them and wave back. The helicopter flew closer and closer. It was very loud. Lily and Max covered their ears.
The helicopter landed on a big field near the park. Lily and Max ran to see it. They saw a man and a woman get out of the helicopter. They were wearing helmets and suits. They looked important.
"Hello, kids!" the man said. "Do you like our helicopter?"
"Yes, we do!" Lily and Max said. "It's impressive!"
"Thank you!" the woman said. "We are doctors. We work in a hospital. We use the helicopter to help people who are sick or hurt. We fly them to the hospital quickly."
"That's amazing!" Lily said. "You are very brave and kind!"
"Thank you!" the man said. "Do you want to see the helicopter up close?"
"Yes, please!" Max said.
The man and the woman took Lily and Max to the helicopter. They showed them the inside and the outside. They explained how it worked and what they did. Lily and Max were very curious and asked many questions. They learned a lot. They thanked the man and the woman for showing them the helicopter.
"Can we fly with you?" Lily asked.
"Sorry, kids, we can't take you with us," the woman said. "We have to return to the hospital soon. Maybe another time."
"OK," Lily said. "But can we wave at you when you fly away?"
"Of course!" the man said. "We would love that!"
Lily and Max hugged the man and the woman. They said goodbye and ran back to the park. They watched the helicopter take off and fly away. They waved at it until it disappeared in the sky. They smiled and clapped.
"That was awesome!" Max said.
"I agree!" Lily said. "That was the best day ever!"
