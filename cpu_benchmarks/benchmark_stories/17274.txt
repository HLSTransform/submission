Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her toys. One day, her friend Jack came over to play with her.
"Let's play with your dolls!" Jack said excitedly.
Lily was shy and didn't like to share her toys, but her mom encouraged her to let Jack play too. "It's okay, Lily. Sharing is nice," her mom said.
Lily felt sorry for being selfish and decided to share her dolls with Jack. They had so much fun playing together and Lily was happy that she listened to her mom's encouragement.
