Once there was a little girl named Jane. She was three years old and loved playing in the sand. Every day, she went to the beach with her parents.
One day, when they got to the beach, there was a surprise. There was a big pile of unknown things at the edge of the sand. Jane was so excited and asked her mom what it was.
"Let's go find out," said her mom.
When they got closer, they saw that it was a big box full of toys. The box was covered in sand and looked like it had been there for a long time. Jane's mom smiled and said, "It looks like someone must have shared their toys with us!"
Jane was so excited and ran to the box to see all the toys. There were trucks, dolls, and lots of other things she had never seen before. She started picking them up and showing them to her mom.
"Let's share these toys with the other children on the beach," her mom said.
So they put the toys back in the box, took it to the middle of the beach, and let the other kids play with them. Together they all shared their toys and had a great time. Jane couldn't stop smiling. She finally knew what it meant to share, and she loved it!
