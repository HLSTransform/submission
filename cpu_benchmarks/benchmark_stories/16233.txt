Paul was in the park and saw a package on a swing. He had never seen a package on a swing before, so he was very curious. He asked his mom, "What is that package doing on the swing?" His mom just smiled and said, "Let’s go over and see." 
They went to the swing and saw that it was a hairy package. Paul was shocked. His mom said, "This package looks like it wants to swing." 
Paul was very excited so he wanted to swing the package in the air. But his mom said, "Not yet. Let’s check inside first."
When they opened the package, they were both surprised. Inside was a puppy with brown eyes and a wagging tail. Paul was so excited that he could swing the puppy in his arms. His mom smiled and said, "It looks like the package wanted to swing, too!"
