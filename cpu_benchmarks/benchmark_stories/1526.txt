Once upon a time there were two friends, a boy and a girl, who really loved hockey. Every day they would go out to the park to play with their hockey kit. They would have a lot of fun balancing the hockey stick on their hands and playing games together.
One day, the park was really busy and they realised that there wasn't enough space for both teams. After thinking it over, they decided to play a fair game. So they each went to the other side of the park, taking turns to balance the hockey stick.
They had so much fun balancing the hockey stick that they lost track of time. When the sun started to set and the park began to empty out, the boy and girl said goodbye and promised to come back and play again soon.
Another day, the two friends would balance the hockey stick together, playing fair and having loads of fun.
