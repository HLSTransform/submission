Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jack. She was only three years old. Jack was curious and she wanted to understand the world around her. 
One day, Jack noticed something that made her very excited. It was a cool hat! She had never seen one before and she wanted to learn more about it. 
Jack asked her mom a lot of questions about the hat. Her mom explained that the hat was like a hat you would wear at the beach, or when it was really sunny out. Jack kept nodding her head, and she seemed to understand. 
To show that she understood, Jack wanted to wear the hat like her mom taught her. She put it on her head and strutted around the house. Jack was so proud because she felt cool wearing the hat. 
Jack learned that day that you can learn new things and understand them too.
