Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice cream and always wanted a cone. One day, her mom took her to an ice cream shop. Lily saw many different flavors of ice cream and got nervous because she didn't know which one to choose.
Her mom told her to pick her favorite one, and Lily chose strawberry. The ice cream man gave her a big scoop of strawberry ice cream on top of a cone. Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you!" to the ice cream man. She enjoyed her cone and ate it all up. From that day on, Lily knew that whenever she felt nervous, she could always get a cone to make her feel better.
