Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweety. Tweety loved to fly high in the sky and feel the wind in her feathers. One day, Tweety was flying over a big field when she saw her friend, a little bunny named Benny. Benny was sad because he had lost his carrot. 
Tweety wanted to help Benny find his carrot, so she started to search all around the field. She looked under the bushes and behind the trees, but she couldn't find the carrot. Suddenly, she saw a little ant carrying something big and orange. It was Benny's carrot! 
Tweety flew down and took the carrot from the ant. She brought it back to Benny and he was so happy and grateful. They sat in the sun and ate the carrot together. Tweety noticed that the carrot was very dry, so she flew to the nearby pond to get some water for her friend. Benny was so happy to have his carrot and a good friend like Tweety.
