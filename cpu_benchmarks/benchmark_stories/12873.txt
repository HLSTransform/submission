Sam was a little boy. He was three years old. Every morning, Sam went for a jog with his dad. His dad always wore his special vest.
One morning, Sam said, "Can I wear a vest too?"
"Yes, of course," replied Dad. "But you must be patient".
So every morning, Sam patiently waited while Dad looked for a vest that fit him. Finally, they found a vest that was just right and Sam put it on.
Every day, he went out for his jog with Dad wearing his special vest. He felt proud and grown up. He was sure that he looked just like his dad.
