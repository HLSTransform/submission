Dilly was out in the park playing. She loved outdoors and enjoyed playing with the swings. She would swing higher and higher, with a big grin on her face.
But today, something was different. She noticed a switch on one of the swings. It was small, cute, and had a red light blinking on it.
At first she was a bit confused. But soon she knew what it was: It was a switch for fun! Dilly was so excited! She pushed the switch and a rainbow of colors filled the sky! The park was now beautiful! 
Dilly kept swinging, feeling happier than ever before. She knew this switch was the start of something great and she wanted to find out what it would bring next! She kept on swinging, dreaming of the possibilities.
