Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the dirt and make mud pies. One day, he found a shiny rock and decided to bury it in the ground so he could find it again later. 
Timmy's family lived in a tiny hut in the woods. They were very poor and didn't have much. Timmy's dad was always working hard to provide for them. 
One day, Timmy's dad came home with a big surprise. He had found a treasure map! Timmy was so excited and couldn't wait to go on an adventure with his dad. They followed the map and finally arrived at the spot where the treasure was buried. Timmy dug and dug until he found a big chest full of gold and jewels. 
Timmy was so happy and couldn't believe they had found such a treasure. He realized that burying things in the ground wasn't so stupid after all.
