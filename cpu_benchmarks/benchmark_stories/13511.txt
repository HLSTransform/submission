Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her favorite toy, a round ball. One day, Lily's mom told her that they were going to the park to play with some other kids.
Lily was excited to play with her ball in the park. When they arrived, Lily saw some kids playing with a big, round hula hoop. She wanted to play with it too, but she didn't know how.
One of the kids saw Lily looking at the hula hoop and said, "Hey, do you want to try spinning it around your waist?" Lily nodded her head and the kid showed her how to do it.
At first, Lily couldn't do it very well. But she kept trying and eventually she got it! The other kids cheered and Lily felt very important. From that day on, Lily loved playing with her ball and hula hoop at the park with her new friends.
