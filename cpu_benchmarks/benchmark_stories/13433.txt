Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had to choose which toy to play with. She looked at her toys and saw a teddy bear and a doll. She chose the teddy bear and hugged it tight.
Lily's parent was watching her play. They were alert and made sure Lily was safe. Lily's parent was happy to see her having fun with her toy.
After playing for a while, Lily got tired and went to her parent. Her parent picked her up and gave her a big hug. Lily felt happy and loved.
