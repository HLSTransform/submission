Once upon a time, there was a triangle. It was very sad because it was all alone. Then, one day a magical box arrived. It was so big! The triangle was so excited, because it was about to be delivered a surprise.
The triangle opened the box, and inside was a toy car. The triangle was so happy! But then it saw a big, bright light. It was coming from a big truck. It was delivering special things. 
The triangle was so scared that it turned itself into a tiny ball. But the truck was still coming. Finally, it stopped right in front of the triangle. The driver got out and gave it a long, thin package.
The triangle opened the package and inside was a teddy bear. It was so cuddly and soft. The triangle was so happy! But then it saw that the bear was hurt and had a few scratches.
The triangle wanted to make the bear feel better. So, it sang the bear a special song. The bear smiled and began to feel better. The triangle was so relieved. Now the bear and triangle were the best of friends and they played happily ever after!
