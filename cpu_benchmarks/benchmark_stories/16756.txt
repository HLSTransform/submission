Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play together. Sometimes they play with toys, sometimes they play outside, sometimes they play on the television.
One day, Tom comes to Lily's house. He wants to play on the television. He says, "Lily, can we play on the television? I want to play the game with the cars and the roads."
Lily says, "No, Tom, we cannot play on the television. The television is weak. It does not work well. It makes funny noises and the pictures are blurry. Mommy says we need a new television."
Tom is sad. He likes the game with the cars and the roads. He says, "But Lily, I really want to play on the television. Can we try to make it work?"
Lily says, "No, Tom, we cannot make it work. It is too weak. We can play something else. We can play with the dolls, or the blocks, or the books. Or we can go outside and play with the ball, or the bike, or the swing. There are many things we can play, Tom. You can choose."
Tom thinks for a moment. He likes the dolls, and the blocks, and the books. He also likes the ball, and the bike, and the swing. He says, "Okay, Lily, we can play something else. But can we play on the television another day, when it is not weak?"
Lily says, "Yes, Tom, we can play on the television another day, when it is not weak. Maybe Mommy will get a new television soon. Then we can play the game with the cars and the roads again. But for now, let's play something else. What do you want to play?"
Tom smiles. He says, "Let's play with the blocks. I want to build a big tower."
Lily says, "Okay, Tom, let's play with the blocks. I want to help you build a big tower."
They go to the room with the blocks. They start to play. They are happy. They are friends.
