Once upon a time, there was a wise old man who lived in a big city. He loved to take his walks around the city every morning. As he was walking one morning, he saw a little girl sitting alone on a bench. 
He stopped to talk to her. "Hello! What are you doing here all alone?" he asked. 
The little girl looked up and smiled. "I'm watching people pour from their houses," she said. 
The old man chuckled. "That's an interesting thing to watch," he said. 
The little girl nodded. "It's fun to see," she said. "It's like I'm the queen of the city!" 
The old man smiled. "You are wise beyond your years," he said. "It's good to use your imagination like that." The little girl smiled, and the old man walked away, knowing that he had made a wise choice by stopping to talk to her.
