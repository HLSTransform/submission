Lila and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. Lila had a doll and Ben had a truck. They were having fun until Ben saw Lila's doll. He did not like dolls. He thought they were ugly and boring.
"Give me your doll," Ben said to Lila. "I want to play with it."
"No, it's mine," Lila said. "You have your truck. Go away."
Ben was angry. He grabbed Lila's doll and ran to the kitchen. He saw a big iron on the table. It was hot and shiny. He had an idea. He put the doll on the iron and pressed it hard. He wanted to destroy the doll.
Lila saw what Ben was doing and screamed. She ran to the kitchen and tried to get her doll back. But it was too late. The doll was burned and melted. It looked very ugly and sad. Lila cried and cried.
"Ben, what did you do?" Mom said. She heard the noise and came to the kitchen. She saw the iron, the doll and the children. She was very angry and sad too. She took the iron and turned it off. She took the doll and threw it in the trash. She took Ben and Lila and put them in their rooms.
"You are very naughty, Ben," Mom said. "You destroyed Lila's doll. That was not nice. You have to say sorry to Lila and to me. And you have to stay in your room until dinner. No more toys for you today."
Ben felt bad. He knew he did a bad thing. He wished he did not destroy the doll. He wished he played nicely with Lila. He wished he said sorry. But he did not know how. He was too scared and ashamed. He sat on his bed and cried.
