Once there was a small girl named Lola. She was only three years old. One day Lola went to the park with her family. While they were there they saw a hairy dog. The dog was very friendly and wagged its tail.
Lola wanted to help the dog, so she gave him a medal. The dog was very happy and wagged its tail even more.
Lola's family was so proud of her that they decided to have a family picnic. Everyone had fun eating, playing and petting the hairy dog.
At the end of the day, they all went home. Lola felt very proud of herself for helping out the hairy dog. She knew she had done a good job and had earned her medal.
