Once upon a time, there lived a gifted fox. The fox had soft fur and sharp claws and he loved to explore the forest. Each day, the fox would sneak down to the twigs on the forest floor and gather them one by one. He would collect all sorts of different twigs and carry them home.
One day, he found a very special twig â€“ it was as thin as a hair but very strong. He decided this twig would always remind him of his adventures in the forest so he decided to keep it safe. So, he wrapped it up in leaves and kept it safe in his den. 
Every time he looked at the twig, it would remind him of the fun he'd had and the thief wonderful things he'd seen in the forest. It was the most special gift he could ever have had.
