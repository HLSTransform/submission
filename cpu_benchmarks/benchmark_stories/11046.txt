Mila and Tom are friends. They like to play with toys and make music. Mila has a drum and Tom has a flute. They make loud and fun sounds with their toys. They are musicians.
One day, they go to the park with their moms. They see a big slide and a swing. They want to try them. They leave their toys on a bench and run to the slide. They take turns to slide down and laugh.
But when they come back to the bench, their toys are gone. They look around and see a boy with a mean face. He has their drum and flute. He says, "These are mine now. Go away!"
Mila and Tom are sad and angry. They want their toys back. They try to solve the problem. They ask the boy nicely, "Please give us our toys. They are ours. We like them very much."
The boy says, "No. They are mine. You can't have them. They make good sounds. I am a musician too."
Mila and Tom say, "No, you are not. You are a thief. You took our toys. That is not nice. Give them back or we will tell our moms."
The boy says, "I don't care. I am bigger and stronger than you. You can't do anything. Go away or I will hit you."
Mila and Tom are scared. They don't want to fight. They look for their moms, but they are far away. They are talking to other moms. They don't see what is happening.
The boy laughs and runs away with their toys. He is happy. He has a drum and a flute. He makes loud and bad sounds with them. He is not a musician. He is a bully.
Mila and Tom cry. They have no toys. They have no music. They have no fun. They are sad. They have a bad day.
