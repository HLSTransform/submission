Ana was walking along the beach one evening. She looked down and she saw something in the sand. She bent down to look more closely. It was a palm! She had never seen one before.
Ana picked up the palm and held it in her hand. All of a sudden, it spoke to her!
"Hello Ana," the palm said. "I'm so happy to meet you. My name is Albert. I used to live on this beach but now I'm very lonely."
Ana was so surprised to hear the palm speak that she gasped. She scooped him up and hugged him close.
"Don't worry Albert," she said. "You won't be lonely anymore! I'm going to take care of you and visit you every day. We can go for regular walks along the beach."
Albert was very happy. Ana smiled and she knew that she and Albert were going to be best friends forever.
