Once there was a little independent girl. Her name was Sue and she wanted to deliver something to her mum. She decided to make a special tuna sandwich for her.
Sue went to the kitchen and took the tuna, bread and butter. She spread the butter onto the bread and then put the tuna on top.
To deliver it to her mum, Sue took a big bag and carefully placed the sandwich into it. She then ran off with the bag.
When she arrived at her mum’s office, Sue held up the bag and said “I deliver tuna sandwich” with a big smile. Her mum was so proud of her independent girl and gave her a big hug.
