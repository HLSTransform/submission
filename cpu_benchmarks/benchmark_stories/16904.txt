Lily was a princess who liked to play with her crown. It was shiny and had many colors. She felt happy when she wore it. One day, she wanted to show it to her friend Max, who lived next door.
She put on her crown and ran to the door. She said to her mom, "Mom, I want to go to Max's house. Can I go?"
Mom looked at Lily and smiled. "Yes, you can go, but be careful. Don't lose your crown. It is very special and original. It was a gift from your grandma."
Lily nodded and said, "I know, Mom. I will be careful. Thank you!" She gave Mom a hug and kiss and rushed out of the door.
She ran to Max's house and knocked on the door. Max opened it and saw Lily. He said, "Hi, Lily. What do you have on your head?"
Lily said, "It is my crown. It is shiny and has many colors. Do you like it?"
Max said, "Wow, it is very pretty. Can I try it on?"
Lily said, "Okay, but be gentle. It is very special and original. It was a gift from my grandma."
Max said, "Okay, I will be gentle." He took the crown from Lily and put it on his head. He looked at himself in the mirror and said, "I look like a king!"
Lily said, "You do look like a king. But can I have it back now? I want to wear it too."
Max said, "Sure, here you go." He gave the crown back to Lily and said, "Thank you for letting me try it on. It is very nice of you."
Lily said, "You're welcome. Thank you for being gentle. It is very nice of you too."
They smiled at each other and played together with the crown. They had a lot of fun. They were good friends.
