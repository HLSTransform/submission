Once upon a time, there was a family of bears. Mama bear, Papa bear and Baby bear. They lived in a big house in the forest. One day, Baby bear asked, "Mama, Papa, we need a vacation. Can we go to the beach?"
Mama bear and Papa bear thought about it and said, "We don't have enough money to go on a vacation. We need to save more honey."
Baby bear was sad. He really wanted to go on a vacation. He said, "I wish we were rich, so we could go on a vacation."
Then, a kind neighbor heard Baby bear's wish and said, "You don't need to be rich to go on a vacation. You can go camping in the forest. It's free and fun!"
Mama bear, Papa bear and Baby bear were happy. They packed their bags and went on a camping vacation. They had a great time and Baby bear learned that you don't need to be rich to have fun.
