Once upon a time, there was a rich family who liked to go places. They decided to go on a trip to the hotel. 
When they got to the hotel, it was so big and so pretty. They were so excited to come inside. 
When they stepped inside, there were so many things to do. They could swim in the pool, play in the playground and eat lots of yummy food. 
But the most exciting thing of all was that they could come back and stay at the hotel again one day. They were so rich and they could travel everywhere. 
And that's why the rich family kept coming back to the hotel over and over again. They loved it so much!
