Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went swimming in the pool with her mommy. She had so much fun splashing around and playing with her toys. But then, she accidentally dropped her favorite toy in the water and it sank to the bottom.
Lily's mommy tried to get the toy out, but she couldn't reach it. So, she called for help. A man came and he tried to get the toy too, but he couldn't reach it either. Then, Lily's mommy remembered she had a white towel in her bag. She threw the towel in the water and it floated to the bottom. She pulled the towel up and the toy was stuck to it. Lily was so happy!
But then, something bad happened. When they got home, Lily realized her toy was broken. She was so sad and cried a lot. Her mommy tried to fix it, but it was too late. Lily learned that sometimes even when we try our best to help, things can still go wrong.
