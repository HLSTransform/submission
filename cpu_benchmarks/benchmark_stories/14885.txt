Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Max. Max loved to explore and play. One day, Max found a maze. It was a big maze with lots of twists and turns.
Max tried to find his way out, but he kept getting lost. Suddenly, he heard a voice. It was a friendly cat named Cleo.
"Hello little mouse, are you lost?" asked Cleo.
"Yes," said Max. "I can't find my way out of this maze."
"Don't worry," said Cleo. "I know this maze like the back of my paw. Follow me and I'll show you the way out."
Max followed Cleo through the maze. Cleo's fur was smooth and soft. Max felt safe with her.
Finally, they reached the end of the maze. Max was so happy to be out. "Thank you, Cleo," said Max. "I couldn't have done it without you."
"You're welcome," said Cleo. "I'm glad I could help."
