Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch television all day long. His mom said it was okay to watch a little bit, but not too much. Timmy didn't listen and watched too much television every day.
One day, Timmy's mom said, "Timmy, you watched too much television today. I don't permit you to watch any more." Timmy was sad and angry. He wanted to watch more television, but his mom said no.
Timmy decided to sneak and watch television when his mom wasn't looking. He watched so much television that his eyes hurt. When his mom found out, she was very upset. She said, "Timmy, you spoiled your eyes by watching too much television. You need to rest your eyes now."
Timmy's eyes hurt so much that he couldn't watch television anymore. He wished he listened to his mom and didn't watch too much television.
