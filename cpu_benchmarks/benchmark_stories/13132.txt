Jimmy was a little boy who loved to play outside. He liked to go to the park with his mom and play on the swings. He would run over, grab a swing, and yell "Higher!" His mom would push the swing slow and steady, making Jimmy smile and laugh. 
One day, Jimmy decided he wanted to try swinging by himself. He tried pumping his legs, but it was too hard. He began to yell for help. 
His mom heard him and ran to his side. She said, "Don't worry, I'll show you how to swing by yourself." She helped him get going, and then Jimmy was off. He was so excited and yelled with joy! 
The swing was going higher and higher and Jimmy was having so much fun. He practiced pumping his legs until he could swing all by himself. He screamed and laughed as the swing moved slowly through the air. 
Jimmy was so proud of himself that he ran to hug his mom and show her what he had learned. His mom was so proud that she picked him up and hugged him tight. 
From then on, Jimmy would make sure to swing every time he went to the park.
