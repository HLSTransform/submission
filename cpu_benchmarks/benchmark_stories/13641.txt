Anna and Ben were playing in the garden. They saw an enormous brick wall. They wanted to see what was behind it.
"Let's crawl under the wall," said Anna. "Maybe there is a secret place."
"OK," said Ben. "But be careful. The wall might fall on us."
They crawled under the wall. They saw a big pond with many fish and frogs. They were happy. They wanted to touch the water.
But then they heard a loud bark. A big dog was running towards them. It looked angry. It wanted to chase them away.
"Run!" said Anna. "The dog is coming!"
They ran back to the wall. But the wall was too high. They could not climb over it. They were scared.
"Help!" they shouted. "There is a dog!"
Their mom heard them. She came to the garden. She saw the dog. She picked up a stick. She waved it at the dog. The dog ran away.
She lifted Anna and Ben over the wall. She hugged them.
"Are you OK?" she asked. "What were you doing?"
"We were crawling under the wall," said Anna. "We wanted to see the pond."
"That was not a good idea," said mom. "The wall is not safe. And the dog is not friendly. You could have been hurt."
"Sorry, mom," said Ben. "We were curious."
Mom smiled. She understood. She was curious too when she was little.
"Next time, ask me first," she said. "I can show you other places to explore. Places that are not dangerous."
"OK, mom," said Anna and Ben. "We love you."
They went back to the house. They had some juice and cookies. They learned a lesson. They were happy.
