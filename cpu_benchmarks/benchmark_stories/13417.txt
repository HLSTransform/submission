Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved peanuts. She always carried a bright yellow bag of peanuts with her wherever she went. One day, she met a new friend named Timmy at the park.
"Hi there, my name is Lily. What's yours?" she said.
"My name is Timmy. I like your bright bag. What's inside?" Timmy asked.
"Lots of yummy peanuts! Would you like to try some?" Lily said as she introduced her new friend to her favorite snack.
Timmy tried a peanut and loved it! From that day on, they became the best of friends and always shared Lily's bag of peanuts whenever they played together at the park.
