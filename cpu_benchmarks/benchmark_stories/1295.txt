Once upon a time there was a furry coal. It was so round and soft like a teddy bear. One day, it decided to go out on an adventure. Suddenly, it felt a big push and it started to move! The coal rolled down a hill and kept going further and further away. 
The coal kept rolling until it saw a great big pond. It looked so sparkly in the sunshine. But the coal couldnâ€™t get in. So it kept searching. Then, it spotted a furry tree nearby. It was just the right size for the coal to fit in! 
The coal got close and gave one big push. Suddenly it rolled right into the tree. It was so happy. At last it had found a safer place to sleep. The coal curled up and started to doze in the furry branches of the tree. The end.
