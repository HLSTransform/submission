Adam and his mommy were very excited. It was Adam's third birthday!
 Mommy wanted to make it special, so she asked him to shout out a wish. Adam was very patient and held his breath, concentrating hard. "I wish for more toys!" he shouted with a gleeful smile. 
Mommy was so proud of her brave little boy and hugged him tightly, saying "What a wonderful wish! What great adventures you'll have with your new toys!" 
Adam smiled bigger than ever and asked, "Can I open presents now?" 
Mommy laughed and said, "Of course! But first you have to blow out your birthday candles! Ready? Blow!" 
Adam shut his eyes and blew as hard as he could. All the candles were blown out in one loud shout! Adam was so proud of himself and his mommy clapped. 
It was the best birthday ever!
