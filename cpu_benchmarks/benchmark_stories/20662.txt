Once upon a time there was a brave man. He was on a long journey to find a distant temple. Every day he walked further, the sun shone in the sky, and he met lots of animals on the way.
One day, he heard a loud noise. He stopped for a moment to listen. It was coming from a nearby lake; it sounded like thunder.
He came closer to the lake and saw a giant wave in the lake. He was so scared and he ran away but then he heard a voice. It said "Brave man, come and strike the water."
He was brave and he approached the lake. He got ready to strike. He used all his strength and he struck the water with his hands. To his surprise, he saw a temple emerge from the distant horizon. He was amazed and filled with joy.
He entered the temple, and found a beautiful place filled with magic and treasures. From that day on, the brave man was never alone and always found joy in the distant temple.
