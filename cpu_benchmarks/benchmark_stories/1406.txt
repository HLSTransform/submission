Once upon a time, there was a girl. She was called Emma. Every day, Emma went to school. She always looked very attractive. One day, Emma was in school and was doing a quiz. Suddenly, she felt a tickle in her nose. She started to sneeze. She sneezed and sneezed and sneezed. Her teacher told her to go and blow her nose. Emma put her handkerchief to her nose, blew and then felt much better. She was so happy that she could continue with her quiz. The end.
