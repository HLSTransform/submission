Tommy was very happy when he got an invitation to Lily's birthday party. He liked Lily and wanted to play with her and the other kids. The invitation said there would be cake and games and a big surprise.
But when Tommy got to Lily's house, he saw something that made him scared. There was a big clown standing at the door, holding balloons and making funny noises. Tommy did not like clowns. He thought they were scary and mean. He wanted to run away and go home.
"Hi, Tommy!" the clown said. "Are you here for Lily's party? Come on in, I have a present for you!"
Tommy shook his head and hid behind his mom. He did not want a present from the clown. He did not want to go in.
"Tommy, don't be scared," his mom said. "The clown is just here to make you laugh. He is Lily's uncle. He is very nice. He won't hurt you. Please, give him a chance. Lily is waiting for you inside. She will be sad if you don't come."
Tommy looked at his mom and then at the clown. He saw that the clown had a friendly smile and kind eyes. He saw that the other kids were having fun with him. He saw that Lily was waving at him from the window.
Tommy took a deep breath and decided to be brave. He let go of his mom's hand and walked slowly to the clown. He took the present from him and said, "Thank you."
The clown gave him a hug and said, "You're welcome, Tommy. I'm glad you came. You're a very good boy. Now, let's go inside and have some fun!"
Tommy smiled and nodded. He followed the clown inside and joined Lily and the other kids. He had a great time at the party. He ate cake and played games and saw the big surprise. It was a magic show. Tommy liked magic. He was not scared of the clown anymore. He was happy. He was glad he came.
