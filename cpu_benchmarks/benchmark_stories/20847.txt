Once there was a mommy and a baby. The baby was outside holding a large blue faucet. Mommy looked over and asked what the baby was doing.
The baby smiled and said they were playing a game. Mommy asked what kind of game and the baby replied that it was a give game. Mommy asked how to play the game and the baby told her the rules. The baby said that she was going to give the big blue faucet to her mommy.
Mommy smiled and said that she was very happy to receive such a gift. She thanked the baby for the gesture. Then mommy opened the faucet and water came out. The baby laughed with joy at the sight of the water. 
Mommy and the baby played with the water for a while until it was time to go inside. The baby looked at the faucet one last time and smiled. Mommy gave the baby a hug and told her how much she loved the game they just played. The baby smiled and said she could play it again tomorrow. It was one of the happiest moments of their lives.
