Once upon a time, there was a dolphin named Dolly. Dolly was a kind and compassionate dolphin who loved to play in the ocean. One day, Dolly met a big, scary shark. The shark was mean and wanted to eat Dolly.
Dolly tried to swim away, but the shark was too fast. Dolly knew she had to hide, so she found a cozy cave to sleep in. She thought she was safe, but the shark found her. Dolly tried to swim away again, but the shark was too close.
In the end, the shark caught Dolly and ate her. Poor Dolly never knew that the big, scary shark was going to be her end.
