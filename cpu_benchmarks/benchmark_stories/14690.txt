Once upon a time there was a girl who was very sad. She was sad because her stair was broken.
She asked her mom and dad to fix it, but they said they didn't know how. The girl was very unhappy and she knew she had to do something.
So she went outside to think. Suddenly, she had an idea. She went to the store to buy a hammer and some nails.
She got home and started to fix the stair. She worked very hard and soon the stair was all fixed.
The girl felt so happy and smiled. She knew she had done a good job and her stair was no longer broken. This made her so happy that it was the end of her sad day.
