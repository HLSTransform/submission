Once upon a time, there was a shy little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but she was too scared to talk to other kids or grown-ups. One day, Lily saw a cop in her neighborhood. She was scared, but the cop smiled and waved at her. Lily felt a little bit better.
Later that day, Lily's mom asked her to complete a puzzle. Lily loved puzzles, so she got to work right away. She put all the pieces together and felt proud of herself. When she was finished, she showed her mom the completed puzzle. Her mom smiled and gave her a big hug. Lily felt happy and brave, just like the cop she saw earlier.
