Once upon a time, there was a bald pirate. He sailed on a big boat across the sea looking for adventure. But the bald pirate had a problem: he wanted to keep his ship safe. 
So he decided to prevent bad things from happening. He used big ropes to tie up the boat whenever he stopped for a break. He also made sure that his treasure chest was locked up tight. 
One day, the bald pirate was sailing when he saw a storm coming. He quickly moved the boat out of the way to prevent it from getting damaged. The bald pirate was very brave and he safely made it through the storm. 
The bald pirate continued to sail the seas with his boat and treasure chest, always trying to prevent bad things from happening.
