Once upon a time, there was an otter who liked to play in the river. She was a normal otter and never did anything too crazy. She liked to scoot around in the water, and would often rub her back along the rocks beneath her.
One night, she was feeling particularly tired and was rubbing her back against the rocks. She felt so relaxed as she floated along. Suddenly there was an explosion of noise above her. Startled, she quickly swam away.
When she got back to shore, she saw a big shining object in the sky. She crept closer to it and saw that it was an enormous circle. It was all kinds of colours, mixing together like paint. She rubbed her arm in amazement.
The otter was mesmerized by the circle in the sky. She stared at it until it disappeared into the night. From then on, she would often rub against the rocks, hoping for the circle to reappear. But every night was normal.
