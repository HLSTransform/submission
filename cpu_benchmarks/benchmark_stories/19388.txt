Once upon a time there was a bow. This bow was different from the other bows, because it never had been used.
One day, a boy named Sam came along to the bow. He started playing with it, but he was disturbing the peace.
The bow was tired of being bored and unused, so it tried to get Sam's attention. It yelled "Now, now" to him and it even shook slightly.
Sam was surprised and stopped disturbing. He pushed a little arrow into the bow and said "I'm sorry". Then he started to play with the bow and the two became great friends.
The End.
