Jennifer and her mum were in the park. They were looking at the ducks in the pond. Jennifer was so excited!
Mum said, "Let's go and play in the playground!"
Jennifer ran to the playground and went straight to the swings. She felt the wind on her face as she swung higher and higher.
Suddenly, it started to rain. Mum said, "Come on, let's go home."
They went back home, and Mum put iron on Jennifer's dress. She said, "Now you look nice and tidy."
The rain stopped, and the sun came out again. Jennifer calmed down and smiled. They stepped out of the house and went back to the park.
