Once upon a time, there was a little girl and she loved to play. One day she was playing in her room with her toys and there was a big, red carpet in the middle of the floor.
The girl had been playing for a long time, when all of a sudden, she heard a noise. She got a bit anxious and looked around. Then she heard the noise again.
It was coming from the carpet! The little girl was very curious and she pulled back the carpet to see what was underneath.
There was a mouse! It was making a funny joke, and the little girl laughed. She and the mouse talked for a while and soon the little girl forgot about the anxious feeling she had felt before. They laughed together until it was time to go to bed.
The little girl said goodbye to the mouse underneath the carpet and she went off to sleep, dreaming of all the fun she had had that day.
