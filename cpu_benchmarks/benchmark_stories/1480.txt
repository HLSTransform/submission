Once upon a time, there was a fragile jar. All around the jar stood a family of bears. They were all trying to support it. 
The jar was quite big and the bears were very small. They all grabbed onto the jar with their paws. But try as they might, the jar wouldn't budge. 
The bears began to worry. What could they do? They wanted to help the jar, but they were too small. 
Suddenly an idea occurred to them. They asked some of the other animals if they could help. Soon, the giraffes, elephants and crocodiles had all come to help. 
Together they all managed to support the fragile jar. They cheered and gave each other high-fives. It was a job well done!
