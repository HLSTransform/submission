Sam was a soldier. He liked to work hard and help people. He wore a green hat and a green suit. He had a big gun and a small knife. He was brave and strong.
One day, Sam had to go to a far place. He had to fight some bad men who wanted to hurt people. He said goodbye to his mom and dad. He gave them a hug and a kiss. He said, "I love you. I will be back soon."
Sam got on a big plane with other soldiers. They flew for a long time. They saw many things. They saw mountains and rivers and trees and houses. Sam liked to look out the window. He wondered what the people were doing.
When they got to the far place, they jumped out of the plane. They had parachutes that made them float in the air. They landed on the ground. They ran to a safe spot. They saw the bad men. They started to shoot at them.
Sam was not afraid. He aimed his gun and fired. He hit some of the bad men. He saw one of them fall down. He felt sorry for him. He said, "Why do you want to hurt people? Why can't we be friends?"
But the bad man did not answer. He was dead. Sam felt sad. He wished there was no fighting. He wished everyone was nice and kind. He wished he was home with his mom and dad. He hoped they were okay.
He looked at the sky. It was blue and mild. He saw a bird flying. He heard it sing. He smiled. He said, "Maybe one day, there will be peace. Maybe one day, I will see that bird again."
