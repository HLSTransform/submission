Once upon a time there was a very wealthy man. He owned a lot of things and was very happy. But every day he walked around with a sad face.
One day, he passed a sign on the side of the road and he stopped to read it. The sign said, "Life is like ice cream. It melts away if you don't enjoy it!"
The man was so moved by the sign that he smiled. He realized that he needed to enjoy his money and his life. He never walked around with a sad face again.
Now he spends his days enjoying the nice ice cream and feeling wealthy and happy. The sign reminded him that life is precious and can easily melt away if we forget to enjoy it.
