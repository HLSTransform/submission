Mum came into the living room with a pot of soil. She asked her son if he wanted to help add some plants to the pot. The 3-year-old boy said he would love to help, so they started adding plants together. 
Mum showed her son how to carefully place the plant in the pot and then cover it with soil. After they had added all the plants, they both stepped back to admire their work. 
“Yum!” said the boy. 
“What do you mean?” Mum asked. 
“These plants look tasty!” he replied. 
Mum laughed and said, “No, plants are not for eating, but when they grow, we will pick some fruits from them.” 
The little boy nodded, understanding that plants give us tasty treats. He was very excited to watch them grow and pick his own tasty treats!
