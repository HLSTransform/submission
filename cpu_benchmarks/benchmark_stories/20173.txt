Lily wanted to help Mommy decorate the big green tree. She saw many shiny things that Mommy hung on the tree. They were called ornaments. Lily liked the ornaments. She wanted to touch them and play with them.
She reached for a red ball that looked like a shiny apple. But when she pulled it, it fell off the tree and broke on the floor. Lily heard a loud noise and saw many pieces of the red ball. She felt scared and sad. She started to cry.
Mommy heard Lily cry and came to see what happened. She saw the broken ornament and the mess on the floor. She felt frustrated and angry. She said to Lily, "Why did you do that? You know you are not supposed to touch the ornaments. They are not toys. They are fragile. You could have hurt yourself. You made a big mess. You embarrassed me."
Lily felt worse. She did not mean to break the ornament. She did not mean to make Mommy angry. She did not mean to embarrass Mommy. She said to Mommy, "I'm sorry, Mommy. I just wanted to help. I just wanted to see the shiny thing. I didn't know it would break. Please don't be mad at me. Please don't be embarrassed by me."
Mommy saw Lily's tears and heard her words. She felt sorry for Lily. She realized that Lily was just curious and did not understand. She hugged Lily and said, "It's okay, Lily. I'm not mad at you. I'm not embarrassed by you. I love you. You are my little helper. But you have to be careful with the ornaments. They are not for playing. They are for looking. Next time, ask me before you touch them. Okay?"
Lily nodded and said, "Okay, Mommy. I love you too. Can I still help you decorate the tree?"
Mommy smiled and said, "Of course you can. But only with the soft ornaments. Like this one." She gave Lily a fluffy snowman that had a carrot nose and a hat. Lily smiled and hung it on the tree. She felt happy and proud. She helped Mommy decorate the tree.
