Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play outside. One day, they see a swamp near their house. They want to go and look.
"Let's go to the swamp!" Sara says. "Maybe we can see frogs and bugs."
"OK, but be careful. The swamp is wet and muddy." Tom says. They hold hands and walk to the swamp.
They see green water and brown mud. They hear funny noises. They hear croaks and splashes and hisses.
"What are those noises?" Sara asks. "They sound funny."
"Maybe they are animals. Maybe they are snakes or alligators." Tom says. He is scared.
"Snakes? Alligators? I don't like them. They are scary." Sara says. She is scared too.
They want to go back to their house. But they don't know how. They are lost.
They start to cry. They are sad and afraid.
"Help! Help!" They shout.
Then they hear another noise. They hear a bark. They see a dog. It is their dog, Spot.
"Spot! Spot!" They call. "You found us!"
Spot runs to them. He wags his tail. He licks their faces.
They hug Spot. They are happy.
Spot leads them back to their house. They follow Spot.
They see their mom and dad. They are worried.
"Where were you?" Mom asks. "We were looking for you."
"We went to the swamp. We heard funny noises. We got lost. But Spot found us." Sara says.
"We are sorry. We won't go to the swamp again." Tom says.
Mom and dad hug them. They are glad.
They give Spot a treat. He is a good dog.
They learn a lesson. They don't go to the swamp anymore. They play in the yard. They are safe.
