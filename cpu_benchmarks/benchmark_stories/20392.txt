Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Timmy. Timmy loved honey very much. One day, Timmy's mom bought him a jar of honey from the store. Timmy was so happy and said, "Mommy, can we decorate the jar?"
Mommy said, "Sure, Timmy. What do you want to put on the jar?"
Timmy thought for a moment and said, "I want to put a picture of a bee on it, because bees make honey."
Mommy smiled and said, "That's a great idea, Timmy. Let's go get some stickers to decorate the jar."
Timmy and mommy went to the store and picked out some bee stickers. They went home and decorated the jar together. Timmy was so proud of his honey jar and showed it to all his friends. From that day on, Timmy's honey jar was his most prized possession.
