Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play with chalk on the sidewalk. They draw big flowers and stars and cars. They have fun.
One day, a big boy comes. He is mean. He says, "Your drawings are ugly. I can draw better." He takes Tom's chalk and draws over their flowers and stars and cars. He laughs.
Tom and Mia are sad and angry. They say, "Stop it! That is our chalk and our drawings. You are not nice. Go away!"
The big boy does not listen. He says, "You are babies. You can't draw. I can draw anything. Watch me." He tries to draw a lion with the chalk. But he does not know how. His lion looks like a blob.
Tom and Mia notice something. They have an idea. They are smart. They say, "Wow, your lion is amazing. It is so big and scary. Can you draw more animals? Can you draw a giraffe? And a monkey? And a snake?"
The big boy is proud. He says, "Of course I can. I am the best. Watch me." He draws more animals with the chalk. But they all look like blobs. He uses up all the chalk.
Tom and Mia smile. They say, "Thank you for drawing for us. You are so good. But we have to go now. Bye bye." They run away.
The big boy is confused. He looks at his drawings. He sees that they are not good. He feels silly. He has no more chalk. He is alone. He is not happy.
