Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They see many things in the park: trees, flowers, birds, swings, slides. They have fun.
One day, they find a big stone in the park. It is round and smooth and shiny. Lily and Ben think it is pretty. They want to do something with the stone.
"Let's make a face on the stone," Lily says. "We can use sticks and leaves and berries."
"Good idea," Ben says. "I will find some sticks and leaves. You find some berries."
They look around the park and find what they need. They put the sticks and leaves on the stone to make eyes and a nose. They put the berries on the stone to make a mouth. They make a cheerful face on the stone.
They look at their stone face and smile. They are happy. They hug each other.
"Hello, stone face," Lily says. "You are our new friend."
"Hello, Lily and Ben," the stone face says. "You are very kind and creative."
Lily and Ben are surprised. They did not know the stone can talk. They are curious.
"How can you talk?" Ben asks.
"I can talk because you gave me a face and a voice," the stone says. "You made me alive."
Lily and Ben are amazed. They feel special. They have a magic stone.
"Wow, you are a magic stone," Lily says. "We are glad we found you."
"Me too," the stone says. "You are the best friends I ever had."
They laugh and talk and play with the stone. They have a wonderful time. They are cheerful.
