Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play outside and look at the flowers. One day, she was playing with her friends when she fell down and hurt her knee. She cried and her friends came to see what happened.
"Are you okay, Lily?" asked her friend Sarah.
"It hurts," replied Lily, pointing to her knee.
Sarah looked at Lily's knee and said, "Don't worry, it's just a little scrape. You'll be charming again in no time."
Lily smiled and felt better. She got up and continued to play with her friends. They all had fun together and Lily forgot about her knee. From that day on, Lily knew that even when she fell down, her friends would be there to help her and make her feel better.
