Once upon a time, there was a kind and compassionate girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. One day, she saw a small bird with a hurt wing. Lily wanted to help the bird, so she went to search for something to make it feel better.
Lily looked everywhere for something to help the bird. She looked under rocks, behind trees, and in the tall grass. Then, she found a soft bush with pretty flowers. Lily thought that the flowers could make the bird happy and help it feel better.
Lily carefully picked some of the flowers from the bush and brought them to the bird. The bird looked at the flowers and seemed to smile. It ate a little bit of the flower and started to feel better. The bird's wing was not hurt anymore, and it could fly again. The bird flew up in the sky and sang a happy song. Lily knew that her search was worth it, and she felt happy that she could help her new friend.
