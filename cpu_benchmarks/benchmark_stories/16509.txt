Once upon a time, there was a playful bird. The bird loved to fly high in the sky and soar through the clouds. One day, the bird saw a shiny piece of iron on the ground. The bird thought it looked like a fun toy to play with.
The bird picked up the iron and began to play with it. But the iron was heavy and the bird's wings were not strong enough to carry it. As the bird tried to fly with the iron, it fell to the ground and hurt itself badly.
The other animals came to help the bird, but it was too late. The bird had hurt itself too much and could not fly anymore. The other animals were sad and wished they could have helped the bird before it was too late. From that day on, the animals knew to be careful when playing with things that could hurt them.
