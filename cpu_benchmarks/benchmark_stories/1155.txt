Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a fat bear named Bobo. Bobo was always hungry. One day, he saw smoke coming from a small house. He walked closer to see what was there.
Inside the house, a nice lady was cooking. She saw Bobo and said, "Hello, fat bear! Are you hungry?" Bobo nodded his head. The nice lady gave him some food to eat. It was very yummy.
After eating, Bobo said, "Thank you!" He was not hungry anymore. The nice lady was happy to help. Bobo went back to the forest, and they both lived happily ever after.
