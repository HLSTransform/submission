Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside, even when it was cold. His mom always made sure he wore his jacket to stay warm.
One day, Timmy and his friend Billy were playing outside. Billy said, "I bet you can't jump over that big rock!" Timmy said, "I can too!" But he was worried his jacket might get in the way.
Later, Timmy's mom said, "Let's test your jacket to see if it's warm enough." Timmy was happy to show her how warm it was. He opened his jacket and said, "See, it's nice and cozy!"
The next day, Timmy and Billy went back to the big rock. Timmy remembered to open his jacket so it wouldn't get in the way. He jumped over the rock and landed safely on the other side. Billy was impressed and said, "Wow, you did it!" Timmy smiled and said, "My jacket kept me warm and helped me jump high!"
