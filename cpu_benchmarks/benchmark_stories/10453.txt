Yesterday, Sammy went outside, wanting to explore. He ran around the garden, and found a rabbit in the bushes. "Come here, little rabbit," he said. Sammy wanted to follow the rabbit, but Mommy said, "No, no Sammy. That's naughty. Let the rabbit go." Sammy obeyed and Mommy was very proud of him.
The next day, Mommy said, "Let's go on an adventure, Sammy!" Sammy was so excited, he quickly followed her outside. They walked around the garden until they saw the same rabbit from yesterday. Sammy wanted to follow the rabbit again, but he remembered what Mommy had said. He looked up at Mommy and asked, "Can I follow the rabbit?"
Mommy smiled and replied, "Yes, Sammy. Let's follow the rabbit together." 
So off they went, following the naughty little rabbit as it hopped around the garden. Together, they watched the rabbit explore the garden until eventually it ran away. Sammy was sad to see it go, but he knew that it was on a new adventure. He also had a new adventure of his own - one that he would remember forever.
