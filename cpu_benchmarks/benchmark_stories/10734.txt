Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big brother named Jack. One day, Jack gifted Lily a soft mattress. Lily loved it so much that she hugged it tight and said, "Thank you, Jack! This is the best gift ever!"
At night, Lily laid on her new mattress and felt so cozy. Jack came to check on her and asked, "Do you like your new mattress, Lily?" She replied, "Yes, Jack! It's so soft and comfy!" Jack smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it. Do you want me to rub your back?" Lily nodded her head and Jack gently rubbed her back until she fell asleep. 
From that day on, Lily slept soundly on her gifted mattress every night. She would always remember how her big brother Jack made her feel loved and cozy.
