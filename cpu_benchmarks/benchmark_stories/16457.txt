Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play together. One day, they decided to make a surprise for their mom. They took some pillows, blankets, and toys and made a big fort on the couch. They hid inside and waited for their mom to come home.
Soon, they heard the door open and their mom's voice. "Hello, kids, I'm home! Where are you?" she called. Ben and Lily giggled and whispered to each other. They wanted to see their mom's face when she saw their fort.
They heard their mom walk into the living room and gasp. "Wow, what is this?" she said. She looked around and saw the couch covered with pillows and blankets. She smiled and walked closer. "Is anyone in there?" she asked.
Ben and Lily jumped out of the fort and shouted, "Surprise, Mommy! We made this for you!" They ran to hug their mom and showed her their toys. Their mom was very happy and hugged them back. "Thank you, my sweeties, this is a wonderful surprise! You are so creative and thoughtful!" she said.
Ben and Lily were very excited and proud. They invited their mom to join them in the fort. They played and cuddled on the couch for a long time. They had a lot of fun and felt very loved.
