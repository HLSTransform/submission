Once upon a time there was a big, smelly cow. The cow's name was Moo Moo. Moo Moo was sick and didn't feel very good. So Moo Moo's mommy demanded that they buy a thermometer. Moo Moo's mommy went to the store and bought the thermometer. 
When Moo Moo and her mommy came home, Moo Moo's mommy put the thermometer under Moo Moo's tongue. It was a little weird, but Moo Moo did not mind. After a few minutes, the thermometer told Moo Moo's mommy what her body temperature was. 
Moo Moo's mommy was happy she had the thermometer, because it told her what was wrong with Moo Moo. She took her to the doctor, who gave her medicine that made Moo Moo feel better in no time. 
Moo Moo's mommy was very grateful that she had the thermometer, because it helped her take good care of Moo Moo.
