Tommy was a bad boy. He liked to hit and make noise. One day, he slapped the old clock on the sideboard. His mom heard the loud noise and rushed into the room.
"Tommy! Why did you do that?" Mom asked.
Tommy was feeling guilty, so he looked away. He didn't know what to say.
"Tell me why you slapped the clock," Mom said again.
Tommy was still quiet.
"I'm waiting Tommy," Mom said.
Tommy sighed. "I wanted to see if it would make a funny noise," he said.
Mom shook her head. "No more slapping things! It's not nice," she said.
Tommy looked down, feeling guilty. He knew he had made a mistake.
