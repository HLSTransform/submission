Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and look at the clouds. He would point to them and say, "Look, Mommy, a big white cloud!" 
One day, Timmy's mom bought him a regular chocolate bar. Timmy was so happy and he ate it all up. But then, Timmy didn't feel so good. His tummy hurt and he had to go to the doctor. 
The doctor said that Timmy ate too much chocolate and it spoiled his tummy. Timmy learned that he shouldn't eat too much candy. From that day on, Timmy only looked at the clouds and didn't eat too much candy.
