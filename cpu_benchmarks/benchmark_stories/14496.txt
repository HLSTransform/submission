Once upon a time, there was a mild soldier. He loved to test things. He tested the winds, the leaves and the sun. He was always busy testing! One day he decided to test the biggest mountain in his town. He started to climb, but it was too mild. He knew he couldn't make it. Suddenly, he noticed a group of children playing. 
He watched as they tested their climbing skills. He was impressed! He cheered them on, and as they made it to the top, he was so proud. He couldn't believe what the children had done. He realized that even mild soldiers can test new things. He was so happy that he joined in the fun. The children cheered and they all celebrated the mild soldier's test!
