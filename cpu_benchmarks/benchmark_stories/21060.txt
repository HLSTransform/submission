Tom and Mia are twins. They like to play in the park. They have a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. They also have a secret spot. It is a hidden view of the pond. They can see ducks, fish, and frogs.
One day, they go to the park with Mom. Mom says they can play for one hour. Tom and Mia run to the slide. They take turns going down. Then they go to the swing. They push each other high. Then they go to the sandbox. They make a castle and a moat.
But Tom wants to see the hidden view. He tells Mia to come with him. Mia says no. She wants to play in the sandbox. Tom says he is the boss. He orders Mia to follow him. Mia says he is not the boss. She orders Tom to stay with her. They start to yell and fight.
Mom hears them. She comes to the sandbox. She asks what is wrong. Tom and Mia tell her. Mom says they have to share and take turns. She says they can both see the hidden view, but only for five minutes. Then they have to come back to the sandbox.
Tom and Mia agree. They say sorry to each other. They hold hands and walk to the secret spot. They see the ducks, the fish, and the frogs. They smile and laugh. They like the hidden view. They also like the sandbox. They like to play together. They are happy.
