Once upon a time there was a girl. She was very small and she wanted to have a special adventure. So she decided to go on a trip to stay in a big hotel.
When she got to the hotel it was dark and she felt a bit scared. But she was brave and soon the lights came on and it looked very cosy and comfortable.
The girl started to explore the hotel but suddenly she felt very dizzy and she started to twist and turn. She twirled and spun around and round until she couldn't stand up anymore and fell into a deep sleep.
When she awoke, the sun was streaming through the windows. She realised she had been dreaming and she felt so happy and excited. She had gone on the most wonderful adventure, even if it was just in her sleepy head.
