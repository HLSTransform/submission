Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and climb trees. One day, he found a suit hanging on a branch. It was a disgusting suit because it was dirty and smelly.
Timmy said, "Ew, that suit is disgusting!"
Just then, a man walked by and saw Timmy looking at the suit. 
"Hello there, young man," said the man. "Do you like that suit?"
Timmy shook his head and said, "No, it's disgusting!"
The man laughed and said, "I agree, it is quite disgusting. I was going to throw it away, but maybe you can use it for playing dress-up."
Timmy's eyes lit up and he said, "Yes, I would love that!"
And so, Timmy took the disgusting suit and hung it up in his treehouse. Now, he could play dress-up whenever he wanted.
