Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lily. Lily was 3 years old and loved to ride her bicycle. Everyday, Lily would gleefully step outside on her bicycle and she even had a special place to ride it.
One day, the sun was especially warm, so Lily decided to cycle for an extra long time. When she eventually stepped back into her house, Lily noticed that her mother was worried.
"Lily," said her mother. "It's not always good to take too many steps without listening to another's advice."
Lily smiled and nodded her head. She understood her mother's words and never stepped outside to ride her bicycle without telling someone first.
By following her mother's advice, Lily was always safe, warm and happy.
