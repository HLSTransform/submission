Mia was a very happy 3 year old. She loved playing outside. One day, Mia's mom and dad took her to an enormous park. Mia spotted a huge motorcycle in the park and was immediately excited. 
Mia's mom said, "Mia, be careful. Don't get too close!"
But Mia didn't listen. She ran right up to the motorcycle and exclaimed, "Wow!"
Suddenly, Mia sneezed. The motorcycle suddenly moved and she felt hurt. She started to cry. 
Mia's mom ran towards her and hugged her tightly. She said, "Mia, it's ok. We will make it better."
Mia smiled, happy to be comforted. Her parents cleaned the hurt and made it all better. She learned a valuable lesson that day - to be careful around motorcyles!
