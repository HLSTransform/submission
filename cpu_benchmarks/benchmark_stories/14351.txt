Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily lived in a snowy place. She loved to build igloos with her friends. One day, Lily saw a polar bear walking towards her. She was scared and wanted to run away, but her dad told her it's okay to stay and watch the bear. The bear didn't hurt her and just walked away. 
Lily felt guilty because she thought she was mean to the bear by being scared. But her dad told her it's okay to feel scared sometimes. He also said it's important to always ask permission before doing something. Lily remembered this and asked her friends if it's okay to build an igloo together. They all said yes and had a lot of fun building it. 
From that day on, Lily always asked permission before doing something and never felt guilty again. She also loved building igloos even more because she knew it was okay to do so.
