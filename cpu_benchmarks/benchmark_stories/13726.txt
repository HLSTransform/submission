Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat candy and cookies all day long. One day, Lily's mommy told her it was time for bed. Lily didn't want to go to bed because she was not sleepy yet. 
Her mommy said, "Lily, you have to go to bed now. You can taste more candy tomorrow." 
Lily went to bed but she couldn't sleep. She saw a spider on the wall and she thought it was interesting. She wanted to catch it, so she got out of bed. 
Suddenly, she fell and hit her head on the floor. Her mommy heard the noise and came to check on her. She saw that Lily was hurt and took her to the hospital. The doctors said that Lily had to stay in the hospital for a long time. 
Lily was sad because she couldn't eat candy and cookies in the hospital. She wished she had listened to her mommy and stayed in bed. The end.
