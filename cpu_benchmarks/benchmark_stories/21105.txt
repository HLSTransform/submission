Once upon a time, there was a loyal dog named Spot. Spot liked to perform tricks for his family. He could sit, jump, and even dance. One day, Spot's family was having a big party. Spot wanted to perform his tricks for everyone.
At the party, Spot saw a shiny ashtray on the table. He thought it would be fun to use it in his tricks. Spot's mom saw him looking at the ashtray and said, "Be careful, Spot. That ashtray is fragile and could break." Spot wagged his tail and promised to be careful.
During the party, Spot started to perform his tricks. He danced around the ashtray, making everyone laugh. But then, Spot accidentally bumped the table, and the ashtray fell. It broke into pieces. Spot felt sad and worried that his mom would be mad.
Spot's mom came over and said, "It's okay, Spot. I know you didn't mean to break it. You are a loyal dog, and we love you." Spot felt happy again, and everyone clapped for his tricks. From that day on, Spot learned to be more careful when performing his tricks, and his family loved him even more.
