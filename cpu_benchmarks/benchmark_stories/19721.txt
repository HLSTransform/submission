Once upon a time, there was a boy called Tom. Tom lived with his dad and mum. Tom was very happy, but one day he got a troubled feeling inside. 
Tom was scared of the sound he heard coming from upstairs. He asked his dad and mum about the sound but they said he was imagining things.
But Tom knew he was not imagining it. He heard the sound again. So he ran upstairs and saw a cat. The cat was scared too and was trying to hide.
Tom was happy to own the cat. He promised to look after it and named it Scratch. Tom thought Scratch was the most beautiful cat in the world.
Tom and Scratch were happy together. Tom was no longer troubled and the sound he heard was no more.
