Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the mud and get her hands dirty. One day, her mommy told her it was time to wash up for dinner. Lily didn't want to stop playing, but she knew she had to wash her hands.
After dinner, Lily's daddy turned on the TV to watch his favorite show. But the picture was dull and fuzzy. He realized there was a problem with the network. He tried to fix it, but he couldn't. So, he called a man to come and fix the network.
While the man was fixing the network, Lily's mommy asked her to help her wash the dishes. Lily didn't want to stop playing again, but she knew she had to help her mommy. She washed the dishes with soap and water until they were sparkly clean. The end.
