Once upon a time there was a cup. It was a special cup and fit perfectly in the little boy's hand. He was very proud of his cup and always made sure it was clean and shiny.
One day the little boy became very excited. He was getting a new toy and he wanted to take his cup with him. The little boy was worried that his cup wouldn't fit in the car. But much to his surprise, it did fit!
The little boy was so happy that his cup fit in the car. He smiled and hugged his cup tightly. On the way to the toy store, the little boy sang a song about his cup.
The little boy and his cup had a great day out. Everywhere he went, his cup fit in with him. The little boy liked it when things fit, just like his special cup did. He left the toy store feeling very proud.
