Anna liked to play with her mom's things in the office. She liked the shiny pens, the colorful papers, and the funny noises the computer made. But her mom always told her to be careful and not touch anything that could break or hurt her.
One day, Anna saw a big pair of scissors on the desk. They looked like fun. She wanted to see what they could do. She picked them up and started to cut the papers. She made shapes and patterns and confetti. She felt happy and proud.
But then she saw something else on the desk. It was a long, thin, black thing with a metal tip. It looked like a pen, but it was not. It was a ruler. Anna wondered what it was for. She decided to try it out. She put it on the paper and tried to draw a line. But it did not work. It was too hard and sharp. She pressed harder and harder, but nothing happened. She felt angry and frustrated.
She lifted the ruler and tried to bend it. Maybe it would make a curve or a circle. But it did not. It was too stiff and strong. She pulled and twisted, but nothing changed. She felt more angry and more frustrated.
She snapped. She threw the ruler on the floor and stomped on it. She screamed and cried. She wanted it to break. She wanted it to do what she wanted.
But it did not. It only made a loud noise. A noise that made her mom come running from the other room. A noise that made her mom see the mess she had made. A noise that made her mom very mad and very sad.
Anna knew she had done something bad. She knew she had made a mistake. She felt sorry and scared. She wished she had listened to her mom. She wished she had not played with the weird ruler. She wished she had not snapped.
