Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play with toys in the yard. One day, they find a big frame in the trash. The frame is hard and shiny. It has many colors and shapes.
"Wow, look at this!" Tom says. "It is so pretty!"
"Can we play with it?" Mia asks.
"Sure, why not?" Tom says. "Let's take it to our fort."
They carry the frame to their fort. It is a big box with a blanket on top. They put the frame inside the fort. They think it is a treasure.
"Let's cover it with the blanket," Mia says. "So no one can see it."
"Good idea," Tom says. "It is our secret."
They cover the frame with the blanket. They are happy. They go to get some snacks.
But they do not know that the frame is not a toy. It is a broken window. It has sharp edges and glass. It is dangerous.
When they come back, they see a big hole in the blanket. They see blood on the ground. They hear a cry.
"Help! Help!" It is Ben, their little brother. He followed them to the fort. He saw the blanket. He was curious. He lifted the blanket. He touched the frame. He cut his hand. He is hurt.
Tom and Mia run to him. They are scared. They are sorry. They call for help.
The end.
Moral: Do not play with things you do not know. They can be harmful. Always ask an adult before you touch something new.
