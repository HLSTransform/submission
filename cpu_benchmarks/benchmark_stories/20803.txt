Once there was a little seal that was very hungry. He had been looking for food for a long time, but he just couldn't find anything to eat.
The seal swam and swam, but he was still very hungry. Then he saw an ice cream cone. He swam up to it and tried to grab it, but he lost it and it fell into the ocean. 
He was so sad that he started to cry. He was so hungry and he wanted the ice cream cone so badly. But he had lost it. 
Just then, he saw a crab. The crab said he was feeling generous and wanted to help the seal. He gave the seal a big fish to eat. The seal was so happy, he gobbled up the fish right away!
The little seal was so happy he had something to eat at last. He thanked the kind crab and swam away, no longer hungry.
