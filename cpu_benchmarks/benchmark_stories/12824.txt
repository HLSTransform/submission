John was a persistent three year old. Every day, he asked his mom to play with him.
"Mama can we go outside and play?" he asked.
Mama smiled and said, "Yes, we can go to a park and have a picnic. We can bring the blanket and a basket of food."
John cheered, "Yay! Let's go!"
So they put on their coats, grabbed the picnic supplies and headed to the park.
John chased birds and butterflies. He splashed in mud puddles.
Mama said, "Let's lay the blanket down and have our picnic."
So they did.
John liked the picnic. He smiled and said, "This is so much fun! I'm so happy."
Mama said, "See? I told you you'd have a good time if you were persistent. Now, let's go home and clean up before bedtime."
John nodded and started to pack up the picnic. He was already thinking about what he and Mama could do tomorrow.
