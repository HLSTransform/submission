Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the garden and dig in the soil. One day, she found a little worm who was very sad. "Why are you sad?" asked Lily. "I lost my way home," said the worm. "Don't worry," said Lily, "I will help you find your way home. I am a compassionate friend."
Lily picked up the worm and placed him on a leaf. She carried the leaf and walked around the garden. "Where is your home?" asked Lily. "It's over there," said the worm, pointing to a patch of soil. Lily gently placed the worm back into the soil. "Don't be sad anymore," said Lily, "you are back home now."
The worm was very happy and thanked Lily for her kindness. "You are a good friend," said the worm. "I am happy to comfort you," said Lily. From that day on, Lily and the worm were the best of friends and they played together in the garden every day.
