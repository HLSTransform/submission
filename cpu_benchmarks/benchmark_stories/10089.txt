Lila and her mother went to the park. They saw many birds and flowers and trees. Lila liked to run and play on the grass. Her mother watched her and smiled.
But then Lila saw a big dog. The dog was black and white and had a long tail. It was barking and running towards Lila. Lila was scared. She thought the dog was angry and wanted to bite her. She ran to her mother and cried.
"Mommy, mommy, help me! The dog is coming!"
Her mother hugged her and said, "Don't worry, Lila. The dog is harmless. He is not angry. He is happy. He wants to play with you. He is a friendly dog."
Lila looked at the dog again. The dog was wagging his tail and licking his lips. He did not look angry. He looked happy. He stopped barking and sat down. He looked at Lila and her mother with big eyes.
"Can I pet him, mommy?" Lila asked.
"Yes, you can, Lila. But be gentle and careful. The dog is big and strong. He might knock you over. Ask his owner first if you can pet him."
Lila saw a man walking towards them. He had a leash in his hand. He was the dog's owner. He smiled and said, "Hello, I'm sorry if my dog scared you. His name is Spot. He is harmless. He loves children. He just wanted to say hello. Can he play with your daughter?"
Lila's mother said, "Yes, he can. Thank you for asking. My daughter is Lila. She was afraid of your dog at first, but now she wants to pet him. Is that okay?"
The man said, "Of course, that's okay. Spot loves to be petted. He is very gentle and friendly. He will not hurt your daughter. He will protect her. He is a good dog."
Lila smiled and walked slowly to the dog. She reached out her hand and touched his fur. It was soft and warm. The dog licked her hand and wagged his tail. He made a happy sound. Lila giggled and said, "Hi, Spot. You are a nice dog. You are not angry. You are happy. You are harmless. You are my friend."
Lila and Spot played together on the grass. They chased each other and rolled over and over. They had fun. Lila's mother and the man watched them and laughed. They were glad that Lila and Spot got along so well. They were glad that Lila was not scared anymore. They were glad that Spot was harmless. They were glad that they saved the day.
