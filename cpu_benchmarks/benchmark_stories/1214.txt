Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the beach with her family. One day, while playing in the water, she saw a cute little crab. She wanted to catch it and take it home with her.
Lily tried to grab the crab, but it quickly scurried away. She chased after it, but it disappeared into the waves. Lily was sad and disappointed. Her mom explained to her that it's not nice to take animals from their homes. It's important to order and respect nature.
Lily learned her lesson and promised to be kind to all creatures. From that day on, she enjoyed watching the waves and all the cute animals that lived in the ocean.
