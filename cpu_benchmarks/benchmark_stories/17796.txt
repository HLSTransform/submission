One day Mommy was in the kitchen cooking dinner. The kitchen smelled very yummy. Mommy grabbed a round can from the cupboard and she began to spray it. The spray was very loud and made a funny noise.
Mommy told her little three-year-old daughter, "Look! You can help me make dinner. This spray is available for you to use too." 
The little girl was so excited to help. She grabbed the round can and began to spray. She sprayed the can all around the kitchen in circles. Mommy was so proud.
After dinner the little girl's hands were sticky. She grabbed the round can again and sprayed it all over them. Mommy laughed and said, "Now your hands are all clean!" 
The little girl was very happy and proud to help her mommy cook dinner. She shared her can of spray with her mommy and they sprayed round circles all around the kitchen, being careful not to get any on the walls. 
They finished spraying and put the can away. Mommy and her daughter hugged and said it was a job well done. The little girl was thrilled that her mommy and her worked together, and now she knew what it meant to be available to help.
