Once upon a time, there lived an old woman who had a special screw. Every day the old woman would take out the screw and look at it. 
One day, she was talking to a 3 year old child who asked her why she looked at the screw all the time.
The old woman smiled and said: "I am looking at this screw because it has the power to change things. You see, if I use it in the right way, I can make new things from old things!"
The 3 year old child was very interested, so the old woman asked the child to help her. Together, they changed an old piece of wood into a beautiful birdhouse. 
The old woman thanked the child for all their help. Then she asked the child to help her take care of the new birdhouse, so that it always stayed as new and beautiful as it was. 
The 3 year old and the old woman smiled and went on with their day. And whenever they needed a change, they went back to the old woman's special screw.
