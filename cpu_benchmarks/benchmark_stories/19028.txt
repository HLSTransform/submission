Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to chew gum. He always had a pack in his pocket. One day, Tim went to the store to buy more gum. He saw a pack he really wanted, but he didn't have enough money. 
Tim saw another boy with a pack of the same gum. He wanted it so badly, he decided to steal it. He took the gum and ran away. 
But Tim's mom saw what he did. She was very patient and waited for Tim to come home. When he did, she asked him where he got the gum. Tim felt guilty and told her the truth. 
His mom explained that stealing was wrong and that he should always be honest. Tim felt bad and promised to never steal again. From that day on, he always asked for what he wanted and never took things that didn't belong to him.
