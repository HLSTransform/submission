Once there was a little shape. It was very gentle and kind. Every day it would go on long journeys.
One day, it started out on a new journey and it was having lots of fun. But then it got tired and suddenly, it couldn't go any further.
The shape was so sad that it started to cry. But then a gentle breeze came and whispered to it, "keep going! Don't give up! You can finish your journey."
So the shape tried very hard and finally, it reached its destination. It could hear a sound of joy and it was the most wonderful sound ever!
The shape was so happy to have finished its journey and it thanked the gentle breeze for giving it the courage and strength to keep going.
