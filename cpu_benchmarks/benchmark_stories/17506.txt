Lily and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun making noises and pretending to be animals. But then they saw a big jar on the shelf. It was shiny and had a lid. They wanted to see what was inside.
"Let's open it!" Ben said.
"No, we can't. Mommy said it's not for us. It's very important to her." Lily said.
"But I'm curious. Maybe it has candy or something." Ben said.
He climbed on the couch and reached for the jar. Lily tried to stop him, but he was too fast. He opened the lid and looked inside. He saw a gray powder that looked like dirt. He touched it with his finger and it felt soft and cold.
"What is this?" he asked.
Lily gasped. She knew what it was. It was ash. It was the ash of their grandpa, who had died last year. Mommy had told them that grandpa was in the jar, and that they should never touch it or move it. She said it was a way to remember him and keep him close.
"Ben, put it back! That's grandpa! You're not supposed to touch it!" Lily shouted.
But Ben didn't listen. He ignored her. He wanted to play with the ash. He poured some of it on the floor and made shapes with it. He laughed and said it was fun.
Lily felt angry and scared. She knew they were doing something bad. She knew Mommy would be very sad and mad if she saw them. She felt guilty. She wanted to tell Ben to stop, but he wouldn't listen. She wanted to clean up the mess, but she didn't know how. She wanted to hide, but she couldn't.
She started to cry. She wished Ben would stop. She wished Mommy would come. She wished grandpa was still here.
