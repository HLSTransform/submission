Once upon a time there was a soldier. Every morning he would wake up at the same time. He was always very busy! He had to practice marching and shouting instructions. He also had to keep his uniform clean and tidy.
Some days he also had to go on long marches with his fellow soldiers. He never got tired though, because he was a brave soldier.
One day he was even busier than usual. He had to practice shooting and get ready for a very important mission. He was so busy that he forgot the time!
But no matter how busy he was, the soldier always managed to wake up early and do all his jobs. He was a true hero!
