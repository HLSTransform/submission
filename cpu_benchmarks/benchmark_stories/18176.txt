Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved peanuts very much. One day, she found a big, heavy bag of peanuts. Lily was so happy!
Lily wanted to eat the peanuts, but she wanted to make them last. So, she decided to eat just a few peanuts each day. She noticed that the more she ate, the heavier the bag felt. This was strange and interesting.
As the days went by, Lily kept eating peanuts. The bag kept getting heavier, and the peanuts seemed to increase. She shared the peanuts with all her friends. They all enjoyed the never-ending, heavy bag of peanuts together. And they all lived happily ever after.
