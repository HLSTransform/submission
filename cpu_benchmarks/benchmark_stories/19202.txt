Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and his dog, Spot. One day, Timmy's mom noticed that the pipe under the sink was leaking. She tried to fix it, but it was too hard. 
Timmy's dad was at work, so his mom had to call a plumber. The plumber came and fixed the pipe, but he said it would cost a lot of money. Timmy's mom was sad because she didn't have enough money to pay the plumber. 
That night, Timmy's mom cried because she didn't know what to do. The next day, the landlord came and said that Timmy's family had to move out because they couldn't pay the rent. Timmy was sad because he didn't want to leave his home. 
Timmy's family moved to a new place, but it wasn't normal. It was small and dark, and they didn't have enough money to buy new toys for Timmy. Timmy cried because he missed his old home and his old toys. The end.
