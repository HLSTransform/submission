Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play in the snow. One day, they go to the park with Mom. They see a big hill. They want to slide down the hill.
"Look, Lily, a trunk!" Ben says. He points to a big brown thing in the snow. It is hard and long. It has a lock on it.
"What is in the trunk?" Lily asks. She is curious. She wants to open the trunk.
"Let's find out!" Ben says. He runs to the trunk. He tries to pull the lock. It is icy and stuck. He can't open it.
"Help me, Lily!" Ben says. He needs his sister.
Lily runs to the trunk. She helps Ben. They pull the lock together. It is hard, but they are strong. They hear a click. The lock opens.
They lift the lid of the trunk. They see many things inside. They see clothes, books, toys, and a teddy bear.
"Wow, look at all these things!" Lily says. She is happy. She picks up the teddy bear. It is soft and warm.
"Maybe someone left them here," Ben says. He is puzzled. He wonders who owns the trunk.
"Maybe they will come back," Lily says. She is hopeful. She wants to share the things with them.
"Or maybe they are a gift for us," Ben says. He is excited. He wants to keep the things.
They hear a voice behind them. It is Mom.
"Hey, kids, what are you doing?" Mom asks. She sees the trunk and the things. She is surprised.
"We found a trunk, Mom!" Lily and Ben say. They show Mom the things.
Mom smiles. She knows the trunk. It is hers. She left it here when she was a kid. She forgot about it.
"That's my trunk, kids," Mom says. She is happy. She remembers the things.
"Your trunk, Mom?" Lily and Ben ask. They are amazed.
"Yes, my trunk. I used to play with these things when I was your age. They are very special to me. But now, they are yours. You can have them," Mom says. She is generous. She loves her kids.
"Really, Mom? Thank you, Mom!" Lily and Ben say. They are grateful. They hug Mom.
They take the things out of the trunk. They play with them in the snow. They have fun. They are happy. They found a trunk. They found a treasure.
