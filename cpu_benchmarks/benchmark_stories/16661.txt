Once upon a time, there was a little fox. He had a pale fur and loved to play in the woods. One day, he met a big dog. The dog wanted to protect the woods from the fox. But the fox did not want to hurt the woods. He just wanted to play. 
The dog chased the fox away. The fox ran and ran until he was very tired. He found a nice place to rest, but he was still scared. Suddenly, a hunter came and shot the fox. The fox tried to run away, but he was too hurt. 
The fox felt sad and alone. He wished he had listened to the dog and stayed away from the woods. Now he knew that he should have been more careful.
