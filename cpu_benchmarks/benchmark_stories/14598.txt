Once upon a time there was a group of people. They were all very nice to each other and everyone liked them. They were very popular.
One day one of the members wanted to give something special to the group. They decided to give each other big squishy hugs. Everyone thought it was a great idea and the group gave lots of hugs to each other. 
Every day the group had fun and gave each other lots of hugs. Everyone was so happy when they were together. 
The group kept giving hugs and having fun for a long time. They stayed popular with everyone else because they always gave out lots of kindness and hugs.
