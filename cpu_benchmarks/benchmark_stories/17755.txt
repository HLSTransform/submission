Once upon a time there was a witch. She had a big bag that was very dirty.
She spread out all the things on the ground. Then the witch started to sort them into two piles.
One pile was made up of all the things that were nice. The other pile was made up of all the things that were not nice. The witch sorted for a very long time.
Finally, she put all the nice things back into her bag. She was very pleased with what she had done.
But then, something very funny happened. The bag began to move and shake. Then the witch saw that inside the bag there were lots of tiny puppies!
The witch was very happy and from then on she was the best friend of the puppies!
