Sam and Mia were at the beach with their mom and dad. They liked to play in the sand and look for shells and crabs. They also liked to watch the boats and the waves.
One day, they saw a big boat with a lot of boxes on it. They wondered what was inside the boxes. They asked their dad, "What is the boat doing?"
Dad said, "The boat is loading the boxes. That means it is putting them on the boat. The boxes have things that people need or want in other places."
Sam and Mia nodded. They wanted to see more. They walked closer to the boat with their dad. Mom stayed on the sand with their towels and snacks.
As they got closer, they saw something incredible. One of the boxes was moving and making noises. They heard a splash and saw a big octopus come out of the box. The octopus had eight long arms and a round head. It was purple and slimy. It looked angry and scared.
The octopus saw Sam and Mia and their dad. It waved its arms at them and made a loud sound. Sam and Mia were surprised and a little scared. They hid behind their dad.
Dad said, "Don't worry, kids. The octopus is not going to hurt us. It just wants to go back to the water. It must have been in the wrong box. Let's help it."
Dad picked up a big stick and gently pushed the octopus towards the water. The octopus slid along the sand and reached the edge of the water. It thanked dad with a soft sound and swam away.
Sam and Mia clapped and cheered. They had never seen an octopus before. They thought it was incredible. They hugged their dad and said, "You are the best, dad. You helped the octopus."
Dad smiled and said, "You are the best, too, kids. You were brave and kind. Now let's go back to mom and tell her what we saw."
