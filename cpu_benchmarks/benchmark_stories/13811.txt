Tommy had a bad fall from his bike and hurt his arm. Mommy took him to the hospital to see the doctor. Tommy was scared and in pain. He did not like the hospital. It was big and noisy and smelled funny.
The doctor was nice and gentle. He looked at Tommy's arm and said he needed an x-ray. An x-ray was a special picture that showed the bones inside the arm. The doctor said it would not hurt, but Tommy had to stay very still. Mommy held Tommy's hand and told him it would be over soon.
But there was a problem. The x-ray machine was broken. The doctor said they had to wait for another one. Tommy and Mommy had to sit in a small room with other people who were also waiting. Tommy was bored and hungry and tired. He wanted to go home. He started to cry and whine.
Mommy tried to calm him down. She gave him a snack and a book and a hug. She said they had to be patient and that the doctor was doing his best. She said the x-ray was important to see if Tommy's arm was broken or not.
But Tommy was not happy. He was grumpy and angry. He threw the snack and the book on the floor. He shouted at Mommy and the doctor. He said he did not want the x-ray. He said he hated the hospital. He said he wanted to leave.
Mommy was sad and frustrated. She did not know what to do. She wished the x-ray machine would work. She wished Tommy would stop crying. She wished they could go home. She wished Tommy would be brave and kind. She wished Tommy would understand.
