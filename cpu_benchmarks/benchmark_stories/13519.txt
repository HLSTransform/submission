Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside in the wild forest near his house. One day, while he was playing, he saw a squirrel. 
"Hello, Mr. Squirrel," said Timmy. 
"Hello, Timmy," said the squirrel. "What are you doing in the wild forest?" 
"I like to play here," said Timmy. "What are you doing?" 
"I am trying to gain some nuts for the winter," said the squirrel. "Do you want to help me?" 
Timmy nodded his head and the squirrel showed him how to pick up nuts with his thumb. They worked together and gained a lot of nuts. Timmy was happy to help his new friend.
