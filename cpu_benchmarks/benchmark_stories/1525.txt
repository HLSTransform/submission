Once there was a mommy and a daddy. They wanted to do something special. They decided to go to the airport. The airport was very big and loud. Mommy and Daddy got to the airport and saw lots of people, airplanes and luggage. Mommy and Daddy were so happy!
They got a healthy snack to eat. They had apple slices and oranges. Mommy and Daddy felt so good, they laughed and smiled. They watched the airplanes take off and felt the wind below their feet.
Mommy and Daddy did something special on the airport day. They had a fun time and felt very healthy. They hugged each other and flew away.
