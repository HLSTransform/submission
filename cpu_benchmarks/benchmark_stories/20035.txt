Lily and Sam were playing near the pond. They liked to look at the fish and the frogs. But they did not know that an alligator lived in the pond. The alligator was hungry and saw the children. He swam very fast and jumped out of the water.
"Look out!" Lily shouted. She pushed Sam away from the alligator. But the alligator bit her leg. It hurt a lot. Lily cried and screamed.
Sam ran to get help. He saw a man with a big stick. He told him about the alligator and Lily. The man followed Sam to the pond. He hit the alligator with the stick. The alligator let go of Lily and ran away.
The man picked up Lily and carried her to his car. He drove her to the hospital. Sam went with them. He held Lily's hand and said, "You are very brave. You saved me from the alligator. Thank you, Lily."
Lily smiled and said, "You are welcome, Sam. You are my best friend. Thank you for getting help." They hugged each other. The man smiled and said, "You are both very good children. I am glad you are okay." He gave them some candy and a toy. They thanked him and ate the candy. They felt better. They hoped they would never see the alligator again.
