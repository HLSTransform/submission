Once upon a time, there was a black bird. She was very independent and liked to do things on her own. Every day, she would fly around and explore the forest.
One day, when she was flying around, she noticed some berries that were on a bush. She liked to eat berries, so she flew down to get one. But when she tried to reach the berry, it was too high for her to reach. 
The black bird thought for a few moments about what she could do. Then she had an idea. She flapped her wings and flew up higher. Then, she used her beak to grab the berry and she flew away. 
The black bird was very proud of herself for using her brain and thinking independently. From that day on, she never stopped using her own ideas to accomplish things.
