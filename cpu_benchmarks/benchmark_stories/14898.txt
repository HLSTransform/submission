Once upon a time there lived a nosy woodpecker called Jack. Jack loved to watch birds build nests and fly around, but Jack was also nosy and he couldn't help peeking into other creature's homes.
One day Jack saw a saw lying on the ground next to a hedge. Jack flew to the saw and asked, "What are you doing here all alone?".
Snap! The saw jumped and answered, "Oh, I was just taking a nap in the sun!". Jack was surprised and said, "Taking a nap in the sun? That sounds like fun!". The saw smiled and said, "You should try it too!".
So Jack took a nap next to the saw in the sun. As Jack was sleeping, the saw started to snore. Jack got so annoyed that he said loudly, "No more snoring! I'm trying to sleep!". The saw was so scared and immediately stopped snoring.
Jack was happy and fell asleep again. But he was still nosy and kept peeking at any creature who passed by. In the end, Jack was the most nosy woodpecker in the wood!
