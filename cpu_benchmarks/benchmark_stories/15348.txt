Once upon a time there was an uncle who was very patient. His patience was tested when he looked after his three year old nephew. His nephew was full of energy and would not sit still!
The uncle didn't want to be too strict, so instead he would show his nephew more fun ways to stay busy. One way was to play a game. The rules were simple, if the uncle caught the nephew he had to surrender.
The game was so much fun! The more the uncle played, the more patient he became. It wasn't long before he was able to catch his nephew without any trouble. The nephew was disappointed, but he accepted the uncle's victory with a smile.
Suddenly the uncle had a wonderful idea. Instead of catching him, he decided to let the nephew win every once and a while. This way the nephew could experience the thrill of winning, and the uncle could continue to practice his patience. 
The nephew was so excited and the uncle was so proud. They had both learned something new about the other, and it only made the bond between them stronger.
