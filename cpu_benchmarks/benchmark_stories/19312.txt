Once upon a time, there were two friends who loved to play together. One day, they decided to make a surprise. They went to the store to get some paint. They were very excited to do something special.
Once they got back home, they put the paint into a bowl and began to mix it. As they pushed the paint around with their hands, it began to swirl and change colour. The mixture smelled like a rainbow.
When the paint was ready, the friends went outside and decided to paint the old wall in their garden. It was so peaceful outside that the friends felt like they had time for the whole world. As they pushed the paintbrush up and down, the wall began to transform. Soon, the old wall was covered in beautiful rainbow colours.
The two friends looked upon their work and saw that it was good. They laughed and smiled and hugged each other, knowing that together, they had created something special.
The end.
