Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his hose in the backyard. One day, Timmy's mom told him that he couldn't play with the hose because it was too hot outside. Timmy was sad and asked, "Why can't I play with my hose, mom?" 
His mom replied, "Because it's too hot outside and the water is too cold. It's not good for your body." 
Timmy was upset but he understood that his mom didn't allow him to play with the hose because she cared about him. Later that day, Timmy's mom made some spicy soup for dinner. Timmy didn't like spicy food and said, "Mom, I don't want to eat this soup. It's too spicy!" 
His mom replied, "I know you don't like spicy food, but it's good for your body. It helps you stay healthy." 
Timmy realized that just like how his mom didn't allow him to play with the hose because it wasn't good for his body, she also made him eat spicy food because it was good for his body. He learned that sometimes things that we don't like can be good for us.
