Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a nice eraser that she loved to use for drawing. One day, Lily's friend Timmy came over to play. Timmy saw Lily's eraser and said, "That's a nice eraser, can I use it?" Lily said, "Sure, but please don't break it."
Timmy started drawing with the eraser, but then he accidentally dropped it. The eraser fell on the floor and broke into two pieces. Lily was sad and said, "Oh no, my eraser is broken. How can we fix it?" Timmy had an idea and said, "Let's tie the two pieces together with a string!"
So, they found a piece of string and tied the eraser together. It wasn't perfect, but it worked. Lily was happy and said, "Thank you, Timmy. You're a good friend." Timmy smiled and said, "No problem, I'm glad I could help." From that day on, Lily and Timmy played together and shared their toys nicely.
