Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run on the grass. But their favorite thing was to splash in the pond with the ducks. The ducks were white and healthy and made funny noises.
One day, Lily and Tom went to the pond with some bread to feed the ducks. They threw some bread in the water and watched the ducks swim and eat. Then they took off their shoes and socks and ran to the edge of the pond. They dipped their toes in the water and giggled. They started to splash each other and the ducks with their hands.
"Stop it, stop it!" a voice shouted. It was Mr. Brown, the park keeper. He was angry and had a big stick. "You are making the pond dirty and scaring the ducks. Go away or I will tell your parents!"
Lily and Tom were scared and ran away from the pond. They put on their shoes and socks and looked for a place to hide. They saw a big tree with a hole in it. They ran to the tree and crawled inside the hole. They hoped Mr. Brown would not find them.
But they did not know that the tree was home to a family of squirrels. The squirrels were not happy to see two children in their hole. They started to chatter and squeak and scratch. Lily and Tom felt something furry and sharp on their legs and arms. They screamed and ran out of the hole.
They saw Mr. Brown waiting for them with his stick. He looked even angrier than before. He grabbed their hands and dragged them to the park gate. He said he would call their parents and tell them what they had done.
Lily and Tom wished they had not splashed in the pond. They wished they had been nice to the ducks and the squirrels. They learned their lesson and never did it again.
