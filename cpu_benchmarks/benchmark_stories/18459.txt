Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited for her first day of school. She woke up early, brushed her teeth, and put on her new dress. Her mommy packed her a lunchbox and they walked to the classroom together.
When they got there, Lily saw all the other kids playing with toys. She wanted to play too, but she didn't have any toys. She felt jealous of the other kids. Then, her teacher came over and said, "Hello, Lily! Would you like to unpack your backpack and put your things in your cubby?"
Lily nodded and opened her backpack. She took out her pencil case and her notebook and put them in her cubby. She felt happy to have her own space in the classroom. Later, she made friends with the other kids and they shared their toys with her. She went home that day with a big smile on her face, excited for the next day of school.
