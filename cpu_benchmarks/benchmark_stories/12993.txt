Once there was a little girl named Bella who loved to dance. Every day she would dance around the living room. She even taught her stuffed animals how to dance.
One day it was raining outside, so Bella decided to stay inside and build with blocks. She quickly made a tall tower and it made her so happy. She danced around the tower and sang songs.
When Bella was done playing, her mom came in to see her tower. She smiled and said, "You worked so hard building this! You must be so happy!"
Bella smiled and began to dance around the tower. She danced and laughed until the sun came out again, and then she went back to dancing in the living room. Bella loved to dance and it always made her feel so happy!
