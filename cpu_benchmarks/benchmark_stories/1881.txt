One day, John wanted to go and see some dolphins. He was very enthusiastic, so he got dressed quickly and ran to the beach. He saw a family of dolphins that were so friendly. They were playing in the water, swimming around and jumping up and down. 
John waved to them from the beach and they waved their fins back. He clapped his hands and the dolphins swam around him. He was so young, but so enthusiastic about the dolphins. 
Then, it was time for the dolphins to go home. They said goodbye to John and he waved and said goodbye too. John was sad, but he stayed and watched them until they were out of sight. 
John was so happy to see the dolphins and he was already planning his next trip to the beach. He couldn't wait to see them again.
