Once upon a time, there was a cute little bunny. The bunny had a box that was filled with carrots. One day, the bunny was hopping around when something strange happened. The bunny accidentally knocked the box over and all the carrots fell out! The bunny was sad because it lost all its carrots. But then, some kind friends helped the bunny pick up the carrots and put them back in the box. The bunny was happy again and shared the carrots with its friends. The end.
