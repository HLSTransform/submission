Kayla was playing in the garden when she noticed something very unusual. A rake had vanished right before her eyes! She looked all around, but it was nowhere to be seen. Then she heard a noise coming from a bush nearby. Curiosity took hold as she crept closer. There it was, the rake just lying there in the bush! She was amazed and reached out to grab it, eager to learn how it had vanished. Just as she touched the rake, a big gust of wind blew it away, and it disappeared. Kayla looked up in wonder and shook her head. What an unusual day!
