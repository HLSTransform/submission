John was running very fast in the garden. He was wearing his favorite red jacket and felt very happy. His little brother Timmy was watching him and clapping his hands.
John stopped running, panting and out of breath. 
"Wow, John! You were running really fast!" Timmy said, impressed.
John smiled. "Yeah, I was going really fast. Look at my jacket, it's so attractive, isn't it?"
Timmy nodded his head. "It is! Can I try your jacket, John?"
John nodded. Timmy put on the red jacket and started running, pretending to be as fast as his older brother. John laughed and waved goodbye as Timmy sped away.
