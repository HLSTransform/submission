Once upon a time, there was a little puppy who loved to lie in the sun. But, one day the puppy heard something dangerous. He heard a loud growl and started to tremble in fear. He wanted to run and hide, but he knew his place was outside in the sun.
Suddenly, the puppy heard a meow. He opened his eyes to find a friendly cat looking at him. “What’s the matter?” asked the cat. “I heard something dangerous growling nearby,” the puppy replied. “That was just a warning. Don’t be afraid. Everything will be alright,” said the cat. 
The puppy thought about what the cat said and took a deep breath. He looked around and realized that the dangerous growl came from his own reflection in a nearby pond. He had been so scared by the sound that he almost ran away!
The moral of this story is that sometimes it's easy to get scared by something that isn't really there. Don't be so quick to lie and run away. Face what you're afraid of. It might not be as dangerous as you think!
