Once upon a time, there was a smart little girl named Lily. She loved going to the mall with her mommy. One day, they went to the mall and bought some yummy treats. Lily's mommy spread some peanut butter on her bread and gave it to her. Lily loved it so much that she wanted more. 
After eating all the treats, they went to a store and saw a big teddy bear. Lily wanted it so badly, but it was too expensive. Her mommy told her that they could save money and come back to buy it next time. Lily was sad, but she understood. 
On their way home, they saw a bird spreading its wings and flying in the sky. Lily was amazed and wanted to fly like a bird too. Her mommy told her that she could spread her arms and pretend to fly. Lily was happy and did just that. They both laughed and had a great day at the mall.
