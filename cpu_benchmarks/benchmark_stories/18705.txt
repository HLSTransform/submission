Once upon a time, there was a group of animals who lived in the forest. There was a rabbit, a squirrel, and a bird. They were all friends and loved to play together.
One day, they decided to have a picnic. They gathered some food and went to a field. But when they got there, they saw that the field was filthy. There was trash everywhere!
The rabbit said, "This is yucky! We can't have a picnic here." The squirrel said, "Maybe we can clean it up." The bird said, "That's a good idea! We can learn to work together and make the field clean." So, they worked together and cleaned up the field. And they had a great picnic together!
