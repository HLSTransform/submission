Once there was a little girl who wanted an apple. She found a big red apple in the garden, and she was so excited. She picked the apple off the tree and took a bite. The apple was very bitter! The little girl was not happy.
Suddenly, a magical fairy appeared! She was a very tiny fairy with wings. She flew over to the little girl and the apple tree. She waved her wand and the apple changed. The bitter taste was gone and it was sweet and delicious.
The little girl was so excited. She thanked the fairy and took another bite. The sweet apple was so good! The little girl smiled as the fairy flew away. She ate the apple and enjoyed every bite.
