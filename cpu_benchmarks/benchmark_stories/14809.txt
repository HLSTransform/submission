Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play with toys and books. One day, they find a weird toy in the park. It is a big box with buttons and a screen. Lily and Tom are curious. They press the buttons and see what happens.
"Look, Tom, the screen has words!" Lily says. "What do they say?"
Tom tries to read the words. He knows some letters, but not all. He says, "It says...message...from...space. What is space?"
Lily shrugs. She does not know what space is. She thinks it is a place far away. She says, "Maybe it is where the stars are. Do you think someone from the stars sent us a message?"
Tom nods. He thinks that is cool. He says, "Maybe they want to be our friends. Maybe they have toys and books too."
Lily and Tom smile. They press another button. The screen changes. It shows a picture of a green face with big eyes and a funny mouth. The face says, "Hello, earth kids. We are from space. We want to play with you. Can you clap your hands?"
Lily and Tom are surprised. They see the face and hear the voice. They think it is a joke. They look around, but they do not see anyone. They wonder who is hiding and making the voice.
They decide to play along. They clap their hands. The face on the screen claps too. It says, "Good, good. You are smart and fun. We like you. Do you want to see more of us?"
Lily and Tom are curious. They want to see more of the space friends. They nod and say, "Yes, yes. Show us more."
The face on the screen smiles. It says, "OK, OK. We will show you more. But first, you have to do something for us. You have to give us your toys and books. We need them for our space mission. Can you do that?"
Lily and Tom are confused. They do not understand why the space friends need their toys and books. They like their toys and books. They do not want to give them away. They shake their heads and say, "No, no. We cannot do that. We need our toys and books too. They are ours."
The face on the screen frowns. It says, "No, no. You have to do that. We are your space friends. You have to listen to us. We will not show you more if you do not give us your toys and books. We will be angry. We will go away. Do you want that?"
Lily and Tom are scared. They do not want the space friends to be angry. They do not want them to go away. They do not know what to do. They look at each other. They do not like this game anymore. They think it is weird and mean. They want to stop.
They say, "No, no. We do not want that. But we do not want to give you our toys and books either. We do not think you are our space friends. We think you are bad. We do not want to play with you. We want to go home."
They turn off the box. They grab their toys and books. They run away from the park. They do not look back. They do not see the face on the screen change. It is not a green face anymore. It is a red face. It is angry. It says, "Bad, bad. You are not smart and fun. You are silly and rude. We do not like you. We will find other earth kids to play with. We will get their toys and books. We will not stop. We are from space. We are clever and strong. You will see."
