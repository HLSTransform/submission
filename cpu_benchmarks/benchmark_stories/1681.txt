Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she went on an adventure with her friend Timmy.
As they walked through the forest, they noticed a colorful butterfly fluttering by. "Look, Timmy! A pretty butterfly!" exclaimed Lily.
Suddenly, they saw smoke coming from a nearby mountain. "What's that?" asked Timmy. "It's a volcano, Timmy," replied Lily. "It's where hot lava comes out."
As they got closer, they saw the volcano erupting with bright red lava. "Wow, it's so hot!" said Timmy. "And so colorful!" added Lily.
After their exciting adventure, they went back home and told their parents all about it. They couldn't wait to go on another adventure and see what other amazing things they could discover.
