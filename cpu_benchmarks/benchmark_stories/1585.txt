Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to take baths in her bathtub. One day, while she was playing with her toys, she accidentally turned the faucet too much and water started to overflow. 
Lily's mom heard the noise and came to see what happened. "Oh no, Lily! You made a mess," she said. "Don't worry, mommy. I'll wipe it," replied Lily. She grabbed a towel and wiped the water from the floor. 
"Wow, Lily! You're so impressive. You cleaned it all up by yourself," said her mom, proud of her daughter. "Thank you, mommy," said Lily with a big smile on her face. From that day on, Lily was more careful when she turned on the faucet during her bath time.
