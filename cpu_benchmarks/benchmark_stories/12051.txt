Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and get dirty. He would come home with mud all over his clothes and shoes. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Timmy, you need to wash up before dinner."
Timmy went to the bathroom to wash his hands and face. He looked in the mirror and saw how dirty he was. He thought to himself, "I need to wash my whole body!" So, he took a long bath and scrubbed himself clean.
The next day, Timmy and his dad were in the garage. His dad was fixing the car and Timmy was playing with his toys. Suddenly, his dad said, "Timmy, can you go get me the weak wrench?" Timmy didn't know what a weak wrench was, but he went to look for it anyway. He found a rusty old wrench and brought it to his dad. His dad said, "No, that's not the right one. The weak wrench is over there." Timmy saw the shiny new wrench and brought it to his dad. His dad said, "Good job, Timmy! You found the right one."
