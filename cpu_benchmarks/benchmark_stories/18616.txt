Once upon a time, there was a happy dog named Max. Max loved to play with his ball all day long. One day, Max's owner gave him a big meal. Max ate all his food and felt very full. After his meal, Max went outside to play. He ran in the grass and felt very playful. Suddenly, Max saw a butterfly and tried to catch it. He jumped up high and then he sprang into the air. Max had so much fun playing outside! The end.
