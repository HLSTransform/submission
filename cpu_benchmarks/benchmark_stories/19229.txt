Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He had a thing that he loved very much, a toy truck. One day, Timmy decided to invite his friend Billy over to play with his toy truck. Billy was very happy to come over and play.
Timmy and Billy played with the toy truck for a while, but then Billy saw a fierce dog outside. Billy was scared and wanted to go home. Timmy tried to calm him down, but Billy was too scared. Timmy's mom came in and saw the dog too. She told the boys to stay inside and she called the dog catcher.
The dog catcher came and caught the fierce dog, but Timmy was sad because Billy was too scared to play with him anymore. Timmy learned that sometimes inviting friends over can be scary, but he still loved his toy truck.
