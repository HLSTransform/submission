Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a big crane. The crane was very sleepy. It had a long neck and could reach very high.
One day, the people in the town wanted to decorate a tall tree. They put pretty things on the tree, like shiny balls and bright lights. But they could not reach the top of the tree.
They asked the sleepy crane for help. The crane was happy to help. It stretched its long neck up, up, up to the top of the tree. The people put the pretty things on the crane, and the crane put them on the tree.
The tree looked very pretty when it was all done. The people were so happy, and they said "thank you" to the sleepy crane. The crane felt good for helping and could now go to sleep. Everyone in the town had a great time, and they all lived happily ever after.
