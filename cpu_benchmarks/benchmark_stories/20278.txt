Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very impatient. He always wanted to know what was going on. One day, Tim's big sister told him that she had a secret. Tim was very excited and wanted to know the secret right away.
Tim's sister said, "You must wait until after dinner to come with me and see the secret." Tim tried to wait, but he was so impatient. He asked his sister many times if it was time to go see the secret. She kept saying, "Not yet, Tim. You must wait."
Finally, after dinner, Tim's sister said, "Now you can come with me to see the secret." Tim jumped up and followed his sister to the backyard. There, in the grass, was a big box with a bow on it. Tim's sister said, "Surprise! The secret is a new bike for you!" Tim was so happy that he had waited for the secret. He knew that good things come to those who wait.
