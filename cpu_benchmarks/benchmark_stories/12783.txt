Tommy loved to go out in the garden. He had his favourite spot where he would pull up chunks of soil and watch as they broke up into smaller pieces. Today, Tommy was in for a special surprise. As he pulled up a piece of soil, he spotted something shining in the dirt. He reached in and pulled out a purple, shiny stone. Tommy had never seen such a beautiful thing before! He looked inside and saw the stone seemed to have a little sparkle inside. He ran inside to show his parents what he had found. They told him it must be a piece of amethyst and that it was very special. Tommy felt so proud of his special find! He kept it in his pocket and carried it around with him everywhere. He taught himself to say “amethyst” and used the word to show off to his friends. From that day, Tommy’s love of gardening grew even bigger and he would spend hours outside pulling up chunks of soil. He always had an extra special look out for any more purple treasures.
