One day, little Robin noticed something fast in the sky. She squinted her eyes and saw a bear appear from the clouds. "Wow, a bear!" she said. The bear was getting closer and closer to the ground, so Robin took off running for the woods. 
When she got to the edge of the woods, Robin looked up and saw the bear again. This time, the bear was standing right in front of her. "Oh no!" said Robin. But then the bear smiled and said, "Hi, little one. Don't be scared. I just wanted to take you on a special adventure."
Robin hesitated, but then smiled when she remembered her favorite adventure stories. "Yes, please!" she said. So, the bear and Robin took off into the woods.
Robin had the best day she ever had. The bear showed her secret hideaways, special trees, and plenty of places to explore. As they arrived at a beautiful meadow, the bear stopped and made a special request. 
He asked Robin to close her eyes, and when she opened them, there were five beautiful deer surrounding her! Robin gasped with delight as the deer ran off into the woods. It was the most magical adventure ever! 
Robin thanked the bear for the day and the adventure he shared with her. The bear smiled once more and said, "You're welcome, my friend. Let's go on more adventures soon
