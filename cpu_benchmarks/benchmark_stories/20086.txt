Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a lemon tree in her yard that had big, yellow lemons. One day, Lily picked a lemon and squeezed it to make lemonade. It was warm outside, so she wanted a cold drink. She went inside to get ice, but when she came back, her little brother had locked the door! 
Lily knocked and knocked, but her brother didn't hear her. She was stuck outside with her warm lemonade and no way to get back inside. She tried to find another way in, but all the windows were locked too. Finally, she remembered that her brother always kept a spare key under a rock. She found the key, unlocked the door, and enjoyed her cold lemonade inside.
