Lily liked to organize her toys. She had a box for dolls, a box for cars, a box for blocks and a box for books. She put each toy in the right box and made them look neat.
One day, her brother Max came to play with her. He did not like to organize. He took out all the toys and mixed them up. He threw the dolls on the floor, the cars on the bed, the blocks on the table and the books on the chair. He made a big mess.
Lily was very mad. She told Max to stop and put the toys back. But Max did not listen. He laughed and said he liked to make messes. He ran around the room and knocked over more toys.
Lily felt like crying. She did not know how to fix the mess. She wanted her toys to be organized. She looked at Max with a sad face.
Max saw Lily's face and felt sorry. He realized he was not being nice. He stopped running and said he was sorry. He helped Lily pick up the toys and put them in the right boxes. He said he would not make messes again.
Lily smiled and thanked Max. She gave him a hug and said it was fine. She asked him if he wanted to play with her. He said yes and they played with the toys together. They had fun and shared the toys. Lily was happy and Max was happy. They learned to be kind and organize.
