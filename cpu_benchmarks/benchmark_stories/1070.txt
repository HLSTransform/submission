Once there was a family who liked to go on tours. They were a very rich family, so they could afford to go wherever they wanted. One day, the parents told their children about a special tour they had planned for the weekend.
The children were very excited, but they started to complain because they wanted to bring their toys along with them. The parents said no, and the children kept whining and moaning about it.
The family finally went on their tour and had a great time. They visited many places, ate delicious food, and made lots of new friends.
The children finally stopped complaining and enjoyed the tour. They learned that complaining only spoiled the fun of the tour, and they never made the same mistake again.
