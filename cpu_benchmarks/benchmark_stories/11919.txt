Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with dolls. She had a favorite doll that she spent all her time with. One day, on a Wednesday, Lily's mom took her to the store to buy a new dress for her doll. Lily was so excited and couldn't wait to spend the day with her doll.
At the store, Lily saw a fake doll that looked just like her favorite doll. She begged her mom to buy it for her, but her mom said no. Lily was very upset and started to cry. Her mom tried to explain to her that the fake doll wasn't as good as her favorite doll, but Lily didn't listen.
Later that day, Lily went to play with her dolls. She picked up the fake doll and started to play with it. But something wasn't right. The fake doll didn't feel the same as her favorite doll. Lily realized that her mom was right and that the fake doll wasn't as good.
Lily was sad that she wasted her money on the fake doll and wished she had listened to her mom. She learned that sometimes it's better to spend time with what you already have instead of trying to find something new.
