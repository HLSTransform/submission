Once upon a time, there was a chubby cat named Mittens. Mittens loved to play with yarn and eat fish. One day, Mittens found a case in the backyard. She didn't know what was inside, but she wanted to see. 
As she was about to open the case, a dog named Max came over. Max wanted to fight Mittens for the case. Mittens didn't want to fight, but she didn't want to give up the case either. 
They started to fight and Mittens scratched Max. Max ran away and Mittens was happy she won the case. She opened it up and found a toy mouse inside. She played with the toy mouse all day and forgot about the fight with Max. From that day on, Mittens was known as the champion of the backyard.
