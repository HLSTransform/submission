Once upon a time, there was a little town. The people in the town were happy and had lots of yummy food to eat. But one day, a big storm came and broke many things in the town. The houses were broken and the roads were not good anymore. The people were sad because they didn't know how to repair everything.
Then, a little girl came to the town. She saw that everything was broken and she wanted to help. She asked the people if she could repair the houses and the roads. The people were happy and let her do it. She worked hard every day and repaired everything in the town. The people were happy again and thanked the little girl for her help. They gave her lots of yummy food to eat as a reward. The end.
