Once there was a boy called George. He was only three years old. He wanted to go on an adventure. But he needed something very special to do it.
George's mom helped him get his passport. George was so excited. He clapped with joy.
Then he said goodbye to his mom and set off on his adventure. He went on a plane and saw lots of different places around the world.
But there were some people who were very selfish. They didn't want to share the nice things they had. This made George sad.
But then he remembered his passport and knew that whatever happened he could always go back home. So, he cheered up and clapped again with happiness.
