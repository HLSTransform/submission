Mum was explaining to her little daughter, who was three years old, all about a clown. The daughter had never seen a clown before and was very curious. Mum explained that clowns are usually dressed in brightly coloured clothes and paint their faces like a mask.
The daughter was excited so Mum took her to the park where there was an unusual clown. It was wearing white clothes and the face was painted a plain colour. It looked different to the pictures Mum had shown her.
At first the daughter was scared but Mum explained that the clown is a friendly person who likes to play with children. She also explained that clowns often dress different to surprise people.
The daughter was soon laughing and running around with the clown. She even tried to copy the clown's funny movements. The daughter had a great time learning about clowns and she never forgot the unusual clown she had met.
