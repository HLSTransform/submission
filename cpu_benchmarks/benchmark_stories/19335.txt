Once upon a time there was a bridge. The bridge was very long and it crossed over a deep, wide river. The bridge was very reliable, so people knew that it was safe to use.
One day, a boy wanted to cross the bridge. He was only three years old, so he was scared to try. He took a deep breath and slowly stepped onto the bridge. He held tight to the ropes as he walked, but he still felt scared.
At the end of the bridge, the boy saw his mom waiting. She cheered and clapped for him. He was so relieved that he had made it across the bridge all by himself. He had been brave, and he had tried really hard. 
The bridge was reliable, and it had helped the boy cross the river. That made him feel really happy.
