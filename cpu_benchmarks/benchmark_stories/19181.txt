One day, a chubby crab named Carl went for a walk by the sea. He liked the feel of the sand on his feet. He saw the tide go in and out. Carl thought it was fun to watch.
"Hi, Carl!" said a little fish named Finn. "Do you want to play with me?"
"Yes, I do!" said Carl. They played in the water and laughed a lot.
As the sun began to set, Carl knew it was time to end their play. He said to Finn, "I have to go home now. But we can play again tomorrow!"
Finn smiled and said, "I can't wait! See you tomorrow, Carl!"
Carl went home feeling happy. He couldn't wait for the next day to play with his new friend again.
