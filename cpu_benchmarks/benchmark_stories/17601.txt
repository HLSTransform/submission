Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the park with his friends. One day, Timmy's friend Johnny fell off the swing and hurt his body. Timmy knew he had to save Johnny so he ran to get help.
Timmy found a grown-up and told them about Johnny's hurt body. The grown-up quickly came to the park to help. They were very kind and gentle, not harsh at all. They helped Johnny feel better and took him to the hospital.
Timmy was happy that he was able to save his friend and make sure he got the help he needed. He learned that it's important to always help others, especially when they're hurt.
