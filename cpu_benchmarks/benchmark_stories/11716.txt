Once upon a time there were two friends, a little boy and a sailor. Every day, the boy and the sailor would go on fun adventures together.
One day, the sailor had to leave town and, with a sad wave, he said goodbye to the little boy.
The little boy felt very sad and he began to weep. He felt so embarrassed that the sailor could see him, so he ran away.
The next day, the little boy was walking around town and he saw something amazing. It was the sailor, waving to him from a boat.
The little boy was so happy and excited that he stopped weeping. The sailor had come back, just like he said he would and they continued to go on adventures together.
