Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to run and jump and laugh. They saw a big hedge near the fence. It was green and thick and hairy.
"Let's enter the hedge and see what is inside," said Tom. He was brave and curious.
"OK, but be careful," said Lily. She was a little scared but followed Tom.
They pushed the leaves and branches and entered the hedge. It was dark and cool and quiet. They heard some noises and saw some eyes.
"Hello, who are you?" said a voice. It was a hedgehog. He was small and spiky and friendly.
"We are Tom and Lily. We are playing in the garden. Who are you?" said Tom.
"I am Harry. I live in the hedge. Do you want to play with me?" said the hedgehog.
"Yes, please. What do you like to play?" said Lily.
"I like to roll and dig and eat worms. Do you?" said the hedgehog.
Tom and Lily looked at each other. They did not like to roll and dig and eat worms. They liked to run and jump and laugh.
"Thank you, Harry, but we have to go now. Maybe we can play another day," said Tom.
"OK, bye, Tom and Lily. Come back soon," said the hedgehog.
Tom and Lily left the hedge and ran back to the garden. They were happy and surprised. They had met a new friend.
