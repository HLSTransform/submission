Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the store with her mom to buy some candy. Lily saw a big bag of sour candy and she wanted it so badly, but her mom said no. Lily was sad and angry, but she listened to her mom and they left the store.
On their way home, they saw a lost puppy. Lily wanted to pet the puppy, but the puppy was scared and wouldn't come close. Lily knew what to do. She took out some treats from her pocket and offered them to the puppy. The puppy followed Lily and her mom home.
Lily's mom was happy to see the puppy safe and sound. She praised Lily for being kind and helpful. Lily felt proud and happy that she could lead the puppy to safety. She learned that doing good things can make you feel good inside, even if you don't get what you want at the store.
