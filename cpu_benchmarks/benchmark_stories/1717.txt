Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to eat celery. She would eat celery every day for lunch and snack time. One day, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to help prepare dinner. Lily was so excited and said, "Yes, mommy! What can I do?"
Her mom gave her a big bowl of celery and asked her to wash it. Lily was very persistent and made sure every piece of celery was clean. "Good job, Lily!" her mom said. "Now we can chop it up and put it in the salad."
Lily was so proud of herself for helping prepare dinner. When they sat down to eat, Lily took a big bite of the salad and said, "Mmm, this is so yummy! I love celery!" Her mom smiled and said, "I'm so glad you helped me prepare the celery. It tastes even better when we make it together."
