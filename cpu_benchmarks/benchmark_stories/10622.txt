One day, a little girl named Becky decided to take a walk around the park. As she walked, she looked up at the sky, but it was a little too cloudy. She let out a big sigh.
Becky was feeling a little sick and she was worried. She had a thermometer with her so she could take her temperature. Sure enough, the thermometer showed that her temperature was mild.
Although the thermometer made her feel a little better, Becky was still worried. She needed to find something to make her better!
Suddenly, Becky saw a big bush filled with some kind of berry. She put a few of them in a bag and took them home.
Back home, Becky washed the berries and ate them. She felt much better!
The end.
