Once upon a time there was a little bunny called Bob. Bob was very alert and liked to go exploring. One day Bob was looking around in a grassy meadow and he spotted a bright white sheet flapping in the wind. Bob hopped over to investigate. "Oh wow!" he said, with a big smile on his face. He brushed the sheet with his paw and looked underneath. To his surprise, he found a big juicy carrot. "Yummy!" He exclaimed, hopping around with joy.
Bob wanted to thank whoever had left the carrot for him. So he called out, "Thank you, who ever you are! Thanks for the carrot!" But no one replied. Bob shrugged his furry little shoulders and then hopped away, still thanking whoever had left the treat for him. 
He hopped off with a hop, skip and a jump, feeling very grateful that he had found such a yummy snack. He waved a paw in the air and shouted,
"Thanks again!"
The end.
