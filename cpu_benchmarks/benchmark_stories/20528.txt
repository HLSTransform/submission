Mum and Dad had an exciting plan. They wanted to design a new thing. It was going to be very special. They chose the colour red to make it stand out.
Mum used lots of red fabric and sewed it together. Dad made a really strong frame out of wood. They worked late into the night until it was finished.
In the morning, Mum and Dad were so excited to show me their new thing. It was tall and wide with a shapely top. It was bright red and had pretty decorations. I was so amazed!
Mum and Dad had designed a beautiful red chair for me. I squealed with delight as I hugged them and spun around in it. It was the best thing ever!
