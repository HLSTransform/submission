It was a bright and sunny day. Mommy and Johnnie were in the yard.
"Johnnie," said Mommy, "let's go for a drive in the vehicle." 
Johnnie was so excited! He loved the vehicle. 
Mommy started the vehicle and began to drive. They drove past lots of houses and trees. Then, they approached a tall bridge.
Johnnie was curious how the vehicle would make it across the bridge. "That's hard," said Johnnie.
"Don't worry, Johnnie," said Mommy. "Our vehicle is very smart."
And sure enough, the vehicle drove across the bridge with ease. Johnnie was so proud of the vehicle. He couldn't believe it was so smart!
