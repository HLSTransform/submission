Once upon a time, there was a pretty child named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, she went to the park and met a new friend named Timmy.
"Hi Timmy, do you want to play with me?" asked Lily.
"Yes, I do!" replied Timmy.
They played together for a while and then sat down on a bench to rest. Lily looked at Timmy and said, "You are a nice friend. Let's discuss what we can play next."
Timmy smiled and said, "Okay, let's play hide and seek!" They had so much fun playing together that day and became the best of friends. From that day on, they would always meet at the park to play and discuss what games to play next.
