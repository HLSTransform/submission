Ben and Mia love to watch fireworks on New Year's Eve. They wait for the dark night and the loud bangs and the bright colors in the sky. They wear warm hats and gloves and coats, because it is very icy outside.
Before they go out, they help their dad polish the car. They use a soft cloth and a shiny spray. They rub and rub until the car looks new. They are very proud of their work. Their dad says they are good helpers.
They get in the car and drive to the park. They see many people and cars and lights. They hear music and laughter and horns. They find a good spot to see the fireworks. They get out of the car and hold their dad's hand.
They look up at the sky and wait. They count down from ten to one. Then they see the first firework. It is red and gold and makes a big star. They clap and cheer. Then they see more fireworks. They are blue and green and purple and pink. They make circles and hearts and flowers. They ooh and aah. They feel happy and excited.
They watch the fireworks for a long time. They hug their dad and wish him a happy new year. They get back in the car and drive home. They are tired and sleepy. They dream of fireworks and stars. They are glad they polished the car.
