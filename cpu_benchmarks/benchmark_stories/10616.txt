John was an ordinary fisherman. He went fishing everyday, but he was disappointed because he never caught anything.
John was tired of being unsuccessful so one day he bravely decided to try something different. He travelled far to a special place. 
When he got there, he called out to the fish. He said, "Come to me!" 
Suddenly, he felt something tug at his fishing line. He was so excited he started to laugh. 
But when he pulled his line up, he realised it was only an old boot. He was so angry that he threw his fishing rod away.
John trudged back home, feeling miserable. Even though he had tried something different, he had failed again. John sadly realised that he was still an ordinary fisherman.
