Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to go fishing with his dad. One day, they went to the lake to catch some fish. Timmy's dad gave him a fishing pole with a hook on the end. Timmy tried to catch a fish, but it was hard. He tried and tried, but he couldn't catch anything.
Then, Timmy saw something shiny in the water. He reached down and found a gold hook! He was so happy! He put the gold hook on his fishing pole and tried again. This time, it was easy! He caught a big fish right away. Timmy was so proud of himself for finding the gold hook and catching a fish. He couldn't wait to go fishing again.
