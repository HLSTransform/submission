There was a pretty painter. He started to paint a picture on a large piece of paper with colourful paints. He worked very hard and was concentrating lots. He felt sleepy so he yawned.
Then, he heard someone speak "Painter, why are you yawning?". He turned around, and there was a little girl. He said that he was tired. She suggested that he take a break and play with her, so he did. 
They played hide and seek, they danced around and they laughed lots. The painter forgot how tired he was. He felt so happy!
When it was Grandma's time for dinner, the little girl asked the painter if he wanted to come. He said yes. 
At the end of the night, the painter said goodbye and thanked the little girl for welcoming him. She smiled, and he yawned once again from the tiredness. But this time, his yawn was a happy one!
