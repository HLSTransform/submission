Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she was walking in the forest when she saw a big basket. "What's in there?" she asked herself. She decided to take a peek and saw some yummy fruits. "I want to gather some!" she exclaimed.
Lily walked deeper into the forest and saw a beautiful plant with colorful flowers. "Wow, it's so pretty!" she said. She wanted to take it home, but she knew it was important to take care of it. "I'll come back and visit you," she promised the plant.
As she continued her walk, she met an old man who was also gathering fruits. "Hello, little one," he greeted her. "Would you like to help me gather some fruits?" Lily happily agreed and they gathered many fruits together.
When they were done, the old man said, "You know, Lily, when you take care of plants, they grow big and strong, just like these fruits." Lily remembered the pretty plant she saw earlier and smiled. She knew she wanted to take care of it and watch it grow deep roots.
