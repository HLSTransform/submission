Once upon a time, there was a brown dog named Ben. Ben loved to play with his friends. They would run and jump all day long. One day, Ben saw a big box with a film in it. He wanted to watch the film with his friends.
Ben asked his friends to come and watch the film with him. They all said yes, and they went to Ben's house. They were very excited to watch the film together. But when they tried to play the film, they could not find the right button.
They pushed all the buttons, but the film would not play. Ben and his friends got very angry with each other. They started to fight and yell. They could not agree on how to play the film.
In the end, Ben's friends left his house. They did not want to play with Ben anymore. Ben was very sad. He wanted to watch the film and play with his friends, but now he was all alone. And the film never played.
