Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. She was very excited to go to the beach. She ran outside and got in the car with her mom and dad.
When they arrived, Sarah could not believe her eyes. The beach was so big and beautiful. She jumped out of the car and ran to the sand. She plopped down and started to feel the warm sand on her toes.
Then, Sarah ran to the water. She could feel the cold water as it lapped against her feet. She loved it! She put her hands in the water and splashed around. She was having so much fun!
Suddenly, Sarah started to feel a bit dizzy. Her mom saw this and said it was time to go. Sarah said goodbye to the beach and hopped back in the car. She was looking forward to the next time she could enter the beach again.
