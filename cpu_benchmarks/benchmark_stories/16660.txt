Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She went to the store with her mommy to buy some cereal for breakfast. They picked a box of colorful cereal with a picture of a happy tiger on it. When they got home, Lily helped her mommy unpack the groceries.
After breakfast, they decided to go for a walk in the park. As they were walking, they saw a bird lying on the ground. Lily asked her mommy why the bird was not moving. Her mommy explained that the bird was dead and could not move anymore. Lily felt sad and wanted to give the bird a hug, but her mommy told her that it was better to leave the bird alone and let it rest in peace. 
From that day on, whenever they went to the park, Lily would look for the bird, but it was never there. She hoped that the bird was flying high up in the sky with its friends, eating cereal and having fun.
