Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a big box under a tree. It is white and has a lock on it.
"What is in the box?" Tom asks.
"Maybe it is a treasure!" Lily says.
They try to open the box, but it is too hard. They need a key. They look around, but they do not see a key.
"Maybe we can take the box home and find a key there," Tom says.
"OK, let's do that," Lily says.
They lift the box and carry it to Tom's house. It is very heavy. They are tired, but they are happy. They think they have a treasure.
When they get to Tom's house, they see Tom's mom. She is surprised to see them with the box.
"Where did you get that box?" she asks.
"We found it in the park. It is a treasure!" Tom and Lily say.
Tom's mom smiles. She knows the box. It is her old box. She used to keep her toys in it when she was a little girl. She has the key.
She takes the key and opens the box. Tom and Lily look inside. They see dolls, cars, books, and puzzles. They are not shiny or new, but they are fun.
"Wow, this is a treasure!" Tom and Lily say.
Tom's mom lets them play with the toys. They have a lot of fun. They share the toys and make stories. They are happy. They have a treasure and a friend.
