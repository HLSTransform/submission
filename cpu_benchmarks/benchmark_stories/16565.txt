Tom was a curious boy. He liked to look at things and touch them. One day, he saw a big pot on the stove. It was shiny and had steam coming out of it. He wondered what was inside.
He climbed on a chair and reached for the pot. He did not hear his mom say, "No, Tom, don't touch the pot! It is hot and you will get hurt!" He grabbed the handle and pulled. The pot fell off the stove and spilled hot soup all over Tom.
Tom screamed and cried. He felt a lot of pain on his skin. His mom ran to him and wrapped him in a towel. She was scared and sad. She said, "Oh, Tom, why did you do that? You should have listened to me. Now you have to go to the doctor and get some medicine."
Tom was sorry and ashamed. He wished he had not been so curious. He learned a hard lesson. He never touched the pot again.
