Once upon a time there was a little kid named Jack. He was three years old.
One day, Jack went to the park to play. As he was playing he saw something weird. The weird thing was a small box with a bright light coming out of it. Jack wanted to see what was inside the box.
He held the box with both of his hands and opened it. To his surprise there was a small box inside the box. Inside the small box was a note which read 'the truth is inside'.
Jack looked inside the small box and found a ring with a shining ruby. He held the ring in his hands and wished for something. Suddenly he heard a voice in his head telling him the truth about himself.
The truth was that Jack was a magical kid who had special powers. Jack was so shocked to realize his truth and felt very weird. 
He quickly put the ring back into the box and closed the lid. From then on Jack never revealed his truth to anyone, but he held it close to his heart.
