Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to draw with her markers and crayons, but sometimes she would run out of ink. One day, her mommy gave her a big box of markers as a gifted surprise. Lily was very happy and said, "Thank you mommy, you are the best!" 
With her new markers, Lily started to draw pictures of her family and friends. She noticed that her drawings were getting better and better. She was improving her skills every day. She even drew a picture of her dog, Max, and it looked just like him! Lily was so proud of herself and showed her mommy all of her new drawings. Her mommy smiled and said, "You are a gifted artist, Lily. Keep drawing and improving!" 
From that day on, Lily continued to draw with her markers and crayons. She knew that with practice, she could improve even more. And every time she used her markers, she remembered the gift her mommy gave her and felt grateful.
