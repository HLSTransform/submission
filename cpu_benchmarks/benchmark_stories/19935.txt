Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo lived in a big blue ocean with his family and friends. One day, Nemo's friend, a crab named Sammy, came to visit him.
Sammy said, "Nemo, I am feeling lonely. Can we play together?"
Nemo replied, "Sure, let's dive into the ocean together!"
As they were swimming, Nemo noticed something shiny in the distance. He swam closer and saw that it was a refrigerator. Nemo and Sammy opened the refrigerator and found some yummy treats inside. They were so happy to have found some new friends to play with!
