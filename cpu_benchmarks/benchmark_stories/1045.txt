Once upon a time there was a lion. He was big and strong with a loud voice and bright yellow fur. Every day he would wake up early and roar up to the sky with all of his might, which everyone could hear.
Some of the animals living in the nearby forest were scared of the roaring, but one brave little songbird enjoyed it. She found the lion's roar lively and full of energy and eventually she started singing her own song in response.
The lion was happy to hear the little bird. He would roar and the bird would sing. And soon all of the other animals, from elephants to monkeys and even more songbirds, started joining in. The noise was happy and loud with everyone singing and roaring and playing together.
The lion and his animal friends had lots of fun making music together. Their song would go on until the sun went down and a peaceful nighttime win over the forest.
