Once there was a crab who lived by the sea. Every day the crab would go out and explore the area. One day, he found the most beautiful shell. He was so excited and he insisted on taking the shell home with him.
But the shell was stuck tightly to the rocks and it was very difficult for the crab to take it away. He pulled and pulled but it wouldn't budge. Taking the shell home seemed impossible.
The crab didn't give up. He kept trying and eventually, he was able to prize the shell loose. Now, he had his beautiful shell and could take it home. 
He was so happy and he insisted on showing all of his friends his new, special shell. He was the happiest crab in the sea!
