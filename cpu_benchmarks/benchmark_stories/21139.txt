Once upon a time, in a little house, there lived a boy named Tim and his sister, Sue. They loved to eat popcorn while watching their favorite cartoons. One day, they had a big bowl of popcorn to share.
Tim and Sue started to quarrel about who would get the first handful of popcorn. "I want it first!" said Tim. "No, me!" said Sue. They were not happy with each other.
Their mom heard them and came into the room. "Why are you both quarreling?" she asked. "We both want the popcorn first," they said. Mom thought for a moment and then smiled. "Why don't you both take a handful at the same time?"
Tim and Sue looked at each other and agreed. They both took a little handful of popcorn and started to eat it together. From that day on, they learned to share and never quarreled over popcorn again. They enjoyed their cartoons and popcorn happily ever after.
