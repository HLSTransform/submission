One day, Timmy and his mommy went to the park. Timmy wanted to play with his friends but he couldn't find them. He needed to call them on his phone but he didn't have it with him. 
"Mommy, where is my phone?" Timmy asked. 
"I don't know, sweetie. Did you bring it with you?" his mommy replied. 
Timmy shook his head. "No, I forgot it at home. I feel weak without it." 
"Don't worry, Timmy. You don't need a phone to have fun. Let's go play on the swings!" his mommy said. 
Timmy smiled and ran to the swings. He realized he didn't need his phone to have a good time with his mommy.
