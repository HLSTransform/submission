Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she saw a group of butterflies flying in the park. The butterflies were so attractive with their colorful wings. Lily wanted to follow them and see where they were going. 
She asked her mom, "Mommy, can I follow the butterflies?"
Her mom replied, "Sure, Lily. But be careful and don't go too far."
Lily followed the butterflies as they flew from flower to flower. She was so happy to see them up close. Suddenly, the butterflies flew away and Lily couldn't find them anymore. She went back to her mom and said, "Mommy, the butterflies are gone. But it was so fun to follow them!"
