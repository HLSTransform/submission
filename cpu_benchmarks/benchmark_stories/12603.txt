Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sing and talk with her friends. One day, she heard a voice that sounded troubled. It was coming from the forest.
Lily was scared but she wanted to help whoever was in trouble. She went into the forest and found a little bird. The bird's wing was hurt and it couldn't fly.
Lily knew she had to help the bird. She took care of it and gave it food and water. After a few days, the bird's wing was better and it could fly again. The bird flew away but before it left, it sang a beautiful song. Lily realized that helping others can make them happy and that made her happy too.
