Mia and Mark were best friends. They did everything together. One day Mia and Mark were playing in the park. They saw an interesting circle on the ground. 
"What is that?" asked Mia to Mark.
"I don't know," replied Mark. 
Mark leaned in and listened. To Mia's surprise, a silly voice started to come from the circle! They both looked at each other and were surprised.
"Let's listen more," Mia said.
Mark and Mia listened to the silly voice coming from the circle. They heard jokes and funny stories that made them giggle and laugh. They listened to the voice until it was time to go home. 
Mia and Mark smiled and had fun. They loved the silly stories from the circle and thought it was the best day ever.
