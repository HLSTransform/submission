John had a marble. He wanted to join it with other marbles but there were none. He went to see his friend Joe, but Joe was too lazy to help him. John was very disappointed. 
Then he saw a tree with a hole in it and a strange noise was coming from it. He looked inside and there were lots of marbles inside! John was so happy that he could join his marble with the others. He stayed a bit longer and played with the marbles, rolling them by the tree.
After a while, John had to go home. He said goodbye to all the marbles in the tree and put his special marble back in his pocket. He felt really happy and excited! He couldn't wait to come back again soon.
