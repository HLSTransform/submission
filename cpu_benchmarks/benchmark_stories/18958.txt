Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and play in her room. One day, she put on a pretty dress and went outside to dance in the sun.
As she danced, she took a big step and saw a little, careless bug on the ground. She didn't want to step on it, so she bowed down to say hello. The little bug was so happy that Lily was kind to him.
Lily and the little bug became best friends. They played and danced together every day. And every time they met, Lily would bow and the little bug would take a tiny step to dance with her. They were always very careful and happy together.
