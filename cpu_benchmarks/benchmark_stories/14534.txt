Once upon a time, there was a boy who loved to play sports. He loved to run and swing, jump and skip. He was very good at sports.
One day his mom said, “It’s time for you to play sports by yourself. I won’t always be there to help you.” The boy was a bit scared but he was excited too.
His mom allowed him to play sports on his own. The boy was so happy. He ran, jumped and skipped all over the place. He was so in the moment that he forgot to be careful.
Soon, he was running so fast and jumping so high that he hurt his knee. He started to cry.
His mom came running over and said, “Remember to be careful when you play sports.” The boy nodded and wiped away his tears. His mom picked him up, gave him a big hug and said, “I’ll always be here to help you, but you have to be careful too.” The boy nodded and smiled.
