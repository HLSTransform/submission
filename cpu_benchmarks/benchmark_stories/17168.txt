Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved Christmas time because she got to decorate the tree with pretty ornaments. One day, she found a shiny red ornament that she really liked. She asked her mom if she could put it on the tree, but her mom said she had to wait until they finished putting up all the other decorations. Lily was patient and waited. 
Later that day, Lily's friend came over to play. They had lots of fun playing with toys and singing songs. But then, Lily's friend asked her a question. She asked, "Can we put the red ornament on the tree now?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, let's do it!" They ran to the tree and carefully hung the red ornament on a branch. It looked so pretty! Lily was very happy that she had waited patiently for the perfect time to put it on the tree.
