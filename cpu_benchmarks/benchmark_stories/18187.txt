Once upon a time, there was a jolly little flea. He lived in a big, green park. He liked to jump and play all day.
One day, the flea found a colorful toy. It was round and fun to play with. He wanted to take it home. But, he had to be careful not to break it.
The flea jumped and played with the toy. He was so happy! But, he did not break it. He took it home to his family. They all played with the toy and had a jolly time. They were careful not to break it, too. And they all lived happily ever after.
