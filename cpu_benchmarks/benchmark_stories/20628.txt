One day, a little boy was playing in his backyard. He noticed something strange in the sky. He grabbed his binoculars to observe. There was a big, orange witch flying on a broomstick!
The witch was wearing a bright orange dress and a big, orange hat. Her skin was bright orange and she had an orange nose. The little boy was so excited that he tried to wave at the witch.
The witch smiled and waved back. She said "Hello, little boy! Would you like to come for a ride with me?" The little boy was so excited that he nodded his head.
The witch swooped down. She grabbed the little boy in her arm and took him on a magical adventure. They flew past mountains and over rivers. The little boy laughed and laughed with joy.
When they had been flying for a while, the witch said they had to go home. She gave the little boy a hug and flew away on her broomstick. He waved to say good-bye and watched her until she disappeared in the sky.
