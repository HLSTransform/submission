One day, Bill and Tim were playing in the park. Bill was a thoughtful boy and Tim was gray like the cloudy sky. They decided to spend the day playing and exploring.
First, they played tag and laughed and shouted. Then, they decided to spend some time climbing on the rocks. Bill was really thoughtful and he offered Tim a helping hand. 
After they were done, they sat down to eat lunch. Bill had brought a big, yummy sandwich and some tasty apples. Tim was so happy! 
Finally, the two boys decided to spend their last minutes fishing in the lake. Suddenly, Tim caught a big, fat fish! Tim was so proud and he hugged Bill. They agreed it was a perfect day, spent together.
