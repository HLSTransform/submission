Once upon a time, there was a grand piano in a grand room. It was so impressive! Everyone could guess that it played beautiful music.
One day, a three year old came into the room and sat at the piano. He touched the keys and it made delightful sounds. He played and played until he was so good that everyone watching was surprised!
The little one had learned to play all by himself. His skills were so impressive! The audience cheered with delight.
The little one smiled proudly and hugged his new grand piano. From that day on, he continued to practice and guess what? He was playing like a pro!
