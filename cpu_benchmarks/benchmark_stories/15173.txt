Once upon a time there was a little boy who loved to play with his new hoop. Every day the little boy played with the hoop and made up new games with it.
One day, the boy noticed something strange in the distance. It was a tall, modern-looking building. The boy wanted to find out what was inside.
So, the boy decided to take his hoop and explore the building. He was so excited because he thought something great must be inside. 
When the boy reached the building, he saw a big sign. It said “This area provides free food and toys to children.” The boy thought it was too good to be true! He ran inside the building and found a big room filled with delicious food and lots of toys. The boy was so happy that he started eating and playing with the toys.
Suddenly, the door of the room closed and the building started shaking. The little boy was scared and started to cry. It turned out that the building was actually an old abandoned factory and the sign was a trick. The little boy was never able to get out of the building.
Moral of the story: Be careful what you believe.
