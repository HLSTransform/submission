Once upon a time, a brave little girl went to the park to find some pretty rocks. She found a shiny mineral that sparkled in the sun. She was so happy and wanted to show her mommy. 
So, she put the mineral in an envelope and wrote her mommy's name on it. Then, she went to the mailbox and mailed it to her mommy. 
When her mommy got the envelope in the mail, she was so proud of her brave little girl. She gave her a big hug and told her how much she loved the shiny mineral. The little girl was so happy that she found something special for her mommy.
