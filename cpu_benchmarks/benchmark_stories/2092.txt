Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go on holiday with his family. One day, they went to an ancient castle. The castle was very big and had lots of old things inside. Timmy saw a statue and wanted to touch it. But when he did, it fell over and broke! Timmy's mom told him not to pinch things that didn't belong to him. Timmy felt bad, but he learned an important lesson. From then on, he always asked before touching anything.
