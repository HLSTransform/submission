Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a small dog called Spot. They loved to walk together. Tim would put a leash on Spot and they would walk to the park.
One day, while they were walking, they met a big dog. The big dog was angry. It barked loudly at Tim and Spot. Spot was scared, but Tim was brave. He held the leash tight and told the angry dog to go away.
The angry dog walked away. Tim and Spot were safe. They continued their walk to the park. They played and had fun. Tim and Spot were happy, and they walked home together.
