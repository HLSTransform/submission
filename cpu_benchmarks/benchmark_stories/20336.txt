Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with balls and nets. They have a big net and a small net. They want to see who has the bigger net.
Tom says, "I have the bigger net. Look, it is longer and wider than yours."
Sam says, "No, you don't. My net is bigger. Look, it has more holes and it is heavier than yours."
They start to argue and pull each other's nets. They are angry and loud.
Mom hears them and comes to see what is wrong. She says, "Stop, boys. Why are you fighting? You can share your nets and play together."
Tom and Sam say, "But we want to know who has the bigger net. How can we tell?"
Mom says, "You can measure your nets. You can use a stick or a rope or a tape. You can see how long and how wide and how heavy they are. Then you can compare them and see the difference."
Tom and Sam think that is a good idea. They find a stick and a rope and a scale. They measure their nets carefully. They see that Tom's net is longer and wider, but Sam's net has more holes and is heavier. They realize that their nets are different, but they are both good.
They say, "Sorry, Mom. Sorry, friend. We were silly and mean. We don't need to fight. We can play with both nets and have fun."
Mom says, "That's right, boys. You can be happy with what you have and respect what others have. You can learn from each other and share your things. That is what friends do."
Tom and Sam hug Mom and each other. They take their nets and go to play. They are not angry anymore. They are happy and kind.
