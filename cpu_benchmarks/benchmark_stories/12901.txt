One day, Dave went for a walk. He wanted to feel the sunshine on his face. But when he arrived at the park, he saw a sad little girl. She was all alone. Dave asked her what was wrong.
"I can't find my key," the little girl said. "My mommy hid it, but I can't find it anywhere."
Dave smiled. He knew now that he had to help her. He looked all around, but there was no key. The little girl started to cry.
Suddenly, Dave heard a giggle. He looked up and saw a boy standing on a nearby bench. He had the key in his hand and he was smiling.
The boy had been ignoring the little girl, but Dave knew that he had the key. Dave asked the boy nicely to give him back the key, and he did.
The little girl hugged Dave, thanked him and ran off happily. Dave smiled. He had helped the little girl and made her day.
