Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. They had many toys, like balls, cars, dolls and books. They always kept their toys in a big bin that had a lid. They were very organized and did not like to lose their toys.
One day, a new boy came to the park. His name was Max. He did not have any toys, and he looked bored. He saw Lily and Ben playing with their toys, and he wanted to join them. But he did not ask nicely. He just grabbed a car from Ben and ran away.
"Hey, that's my car!" Ben shouted. "Give it back!"
"No, it's mine now!" Max said. "You have too many toys. I have none. It's not fair!"
Lily and Ben were very angry. They ran after Max, but he was fast. He hid behind a tree and played with the car. He did not care that he had stolen it.
A lady who was walking her dog saw what happened. She did not like Max's behavior. She went to the tree and said to Max, "What are you doing, young man? You can't steal other children's toys. That's very bad. You should apologize and return the car."
Max was scared of the lady. He did not want to get in trouble. He gave the car back to Ben and said, "Sorry, I was just playing. Here, take your car."
Lily and Ben were happy to get their car back. They thanked the lady and put the car in their bin. They closed the lid and went to play somewhere else. They did not want to play with Max anymore. They hoped he would learn to be nice and share.
