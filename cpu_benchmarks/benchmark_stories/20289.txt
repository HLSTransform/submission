One day, a nosy little dog named Max went for a walk. He saw a big red gear in the park. Max was very curious about the gear, so he went closer to look at it. The gear was shiny and had many small parts. Max thought it was fun to play with.
Later, Max saw a girl named Lily. Lily was trying to feed her pet bird, Tweet. Tweet was a small, yellow bird who loved to eat seeds. Max wanted to help Lily feed the bird, so he wagged his tail and barked happily. Lily smiled and let Max help her.
Max and Lily had fun feeding Tweet. They laughed as Tweet chirped and ate the seeds. After they finished, Max and Lily played with the big red gear together. They rolled it around the park and had a great time. At the end of the day, Max and Lily became good friends.
