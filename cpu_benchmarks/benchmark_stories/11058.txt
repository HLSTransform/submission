Lily liked to do things by herself. She was independent. She did not need help from Mom or Dad or her big brother Tom. She could put on her shoes, brush her teeth, and make her bed.
One day, Lily wanted to reach a book on the top shelf. She saw a chair in the kitchen. She dragged the chair to the bookcase. She climbed on the chair and stretched her arm. But the book was still too high. She stood on her toes and leaned forward. She almost had it.
"Be careful, Lily!" Tom said. He came into the room and saw Lily on the chair. "You might fall and hurt yourself. Let me get the book for you."
"No!" Lily said. She did not want Tom to help her. She wanted to get the book by herself. She seemed angry. She pushed Tom away. She reached for the book again.
But then, the chair wobbled. Lily lost her balance. She screamed. Tom caught her before she fell. He hugged her and put her down. He gave her the book.
"Thank you, Tom," Lily said. She felt scared and sorry. She hugged Tom back. She realized that sometimes, she needed help from others. She was independent, but not always.
