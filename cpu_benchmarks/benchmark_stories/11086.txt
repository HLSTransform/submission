Tom and Jen were brother and sister. They liked to play in the backyard. One Tuesday, they saw a big hole in the fence. They wanted to discover what was behind it.
"Let's go, Jen," Tom said. "Maybe we can find something fun."
"No, Tom," Jen said. "Mom said we can't go out of the fence. It's not safe."
But Tom was persistent. He did not listen to Jen. He crawled through the hole. Jen followed him. She did not want to be alone.
They found a big street with many cars. They were scared. They did not know how to go back. They tried to cross the street. But a car was too fast. It hit them. They were hurt. They cried.
Mom heard them. She ran to the street. She saw them. She was sad. She called for help. But it was too late. Tom and Jen were gone.
