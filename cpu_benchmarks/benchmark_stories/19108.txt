Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Bobby. Bobby loved honey very much. He would always go to the forest to find some honey. One day, Bobby saw a beehive in a tree. He climbed up the tree and took some honey from the beehive. But he did not know that he was stealing from the bees.
The bees saw what Bobby did and they got very angry. They chased him and stung him many times. Bobby was very weak and he fell from the tree. He was hurt very badly and could not move. The bees took back their honey and flew away.
Bobby learned that stealing is not good and that he should always ask before taking things that do not belong to him. He was very sad that he got hurt and could not have any honey. From that day on, Bobby always asked before taking anything.
