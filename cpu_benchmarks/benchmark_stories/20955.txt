Mia ran in the race. She was so excited but a little scared too. She saw lots of people cheering. She wanted to be fast, like the other runners.
Mia ran and ran until she finished the race. Everyone clapped and cheered for her! She was proud, but also a bit tired.
After the race, Mia's Dad gave her a sour lemon. She didn't understand why it was sour, but she ate it anyway. It was so yucky! Mia's Mom laughed and gave her a sweet apple. This Mia understood. She smiled and ate the apple.
Mia was happy she understood the difference. She knew racing was fun and sour lemons weren't!
