Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to whistle all day long. One day, she went to the store with her mom to buy some rice. Lily saw a big bag of rice that looked so yummy, but it was too expensive for her mom to buy.
Lily said, "Mommy, can we buy that rice? It looks so good!"
Her mom said, "I'm sorry, Lily. That rice is too expensive for us to buy right now."
Lily was sad, but then she started to whistle a happy tune. Her mom asked her, "Why are you whistling, Lily?"
Lily said, "I'm happy because I have you, Mommy. We don't need expensive rice to be happy."
Her mom smiled and hugged Lily. They went home and cooked some delicious rice together. Lily whistled while they cooked, and they both felt happy and grateful for each other.
