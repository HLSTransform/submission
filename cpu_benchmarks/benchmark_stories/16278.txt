Johnnie was very excited because he was about to go for a ride on his lovely zoom! He grabbed his mysterious helmet and happily leapt onto the seat.
"Ready to go?" He asked his friend Susie.
"Ready!" She grinned, hopping onto the back seat. 
Johnnie pressed his foot onto the pedal and the zoom flew off. The wind blew against their faces and the sun was blazing in the sky.
But then, disaster almost struck! Johnnie's zoom stumbled over a bump in the road. He squeezed the brakes and managed to stay in control.
Susie clapped her hands. "That was close!" She exclaimed.
Johnnie smiled. He was determined to make sure they had a lovely ride. So, he slowly and carefully rode around the bump the next time they passed.
Johnnie and Susie waved their hands in the air and laughed all the way home. All in all, it was a lovely ride.
