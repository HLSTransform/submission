Once upon a time there was a high hill. At the top of the hill was a tall castle. There were many bright windows and lots of pretty flags waving in the wind.
One day, the king wanted to build a bridge to the top of the hill. He told the workers to include a cable for the bridge. The cable was long and strong, and it took lots of time to install.
Finally, the cable was finished and the bridge was ready. It was very high and sparkly in the sunshine. Everyone cheered and clapped.
The king and his family were so proud of their new bridge. Every day they used it to get to the top of the hill. 
In no time at all, a great many people crossed the bridge. They walked, skipped, and ran across the bridge and said hello to each other. The cable was part of a very special bridge for everyone to use and enjoy.
