Lily and Max were hungry. They wanted to find something to eat. They went to the kitchen and opened the fridge. They saw a big bowl of red sauce.
"Look, Max, sauce!" Lily said. "Maybe we can have some with bread."
"Good idea, Lily!" Max said. "Let's get some bread and a spoon."
They took the bread and the spoon and went to the table. They dipped the bread in the sauce and took a big bite. But as soon as they tasted the sauce, they made a funny face.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lily cried. "This sauce is spicy! It hurts my mouth!"
"Me too, me too!" Max cried. "This sauce is not good! It makes me want to drink water!"
They dropped the bread and the spoon and ran to the sink. They turned on the tap and drank some water. They felt better, but they were still hungry.
They looked at the fridge again. They realized that the sauce was not for them. It was for Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad liked spicy food, but Lily and Max did not.
"Sorry, Max, I made a mistake," Lily said. "We should not have eaten the sauce. It was not ours."
"It's okay, Lily, I made a mistake too," Max said. "We should have asked Mom and Dad first. Maybe they have something else for us."
They went to the living room and found Mom and Dad on the couch. They told them what happened. Mom and Dad smiled and hugged them.
"It's okay, Lily and Max, we're not mad at you," Mom said. "We're glad you're okay. The sauce was too spicy for you. It was for our dinner tonight."
"We have something else for you," Dad said. "We have some cheese and crackers and grapes. Do you want some?"
"Yes, please!" Lily and Max said. "We like cheese and crackers and grapes. They are not spicy. They are yummy!"
Mom and Dad took them to the kitchen and gave them some cheese and crackers and grapes. They ate them happily. They were not hungry anymore. They learned a lesson. They realized that they should always ask before they eat something from the fridge.
