Sara liked to follow her big sister Anna everywhere. Anna was six years old and knew many things. She wore a pretty skirt with flowers and ribbons. Sara wanted to be like Anna.
One day, Anna said to Sara, "Let's go to the park and play. But we have to be quiet. Mom is sleeping and we don't want to wake her up." Sara nodded and put on her shoes. She followed Anna out of the house and down the street.
The park was big and green. There were swings and slides and a sandbox. Anna ran to the swings and pushed one hard. She jumped on it and swung high in the air. Sara followed her and tried to do the same. But she was too small and scared. She fell off the swing and hurt her knee. She cried out loud.
Anna heard Sara's cry and jumped off the swing. She ran to Sara and saw her bleeding knee. She said, "Oh no, Sara, you're hurt. We have to go back home and get Mom. Come on, let's go." She took Sara's hand and pulled her along.
But on the way back, they saw a big dog. The dog was black and hairy and had sharp teeth. It barked and growled and ran towards them. Anna and Sara were very afraid. They tried to run away, but the dog was faster. It jumped on them and bit them. They screamed and cried, but no one heard them. The dog dragged them away and ate them. Mom never saw them again.
