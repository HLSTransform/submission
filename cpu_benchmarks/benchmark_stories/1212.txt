Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Lily. She loved to share her toys with her friends. One day, she decided to invite her friends to her birthday party. She wanted to make them happy and give them gifts. 
Lily's mom took her to the airport to pick up her grandma. When they arrived, Lily saw a boy who looked sad. She went to him and asked what was wrong. The boy said he missed his family and didn't have anyone to play with. Lily felt bad and invited him to her party. 
At the party, Lily gifted her friends with toys and the boy with a big smile. Everyone had fun playing together. Lily learned that sharing and inviting others can make them happy too. From that day on, she always looked for ways to help others and make them feel included.
