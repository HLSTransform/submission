Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play dress-up. She had a costume box full of fun outfits like princess dresses and superhero capes. One day, Lily decided she wanted to be a ballerina. She put on her tutu and ballet shoes and twirled around the room.
Her mom came in and said, "Lily, you look perfect! Can you show me a dance?"
Lily leaned against the wall and started to dance. She twirled and spun, and her mom clapped and cheered. "You're such a good dancer, Lily!" her mom said.
Lily smiled and said, "I love my ballerina costume. It makes me feel like a real dancer."
