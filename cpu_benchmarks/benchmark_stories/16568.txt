Sam liked to play with his trumpet. He liked to make loud noises and pretend he was in a band. He liked to march around the house and blow his trumpet. But today, he could not play with his trumpet. His mom said he had to be quiet. His dad was sick and needed to rest. Sam felt gloomy. He did not like to be quiet.
He went to his room and looked at his trumpet. He wanted to play with it, but he did not want to make his dad feel worse. He had an idea. He took his blanket and covered his trumpet with it. He thought that would make it less loud. He put the blanket-covered trumpet to his mouth and blew. He heard a muffled sound. He smiled. He thought it sounded funny.
He marched around his room and blew his blanket-covered trumpet. He made up a song in his head. He felt less gloomy. He was having fun. He did not notice his mom coming in. She saw him playing with his blanket-covered trumpet. She smiled. She thought he was clever and sweet. She gave him a hug and a kiss. She told him he was a good boy. She told him his dad would get better soon. She told him she loved him. Sam felt happy. He loved his mom. He loved his trumpet. He loved his blanket. He blew his blanket-covered trumpet one more time. He made his mom laugh. He laughed too.
