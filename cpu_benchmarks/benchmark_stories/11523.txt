Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a big black dog. The dog liked to play with lumber. He would carry the lumber in his mouth and run around the yard.
One day, it started to rain. The dog did not want his lumber to get wet. So, he decided to cover the lumber. He found a big leaf and put it on top of the lumber. The leaf was not big enough to cover all of the lumber, but the dog was happy.
The rain stopped and the sun came out. The black dog was very happy that his lumber was not wet. He picked up the lumber in his mouth and ran around the yard again. The dog and his lumber had a great day playing in the sun.
