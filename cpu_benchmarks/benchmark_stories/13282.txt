There was an old lady who lived in a tall, white house. She was a very nice lady and loved to tend her garden. One day a big ambulance drove to her house. It had loud lights and a loud siren.
The ambulance had come to take her away. When the old lady saw the ambulance, she started to weep. Everyone in the neighbourhood could hear her loud cries. She was frightened and did not want to go. 
The neighbours were very sad for the old lady. They wished that they could make her feel better. But the nice ambulance driver said it was best if the old lady went to the hospital. So, even though she was still crying, the ambulance driver gently picked her up and carried her away.
The neighbours waved goodbye to the old lady and they all wiped away their tears. They knew that she would get the help she needed. And they hoped that one day she'd be back.
