Once upon a time, there was a big boat. The boat had a big anchor to help it stay in one place. One day, the boat went out to sea with some friends. But when they got far from the shore, the sky turned dark and the waves got big. The boat was moving a lot and the friends were scared.
One friend said, "I wish we had something to help us stay safe." Another friend said, "I can supply a clear plan! We can use the anchor to keep us in one place until the storm stops." The other friends thought this was a good idea. They quickly got the anchor and threw it into the water. The anchor helped the boat stay in one place, and the friends were safe until the storm passed.
