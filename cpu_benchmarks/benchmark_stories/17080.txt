Once upon a time, there was a smart crab named Tim. He lived on the beach where the tide went in and out every day. Tim loved to watch the water go up and down.
One day, Tim saw a big machine on the beach. It could print words in the sand. Tim was very excited and wanted to try it. He asked the man with the machine, "Can I print my name in the sand?" The man smiled and said, "Yes, you can."
Tim used the machine to print his name in the sand. He was so happy to see his name next to the tide. All the other animals on the beach thought Tim was very intelligent. They all wanted to learn how to print their names too. So Tim taught them, and they all had fun printing their names in the sand together.
