Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Anna. She was very excited because it was almost time for her birthday party. She looked at the clock, it said five o'clock. 
Anna started to hurry. She put on her pretty purple dress and her delicate white shoes. Then she ran to the kitchen. 
Mom was busy getting the party ready. She had put up decorations and was in the middle of baking a big birthday cake. 
Anna couldn't wait for her friends to arrive so they could all eat cake. 
But then the clock struck six. “Oh no!” Anna exclaimed. She hurried back to her bedroom one more time to grab her special birthday present. 
In the bedroom, Anna found the present - a beautiful, delicate doll from her mom. She smiled and held it close. 
And just in time, her friends started to arrive. They all played together, ate cake, sang and opened presents. Anna was so happy - it was the best birthday ever!
