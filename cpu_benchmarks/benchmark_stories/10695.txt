Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, when they were playing, they found a fountain. It was a big, beautiful fountain that seemed to sparkle in the sun.
Lily and her friends were very thirsty, but the fountain water seemed dirty. They decided not to drink it. Suddenly, they saw a hungry dog. It was barking and seemed very angry. The dog wanted to drink from the fountain too, but Lily and her friends were afraid it would bite them.
They had a problem. They wanted to help the dog, but they didn't want to get hurt. Then, Lily had an idea. She went to the store and bought a bowl. She filled it with fresh water and brought it to the dog. The dog drank the water and seemed very happy. Lily and her friends were happy too, because they helped the dog and solved the problem.
