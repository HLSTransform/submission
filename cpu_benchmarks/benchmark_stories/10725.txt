Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went to school and entered her classroom. The classroom was very dull and boring. Lily didn't like it very much. 
But then, her teacher Ms. Smith came in and started to teach the class. Ms. Smith was very funny and made learning fun. Lily started to enjoy the class and even made some new friends. 
After class, Lily went home and told her mom all about her day. She said that even though the classroom was dull, she had a lot of fun with her new friends and loved her teacher. From that day on, Lily loved going to school and learning new things.
