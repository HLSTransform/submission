Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she went for a walk in the park with her mom. They saw a beautiful landscape with trees, flowers, and a river. Lily loved it so much that she wanted to touch the water. But as she got closer, she slipped and fell into the river!
Lily's mom quickly pulled her out and hugged her tightly. They went back home, and Lily felt sad because her clothes were wet and dirty. Her mom tried to cheer her up by showing her a fake flower she had bought at the store. Lily smiled and hugged her mom, feeling happy again.
Later that day, Lily's mom took her to the store to buy new clothes. They also bought some fake flowers to decorate their house. Lily loved the new clothes and the flowers, but she never forgot about the beautiful landscape in the park. She promised herself that she would be more careful next time she went there.
