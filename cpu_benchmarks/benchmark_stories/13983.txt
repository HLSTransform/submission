Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with clay. He would make all sorts of things like animals and cars. One day, Timmy decided to make something very unusual. He wanted to make a clay castle with a moat and a drawbridge.
Timmy worked very hard on his castle. He rolled and molded the clay until it was just right. But then, he got frustrated because the drawbridge wouldn't stay up. He wanted to quit and throw the clay away. But his mom encouraged him to keep trying.
Finally, Timmy figured out how to make the drawbridge stay up. He was so happy and proud of his unusual clay castle. He played with it for hours and showed it to all of his friends. Timmy learned that even when things get tough, he shouldn't quit because he can do anything he puts his mind to.
