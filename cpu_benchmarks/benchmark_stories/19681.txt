Once upon a time, there was a gifted cat. He lived in a special place with lots of trees and grass and bright green hills. Every day, it would rain in the morning and the cat would go outside to play in the sunshine and the rain. One day, he was playing in the grass when he found a bone! He was so happy to find it, so he ran and showed it to his friends. Everyone was excited to see the bone and they gathered around to look at it. They tossed it around and played with it until it grew dark. Then, the rain came back. The cat and his friends had to go find shelter, so they all ran back home. But the cat still had the bone, and he kept it safe until the rain stopped and they could play again. The end.
