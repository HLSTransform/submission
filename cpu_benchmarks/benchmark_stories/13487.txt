Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden. One day, she found a tiny seed and decided to plant it in the dirt. She watered it every day and watched it grow into a big, beautiful flower. 
One day, Lily's friend came to play with her. They decided to play dress-up and put on their favorite outfits. But when Lily tried to zip up her dress, the zipper got stuck. She asked her friend for help, but they couldn't get it to open. 
Suddenly, they had an idea. They went back to the garden and picked a flower. They used the stem to gently pry open the zipper and Lily's dress was saved! They were so happy and continued to play together in the sunshine, watching the flowers grow taller and taller.
