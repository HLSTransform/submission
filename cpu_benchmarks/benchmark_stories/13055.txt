One day, Tom was walking through the woods. He saw a patch of soil that looked a bit different from the rest of the ground. He stopped and looked at it and noticed it was a darker color. He wondered why it was darker than the rest. Suddenly, he started to worry. What was wrong with the soil? Was it normal, or was something wrong?
Tom started to think and he decided to get closer to the soil. He bent over and felt the soil with his hand. It felt a bit wet, so he scooped up a bit of the soil. He held it in his hands and realized it was normal dirt. He was relieved!
Tom smiled and continued walking away. He was no longer worried about the soil. He knew it was simply a normal patch of dirt, and nothing was wrong with it. He was happy, and went on his way.
