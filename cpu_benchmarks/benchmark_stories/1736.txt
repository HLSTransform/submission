Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had long hair that she loved to brush every day. One day, Lily's mom suggested that they try a new hairstyle. "Let's braid your hair!" said Lily's mom. 
Lily thought it sounded like a difficult task, but she was willing to try. "Okay, I will sit still," said Lily. Her mom started to braid her hair and it was a bit tricky at first, but they worked together and soon it was done. 
Lily looked in the mirror and saw her new hairstyle. "Wow, I love it!" she exclaimed. Her mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it. You look so pretty!" From that day on, Lily loved trying new hairstyles with her mom and it was always so much fun.
