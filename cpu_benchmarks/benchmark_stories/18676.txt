Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the snow. One day, as she was building a snowman, she saw a stranger walking towards her. The stranger looked friendly, but Lily didn't know who they were. She felt a little scared, so she decided to freeze and stay still. 
The stranger came closer and said hello. Lily felt a little better and said hello back. The stranger asked if she needed any help building her snowman. Lily smiled and said yes. Together, they built the biggest and best snowman ever! 
From that day on, Lily wasn't scared of strangers anymore. She learned that sometimes strangers can be friendly and helpful. And she was happy to have made a new friend.
