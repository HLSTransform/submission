Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Betsy. Betsy loved to play in the wild forest with her friends. One day, Betsy and her friends were playing hide and seek. Betsy hid behind a big tree and waited for her friends to find her.
But as she waited, she started to yawn. "I'm so tired," said Betsy to herself. "I need to rest my eyes." So she closed her eyes and took a nap.
When she woke up, she couldn't see her friends anywhere. She looked around but they were nowhere in sight. Betsy started to panic. "Where did they go?" she said out loud.
Just then, she heard a voice. "Betsy, we found you!" It was her friends. They had been looking for her too. Betsy was so happy to see them. "I'm sorry I fell asleep," she said. "I was so tired."
"It's okay," said her friends. "Let's go play some more!" And so they did, until it was time to go home. Betsy went to bed early that night, feeling happy and content.
