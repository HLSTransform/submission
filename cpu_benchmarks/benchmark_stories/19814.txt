Once there was a boy named Joe. He was 3 years old and loved to explore. One day he was feeling brave so he decided to explore outside. 
He stepped off his porch and looked around. He saw a weird cushion and he dared himself to go nearer to check it out. He walked closer and closer until he was only an inch away from it. He touched the cushion and couldn't believe his eyes. It was so soft and cozy!
Joe felt so happy and decided to take the cushion inside. He knew his family was going to love it as much as he did. So he ran back inside and showed everyone the weird cushion he had found. They were all so amazed and Joe smiled with joy. 
The cushion quickly became Joe's best friend and he would always take it with him whenever he dared to explore. 
The end.
