Once upon a time there was a bunny who loved to hop. His name was Hoppy and everyday he would run around his garden and hop everywhere.
One evening, Hoppy got tired of hopping so he decided to take a nap. But he had no idea somebody was watching him. It was an ignorant crow who had never seen a bunny that loved to hop.
As Hoppy snoozed, the crow watched in awe, wondering why he never hopped. He looked around in confusion, and couldn't quite figure it out.
Then he had an idea. He flew close to Hoppy and flapped his wings, trying to wake him up. After a few minutes, Hoppy opened his eyes, shook his head and started to hop.
The crow was so astonished at how much Hoppy loved to hop and he flew away, never to be seen again. Hoppy continued to hop in his garden, feeling very happy.
