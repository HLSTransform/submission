Timmy wanted to paint. He got some paints from his Mom. He asked his dog to help. The dog wagged his tail. 
Timmy spread paint all over his paper. The dog painted too. His paper was getting colorful. 
Timmy and the dog had a lot of fun. The colors were so nice! They painted the whole paper. 
When they were done, Timmy clapped. The dog barked with joy. They hugged and went outside to play in the sun. It was a nice day!
