Tommy was happy to be in the backyard. He saw his friends gathered there with their jump ropes. He was a bit envious that they had jump ropes but he was still very excited. He looked around the backyard and saw so many things to play with and explore.
He ran around the backyard searching for something interesting. After a few minutes of searching, he found some string that was lying on the grass. He quickly grabbed it and gathered his friends together. They all set to work making circle shapes with the string. 
Happy with their creation, Tommy's friends started playing together. Tommy was so happy to be part of the fun in the backyard. He watched as his friends jumped their ropes and ran around him. He wished he his own jump rope but he still felt content to be with his friends. 
His friends finally stopped playing and all gathered around Tommy as they talked and laughed. They never seemed to get bored in the backyard. Tommy was glad he could be part of such wonderful memories.
