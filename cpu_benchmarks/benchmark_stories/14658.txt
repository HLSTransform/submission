Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Daisy. One day, Daisy was playing outside when she saw a big squash. She wanted to touch the squash, but she was scared.
So Daisy asked her friend, "Do you dare me to touch the squash?" Her friend smiled and said, "Yes, I dare you."
Daisy was so excited. She took a deep breath and touched the squash. It was soft and squashy! Daisy felt so brave.
But then, a sudden gust of wind blew the squash away. It rolled right into a puddle! Everyone laughed and Daisy felt embarrassed. But then, Daisy's best friend said, "Good try, Daisy. You were very brave."
Daisy smiled. She wasn't embarrassed anymore. She had been daring - and it was fun!
