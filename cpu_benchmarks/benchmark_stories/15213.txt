Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the zoo with her mom. Lily was very excited to see all the animals. She was a bit impatient and wanted to see them all at once. Her mom told her, "Slow down, Lily. We have all day to see the animals."
At the zoo, Lily saw a big elephant. She wanted to touch it, but it was too tall. Lily's mom said, "Kneel down, Lily. The elephant will come to you." So Lily kneeled down, and the elephant came closer. She gently touched its trunk and smiled.
Later, they saw a group of kids running and shouting near the animals. The zookeeper told them, "Please be quiet and calm. The animals will be scared if you are loud." The kids listened and soon, the animals came closer. Lily learned that being patient and kind was the best way to enjoy the zoo.
