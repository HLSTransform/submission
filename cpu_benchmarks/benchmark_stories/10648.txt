Once upon a time, there was a little black cat. He was a very happy cat and he loved to explore. On one of his adventures, he stumbled upon a small heel, lying alone in the grass. He wanted to care for it and make it his own, so he decided to take it home.
He brought it into the house and proudly showed it to his family. Everyone was very happy, but they warned him not to leave it lying around too often. They said if he was careful when handling it and put it away in a safe place, it would last longer.
At first, the little black cat was a bit sad, but he saw how important it was to care for something he liked. He put away the heel every time he was done playing with it, and soon he was as happy as always.
The little black cat learned a valuable lesson that day: when you care for something, it can last a long time.
