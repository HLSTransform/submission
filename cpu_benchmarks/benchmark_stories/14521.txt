Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to put on her shoes and go to the shop. Every time she got to the shop, she saw something new.
One day, Lucy found a mysterious box in the shop. She asked the shop keeper what was in it, and the shop keeper said "That is a mysterious box, I don't know what's in it". Lucy wanted to find out what was in the box, so she asked the shop keeper if she could put it in her bag.
The shop keeper said yes, so Lucy put the box in her bag and walked home. When she got home, she couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious box! She opened it up, and to her surprise, it was full of surprises! She had lots of fun things to play with. 
From then on, Lucy always went to the shop and looked for mysterious boxes. It was her favorite thing to do!
