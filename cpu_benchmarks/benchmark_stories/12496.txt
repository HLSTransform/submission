Once upon a time, there was a man. He was very nice and always tried to do the right thing. One day, he went to the store to buy some food for his dinner. He saw a big cake and thought it would be perfect for dessert. 
But when he got home and opened the cake, he saw that it was spoiled. That means it was not good to eat anymore. The man was sad because he really wanted to eat cake for dessert. 
He decided to go back to the store and ask for a new cake. The store was very nice and gave him a perfect cake. The man was happy and enjoyed his dessert very much. From then on, he always checked his food before he bought it so it wouldn't spoil again. The end.
