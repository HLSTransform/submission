Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They had a basket full of toys and snacks. They liked to share and have fun.
"Look, a big slide!" Tom said. He ran to the slide and climbed up. "Whee!" he shouted as he slid down.
Lily followed him. She liked the slide too. She smiled and laughed as she slid down.
They played on the slide for a while. Then they saw a big dog. The dog was brown and furry. It looked friendly, but it was hungry.
The dog saw the basket. It smelled the snacks. It ran to the basket and grabbed it with its mouth. It ran away with the basket.
"Hey, that's our basket!" Lily cried. She and Tom chased the dog. They wanted their basket back.
The dog was fast. It ran across the park. It dodged the trees and the people. It thought it was clever.
But it did not see the pond. It ran into the water with the basket. It got wet and cold. It dropped the basket and barked.
Lily and Tom reached the pond. They saw the dog and the basket. They were glad they found their basket. They were not mad at the dog.
"Are you okay, doggy?" Lily asked. She was calm and kind. She petted the dog's head.
The dog wagged its tail. It was sorry it took the basket. It liked Lily and Tom.
"Can we be friends, doggy?" Tom asked. He gave the dog a snack.
The dog nodded. It liked the snack. It liked Lily and Tom.
Lily and Tom took their basket. They invited the dog to play with them. They had a lot of fun. They were happy.
