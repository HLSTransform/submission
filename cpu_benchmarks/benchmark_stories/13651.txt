Tom and Lily liked to play outside. They had a big yard with many trees and flowers. One day, they saw a creek behind their house. They wanted to see the water and the fish.
They told their mom they were going to play in the yard. But they did not tell her about the creek. They ran to the creek and looked at it. It was shiny and clear. They saw some fish swimming and some rocks on the bottom.
Tom and Lily wanted to touch the water. They took off their shoes and socks and put their feet in the creek. It was cold and wet. They laughed and splashed each other. They did not see the sign that said "Danger. Deep water."
They wandered along the creek, looking for more fish and rocks. They did not hear their mom calling them. They did not see the bend in the creek, where the water got deeper and faster. They did not see the hole in the ground, where the water went down.
Tom stepped on the hole and fell in. He screamed and tried to swim. Lily saw him and ran to help him. She reached out her hand, but she could not grab him. He went down and down, and she could not see him anymore.
Lily cried and cried. She did not know what to do. She was scared and alone. She wished she had listened to her mom and stayed in the yard. She wished she had never seen the creek. She wished she could see Tom again.
