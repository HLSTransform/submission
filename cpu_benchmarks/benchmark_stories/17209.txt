Once upon a time, there was a long subway that went under the ground. People would ride it to go to work or to see their friends. One day, the subway stopped working and the people were sad. They needed to replace a part to make it work again.
A man came to fix the subway. He had a big bag of tools. He looked at the broken part and took it out. Then, he put a new part in its place. The people were happy because now they could ride the subway again. They thanked the man for fixing it.
