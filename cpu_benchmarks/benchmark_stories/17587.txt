Sara likes to print pictures of animals. She has a printer in her bedroom. She prints pictures of cats, dogs, birds, and fish. She puts them on her wall with tape. She thinks they are cute.
One day, Sara prints a picture of a lion. It is big and yellow and has a mane. Sara likes the lion. She wants to show it to her mom. She runs out of her bedroom with the picture in her hand.
But she does not see her brother Tom. He is playing with his truck on the floor. Sara trips over the truck and falls down. The picture of the lion flies out of her hand and lands on Tom's head.
Tom is scared. He thinks the lion is real. He screams and runs away. Sara is sad. She thinks she hurt Tom and lost her picture. She starts to cry.
Mom hears the noise and comes to see what is wrong. She sees Sara crying and Tom hiding. She sees the picture of the lion on the floor. She picks it up and smiles.
She hugs Sara and Tom and tells them it is okay. She says the picture is not real, it is just paper. She says Sara did a good job printing it. She says it is a cute lion. She asks Sara if she wants to hang it on her wall.
Sara nods and smiles. She says yes. She says she is sorry for tripping over Tom's truck. She says she loves him. Tom says he is sorry for screaming and running away. He says he loves her too. They hug and say sorry.
Mom takes them to Sara's bedroom. She helps Sara hang the picture of the lion on her wall. She tells them they are both cute too. She kisses them and says she loves them. She says it is time for a snack. They go to the kitchen and have cookies and milk. They are happy.
