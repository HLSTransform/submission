Once upon a time, there were two friends named Alex and Lucy. Alex was a cat and Lucy was a dog. 
One day, they were in the backyard when they saw a rope. Alex was excited and wanted to play with it. "Let's skip!" he said.
Lucy was a bit shy, but she said ok. They took turns skipping over the rope. Alex was so proud of himself!
Suddenly, Alex looked at Lucy and said, "Come on, Lucy! You can do it!" But Lucy was still scared.
Alex gave her a little nudge. "You can do it, I'm sure!"
After a few tries, Lucy finally managed to skip over the rope. She couldn't contain her excitement! She cheered and Alex cheered too. They were proud of their new skipping skills. 
The two friends smiled as they skipped and played in the sunshine.
