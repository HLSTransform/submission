Once there was a little girl. She liked to play outside and one day she found a bucket. She was so happy and excited to play! She spun around in circles with the bucket in her hand. She laughed and spun faster and faster. Eventually, she got so dizzy she fell down onto the grass. After she got up, she put the bucket back where she found it and went inside. From then on, whenever she was outside, she remembered the time she spun around with the little bucket in her hand and smiled.
