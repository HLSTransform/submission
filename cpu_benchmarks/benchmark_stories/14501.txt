Timmy was very curious and wanted to examine the moon. So he asked his Daddy to take him outside to look at it. They stepped outside and Timmy looked up. The moon was so big and bright and the sky was full of stars. It was so beautiful that Timmy was dizzy with amazement.
They stayed outside for a long time and Timmy was so excited to learn about the moon and the stars. He couldn't believe how magical it all felt seeing the stars twinkle and the moon glistening in the night sky. 
Timmy and his Daddy talked about the moon and how different it appeared on different nights. Timmy was so happy and couldn't stop smiling. It was the best night ever! Before they headed back inside, Timmy promised to show his friends the moon and the stars the next night.
