Once upon a time there was a boy named Alex. He was 3 years old and he loved playing outside in the garden.
One evening, while playing in the garden, Alex heard something in the bushes. It sounded quite strange. He stood still and listened.
Suddenly, out from the darkness hopped a small, brown bunny. Alex had never seen him from before. 
"Hi there" the little bunny said. "I was just looking for a pin in the bushes".
Alex was a little disturbed by the bunny, but he was also a little curious. 
"What do you need a pin for?" he asked the bunny.
The little bunny held up a ball of wool and said: "I want to hold the wool together, but I need a pin to do it".
Alex was now feeling less disturbed. He had seen his Mommy using pins when she sewed. So he reached down and picked up a pin from the ground.
He handed it to the bunny who smiled and thanked him. Then he hopped away back into the dark. 
Alex smiled and went back to playing in the garden.
