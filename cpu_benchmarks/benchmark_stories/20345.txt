Tim and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to pretend they were animals. Tim was a lion and Lily was a monkey. They ran and jumped and roared and chattered.
"Let's go to the pond and see the fish," Lily said.
"Okay, but be careful. There might be an alligator," Tim said.
They went to the pond and looked at the water. They saw some fish swimming and some frogs hopping. They did not see an alligator.
"Look, there's a big orange ball in the water. Let's get it," Lily said.
She ran to the edge of the pond and reached for the ball. But it was not a ball. It was an alligator's head. The alligator opened its mouth and showed its teeth.
"Help, help, it's an alligator!" Lily screamed.
Tim heard Lily and ran to help her. He picked up a stick and threw it at the alligator. The alligator did not like the stick. It closed its mouth and turned away.
"Come on, Lily, let's go. We have to crawl away from the alligator," Tim said.
They crawled away from the pond as fast as they could. They did not stop until they reached the playground. They were safe.
"That was scary. I don't like alligators. They are mean and scary," Lily said.
"Me neither. They are not nice animals. Let's not play near the pond anymore. Let's play on the slide and the swings. They are fun and safe," Tim said.
They hugged each other and went to play on the slide and the swings. They were happy. They forgot about the alligator. They were still animals, but they were friendly animals.
