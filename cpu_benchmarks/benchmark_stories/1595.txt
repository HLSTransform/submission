Tom and Anna were playing in the yard when they saw dark clouds in the sky. They heard a loud boom and saw a bright flash. It was lightning and thunder.
"Let's go inside, Tom. It's scary out here," Anna said.
"No, I want to stay. I like the lightning. It's cool," Tom said.
He ran to the fence and tried to touch the lightning. Anna was scared for him. She urged him to come back.
"Tom, please. It's not safe. The lightning can hurt you. You can be strong and brave inside the house," she said.
But Tom did not listen. He reached out his hand to the lightning. He felt a shock and fell down. He cried out in pain.
Anna ran to him and hugged him. She called for their mom. Mom came out and saw what happened. She was angry and worried.
"Tom, what were you thinking? You could have been very hurt. You need to listen to Anna and me. We tell you things for your own good," she said.
She took Tom inside and put some ice on his hand. She gave him a hug and a kiss. She told him she loved him, but he had to be more careful.
Anna followed them inside. She was glad Tom was okay. She gave him a smile and a toy. She told him she loved him, too. She hoped he learned his lesson.
