Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a pair of scissors. The scissors were not sharp, they were dull. Tim wanted to cut paper with the scissors, but it was hard because they were dull.
One day, Tim's mom saw him trying to cut paper with the dull scissors. She felt sad for Tim. She wanted to help him. Tim's mom had an idea! She thought she could restore the scissors and make them sharp again.
Tim's mom took the dull scissors and worked on them. She made the scissors sharp. Now, Tim could cut paper easily! Tim was very happy. He thanked his mom for helping him. From that day on, Tim and his mom cut many things together with the restored scissors. They had lots of fun and made beautiful art.
