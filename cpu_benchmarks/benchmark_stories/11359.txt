The Chubby Rose.
Once there was a chubby rose who loved to travel. She stopped in many places, admiring the sights and sounds of her adventures. Everywhere she went she was given a warm welcome.
One day as she was travelling along she suddenly heard a loud voice. It was coming from a man. He was shouting at her, telling her to leave. The rose was very scared and she didn’t know why the man was acting so angry.
“What’s wrong?” the rose asked.
“You’re ruining my garden,” the man said. “You need to travel somewhere else.”
The rose didn’t want to leave as she had grown quite fond of the place. But she realised that the man was not going to let her stay.
So with a heavy heart, the chubby rose left and continued her travels. She was sad to have been forced to leave but she was still determined to find new places to visit and to have new adventures.
