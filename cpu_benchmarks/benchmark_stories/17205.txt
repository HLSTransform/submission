Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved wearing his favorite red shirt every day. One day, Timmy's mom washed his shirt and put it in the dryer. When she took it out, Timmy's shirt was too small! Timmy was confused and sad because he couldn't wear his favorite shirt anymore.
Later that day, Timmy's mom took him to the store to buy a new shirt. Timmy was excited to pick out a new shirt, but he was still confused about why his old shirt didn't fit. At the store, Timmy found a blue shirt that he loved. His mom said they could buy it, but they needed to add some money to their piggy bank first.
After they added some money to their piggy bank, Timmy's mom bought him the blue shirt. Timmy was so happy and couldn't wait to wear it. When they got home, Timmy's mom showed him that his old shirt had shrunk in the dryer. Timmy was no longer confused and was happy to have a new shirt to wear.
