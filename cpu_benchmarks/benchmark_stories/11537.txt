One day, a boy named Tom went to the store with his mom. They needed to buy some food for dinner. Tom saw a can of cheap soup on the shelf. He asked his mom, "Can I take this soup home?"
His mom said, "No, we have to make our own soup today." Tom was sad because he really wanted the cheap soup. He didn't want to make soup at home. Tom's mom saw that he was sad and said, "Don't worry, our soup will be much better than the cheap soup."
When they got home, Tom helped his mom make the soup. He cut the vegetables and stirred the pot. The soup smelled very good. Tom was happy that he helped make the soup. They sat down to eat, and Tom said, "This is the best soup ever!" His mom smiled and said, "I told you our soup would be better than the cheap soup."
