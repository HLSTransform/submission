Anna and Ben were playing in the garden. They had a big bucket of water and some cups. They liked to pour water on the flowers and on each other.
"Look, Anna, I can make a big splash!" Ben said. He filled his cup with water and threw it in the air.
Anna laughed and did the same. "Me too, me too!" she said. The water sparkled in the sun.
But they did not see the giant who lived next door. He was very grumpy and did not like noise. He was trying to take a nap, but the sound of the water and the children's laughter woke him up.
He opened his eyes and saw the water flying over the fence. He got very angry and decided to teach them a lesson. He grabbed his kettle, which was full of hot tea, and poured it over the fence.
"Ouch, ouch, ouch!" Anna and Ben screamed. The hot tea burned their skin and clothes. They ran inside the house, crying and wet.
"Who did that? Who did that?" their mom asked. She saw the steam and the tea stains on the fence. She knew it was the giant. She was very mad and called the police.
The police came and knocked on the giant's door. He opened it and saw their angry faces. He knew he was in trouble. He tried to say sorry, but it was too late. The police took him away and locked him up.
Anna and Ben learned to be careful with water and to respect their neighbors. The giant learned to be nice and to share his tea. They all lived happily ever after.
