Mia and her dad went to the store. Mia was so excited. She was looking for a card. Suddenly, she saw a card she liked. It had a pretty picture of a cat on it. Mia asked her dad, "Can I have it?" Dad said, "Yes".
They took the card to the counter. Mia's dad paid for it and the clerk gave them a bag. Then they walked out of the store.
Mia couldn't wait to give the card to her friend. She opened the bag, but the card was broken. Mia's dad looked at the card and said, "It doesn't fit." Mia was sad. She didn't want her friend to get a broken card.
Mia's dad had an idea. "Let's go back to the store," he said. So they went back and the clerk gave them a new card. It fit perfectly!
Mia was so happy. She gave the card to her friend and they both smiled.
