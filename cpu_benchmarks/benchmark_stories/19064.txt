Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and jump on his bed. But one day, he got in trouble for jumping on his bed too much. His mom said, "Timmy, if you keep jumping on your bed, you might break it!" 
Timmy didn't listen to his mom and continued to jump on his bed. Suddenly, he heard a loud CRACK and fell to the ground. His bed was broken! 
Timmy's mom was very upset and told him to go sit on the furniture in the living room. Timmy sat on the couch and thought about what he had done. He realized his mom was wise and knew what was best for him. From that day on, Timmy never jumped on his bed again.
