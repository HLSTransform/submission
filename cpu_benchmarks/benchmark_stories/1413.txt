Once upon a time there was a strong monster. The monster had one big tooth. But the monster was not happy. He wanted more teeth so he could eat more food.
One day the monster saw a young boy playing a game. He wanted the boy to give him a tooth. But the boy said no and ran away.
The angry monster chased the boy. The boy was too fast, so the monster destroyed things around him. He knocked over trees and broke rocks with his strong arms. Finally, the boy stopped and the monster was close enough to snatch his tooth.
The boy was scared, but he tried to stay brave. He opened his mouth, showed the monster his tooth, and said, "No, you can't have it!"
The monster was so surprised that the boy was brave enough to stand up to him. He smiled and promised not to destroy anything else. Then, he thanked the boy for his tooth and happily went on his way.
