Once upon a time there was a little girl called Amy. She was three years old. She loved to joke around. One day her parents took her to a lake. It was a big lake with lots of fish.
Amy looked around to see what she could do. She saw some little boats at the lake. She asked her Dad if she could go in one. He said yes.
So Amy went into one of the boats. She saw lots of other boats around her. Amy was laughing and joking. Everyone around her was laughing too.
Soon Amy found she was getting hungry. She asked her Dad if there was any food available. He said yes and soon they were eating lunch together at the lake.
Amy had a wonderful time. She was still joking around and having fun. After a few hours, it was time to leave the lake. Amy and her parents said goodbye to the lake and all the other people who were laughing and joking.
