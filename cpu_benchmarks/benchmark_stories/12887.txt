Mum and little Robby were out walking in the park on a sunny day. They passed by a big tree and Robby said, “Look! A tree!” Mum smiled and said, “Yes Robby, that’s a big, lively tree.” 
Robby ran up to the tree and put his hands on the bark. Then, he saw a squirrel running up the trunk and shouted to Mum, “Mum, the squirrel is hurrying!” Mum laughed and said, “Yes, he’s in a hurry to get some nuts!”
Robby started running after the squirrel. He ran around the tree, but it was too quick and he couldn’t keep up. After a while, Robby stopped running, looking up at the lively tree and said, “Bye bye, squirrel. Maybe next time!”
