Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max loved to play with his friends at the park. They would run and jump and laugh together. 
One day, Max's friend Spot invited him to a lab. Max was curious and excited to see what a lab was. When he got there, he saw lots of beakers and test tubes. Spot's owner was a scientist and she was doing experiments. 
Max and Spot started to play a game of fetch in the lab. They were both very competitive and wanted to win. Max threw the ball far and Spot ran to get it. They both laughed when Spot accidentally knocked over a beaker. Luckily, nothing broke and they continued to play. Max had a great time at the lab with his friend Spot.
