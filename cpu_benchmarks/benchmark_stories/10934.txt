Once upon a time, there was a big dog. He loved to run and play all day long. One day, he went for a walk in the park. Suddenly, he saw a squirrel and started to chase it. But the ground was wet and he slipped! 
The dog fell down and hurt his paw. He tried to stand up, but he couldn't. He was scared and alone. His owner was distant, and he didn't know how to find him. 
But then, a little girl saw him and came to help. She petted him and gave him some water. She even called his owner on her phone! The dog was so happy and grateful. He realized that even when you slip and fall, there are always kind people who will help you.
