Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. Amy had a wild dream. In her dream, she saw a big, beautiful bird. The bird could talk! It said, "Hello, Amy! I need your help."
Amy asked, "How can I help you, bird?" The bird said, "I lost my family. Please pray for me to find them." Amy closed her eyes and prayed. She said, "Please help the bird find his family."
When Amy opened her eyes, the bird was smiling. "Thank you, Amy," the bird said. "I found my family because of your prayer." Then, Amy woke up from her dream. She felt happy to help the bird.
Amy told her mom about her dream. Her mom said, "That's a nice story, Amy. It shows that we should always help others, even in our dreams." Amy learned that it is good to be kind and help others when they need it.
