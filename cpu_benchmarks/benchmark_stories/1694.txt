Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play outside in the park. One day, she saw a beautiful butterfly. "Look, mommy! A pretty butterfly!" she said. "Can we bring it home?" 
"No, Lily. The butterfly belongs in the world outside," her mommy replied. 
Lily was sad, but then she saw a colorful flower. "Mommy, this flower is so attractive! Can we bring it home?" 
"No, Lily. The flower belongs in the world outside, too. It needs sunshine and rain to grow," her mommy explained. 
Lily understood and continued to play in the park, enjoying the beauty of the world around her.
