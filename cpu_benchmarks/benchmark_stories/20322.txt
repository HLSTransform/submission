Ben and Mia are friends. They like to play outside. One day, they see a big cliff near the forest. The cliff is very high and has many rocks.
"Let's go to the cliff," Ben says. "We can have fun there."
"OK," Mia says. "But we need a plan. The cliff is dangerous. We don't want to fall."
They think for a while. Then they have a plan. They find a long rope and a big stick. They tie the rope to the stick. They hold the stick and the rope together.
"Now we can swing over the cliff," Ben says. "It will be like flying."
They go to the edge of the cliff. They see a black bird flying in the sky. They wave to the bird.
"Ready?" Ben asks.
"Ready!" Mia says.
They swing the stick and the rope. They feel the wind in their hair. They laugh and shout. They swing over the cliff and back. They have a lot of fun.
They do it again and again. They are not afraid of the cliff. They are brave and happy. They are the best friends.
