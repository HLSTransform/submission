Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and toys every day. One day, Lily's mom asked her what she wanted to do when she grew up. Lily said she wanted to be a doctor and help people feel better.
Lily's mom smiled and said, "That's a great goal, Lily! But being a doctor is not easy. You need to study a lot and work hard to become one."
Lily thought about it and said, "I plan to study every day and ask my teacher for help when I need it. I know it will be hard, but I want to help people."
Lily's mom was proud of her and said, "That's a good plan, Lily. I know you can do it!" From that day on, Lily worked hard every day to achieve her goal of becoming a doctor.
