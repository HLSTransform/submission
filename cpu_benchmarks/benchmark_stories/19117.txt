Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play hide and seek with her friends. One day, she was hiding behind a big tree when she saw a cop walking by. The cop was looking for a lost kitten.
Lily was scared because she was hidden and didn't want the cop to find her. She whispered to herself, "I need to release my fear and be brave." 
Suddenly, the cop heard Lily's whisper and asked, "Are you hiding from me, little one?" 
Lily replied, "Yes, but I'm not a bad guy. I'm just playing hide and seek with my friends." 
The cop smiled and said, "That's okay. I'm just looking for a lost kitten. Do you want to help me find it?" 
Lily was happy to help and together they searched for the kitten. They found it in a tree and the cop climbed up to release it. Lily was so happy that she made a new friend and helped a lost kitten.
