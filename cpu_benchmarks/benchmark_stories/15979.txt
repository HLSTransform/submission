Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toy basket and fill it with all sorts of things like toys and snacks. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and saw a scary man who looked angry. She was scared and held onto her mom tightly.
Suddenly, the man came over and asked Lily if he could have her basket. Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. Her mom told her to be brave and say no. So, Lily said no and the man walked away. Later, Lily and her mom saw the man destroy a nearby bench. Lily was sad and scared again.
Her mom explained that sometimes people do bad things and it's important to be brave and say no to them. She also told Lily that it's important to take care of our things, like her basket, so they don't get destroyed. From that day on, Lily always remembered to be brave and take care of her things.
