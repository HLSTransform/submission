Jimmy was a three-year-old boy. He was popular because everyone liked him. He liked to go out and look around. One perfect day he decided to stare at the sky. He saw some beautiful fluffy clouds and some high birds. He smiled and pointed at them while he stared.
Jimmy saw a butterfly and followed it with his eyes. He was so happy! The butterfly flew away but Jimmy kept staring. Next he saw lots of colourful leaves on the trees and he was so excited. He wanted to pick one and take it home.
Jimmy kept staring at different things and he was so curious about everything. Finally he looked around at the park and all the people playing. He saw that everyone was having fun and he was too. That day was so special.
