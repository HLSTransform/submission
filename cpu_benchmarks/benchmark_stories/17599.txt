Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she was playing hide and seek with her friend, Teddy, under a big tree. They were having so much fun that they didn't realize how much time had passed.
Suddenly, Lily's mom called out to her, "Lily, it's time to come inside for lunch." Lily and Teddy ran out from under the tree and into the shade of the porch. They were both very hungry and couldn't wait to eat.
As they sat down to eat, Teddy noticed that Lily's lunch was very poor. She only had a small sandwich and an apple. "Lily, why don't you have more food?" Teddy asked. Lily replied, "My mom doesn't have a lot of money right now, so we have to be careful with what we eat."
Teddy felt sad for Lily and realized that not everyone has as much as he does. From that day on, he made sure to share his snacks with Lily whenever they played together.
