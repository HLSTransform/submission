Bob was feeling very nervous. He had a long walk ahead of him. But he was excited too, because he had a special surprise at the end of the walk.
Every few steps he walked, Bob looked up. There was something special hanging in the sky. He could not see it, but he knew what it was and he was excited.
When they finally arrived at their destination, Bob was even more nervous. He was glad his surprise was near. As they walked through the door, they saw the surprise hanging on the wall. Bob's eyes widened and he shouted, "A treasure map, I can't believe it!".
They had arrived at Bob's house and the treasure map was hanging right in the middle. Bob was overwhelmed with excitement and was so happy to find the map. He had been nervous about the long walk, but it was worth it.
Bob and his friends started their adventure to find the treasure. They were happy and had lots of fun. This was the best surprise ever!
