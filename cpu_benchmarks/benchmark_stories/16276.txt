Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Amy. She was three years old and loved adventures. One day, Amy found a secret chamber in her backyard. Anxious to explore, she opened the door of the chamber. Suddenly, Amy heard a loud rumble. When she looked inside, she saw a huge monster! 
The monster shouted, "I will destroy you!". Amy was scared but bravely said, "No, you won't!". The monster became angry and charged towards her. 
She ran outside and shouted for help. Then, her parents heard her cry and quickly came outside. They saw the monster and shouted, "Go away!". The monster was scared and ran away. 
Amy was relieved and hugged her parents. From that day onwards, she always thought twice before exploring any mysterious chambers.
