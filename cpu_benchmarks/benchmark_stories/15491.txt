There was once a little girl who lived in a town. One day she went outside to play, but she could see something strange in the sky. It was a tornado! It slowly moved closer to the town and the little girl was scared. The tornado was spinning round and round, and it was very strong.
The little girl's family quickly ran inside the house and hid. She was so scared that she started shaking. But when the tornado was really close she felt something moving. It was so big and powerful.
 From her window she could see that it was so fragile. It was spinning around and around, but it was also very gentle.
The tornado eventually moved away and the little girl and her family were safe. When they went outside they saw how fragile the tornado had been. They were very grateful that they were all safe. And the little girl never forgot what she saw that day.
