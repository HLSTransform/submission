Lily loved her kitten, Fluffy. Fluffy was small and soft and liked to play with Lily. Lily liked to hug Fluffy and give her milk and toys.
One day, Lily's mom said they had to go to the store. Lily wanted to take Fluffy with her, but mom said no. Mom said Fluffy had to remain at home, because the store was not a good place for kittens.
"But why?" Lily asked. "Fluffy is good and cute. She will not make trouble."
Mom said, "The store is big and loud and has many people and things. Fluffy might get scared or lost or hurt. She will be happier and safer at home, where she knows everything."
Lily was sad, but she understood. She kissed Fluffy and said, "I will be back soon, Fluffy. You remain here and be good. I love you."
Fluffy meowed and licked Lily's face. She watched Lily and mom leave, then curled up on Lily's bed. She missed Lily, but she was glad to be in her cozy and quiet home. She dreamed of playing with Lily again.
