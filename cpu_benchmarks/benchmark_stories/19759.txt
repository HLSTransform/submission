Mommy was anxious. She wanted to leave and get to work. She looked around the house for something she needed. Suddenly, Mommy spotted something. It was a newspaper! She picked it up, put it in her bag, and left.
When she was gone, the house felt empty. It was so quiet.
Then, something amazing happened. The newspaper she had taken with her flew back into the room and opened up. On the pages were pictures of fun places and animals.
The 3 year old was so excited! She ran around the house looking at all the pictures. She imagined going to the zoo and to the park. She even dreamed of riding a roller coaster!
With a big smile on her face, the 3 year old felt happy. Mommy's absence was not so bad after all!
