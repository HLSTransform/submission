Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lily. She was three years old and very curious about the world. One day, Lily was playing in the garden and she stubbed her knee on a rock. It hurt her very badly and she started to cry. 
A big, kind lady heard Lily's crying and took her into her arms. 
The kind lady asked Lily why she was so upset and Lily told her about the rock. The kind lady smiled and said to Lily, "I know exactly what to do." She then showed Lily how she could use her knee to stand up again. 
Lily was so thankful and she learned that it was useful to have a knee. This helped her to stand strong, without needing anyone's help. 
The moral of the story is that having a knee can be very useful and it helps you with many different things. You should never give up, no matter how hard something is.
