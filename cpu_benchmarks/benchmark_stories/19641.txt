John was sad. He wanted a stamp but he did not know where to find one. He looked everywhere but he could not find one. He asked his mother, "Please, where can I get a stamp?" His mother said, "Honey, why don't you try the deep blue lake?". So John went to the deep blue lake. He looked in the water and he saw a stamp! He reached into the water, and he grabbed the stamp. He was so happy, he thanked his mother and ran back outside. He showed the stamp to all of his friends, and they were so impressed! He was so glad that he found the stamp at the deep blue lake.
