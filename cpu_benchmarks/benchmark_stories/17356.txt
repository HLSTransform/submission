Lily and Ben were very happy. They were going to a safari with Mom and Dad. A safari was a big place with many animals. They could see lions, elephants, giraffes and more.
They got in the car and drove for a long time. They saw signs with pictures of animals. They were getting closer to the safari. Lily and Ben looked out the window and tried to spot the animals.
They arrived at the safari gate. Mom and Dad had to buy tickets. They gave money to a man and he gave them paper. The paper was the tickets. They showed the tickets to another man and he let them in.
They drove into the safari. They saw many animals. Some were big, some were small, some were furry, some were scaly. Lily and Ben pointed and shouted the names of the animals. They were very excited.
But then they saw a big lion. The lion was lying on the road. He looked angry. He roared at the car. Lily and Ben were scared. They were worried. They wanted the lion to go away. Mom and Dad were worried too. They did not know what to do.
They honked the horn. They hoped the lion would move. But the lion did not move. He roared again. He showed his big teeth. Lily and Ben cried. They hugged each other.
Then they heard another sound. It was a truck. The truck was coming from behind. The truck had a man with a big hat. The man with the big hat was a ranger. He worked at the safari. He knew how to deal with the animals.
The ranger stopped the truck. He got out. He had a stick. He waved the stick at the lion. He said some words. The lion looked at the ranger. He stopped roaring. He got up. He walked away.
The ranger smiled. He waved at Mom and Dad. He said sorry for the trouble. He said the lion was just resting. He said they could go on. He got back in the truck. He drove away.
Lily and Ben were happy again. They were not scared anymore. They were not worried anymore. They thanked the ranger. They said bye to the lion. They saw more animals. They had fun at the safari.
