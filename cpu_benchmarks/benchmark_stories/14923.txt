Once upon a time, there was a car that wanted to go very fast. So it ran to the gas station and filled up its tank with fuel. The car was so excited!
Then it started to spin round and round, faster and faster. The car was going so fast that it was making lots of smoke. The smoke was so thick and dark, it was like a cloud!
But then something bad happened. The fuel ran out, and the car stopped spinning. It was stuck and no one could help, not even the car!
The car was so sad, it never got to go fast again. It spent the rest of its days just standing still in the same spot. The End.
