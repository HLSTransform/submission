Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Sara. She was only three years old and was excited to go for a walk with her dad. 
In the park, Sara saw a bird. She looked at it and asked, "What is that, daddy?" Her dad said, "It's a dead bird." 
Sara felt sad and asked, "Why is it dead?" Her dad explained, "It did not stay safe, so it passed away." 
Sara then said, "I want to stay safe too. I don't want to be dead." Her dad smiled at her and said, "You can stay safe. Just look both ways when you cross the street." 
So Sara took her dad's advice and stayed safe every time she went walking. She always looked both ways before crossing the street and stayed safe!
