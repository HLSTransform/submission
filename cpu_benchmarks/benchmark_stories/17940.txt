One day, a little boy named Tim found a big stamp in his toy box. It was dark and had a picture of a star on it. Tim was very happy and wanted to use the stamp on his drawings.
He showed the stamp to his mom. "Look, Mom! I found a stamp!" he said. She smiled and encouraged him, "That's great, Tim! You can use it on your drawings to make them even more special."
Tim went to his room and started drawing. He drew a big sun, a happy tree, and a funny dog. Then, he used the dark stamp to put stars all around the sun, tree, and dog. Tim was so proud of his drawings.
Later, Tim's dad came home and saw the drawings. "Wow, Tim! These are amazing! I love the stars you added with your dark stamp," he said. Tim felt very happy that his dad liked his drawings too.
From that day on, Tim used his dark stamp on all his drawings. He loved how it made his pictures look even better. And his mom and dad always encouraged him to keep drawing and using his special stamp.
