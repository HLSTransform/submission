Once upon a time, there was a tall goat named Billy. Billy loved to eat grass and play in the sunshine. One day, Billy went for a walk in the woods. He saw a little girl named Lily who was struggling to carry a big basket of apples. 
"Hello, little girl," said Billy. "Do you need some help?"
"Yes, please," said Lily. "This basket is too heavy for me."
Billy helped Lily carry the basket of apples all the way to her house. "Thank you, Billy," said Lily. "You're a very kind goat."
From that day on, Billy and Lily became good friends. They played together in the fields and ate apples under the tall trees. Billy was happy to have helped his new friend.
