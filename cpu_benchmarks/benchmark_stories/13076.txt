Once upon a time there was a fearful little swan. The swan was scared of the big lake it lived in because there were a lot of things that could hurt it. One day, the swan wanted to be brave and explore the lake. So it ran and ran, swimming far and fast with its wings.
 
The swan went deeper and deeper into the lake, feeling braver and braver with every stroke. Soon, it saw a school of fish that were so colourful and so beautiful. The swan smiled and kept swimming until it arrived at a little cave. 
The swan wanted to explore the cave, but it was very scared. Its heart started to beat faster and it wanted to run away. But it took a deep breath and decided to go in anyway. 
Inside the cave, the swan was surprised to find a lot of other swans swimming around. All the swans welcomed the little frightened swan and it instantly felt happy and safe in their presence. The brave little swan immediately knew it had made the right choice to explore the lake and had made some new, special friends.
