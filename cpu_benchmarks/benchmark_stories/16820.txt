Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch movies. One day, he went to the store and saw a movie he wanted. He grabbed it and went home.
When Timmy got home, he started to watch the movie. But it was a sad movie and it made him feel sad too. Timmy didn't like feeling sad, so he turned off the movie and went to bed.
The next day, Timmy wanted to watch the movie again. But when he looked for it, he couldn't find it. He looked and looked, but it was gone. Timmy was sad again. He never found his favorite movie and he never felt happy again. The end.
