Once upon a time there was a puppy named Jack. He was very restless and always wanted to play. One day, his master took him out on a leash. Jack was so happy to be outside and ready to explore the world around him. 
Then, his master bent down and whispered something in Jack’s ear. Jack didn’t understand what was said, but he wagged his tail in excitement. His master then took him further away to explore new places. 
Suddenly, Jack noticed a rabbit, so he started to bark. His master knew he wouldn’t be able to contain Jack, so he quickly pulled the leash and whispered, “No, Jack.” Jack obediently sat down and stopped barking. 
Jack was so glad to be outside and explore the world with his master. He was happy that his master was there to take care of him and keep him safe.
