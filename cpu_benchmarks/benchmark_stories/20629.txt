Jake was on the hunt for a new pet. He looked at many animals, but none of them seemed just right for him. As he walked through the pet store, he noticed something unusual. It was a cactus with little pinchy spikes. Jake smiled and thought to himself, "I like this cactus. It is clean and green. It looks like it needs a home, just like me."
Jake brought the cactus to the counter, and the pet store worker smiled at him. He said that the cactus needed special care and warned Jake to be careful not to pinch himself on the spiky green plant. Jake nodded and took his new pet home.
He carefully placed the cactus in his bedroom, directly beside the windowsill. Every morning, Jake would wake up and take a close look at his cactus, carefully brushing its prickly spikes, making sure it stayed clean and healthy. 
Every night, when Jake went to bed, he would leave a treat, like a bit of honey or some sprinkles, for the cactus. Over time, Jake realized that the cactus had become his very special friend. It was always there to listen and never judged him, no matter how he was feeling. Jake and the cactus were now friendly pals.
