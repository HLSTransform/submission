Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the park with his mommy and daddy. One day, they went to the park and saw a big, smelly skunk. Timmy said, "Ew, that skunk is so smelly!"
His mommy said, "Yes, skunks are very smelly. We need to stay away from it." 
Just then, a man walked by and said, "Welcome to the park! Did you see the skunk?" 
Timmy's daddy said, "Yes, we saw the smelly skunk. We're trying to stay away from it." 
The man said, "Good idea. That skunk can strip the paint off a car with its smell!" Timmy and his family decided to play on the other side of the park, far away from the smelly skunk. They had a great time playing together and went home happy.
