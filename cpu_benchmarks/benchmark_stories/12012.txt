Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with marbles. One day, she was skipping down the street when she saw her friend, Tommy.
"Hi Tommy!" Lily said enthusiastically. "Do you want to play marbles with me?"
Tommy smiled and said, "Yes please, I love playing marbles!"
So Lily and Tommy sat down on the sidewalk and started to play. They took turns shooting their marbles and trying to knock each other's marbles out of the circle.
After a while, Lily said, "I'm having so much fun playing with you, Tommy. We should do this more often!"
Tommy nodded and said, "I agree, skipping and playing marbles with you is the best!"
