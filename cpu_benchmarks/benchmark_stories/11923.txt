Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a lot of stuff, like dolls and toys. One day, her friend Timmy came to play with her. Timmy really liked one of Lily's dolls and asked if he could play with it. But Lily didn't want to share her stuff because she was being selfish.
Timmy said, "Lily, it's not nice to be selfish. You should share your stuff with me."
Lily didn't believe him at first, but then she thought about it and realized that it's better to share than to be selfish. So, she gave Timmy the doll to play with and they had a lot of fun together.
From that day on, Lily learned that sharing is important and it makes her feel happy when she does. She believed that being kind to others is the right thing to do.
