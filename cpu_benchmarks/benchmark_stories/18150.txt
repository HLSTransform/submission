Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max had a toy with a zipper on it. He loved to bite the toy and play with the zipper all day long.
One day, Max saw a big, patient cat named Luna. Luna was sitting in the sun, watching Max play with his toy. Max wanted to be friends with Luna, so he took his toy to her.
Max showed Luna how to bite the toy and play with the zipper. Luna liked the toy, too. They took turns biting the toy and playing with the zipper. Max and Luna became good friends and played together every day. And they lived happily ever after.
