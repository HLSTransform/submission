Once upon a time in a small town, there was a little girl named Amy. Amy had long hair that she loved very much. But one day, her mom said, "Amy, it's time for a haircut!" Amy was scared, but she knew her mom would make her hair look perfect.
At the haircut place, Amy sat in the big chair. The lady who cut her hair was nice. She gave Amy a kiss on her cheek and said, "Don't worry, your haircut will be perfect." Amy closed her eyes and let the lady cut her hair.
When the haircut was done, Amy looked in the mirror. Her hair was short and perfect! She was so happy. She gave her mom a big kiss and said, "Thank you, Mommy! I love my perfect haircut!" And they went home, smiling and holding hands.
