Anna liked to read books. She had many books on her bookshelf. She liked to look at the pictures and the words. Sometimes she read with her mom or dad. Sometimes she read by herself.
One day, it was very cold outside. Anna saw the snow and the ice. She wanted to play in the snow. But her mom said, "No, it is too icy. You might slip and fall. You can play inside with your toys or your books."
Anna was sad. She did not want to play inside. She wanted to play outside. She was angry at her mom. She went to her room and slammed the door. She saw her bookshelf. She did not want to read. She wanted to make a mess. She pulled the books from the shelf and threw them on the floor. She snapped the pages and the covers. She ripped the pictures and the words.
She heard a loud noise. She looked at the bookshelf. It was broken. The wood was cracked and the nails were loose. The shelf fell down and hit the floor. Anna was scared. She cried. She knew she did a bad thing.
Her mom heard the noise and came to her room. She saw the broken bookshelf and the torn books. She was sad and angry. She said, "Anna, what did you do? Why did you break your bookshelf and your books? You know you should not do that. You should be careful and gentle with your things. You should be sorry."
Anna was sorry. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I was mad. I wanted to play outside. I did not want to read. I did not mean to break my bookshelf and my books. I love my books. Can you fix them?"
Her mom hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, too, Anna. I know you wanted to play outside. But it was too icy. It was not safe. Maybe tomorrow it will be warmer and we can play outside. I can try to fix your bookshelf and some of your books. But some of them are too damaged. You will have to get new ones. You will have to be more careful and respectful with your things. Do you understand?"
Anna nodded and said, "I understand, mom. I will be more careful and respectful. I will not snap my books again. I will read them and love them. Thank you, mom."
Her mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, Anna. I love you."
They cleaned up the mess and picked up the books. They found some books that were not too bad. They read them together and cuddled. Anna felt better. She learned a lesson. She was happy.
