Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, as she was playing in the park, she saw her friend Johnny crying. 
Lily went up to Johnny and asked, "What's wrong?" 
Johnny sniffled and said, "I lost my toy car." 
Lily felt thoughtful and wanted to help her friend. She looked around and saw the toy car in the grass. She picked it up and said, "Here, I found your car. I'll give it back to you." 
Johnny smiled and said, "Thank you, Lily. You're the best friend ever." 
Lily felt happy that she could make Johnny smile again. They continued playing in the park until noon, when it was time to go home. From that day on, Lily and Johnny were even closer friends.
