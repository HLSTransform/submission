Tim was feeling a bit scruffy, so he decided to go and get a haircut. He took some money to pay for it and went off to the barber. When he arrived there, the barber was ready and waiting.
The barber had to cut away a lot of Tim's hair, but when he was finished, Tim looked very smart. He paid the barber and went out into the sunshine.
On the way home, Tim stopped at a shop to buy an ice-cream. He chose a sour one and it was so delicious! He licked it all up and went on his way. He was feeling very happy with his new haircut.
When he arrived home, he showed his family his new hairstyle. Everyone thought it looked great and he was very proud of it.
From then on, Tim was always sure to get a haircut whenever he needed one. He was always happy to pay for a nice new look!
