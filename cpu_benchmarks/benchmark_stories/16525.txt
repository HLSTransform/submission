Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat yummy snacks. One day, she went to her grandma's house and saw a big cake on the table. "Wow, that cake looks delicious!" she said.
Her grandma smiled and said, "Yes, it's my special recipe. Do you want to try a piece?" Lily nodded eagerly and took a bite. "Mmm, it's so yummy!" she exclaimed.
As she ate, her grandma whispered to her, "Can you guess what shape the cake is?" Lily looked closely and said, "It's a heart shape!" Her grandma smiled and said, "That's right! You have a good eye for shapes."
Lily finished her cake and hugged her grandma. "Thank you for the delicious cake and for teaching me about shapes," she said. Her grandma hugged her back and whispered, "You're welcome, my dear. Anytime."
