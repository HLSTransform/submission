John was a poor boy. He didn't have many toys. Every day he asked his mom for something new, but she could NOT give him anything. 
One day John went for a walk outside. He found a little mineral that sparkled in the sunshine. He picked it up and put it in his pocket. He was so happy!
John took the mineral back home and showed it to his mom. His mom smiled and took him back outside and asked him to find more minerals. John asked why, and his mom said it was a surprise. 
John ran and ran, searching everywhere. He found many minerals and carefully put them in his pocket. When he was finished, he ran back to his mom, who was surprised! She told John they were going to make something special with the minerals.
Together, they went back inside and made a necklace. The necklace was beautiful and it sparkled in the sunlight. Every time he wanted to feel special, John would put on the necklace and repeat to himself, "I am special." 
John never forgot that special day. He always found joy in the simple things, like his mineral necklace.
