Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the beach with her family. One day, while playing in the sand, Lily's mom noticed something troubling in the water. She told Lily's dad, "We need to measure the water to see if it's safe to swim." 
Lily's dad went to get a measuring tape, but when he came back, he saw that Lily had already gone into the water. He quickly ran after her, but it was too late. Lily had been caught in a strong current and was struggling to stay afloat. 
Lily's parents tried to save her, but the current was too strong. Sadly, Lily drowned that day. Her parents were very sad and wished they had measured the water before letting Lily go in. From then on, they always made sure to measure the water before going for a swim.
