Lila and Ben were playing on the beach. They liked to dig in the sand and look for shells. They found many shells of different colors and shapes. Some were big, some were small, some were smooth, some were rough.
"Look, Lila, I found a weird shell!" Ben said, holding up a shell that was round and spiky. "It has little holes in it. What do you think is inside?"
Lila looked at the shell and shrugged. "I don't know. Maybe a bug or a fish. Do you want to open it and see?"
Ben nodded. He was curious. He tried to pull the shell apart, but it was too hard. He tried to hit it with a rock, but it was too strong. He tried to poke it with a stick, but it was too sharp.
"Ow!" Ben cried, dropping the shell. "It hurt me!"
Lila ran to him and hugged him. "Are you okay, Ben? Let me see your hand."
Ben showed her his hand. It had a small cut and a drop of blood. Lila took a tissue from her pocket and wrapped it around his hand.
"It's okay, Ben. It's just a little cut. It will heal soon. Don't touch the shell anymore. It's mean."
Ben nodded. He felt better. He looked at the shell and saw something move inside. He gasped.
"Lila, look! The shell is alive! Something is coming out of it!"
Lila looked at the shell and saw a small creature with legs and claws and eyes. It was a crab. It crawled out of the shell and scuttled away.
"Wow!" Lila said. "It was a crab! It was hiding in the shell. It was scared of us. That's why it hurt you. It wanted to protect itself."
Ben nodded. He understood. He felt sorry for the crab. He wished he had not tried to open the shell.
"I'm sorry, crab," Ben said. "I didn't mean to hurt you. I hope you find a new shell. A nice one. Goodbye, crab."
Lila smiled. She took Ben's hand and they walked away. They left the shell on the sand. They hoped the crab would release it and find a new home. They learned something new that day. They learned that some shells are weird, but some shells are alive.
