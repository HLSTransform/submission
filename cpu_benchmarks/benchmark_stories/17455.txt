Jill and Tom liked to play in the park. They had a ball, a kite and a whistle. The whistle was Jill's favorite toy. She liked to blow it and make high sounds. Tom liked to kick the ball and run after it.
One day, they saw a big dog in the park. The dog was black and white and had a long tail. The dog ran to them and wanted to play. Jill and Tom were scared. They did not know the dog. They ran away from the dog, but the dog followed them.
"Go away, dog!" Tom shouted. He threw the ball at the dog, but the dog caught it and ran with it.
"Help, help!" Jill cried. She blew the whistle, but the dog did not care. The dog came closer and closer to Jill.
Then, they heard a voice. It was the dog's owner. He was a man with a hat and a coat. He called the dog's name.
"Spot, Spot, come here!" the man said. He had a part in his hair and a smile on his face. He was not angry. He was sorry.
"I'm sorry, kids. Spot is a friendly dog. He just wanted to play with you. He likes balls and whistles. He does not mean to scare you." the man said.
He gave the ball and the whistle back to Tom and Jill. He petted Spot and put a leash on him. He said goodbye and walked away with Spot.
Tom and Jill were happy. They were not scared anymore. They played with the ball and the whistle again. They learned that some dogs are nice and some people are kind. They had fun in the park.
