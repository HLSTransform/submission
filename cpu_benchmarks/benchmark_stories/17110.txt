Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to read books because they made her happy. One day, she went to the library to find a new book to read. But when she got there, she saw that all the popular books were already borrowed by other kids.
Lily felt sad because she really wanted to read those books. As she was walking away, she saw a boy named Max. Max had a lip that was different from other kids. Some kids made fun of him because of it. But Lily didn't care about that. She walked up to Max and asked if he wanted to read a book with her.
Max was happy to have a friend to read with. They found a book that they both liked and started to read together. They forgot about the popular books and enjoyed their time together. Lily realized that having a friend to read with was more important than reading a popular book. From that day on, Lily and Max became good friends and read books together every week.
