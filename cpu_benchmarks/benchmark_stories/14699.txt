Once there was a monster, and he was very worried. He was worried because he had a lot of pain. He tried to make the pain go away, but it didn't work. Suddenly he roared. He roared very loudly. Everyone around was scared and tried to run away. But the monster kept roaring more and more. He was so scared and in pain that he didn't know what else to do.
Just then, a small mouse came up to the monster and asked, "Why are you roaring?"
The monster was so surprised to hear a small mouse talking to him. He told the mouse that he was in a lot of pain and was very worried.
The mouse said, "Don't worry, I can help you! I'll get some of my friends and we can help make your pain go away."
The monster was very happy to hear this. He thanked the mouse and soon enough, a group of little mice had gathered around him. They nibbled on the monster's pain and soon, it went away.
The monster was so thankful and was no longer scared or worried. He hugged the little mouse and all of his friends and thanked them for helping him. Everyone was happy and the monster was never scared or worried again.
