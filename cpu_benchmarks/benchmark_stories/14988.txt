Mona was a three year old girl. She had a bunch of colorful toys in her room. Mona saw some purple toys that she wanted to play with. She grabbed a purple toy and a purple bucket. Mona smiled at the purple bucket.
Mona went into her kitchen and found some yogurt. She opened the yogurt and put it into the purple bucket.
Mona's mom walked into the kitchen. She saw Mona with the yogurt and purple bucket. Mona's mom asked, "What are you doing, Mona?"
Mona smiled and said, "I'm sorting yogurt into the purple bucket!"
Mona's mom smiled, too. She said, "That's okay, Mona. You can sort the yogurt if you want."
So Mona kept on sorting the yogurt into the purple bucket until it was all gone. Mona was very proud of her sorting skills. She smiled and proudly said, "I did it!"
