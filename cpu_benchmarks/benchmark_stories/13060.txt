Once there was a fair girl named Lucy who wanted to take a surprise on a journey. She asked her mom for help and together they started to unpack their car. It was getting dark outside, so Lucy's mom packed a lantern. Lucy was excited to see what was inside the box. She eagerly opened it and found a toy horse. She smiled and hugged it tight, excited to take it on her journey. Later they packed the toy horse, the lantern and many other things. Soon they were ready to start their adventure. As they drove away, Lucy smilled, happy to take her surprise with her.
