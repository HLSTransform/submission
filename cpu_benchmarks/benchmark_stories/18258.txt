Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her toys and read books. One day, Lily's mom told her that they were going to have a surprise visitor. 
Lily asked, "Who is coming to visit us?" 
Her mom said, "It's a surprise, but I need you to help me get ready. Can you please open the curtains and let the sunshine in?" 
Lily jumped up and ran to the window. She opened the curtains and saw a beautiful chair outside. She wondered if the surprise visitor would sit in the chair. 
Later that day, Lily's grandma came to visit. She sat in the chair outside and said, "Thank you for allowing me to sit in this comfy chair. It's perfect for enjoying the sunshine." 
Lily smiled and felt happy that she helped her mom prepare for the surprise visitor. She also felt proud that she opened the curtains and saw the beautiful chair.
