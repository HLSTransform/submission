Once upon a time, there was a shy bunny named Benny. Benny had a big opinion about carrots, he loved them! One day, Benny was hopping in the meadow when he heard some other bunnies teasing him. They said, "Benny, you're so shy! You need to be brave like us and try new things!" Benny felt sad and didn't know what to do. 
Just then, a friendly squirrel named Sammy came along and asked Benny what was wrong. Benny told Sammy about the other bunnies teasing him and Sammy said, "Don't listen to them Benny, they don't know your opinion about carrots. You should be proud of who you are!" Benny felt better and thanked Sammy for his kind words. 
From then on, Benny didn't feel so shy anymore. He knew that it was okay to have his own opinion and that he didn't have to listen to the other bunnies teasing him. Benny continued to hop in the meadow, enjoying his favorite food - carrots!
