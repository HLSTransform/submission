Once upon a time, there was a flower named Rose. Rose was very pretty, but she felt sad and lonely. Then one day, the sun shone down on her and she began to bloom. She opened her petals and felt so happy that she was able to bloom with the other flowers.
Rose started to learn about the truth of the world. She found out that patience was the key to finding joy. Gradually, she became less impatient, and more understanding of the things she couldn't control. 
Soon, it was time for Rose to bloom again! She opened her beautiful petals and stretched towards the sky. All the other flowers cheered for her accomplishment and she felt proud. Rose had learned that with patience, everything can bloom.
