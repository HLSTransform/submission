Once upon a time, there was a boy called John. He wanted to design something special. So finally he decided to design a kite. He went to buy all the materials he needed to make it.
John thought it was a very exciting idea to design and make a kite. He drew the shape of the kite and cut the paper piece by piece. He colourfully decorated and stuck them together until he made a beautiful kite.
John went to the park to show his kite to his friends. His friends were amazed by his kite and laughed with excitement. They also wanted to make their own kite. John was very happy.
Suddenly, the wind was blowing very strongly. It carried all the kites away. Except John's! His was the only one that stayed on the ground because he designed it to be very strong. All his friends laughed at their own kites because they had designed them too stupidly. But John just smiled because he had designed perfectly.
