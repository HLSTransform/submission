Once there was a frog named Fred. He lived in a small town and he loved to swim. Every day he would jump into the pond near his house and swim around. One day, Fred decided to swim further out of town.
He passed by some busy streets and he saw lots of people walking around. But he didn't stop. He kept swimming further and further away.
Finally, Fred reached a large lake. It was crystal clear and he could see lots of little fish swimming around. He was so happy to be here! He swam around, exploring the lake and having fun.
But while he was swimming, Fred suddenly heard a sound in the distance. It sounded like someone was calling his name. He swam closer, and he saw two little frogs waiting for him on the shore. It was his brother and sister!
He had a feeling that this lake would bring him big adventures with his family, and he was right! He and his siblings spent lots of time swimming around the lake together, exploring and having even more fun.
