Once upon a time, there was a tall giraffe named Jerry. Jerry loved to play sport with his animal friends. They would run and jump and have so much fun together. One day, they decided to play with water. Jerry had a special spray bottle that he used to cool himself down when it was hot outside. He sprayed his friends with water and they all laughed and played together. From that day on, they made sure to always have fun playing sport and spraying each other with water. The end.
