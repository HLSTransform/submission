Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very, very worried. She couldn't stop thinking about something terrible that had happened at school.
One day, the little girl's mom said to her, "Let's go outside and set up the tent. That will make you feel better."
The little girl and her mom carried the pale tent to an open spot in the garden and quickly set it up. The little girl felt like she was in a whole different world.
The little girl's mom asked, "Do you feel happier now?"
The little girl smiled a small, pale smile. "Yes," she said, her worries starting to drift away. 
The little girl and her mom spent the rest of the day in the pale tent, telling stories, playing games and just being happy. 
And from that day on, the little girl never had to worry again.
