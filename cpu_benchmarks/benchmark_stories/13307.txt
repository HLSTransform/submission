Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a little girl named Lily. Lily wanted to be independent and do things by herself. One sunny day, she decided to go for a walk in the park alone.
While walking, she saw a colorful rainbow in the sky. Lily was so happy to see it. She wanted to show the rainbow to her friend, Tim. So, she ran to Tim's house and knocked on the door.
"Tim! Come out and see the rainbow!" Lily called. Tim came outside and saw the beautiful rainbow. He was amazed by the colors. Tim's mom came out too and said, "Lily, you should always behave and be safe when you are alone."
Lily and Tim promised to behave and be safe. They enjoyed looking at the rainbow together, and they learned the importance of being independent while also being careful. From that day on, they always remembered to behave and be safe while having fun.
