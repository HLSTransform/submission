Once upon a time, there was a puppy named Max. Max had a colorful collar and a leash that was red. Max loved to go on walks with his owner, Lily. One night, Max had a dream that he could fly. 
The next day, Max told Lily about his dream. "I had a dream that I could fly!" Max barked. "That's so cool!" Lily said. "Maybe one day you'll fly in your dreams again." 
As they walked, Max saw a butterfly and chased after it. He pulled on his leash so hard that it broke! "Oops, I broke my leash," Max said. "It's okay, Max," Lily said. "We can get you a new one." 
Max wagged his tail and felt happy. He knew that he could always dream of flying, even if he had to stay on the ground.
