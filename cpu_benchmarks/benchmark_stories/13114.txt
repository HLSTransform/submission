Poppy was jumping around the room. She was so happy and excited. She grabbed her favorite toy and jumped on the bed. She laughed and laughed as she jumped higher and higher.
Suddenly, her Daddy entered the room looking very serious. He said to Poppy, "It's time to go home now". Poppy stopped jumping and looked sad. She slowly got off the bed, grabbed her toy and followed Daddy out the door.
When they got outside, Poppy saw a big field of beautiful poppies. She jumped with joy, ran towards the field and started picking all the poppies. Daddy smiled and laughed at how happy Poppy was with her poppies.
