Once upon a time, there lived a very patient patient whale. Everyday he sailed in the vast sea looking for food. But his mission was not just to eat, it was to collect anchors. He wanted to make a very special collection of anchors because it was his dream.
One day he found a beautiful anchor. He was so happy! He swam faster, and faster until he reached it. With all of his strength, he grabbed it, and tucked it into his special collection.
Completely exhausted, the patient whale looked at the anchorage. He was so proud of what he had collected. He thought it was the best collection ever! He lay down in the water, with satisfaction and smiled. 
The patient whale was so proud of himself. He had worked hard for his special collection and it had paid off. He had collected a wonderful new anchor which would definitely be the highlight of his collection.
