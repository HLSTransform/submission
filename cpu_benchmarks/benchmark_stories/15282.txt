Joe the cat was mad today. He had wanted to go for a jog, but his mom said no. He was so angry that he pawed the ground. But then he remembered his best friend, Maggie. They were always together and today was no different. Maggie asked Joe why he was angry and he told her his story. She said they could jog together. So they did! 
They started in the park and ran around the big tree. Joe was so excited to be jogging that he jumped over the small stream. Maggie laughed, so he jumped again. Then they ran up the hill and down the hill. 
After they finished, they were both tired but very happy. Joe was thankful that Maggie was with him to help him calm down and get his energy out. He knew that his feet could take him wherever he wanted to go.
