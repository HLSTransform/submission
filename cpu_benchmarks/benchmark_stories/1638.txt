Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play with paper. They cut paper, fold paper, and draw on paper. They make paper planes, paper hats, and paper animals.
One day, they decide to travel with paper. They take their paper planes and go to the park. They throw their paper planes in the air and watch them fly. They pretend they are pilots and talk to each other.
"Look, Lily, my paper plane is so fast!" Tom says.
"Wow, Tom, your paper plane is very good. But my paper plane is so cute!" Lily says.
They run after their paper planes and catch them. They laugh and have fun.
But then, a big wind comes. It blows their paper planes away. They try to chase them, but they are too far. They lose their paper planes.
"Oh no, Tom, our paper planes are gone!" Lily says.
"I'm sorry, Lily, I can't see them anymore!" Tom says.
They are sad and cry. They miss their paper planes.
But then, they see a man. He has a big bag. He has their paper planes in his bag. He smiles and walks to them.
"Hello, kids, are these your paper planes?" he says.
"Yes, sir, they are our paper planes!" Tom and Lily say.
"I found them in the sky. They are very nice paper planes. You are very clever kids. Do you want them back?" he says.
"Yes, please, sir, we want them back!" Tom and Lily say.
"OK, here you go. But be careful, the wind is strong today. Maybe you can play with them inside or somewhere else." he says.
He gives them their paper planes and leaves. Tom and Lily are happy and thank him. They hug their paper planes and go home. They decide to play with paper in their room. They make more paper planes, paper hats, and paper animals. They travel with paper in their imagination. They are friends. They like to play with paper.
