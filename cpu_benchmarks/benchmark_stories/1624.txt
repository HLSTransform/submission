Tom and Ben are friends. They like to play with a ball in the park. One day, they see a man with a big cut on his head. He is bald and angry.
"Who did this to you?" Tom asks the man.
"A bad boy kicked me with his shoe. He ran away with my hat. He was mean and rude," the man says.
Tom and Ben feel sorry for the man. They want to help him.
"We have a ball. Do you want to play with us?" Ben asks the man.
The man smiles. He likes the ball. He nods and says, "Yes, thank you. That is very kind of you."
Tom and Ben give the ball to the man. They take turns to kick it and catch it. They have fun and laugh. The man forgets his cut and his hat. He is happy and friendly. He makes new friends.
