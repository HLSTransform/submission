Mum and Dad were very poor. They had two children: Adam and Emily, but not much food for dinner.
Dad paused for a moment and looked sad. He knew things would be hard.
Mum, however, kept busy. She had an idea. She opened the cupboard and found some potatoes, she boiled them and added a bit of butter.
When dinner was ready, they all sat down at the table. The potatoes weren't very tasty, but they were very filling.
Adam and Emily were so happy. Having such a poor dinner was better than having no dinner at all.
The family enjoyed their time together and, although the dinner was poor, they were thankful.
