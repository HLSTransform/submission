Tom and Anna were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a group of big kids playing with a ball. Tom and Anna wanted to join them, but they were too shy.
"Can we play with you?" Tom asked in a small voice.
The big kids looked at them and laughed. "No, you can't. You are too little and slow. Go away!" one of them said.
Tom and Anna felt sad and angry. They walked away with their heads down. The sky was gloomy and it looked like it was going to rain.
"Those kids are mean. They don't want to share. They don't know how to be nice," Anna said.
Tom nodded. He had an idea. He picked up a stick and ran back to the group of big kids. He waved the stick in the air and shouted, "Hey, you! Give us the ball or I will shake you!"
The big kids were surprised and scared. They dropped the ball and ran away. Tom and Anna grabbed the ball and smiled.
"We did it! We got the ball! Now we can play!" Tom said.
Anna hugged him and said, "You are brave, Tom. You are my best friend."
They threw the ball to each other and had fun. The sun came out and the park was bright. Tom and Anna were happy.
