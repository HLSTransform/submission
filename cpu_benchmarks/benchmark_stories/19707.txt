One day, a little girl named Sarah was playing with her crayons. She loved to draw and color with them. She had all sorts of different kinds.
Suddenly, a popular boy came up to her. He had never talked to her before. He asked Sarah if he could borrow one of her crayons. Sarah was very surprised and said yes.
The boy said he would give it back soon, but he never did. Sarah waited, but the boy never returned the crayon.
In the end, Sarah realised that the boy had stolen her crayon! She was so upset. She learned that sometimes it is not wise to trust strangers.
