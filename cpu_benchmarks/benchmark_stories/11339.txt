Once upon a time, there was a dog named Browny. Browny was a good dog but he was very impatient. Every day he played in the garden with his tail wagging. 
One day, Browny's tail was not wagging as much as it usually did. He thought it would be better if he had a longer tail. So Browny decided to practice to improve his tail wagging.
First, Browny tried to wag his tail slowly. Then he tried to wag it faster. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't make his tail longer. 
Browny was frustrated. He asked his mom, "Mommy, how can I make my tail longer?"
Mommy replied, "Ah, my darling - you can't make your tail longer. But you can still practice and improve your tail-wagging. With enough practice, you will get better!"
Browny was happy. He went back to practicing, and soon he was able to wag his tail faster and better than before. 
Moral of the story: With patience and practice, you can improve your skills.
