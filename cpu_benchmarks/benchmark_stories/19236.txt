Once upon a time, there was a reindeer named Rudolph. Rudolph was very special because he had a shiny red nose that glowed in the dark. One day, Rudolph's friend, a little girl named Lily, wanted to make some cookies. She asked Rudolph to help her. Rudolph loved cookies, so he agreed to help.
Lily wanted to make spicy cookies, so she put some hot pepper in the dough. Rudolph thought it was a strange idea, but he wanted to help his friend, so he acted like he liked the spicy cookies. They baked the cookies together and they smelled very good.
When the cookies were ready, Rudolph and Lily sat down to eat them. Rudolph took a bite of the spicy cookie and his nose started to glow even brighter! Lily was amazed and happy that Rudolph liked the cookies. From that day on, Rudolph and Lily made spicy cookies together every Christmas.
