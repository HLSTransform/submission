Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Ellie. She was walking through a field full of beautiful, bright flowers when she came upon a strange sight. There, in the middle of the field, was a man holding a weapon.
Ellie was scared at first, but then the man smiled at her and asked her to come closer. She felt a bit better and took a few steps closer to the man. He told her that he just wanted to relax, so Ellie decided to sit down and relax with him.
The man's weapon was very big and it was very harsh. Ellie was still scared, but the man was very gentle with his weapon. He showed her how it worked and taught her how to make sure it was safe.
Eventually, Ellie stopped feeling scared and started to enjoy her time with the man and his weapon. She learned a lot from her experience and when she went home, she felt a bit more relaxed.
