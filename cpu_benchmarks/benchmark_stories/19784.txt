Once upon a time, there was a spider. It was a brilliant spider, brilliant like the sun. The spider weighed a lot, so it climbed to the top of a tall tree. From there, it could see everything far and wide.
One day, the spider wanted to go down from the tree. But it weighed too much to spin a web. So, it had to find another way. It looked around and saw a bird with strong wings.
The bird said, "I can help you." The spider got onto the bird's back and the bird flew away. They flew through the sky, and the spider could see all the small things below. Finally, they reached the ground and the spider jumped off.
The spider was so thankful. With the bird's help, it had weighed nothing. The brilliant spider waved goodbye to the bird and went on its way.
