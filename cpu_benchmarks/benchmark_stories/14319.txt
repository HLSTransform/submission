Once upon a time, there was a tall house. Inside the tall house lived a little girl.
One night, the little girl was very scared. She saw a light outside her window and it made her shiver. She hugged her toy rabbit close and decided to look outside.
The little girl opened her window and peeped out, but the light had gone. Instead, she saw a giant tree. It was so tall, she couldn't see the top! She felt a chill and hugged her bunny tighter. Then she heard a whisper in the wind...
The little girl was so scared, she ran back to her bed. She knew that nothing bad could ever happen when her warm quilt was around her. Once she was safe and snug, the little girl felt brave enough to look out of her window one more time.
From the safety of her room, the little girl saw a beautiful twinkling night sky full of stars. She smiled and the scared feeling was gone. The little girl's bedroom was bright with hope.
