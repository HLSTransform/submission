Once upon a time, there was a little beetle. He was red and black, and had six tiny legs. He was very smart and loved to explore the world.
One day, the little beetle found himself stuck in a deep hole. He had gone looking for adventure and now he was stuck. He was afraid and started to cry.
Fortunately, he was heard by a kind warrior. He was a brave knight and decided to rescue the little beetle. He carefully climbed down into the hole and brought the little beetle to safety.
The beetle was so grateful and thanked his knight with a big hug. The knight thanked the beetle for the hug and wished him a safe journey.
The little beetle was so happy now and he promised himself to be extra smart and never get stuck in a hole again!
