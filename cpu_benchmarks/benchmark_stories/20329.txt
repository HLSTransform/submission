Sara liked to go to the beach with her mom and dad. She liked to play in the sand and look for shells. One day, she found a big shell that was closed. She wondered what was inside.
She asked her mom, "Can I open this shell, mom?"
Her mom said, "That is an oyster, Sara. It has a living thing inside. You should not open it. It might hurt you or the oyster. You should let it stay in the water."
Sara said, "But I want to see what is inside. Maybe it has a pearl. A pearl is shiny and pretty."
Her mom said, "Maybe it does, but you cannot take it. The pearl belongs to the oyster. It is its treasure. How would you feel if someone took your treasure?"
Sara thought about her favorite toy, a pink teddy bear. She loved her teddy bear very much. She would not like it if someone took it from her.
She said, "I would feel sad and angry, mom."
Her mom said, "That is how the oyster would feel, too. You should be kind and respectful to the oyster and other living things. They have feelings, too."
Sara nodded. She understood. She said, "Okay, mom. I will not open the oyster. I will put it back in the water. Maybe it will be happy to see its friends."
She walked to the clear water and gently placed the oyster on a rock. She waved goodbye to the oyster and said, "Thank you for letting me see your shell. It is very beautiful. I hope you have a good day."
The oyster did not say anything, but it felt a little smile in its heart. It was glad that Sara was a nice and caring girl. It hoped that she would come back to the beach and visit again.
