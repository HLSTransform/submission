Once upon a time, there was a kind man named Mr. Bear. He had a nice garden with lots of flowers and fruits. One day, he met a new friend, a little rabbit named Peter. Peter liked the garden too and asked if he could take some fruits. Mr. Bear said yes and lend him a basket.
But one night, a thief came and stole some fruits from the garden. Mr. Bear was very sad because he worked hard to grow them. Peter saw how sad he was and decided to help. He went around the forest asking if anyone saw the thief. Finally, he found him hiding behind a tree.
Peter told the thief that stealing was wrong and asked him to give back the fruits. The thief was surprised by Peter's gentle voice and gave back all the fruits. Mr. Bear was very happy and thanked Peter for being such a good friend. From that day on, they always lend each other things and helped each other out.
