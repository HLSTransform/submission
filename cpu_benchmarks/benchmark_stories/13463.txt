Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had a bossy big sister named Sarah. One night, Lily and Sarah were getting ready for bed. 
Sarah said, "Lily, eat your dinner before bed." 
Lily replied, "But I'm not hungry." 
Sarah said, "You have to eat your dinner or you won't grow big and strong." 
Lily ate her dinner and went to bed. She dreamed of eating ice cream all night long. The end.
