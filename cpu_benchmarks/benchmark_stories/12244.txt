Billy was walking in the yard one day when he noticed something red in the corner. He inched closer and found a trembling little bird. He smiled and said, "Hello! What are you doing here?". He reached out to touch it but the it quickly flew away.
Billy was sad. He wanted to help the little bird. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise from behind a bush. He walked closer and saw a large dog. It was growling and shaking the bush. There was the bird again, trembling in fear.
Billy quickly ran over and yelled at the dog. He was shocked and scared at the same time. He had never been so brave before. The dog stopped growling and ran away. Billy let out a big sigh of relief.
The little bird flew away and Billy watched it go. His red cheeks were a sign of his bravery. He smiled and knew that the bird was safe.
