Abby was very nervous. She had never been outside without her mom before. Today, she was going to help her dad. She was helping him look for something special - a silver key. 
Dad tried to encourage Abby as they looked. "Don't be nervous, Abby. We'll find it soon," he said. 
Abby smiled, but was still a bit scared. Then, she saw it. She could see a silver sparkle from the corner of her eye. She ran over and there it was - the silver key! 
Dad smiled when he saw the key. He gave Abby a big hug and said, "Thank you for helping me, Abby. Your help is very special." 
Abby was so proud of herself. She helped her dad and it was the best feeling ever.
