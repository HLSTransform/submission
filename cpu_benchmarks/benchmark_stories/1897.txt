Once upon a time there was a young girl. She loved to play and explore. One day she wanted to try something new. She asked her mother if she could have a special dish. Her mother said yes and gave the girl a dish. 
The young girl was excited! She took the dish outside and looked closely at it. The dish was full of all sorts of goodies. She couldn't believe her eyes. She took a bit of each thing, and was so happy with what she received. 
The young girl had so much fun tasting all the different things in the dish. She thought it was the best thank she had ever gotten! She ate until she was full and thanked her mother for the dish. The young girl smiled and played the rest of the day.
