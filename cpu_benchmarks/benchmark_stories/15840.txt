Once upon a time, there was a bunny who lived in a big house. The house had lots of rooms, and at the very top of the house was an attic. The bunny felt lonely, so he decided to lay in the attic to try to make new friends.
Suddenly, he heard a noise in the attic. It was coming from behind a pile of hay. Cautiously, he hopped closer to investigate.
He was surprised to see a tiny mouse sitting there! The mouse was scared and asked the bunny, "Where am I?"
The bunny replied, "You are in the attic of my house."
The mouse smiled and said, "I am so glad I found you! Now we can be friends! My name is Tiny."
The bunny smiled and said, "My name is Fast, and I am glad we are friends too!"
So Fast and Tiny hopped around the attic and played together all day. They became best friends, and Fast was never alone in the attic anymore.
