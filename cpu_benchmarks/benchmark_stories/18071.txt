Once upon a time, there was a big plane. It flew high in the sky and made a noisy sound. A little girl named Lily saw the plane and waved at it. The plane was so big that it looked like a giant bird.
As the plane flew away, Lily saw something strange. The trees and houses in the distance started to shrink! They became smaller and smaller until they were tiny like toys. Lily was amazed and wondered how it happened.
She asked her mommy, who explained that it was just an optical illusion caused by the distance. Lily didn't understand all the big words, but she was happy to learn something new. From then on, she loved watching planes and imagining all the amazing things they could do.
