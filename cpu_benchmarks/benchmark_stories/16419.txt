Tom and Sue are twins. They like to play with their toys and draw pictures. They have a grandma who lives far away. She is elderly and kind. She always sends them cards and stickers in the mail.
One day, Tom and Sue want to make a card for their grandma. They find some paper, a pen, and some crayons. They draw a big heart and write "We love you, Grandma" inside. They also draw some flowers and stars and smiley faces.
They show their card to their mom. She says, "That's a very nice card. I'm sure Grandma will love it. Do you want to mail it to her?" Tom and Sue nod and say, "Yes, please!"
Mom helps them put the card in an envelope and write Grandma's address. She also gives them a stamp and shows them how to stick it on the envelope. Then she takes them to the mailbox. Tom and Sue take turns to put the card in the mailbox. They wave and say, "Bye-bye, card! Have a good trip!"
They hope Grandma will get their card soon and be happy. They love their grandma very much.
