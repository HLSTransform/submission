Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited to go to the park with her mommy. They walked to the park and played on the swings and the slide.
Suddenly, Lily's mommy's phone rang. She answered it and said, "Hello?" Lily was very impatient and asked, "Mommy, can we go play more?" Her mommy said, "Hold on, Lily, I need to talk to the patient on the phone."
Lily didn't understand what "patient" meant, so she asked, "What's a patient?" Her mommy explained, "A patient is someone who needs help from a doctor." 
After her mom finished talking on the phone, they continued to play at the park. Lily was happy that they didn't have to leave early. The end.
