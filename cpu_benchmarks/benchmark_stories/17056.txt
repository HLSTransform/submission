One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk. It was an icy cold day, so he wore his big coat and hat. As he walked, he liked to listen to the sounds around him. He heard birds singing and dogs barking.
Tim saw his friend, Sue, playing in the park. "Hi, Sue!" he said. "Do you want to play with me?" Sue smiled and said, "Yes, let's play!" They played on the swings and the slide, laughing and having fun.
As they played, Tim saw an ashtray on a bench. He didn't know what it was, so he asked Sue. "That's an ashtray," she said. "People put their yucky stuff in there." Tim nodded and said, "We should not touch it." They continued to play and enjoy the icy day, listening to the sounds around them.
