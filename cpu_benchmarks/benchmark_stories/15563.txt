Ben and Mia liked to play by the harbor. They saw big boats and small boats, and sometimes they waved to the people on them. They also liked to look for shells and rocks on the shore, and make shapes with them in the sand.
One day, they found a little bird on the beach. It was gray and white, and it had a long beak. It looked very tired and sad, and it did not move much. Ben and Mia felt sorry for the bird. They wanted to help it.
"Maybe it is hungry," Mia said. "We can give it some of our bread."
"Maybe it is cold," Ben said. "We can wrap it in my jacket."
They gently picked up the bird and carried it to a shady spot under a tree. They broke off some pieces of bread and put them near the bird's beak. They also covered the bird with Ben's jacket, leaving a hole for its head.
The bird ate some of the bread and made a soft sound. It looked at Ben and Mia with its bright eyes. It seemed to say thank you.
Ben and Mia smiled. They were happy that they could make the bird feel better. They were compassionate, which means they cared about others.
They decided to stay with the bird until it was ready to fly again. They talked to it and sang to it. They also rested with it, lying on the grass and looking at the sky.
They hoped that the bird would soon be strong enough to join its friends in the air. They also hoped that it would remember them, and maybe come back to visit them at the harbor. They felt a special bond with the bird, and they named it Flora.
