Ben and Lily wanted to surf in the sea. They put on their swimsuits and ran to the beach. They saw a big wave and jumped on their boards.
"Look at me, Lily! I can surf!" Ben shouted.
But then he saw something disgusting in the water. It was brown and smelly and sticky. It was poop!
"Yuck! What is that?" Ben cried.
He tried to wipe it off his board, but it was too hard. He felt sick.
"It's poop, Ben! Someone pooped in the sea!" Lily said.
She was angry and sad. She loved the sea, but now it was dirty.
"Who did this? It's not fair!" Lily said.
They looked around and saw a big boat near the shore. It had a pipe that was dumping poop into the sea.
"That's the poop boat! They are the bad guys!" Ben said.
He and Lily decided to stop them. They paddled to the boat and banged on the side.
"Hey, poop boat! Stop pooping in the sea! You are ruining our surf!" Ben yelled.
The people on the boat heard them and looked down. They saw two kids on surfboards covered in poop.
"Who are you? What are you doing here?" one of them asked.
"We are Ben and Lily, and we are here to surf. But you are making the sea disgusting with your poop. You have to stop!" Lily said.
The people on the boat laughed. They thought it was funny to see the kids so mad.
"Sorry, kids, but we don't care. We have to dump our poop somewhere, and the sea is the easiest place. You can't stop us. Go away!" one of them said.
Ben and Lily felt sad and angry. They wanted to surf, but they couldn't. They wanted to save the sea, but they couldn't. They felt helpless.
They turned around and paddled back to the shore. They hoped that one day, the poop boat would stop, and the sea would be clean again.
