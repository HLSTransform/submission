Once upon a time there was a girl who lived in a normal house. She liked to go out and play in the sun. One day while playing, the girl saw a well in the ground which she had never seen before. It was deep and dark. Out of curiosity, she decided to drop a stone into it. But, as the stone dropped into the well, the girl heard an awful noise from down below. She realized that she had opened a hole in the ground and water was quickly filling up the well and spilling out onto the ground. Quickly, the girl ran away, but the damage had already been done. The well was full of water and it was too late to save it. Sadly, the girl had caused a bad ending.
