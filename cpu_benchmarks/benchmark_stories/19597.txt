One sunny morning, a small boy was walking with his father. As he walked, he stumbled over a plastic toy car. It was small and just right for him. He picked it up and held it close. His dad smiled and said, "Let's take it home with us." The boy smiled and nodded. He was so excited to have this new toy.
When they got home, the boy ran to show his mom his new toy. He showed her the plastic car, and she smiled and said, "What a cute little car." The boy beamed with pride as he hugged his toy close.
After dinner, the boy wanted to play with his car. He took it out to the front yard, where he stumbled around trying to push it forward. After a few tries he figured out how to move it and was soon having lots of fun. He spent the rest of the evening playing with his small plastic car until it was bedtime.
