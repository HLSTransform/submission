Once upon a time, there was a smart nurse who could do something very special. She could reverse time. One day, she decided to show her magic to her three-year-old friend.
First, she told the friend to close her eyes. Then, Nurse waved her wand and suddenly it was morning. The sun was up in the sky and birds were singing. 
Then, Nurse waved her wand again and it was nighttime. The stars were out and the moon was in the sky. 
The little friend was so amazed. She opened her mouth in surprise. Nurse laughed and said, "Now it's time to reverse again." With one more wave of her wand, it was the morning again.
The little girl went home with a smile on her face, amazed at the magical things Nurse could do.
