Once upon a time, there was a river. It was big and blue. But it was broken. It made a big mess. 
The river was sad. It wanted to get fixed. It looked near and far to find someone to help.
Then one day, a nice person came by. The person saw the broken river. They said they would help fix it. 
The nice person worked very hard. They put the river back together. And soon the river was happy again.  
The river was now strong and blue. It was no longer broken. Everybody was so happy!
