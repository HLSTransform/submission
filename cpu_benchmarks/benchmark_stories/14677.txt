Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. He wanted to go to the shop. So he put on his coat and went outside. It was a wet day, so he had to have an umbrella with him.
When Jack arrived to the shop, he saw lots of things he wanted to buy. But one thing caught his eye. It was a big bucket. He wanted to fill it with lots of toys. So he grabbed it, and asked the shopkeeper if he could fill it with fun things.
The shopkeeper said yes, so Jack started filling his bucket with lots of toys. He was so excited to have all of these fun toys to play with. After he filled it up, he thanked the shopkeeper and went home with his bucket.
He took the toys out of his bucket, and he was so happy. He played with them all day and had so much fun. Jack was happy that he was able to go to the wet shop and fill his bucket with lots of toys.
