Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was playing in the rain and she saw a big drain. She wanted to see what was inside the drain so she tried to look inside. But she was clumsy and she fell in!
Lily's mom heard her cries and rushed to help her. "What happened, Lily?" her mom asked. "I fell in the drain," Lily said. "Oh no! Are you hurt?" her mom asked. "No, I'm okay. But I don't want to be clumsy anymore," Lily said.
"Don't worry, Lily. You're not clumsy. You just need to be more careful," her mom said. Lily smiled and hugged her mom. "Thanks, Mom. You always know how to make me feel better," Lily said. From that day on, Lily was more careful and never fell in the drain again.
