Once upon a time, there was an old kangaroo who lived in the forest. One day, the old kangaroo met a little girl. The little girl said, "I need a friend to play with. Do you want to be my friend?" The old kangaroo said, "Yes, I need a friend too."
The little girl and the old kangaroo played together every day. They hopped and jumped and had so much fun. One day, the little girl said, "You're an old kangaroo. Do you need to rest?" The old kangaroo said, "Yes, I need to rest my legs."
The little girl and the old kangaroo sat under a tree and talked. The old kangaroo said, "I'm so happy I have a friend like you. I don't feel old when I'm playing with you." The little girl said, "I'm happy too. You're the best kangaroo friend I could ever have." From that day on, the little girl and the old kangaroo were the best of friends.
