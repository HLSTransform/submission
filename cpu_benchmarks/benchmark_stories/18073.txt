Once upon a time, there was a birdie. The birdie lived in a tree. The birdie loved to sing. It sang every day. One day, the birdie saw a wire. The wire was on the ground. The birdie thought the wire was a toy. It tried to play with the wire. But the wire was not a toy. It was dangerous. The birdie's mommy came and told the birdie to stay away from the wire. The mommy said the wire was not original. It was put there by humans. The birdie listened to its mommy and flew away.
