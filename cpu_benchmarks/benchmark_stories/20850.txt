Once upon a time there was a happy woman. She lived in a cozy house and had lots of friends. One day the woman was walking in the park, when she heard a voice from the sky. The voice said; "I have a wish for you". 
The woman looked around but saw nobody. "Who said that?", she asked. 
The voice replied; "It is me. I am the Sky Wish Fairy". 
The woman was very surprised. She asked; "What is your wish for me?". 
The Sky Wish Fairy answered; "I wish that you will always be happy". 
The woman was very happy and gave the Sky Wish Fairy a big hug. The Sky Wish Fairy waved goodbye and flew away.
From that day on the woman always felt happy whenever the sky looked beautiful.
