One day, a little girl found some glue. She picked it up and put it in her pocket. While the glue was in her pocket, it started to drop onto her shirt. It made a big mess!
The little girl wanted to clean it up, but she didn't know how. Suddenly, she remembered her mom had some special dead glue. This glue was perfect for cleaning!
She ran to the kitchen and found the dead glue. She put a bit of the glue on a rag and wiped it on the shirt. The glue worked and soon the shirt was clean!
The little girl was so happy that the dead glue worked. She didn't have to throw away her shirt because of the dropped glue.
