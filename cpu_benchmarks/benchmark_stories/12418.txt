Once upon a time, there was a tall girl named Lizzy. She loved to go outside in every season. Whenever she went for a walk, her nose got tickled. She would sneeze a lot! It was fun for her.
One day, Lizzy bumped into a tall tree. As soon as she got close enough, her nose began to tingle again. She started to sneeze and it felt so good! She sneezed three times in a row.
As she laughed, Lizzy decided to go home. She was now ready to enjoy the rest of the season. Every time she sneezed, she smiled and felt so happy.
