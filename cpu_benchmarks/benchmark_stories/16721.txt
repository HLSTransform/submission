Anna and Ben were playing in the park with their toy cars. They liked to make them zoom and crash on the grass. Anna had a red car and Ben had a blue car. They were having fun.
But then they saw a big brown dog running towards them. The dog looked angry and hungry. It barked loudly and showed its teeth. Anna and Ben were scared. They dropped their cars and ran away. The dog chased them.
"Help! Help!" Anna and Ben shouted. They looked for their mom and dad, but they were too far away. The dog was getting closer and closer.
But then they saw a switch on a fence. The switch was for the sprinklers. Anna had an idea. She ran to the switch and turned it on. Water sprayed out of the sprinklers and wet the dog. The dog hated water. It stopped chasing Anna and Ben and ran away.
"Yay! We did it!" Anna and Ben cheered. They hugged each other. They were safe. They picked up their cars and went to their mom and dad. They told them what happened.
"You are very brave and smart," their mom and dad said. "You rescued yourselves from the dog. We are proud of you."
Anna and Ben smiled. They were happy. They played with their cars again. They liked the park.
