Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and run around with her friends. One day, Lily fell down and hurt her knee. She started to cry and her mommy came running over to comfort her.
"Mommy, it hurts so much," Lily said.
"I know, sweetie. Let's go inside and I'll give you a treat to make it feel better," her mommy replied.
Lily's mommy brought her inside and gave her a cookie. Lily felt happy and her knee started to feel better. The next day, Lily was playing outside again and saw her friend, Tommy, fall down and hurt himself. Lily remembered how her mommy comforted her and gave her a treat, so she went over to Tommy and said, "It's okay, Tommy. Let's go get a treat and it will be easy to feel better." Tommy smiled and they went inside together to get a cookie. From that day on, Lily always knew how to comfort her friends when they got hurt.
