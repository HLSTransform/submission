Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she found a green twig on the ground. She picked it up and put it in her pocket. 
As she was walking, she saw a bird's nest in a tree. The nest looked empty, so she put the twig in the nest. Suddenly, a little bird flew down and saw the twig. It was so happy and chirped a song. 
Lily was happy too because she made the bird happy. From that day on, Lily would always look for twigs to put in the bird's nest. And the little bird would always sing a happy song whenever it found a new twig in its nest. The end.
