Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jake. Jake was very smart and always looking for something fun to do. He one day decided to play a game. As he played, he noticed something special. Each time he played the game, he got better and better. Jake's game skills increased and he was having a good time.
He kept at it day after day and with each playing, his skills grew. Pretty soon, Jake was the best game player in the whole town. Everyone talked about how good Jake had become.
One day, a friend of Jake's asked him how he had gotten so good. Jake smiled and said, "I just kept playing until I became the best!" Ever since then, Jake has continued to play games and his skills keep increasing.
The end!
