Once upon a time, there was a bad mouse. The mouse was very wicked and mean. He liked to sneak around and cause trouble for everyone.
One day, the mouse was making a mess. He knocked over a pot and it broke into many pieces. The people were very angry and quickly chased after the mouse. 
At the same time, someone was bringing a very nice present. It was neatly wrapped in colorful paper and a big red bow. The mouse saw the present and had an idea.
He quickly ran over and grabbed the present. He wrapped himself up in it and shouted happily. He thought no one would find him now. 
But the people were clever. They soon worked out what had happened and came to catch the mouse. The mouse tried to run away, but he was stuck in the present! He was soon caught by the people and taken away. 
And the mouse never caused any more trouble again!
