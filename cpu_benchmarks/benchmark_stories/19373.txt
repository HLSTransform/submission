Once there was a girl named Jo. She was three years old and really wanted to pick something new. One day she saw an oyster. She decided to pick it and see what was inside it! Jo carefully picked the oyster, hoping for a surprise. When she opened it, a beautiful, shiny pearl was inside! Jo was so excited, she had never seen a pearl before. She held the pearl tight and brought it home to show her mom. Her mom was so proud, and they both decided it was special and should stay safe in a box. Jo smiled, she had found something new!
