Once upon a time there was a boy who loved to listen to the birds sing in the sky. But one day he heard something different.
It was like the sound of water pouring out of a pipe. He thought it was interesting but he couldn't figure out where it was coming from.
So he started to listen harder as he walked around his neighborhood. He looked under bushes and in the trees, but he couldn't find the sound.
Finally, he looked up in the sky and spotted it! High up in the sky was a pipe spraying water from one end. As he watched the water danced through the air.
He thought it was the most interesting thing he had ever seen. So each day he would make sure to listen for the sound of the pipe and watch the water twirl around in the sky.
