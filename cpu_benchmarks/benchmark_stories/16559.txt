Lily and Ben like to play in the park. They like to run, swing, slide and climb. They also like to look at the animals. There are birds, squirrels, ducks and dogs. Sometimes they see a cat or a rabbit.
One day, they see a new animal. It is big and brown and has a long nose. It makes a loud noise. Lily and Ben are curious. They want to go closer and touch it.
"Stop!" a voice says. It is a man. He works in the park. He has a hat and a badge. He looks angry. "That is not a regular animal. That is an elephant. It is not safe. It can hurt you. Go away now!"
Lily and Ben are scared. They do not want to be hurt. They listen to the man. They run away from the elephant. They say sorry to the man.
The man is not angry anymore. He is kind. He smiles. He says, "It is OK. You did not know. But you have to be careful. Some animals are not for playing. They are wild. You have to warn other kids too. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben nod. They understand. They thank the man. They go back to their regular animals. They play with the birds, squirrels, ducks and dogs. They are happy. They are safe.
