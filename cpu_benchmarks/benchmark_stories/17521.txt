Lily and Max were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to pretend they were pirates and princesses. Lily wore a fancy dress and a crown. Max wore a hat and a sword.
"Arrr, I am the captain of this ship!" Max said, pointing his sword at Lily. "Give me your jewels, princess, or I will make you walk the plank!"
"No, you are a mean pirate!" Lily said, holding her necklace. "This is my treasure, and you can't have it!"
They chased each other around the couch, laughing and shouting. Suddenly, they heard a loud boom outside. They stopped and looked out the window. It was dark and rainy. They saw a bright flash of lightning in the sky.
"Wow, did you see that?" Max said, amazed.
"That was scary!" Lily said, holding Max's hand.
They heard another boom, louder than before. They jumped and hugged each other. They saw their mom coming from the kitchen.
"Mommy, what is that?" Lily asked, pointing at the window.
"That is a thunderstorm, sweetie," Mom said, smiling. "It is when the clouds make noise and light. It is nothing to be afraid of. It will go away soon."
She picked them up and carried them to the couch. She gave them a blanket and a book.
"Here, let's read a story together," she said, opening the book. "This is about a brave knight and a beautiful dragon. Do you want to hear it?"
"Yes, please!" Lily and Max said, nodding.
They snuggled with Mom and listened to her voice. They forgot about the storm and the lightning. They felt safe and happy. They dropped their toys on the floor. They didn't need them anymore. They had each other.
