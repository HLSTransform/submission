Once upon a time, there was a well in a small town. The well was very important to the people who lived there. They used the water from the well to drink, cook, and clean. The well was very deep, and the water was very clean and good.
One day, the well started to increase its water. The water came up and up, and soon, it was almost overflowing. The people were surprised, but they were also happy because they had more water to use. They could be more flexible with how they used the water, and they didn't have to worry about running out.
The people in the town were very thankful for the well and the water it gave them. They knew that the well was special, and they took good care of it. They made sure it stayed clean and safe, so that it would always be there to help them when they needed it. And the well was always there, increasing its water and making the people happy.
