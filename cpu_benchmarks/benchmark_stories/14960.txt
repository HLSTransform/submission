Once there was a little girl named Daisy who loved to explore. One day, she went in the garden and decided to look everywhere. She saw a cobweb in the corner, it was green and beautiful.
Daisy decided to look closer and so she gently moved closer to the web.
What Daisy saw made her gasp: A little green spider appeared!
He smiled at Daisy and said: "If you don't touch my web I will be your friend!"
Daisy thought it was a nice idea and so she decided to be friends with the spider. They played together all day long and Daisy never touched his cobweb. They were the best of friends!
