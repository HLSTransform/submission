Once upon a time there was a quiet silver box. It was very special. The box always got taken care of. Every day someone would come to make sure the box was safe and happy.
The box was so happy! It liked to watch the people who came to see it. One day it saw a little boy. He was small and had big eyes. He leaned against the box and held it close. They both smiled and felt very lucky.
The box knew the little boy cared for it. They became friends. Every day the little boy would come to visit the quiet silver box. He would give it hugs and tell it stories. They would spend hours together.
The little boy was so happy. He had found someone special to care for. And the box was happy too. It knew the little boy loved it.
