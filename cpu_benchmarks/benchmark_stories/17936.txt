Once upon a time there were two little boys. One was called Tim and the other was called Tom. They were both very cute.
Tim really wanted to play outside. But Tom did not want to. He said that it was too scary because of the tornado.
Tim and Tom's mum saw them arguing and decided to punish them. No playing outside until they obeyed her orders!
But then something magical happened. A big rainbow appeared in the sky and the tornado disappeared. Tim and Tom were so happy!
So, Tim and Tom's mum decided to forgive them and let them go and play outside. They were so excited and had so much fun.
The End.
