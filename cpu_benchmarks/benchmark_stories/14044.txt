Once upon a time there was a little girl. She lived in a beautiful home. Her home had lots of windows and trees that she could see from all around. 
Every day, she would go outside and spray the flowers and grass with water. She was always honest and did her best to take care of her home. 
One day, she decided to strut her stuff and show everyone how honest she was. She dressed up in her most beautiful clothes and sprayed the outside of the house. 
She sprayed the walls and the grass and made sure everything was sparkling clean. Her neighbors noticed her hard work and praised her honestly. Everyone admired her kind heart and thanked her for taking care of their home. 
The little girl was so happy and continued to spray the outside of her house every day, just to make sure that everyone was happy.
