Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Jane. Jane had a golden bracelet with a sparkly stone. Every day, she would jog around the park. Jane loved to run and feel the sun on her face.
One day, Jane saw an old lady walking in the park. She had difficulty walking, so Jane decided to help. With a compassionate smile on her face, Jane asked the old lady:
"Can I help you, ma'am?"
The old lady was so thankful. She held out her hand, and Jane put the golden bracelet in it. The old lady could not stop talking about the sparkly stone, and Jane laughed.
"This is for you," said Jane, with a friendly grin.
The lady hugged her and Jane jogged away. She felt happy she had been able to help the old lady. Jane ran back to her house, feeling proud of her compassionate act.
