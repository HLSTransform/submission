Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jane. She was three years old. She loved to swing. Her mom and dad had built her a special swing made just for her.
One day, Jane was playing in her backyard. She was swinging when she noticed a little pocket on the swing. She wanted to know what was inside so she pulled it open.
Inside the pocket, Jane found a little green stone. She thought it was very pretty. Suddenly, a voice spoke. It was the stone! It said, "I am incredibly intelligent and I will answer any three questions you have."
Jane was amazed. She asked the stone all sorts of questions. She asked about stars and trees, animals and clouds. The stone answered all her questions.
Jane was so happy. She thanked the stone for being so intelligent and kept the little green stone in her pocket. She knew she would never forget this magical day.
