Once upon a time there were two friends, Abi and Tom, who wanted to have a picnic. They asked their parents and they said yes. So Abi got some sandwiches and Tom packed an enormous picnic blanket. 
Abi and Tom had the most fun ever. They ran around in the park, played tag, and laughed a lot while they ate their delicious sandwiches. 
But then something unexpected happened. Abi noticed it was already late in the afternoon and they had to go home. "Oh no! We have to go now," said Abi. 
Tom was so sad. He thought something was missing from their picnic. "We didn't bring any dessert!" said Tom. His dad had forgotten to pack it. 
Abi thought for a moment. Then she smiled and said, "That's okay. We can have dessert next time. We'll just have to miss it this time around." 
And so they left the park and went home, looking forward to their next picnic with an enormous dessert!
