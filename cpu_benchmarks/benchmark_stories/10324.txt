Lila and Tom were at the zoo with their mom. They saw many animals, but their favorite was the seal. The seal was big and gray, and had a thick fur. It liked to swim and splash in the water.
"Look, mom, the seal is waving at us!" Lila said, pointing at the seal that lifted its flipper.
"Maybe it wants to say hello," mom said. "Do you want to say hello back?"
"Yes, yes!" Lila and Tom said, and waved their hands at the seal.
The seal seemed happy, and made a loud noise. It sounded like "arf, arf, arf!"
"What is it saying, mom?" Tom asked.
"I don't know, maybe it's saying thank you for being nice," mom said. "Or maybe it's saying that it values your friendship."
"What does value mean, mom?" Lila asked.
"It means that you care about something or someone very much, and that you think they are important and special," mom said.
"Oh, I see. I value you, mom, and I value Tom, and I value the seal too," Lila said.
"I value you too, Lila, and I value mom, and I value the seal too," Tom said.
"I value you both, Lila and Tom, and I value the seal too," mom said.
They all smiled and hugged each other, and then waved at the seal again. The seal waved back, and arfed some more. They felt happy and warm, and knew that they had made a new friend.
