Once upon a time, there was a little engine named Ellie. Ellie loved to ring her bell as she went down the tracks. One day, she saw a big engine named Ben. Ben looked sad and helpless. Ellie wanted to help him.
Ellie asked, "Ben, why are you sad?"
Ben said, "I can't move. I need help."
Ellie wanted to help, but she was small. She had an idea. She asked all her engine friends to come and help Ben. They all came and pushed Ben together. Ben started to move again.
Ben was so happy. He said, "Thank you, Ellie and friends!" They all rang their bells and went down the tracks together. Ellie felt proud to help her new friend.
