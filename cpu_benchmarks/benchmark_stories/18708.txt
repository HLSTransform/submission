Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had long hair that covered his eyes. His mom said it was time for a haircut. Timmy didn't want a haircut because he liked his hair. 
One day, Timmy's friend came over to play. His friend had a toy car that he wanted to show Timmy. Timmy couldn't see the car because his hair was in the way. His friend said, "You need a haircut so you can see my toy car." 
Timmy's mom said there was a haircut available at the salon. Timmy went to the salon and the hairdresser spread a cape around his neck. She cut his hair and when she was done, Timmy could see the toy car. Timmy was happy he got a haircut.
