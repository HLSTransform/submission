Once upon a time there was a boy who liked to joke a lot. One day he saw a big space that was dark and cool. He thought of something funny and he joked about it. He laughed and ran around the space but then he noticed something. It was smelly! The boy thought the smell was funny so he laughed and joked about it. He kept running around and joking until his Mum called him home. The end.
