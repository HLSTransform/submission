Once upon a time there was a sleepy bear named Sammy. He was very tired and wanted to take a nap. He laid down in a soft spot and closed his eyes. However, he soon heard a loud noise! It was a very fearful noise. Sammy was scared. He ran and ran and ran trying to find a safe place to stay.
Eventually Sammy found a warm and cozy cave. He felt much better inside the cave and knew this was a safe spot to nap. He laid down and was fast asleep in no time. But then Sammy heard the noise again! This time he was even more scared. He curled up in a ball and waited.
Finally, Sammy realized the noise was just a gentle breeze. He had been too fearful to realize it before. He was so relieved he decided to take an extra long nap in the cozy cave. Sammy laid down and closed his eyes and soon began to snore. He would stay in the cave until he woke up feeling well rested and happy.
