Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to swing on the big swings. They pushed each other and laughed.
"Look at me, Lily! I can swing very high!" Ben said.
"Me too, Ben! I can swing higher than you!" Lily said.
They swung and swung until they were tired. Then they walked home with their mom.
Mom said, "I have a surprise for you. I made a cake in the oven. Do you want some?"
"Yes, please!" Lily and Ben said.
They went to the kitchen and saw the cake. It was big and round and had pink frosting and sprinkles.
"Wow, mom! It looks yummy!" Lily said.
"Thank you, mom! You are the best!" Ben said.
Mom smiled and said, "You are welcome, my sweeties. But be careful, the cake is still hot. Don't touch the oven, it can burn you."
Lily and Ben nodded. They waited for the cake to cool down. They knew it was difficult to wait, but they did not want to get hurt.
Soon, mom cut the cake and gave them each a slice. They ate the cake and enjoyed it very much. They thanked mom again and gave her a hug.
They were happy and full. They decided to go to their room and play with their toys. They had a fun day.
