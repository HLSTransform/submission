Mary was a happy mom. She had a little daughter. Mary played with her daughter every day.
Mary and the daughter were outside together. Suddenly, the daughter fell down. She had hurt her knee. Mary was bitter. 
Mary asked the daughter if she was okay. The daughter said she was okay, but she still had to lift her up because she was hurt. Mary hugged her daughter and kissed her. 
Mary knew that she had to be careful. She wanted to make sure her daughter didn't fall again. From that day on, Mary was always close to her daughter so she would not fall again.
