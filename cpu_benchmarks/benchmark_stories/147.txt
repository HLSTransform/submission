Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his football. His football was the most special thing he had. One day, Timmy went to play with his friends in the park. But when he got there, he realized he forgot to unlock his door. 
Timmy was very sad because he couldn't play with his football. He tried to open the door, but it was locked. Suddenly, he remembered that his dad had given him a special key to unlock the door. Timmy found the key and unlocked the door. 
He was so happy that he could finally play with his ordinary football. Timmy and his friends played for hours until it was time to go home. Timmy went to bed that night feeling very proud of himself for unlocking the door and getting to play with his football.
