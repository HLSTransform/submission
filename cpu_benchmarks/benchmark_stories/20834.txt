Once upon a time, there was a parent who was very selfish. Every day, they thought only of themselves and negated the needs of their child. One day, the parent was having a hard time and asked their child for comfort. But their child only had so much love to give, and the parent only took from them. 
One day, the parent asked their child for comfort again. This time, their child was not able to give anything, so they said no. The parent became very angry and started to scream and shout. The child was very scared and started to cry. 
The parent, however, became even more selfish. They continued to scream and shout until their child left the room, scared and upset. 
The bad ending of this story was that the child never received any comfort from the parent. They were only met with anger and selfishness.
