Once there was a very competitive boy. He was always trying to be the best at everything. But one day he decided to try something new. He wanted to grow.
So, he went to the store and bought some glue. He stuck the glue all over his body. It was sticky and gooey but he kept going until he was completely covered.
He had a plan to grow taller and become the best at something. He hoped the glue would make him grow.
But the glue didn't work, and the boy stayed the same size. He was disappointed and grumbled, but he didn't give up. He tried other things and eventually he became the best at something! He was the best at being competitive.
