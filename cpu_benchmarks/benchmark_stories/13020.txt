One day, Jim and his dad decided to go out for a drive. They drove around the lively city and looked at all the busy traffic. Jim thought it was so exciting to be able to look at all the cars and watch who was at the street signs.
While they were stopped at a red light, they noticed something funny. Two birds were stuck in a cage that had been left behind. Jim's dad said they should help the birds, so he looked around for something to release the latch on the cage.
Thankfully, he found something small enough that he could use to open the latch. He slowly and carefully opened the cage, and the two birds flew free. Jim was so happy he clapped his hands and shouted for joy.
Jim and his dad both waved goodbye as the birds flew away. Jim felt proud that he and his dad could help the birds and released them from the cage. It was a great feeling to do something good in the world!
