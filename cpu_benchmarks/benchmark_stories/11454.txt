Mama was in the kitchen making a special meal. She had a big bag of wheat and wanted to make something yummy. Her little 3-year-old daughter came into the kitchen and saw what Mama was doing. She shouted, "Wheat!”
Mama looked up and smiled. She told her daughter, "Yes, I'm making something special for you with the wheat.” The daughter looked excited and asked, "Can I help?”
Mama agreed and the daughter got busy measuring out the wheat. Her mother watched with a proud smile. Suddenly, the daughter shouted out, "More wheat!” Mama laughed at her daughter's loud request.
Mama obliged and the daughter kept adding wheat until the bag was empty. The daughter was proud of her helpful contribution. Mama thanked her daughter and they both enjoyed the special meal they had made together.
