Once upon a time, there were two friends - Sam and John. They were both very competitive. One day, they were playing in the backyard. Sam wanted to try something new. He asked John to help him. He said, "Let's push the steel box!" 
John said "Ok. Let's see who can push it the furthest!" They both grabbed the box and started pushing it. Sam pushed and pushed and pushed. He was so strong! John pushed and pushed too, but he couldn't quite match Sam's strength. Sam pushed the box all the way to the end of the yard!
John clapped. "Wow, Sam! You did it! You are so strong!" Sam was so proud of himself. He said, "That was so fun! Let's do it again!" 
John and Sam had a great day. They pushed and pushed the steel box and had lots of fun!
