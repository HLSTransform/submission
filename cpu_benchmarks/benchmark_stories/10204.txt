One day, a big cat and a small dog were playing near a tree. The cat was very mean and liked to slap the dog. The dog did not like this, but he was too small to do anything.
The small dog said, "Please stop slapping me, cat. It is not nice." The big cat did not care. He was deaf and could not hear the dog's words. The cat kept slapping the dog, and the dog felt sad.
Then, the dog had an idea. He saw a point on the tree and thought it could help him. He ran to the point and hid behind it. The cat tried to slap the dog, but he missed and hit the point instead. The point was very sharp, and the cat got hurt. The dog was happy, but the cat was angry and in pain. The cat never learned to be nice, and they never played together again.
