Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big tree with red fruit. They want to eat the fruit.
"Can we pick the fruit?" Lily asks Tom.
"I don't know. Maybe it is not nice to take the fruit. Maybe it belongs to someone else." Tom says.
"But I am hungry. And the fruit looks yummy." Lily says.
She reaches for a fruit and pulls hard. The fruit breaks off the tree. But it also breaks the branch. The branch falls down and hits Tom on the head.
"Ow! That hurts!" Tom cries.
Lily feels bad. She did not mean to hurt Tom. She gives him the fruit and says sorry.
"Are you okay, Tom?" Lily asks.
Tom rubs his head. He sees the fruit in Lily's hand. He smiles.
"It's okay, Lily. I forgive you. Thank you for the fruit. Do you want to share it with me?" Tom asks.
Lily nods. She is happy that Tom is not angry. They sit on the grass and eat the fruit. It is sweet and juicy. They both think it is the best fruit ever. They hug and say they are still friends.
