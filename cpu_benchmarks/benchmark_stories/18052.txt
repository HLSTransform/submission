Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went on a picnic with her mommy and daddy. They packed yummy sandwiches and fruit in a big basket. They found a nice spot under a big tree and spread a blanket on the grass.
Lily wanted to play, but her mommy said, "Wait, first we eat." Lily saw the sandwiches and said, "Yum, I want one!" But her daddy said, "Not yet, you need to fit your new dress first." Lily was sad because she wanted to eat.
Suddenly, a big dog came and took their basket! Lily screamed, "Oh no, our picnic!" Her daddy chased the dog and got the basket back. They all laughed and ate their sandwiches. Lily said, "I see the dog, but he can't have our food!" They had a fun day at the park. The end.
