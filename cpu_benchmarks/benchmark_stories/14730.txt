Once upon a time, there was an empty house. Suddenly, an emergency happened. This emergency was very scary. The door to the empty house started to shake. The emergency tried to enter, so it could help the people inside the house. It pushed the door open and entered. But the emergency found something strange. The house was actually empty! There was nothing inside. The emergency left, but it learned something important. We should be careful, even in an empty house.
