Once upon a time, there was a chubby little girl named Lily. She loved to eat pastries, especially chocolate ones. One day, Lily's mom baked a big chocolate pastry for her to eat.
As Lily was about to take a bite, she looked out the window and saw dark clouds in the sky. She knew it was going to rain soon. Lily's mom said, "Don't worry, we'll eat the pastry inside where it's dry."
Lily ate the pastry and it was delicious. Then, just as her mom predicted, it started to rain outside. Lily was happy she didn't have to eat her pastry in the rain. She hugged her mom and said, "Thank you for keeping me dry and giving me yummy pastries!"
