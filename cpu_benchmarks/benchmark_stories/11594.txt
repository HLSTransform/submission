"Harry went for a walk with his daddy. It was a bright and sunny day, and Harry was enjoying the sun.
Harry saw a big factory with a big sign.
'What's that Daddy?' asked Harry.
'That's a factory, darling,' said Daddy.
They walked up to the factory and Harry saw a big puddle.
'Daddy, Daddy can I splash in the puddle?'
'Of course' said Daddy,
So Harry jumped up and down and splashed in the puddle. He had so much fun and got his shoes all wet.
'Time to go now, Harry.'
Harry said goodbye to the factory and went with Daddy, hand in hand.
