Tom and Lily were twins. They liked to play with their toys and make things. One day, they decided to make a display of their toys for their mom and dad. They used a big box, some paper, and some glue.
They put their toys on the paper and glued them to the box. They had cars, dolls, animals, and blocks. They made a road, a house, a farm, and a tower. They were very proud of their display. They wanted to show it to their mom and dad.
They called their mom and dad to come and see their display. Mom and dad came and looked at the box. They smiled and clapped. They said, "Wow, what a wonderful display! You are very creative and clever, Tom and Lily!"
Tom and Lily were happy. They hugged their mom and dad. They said, "Thank you, mom and dad! We love you!"
Mom and dad said, "We love you too, Tom and Lily! You are our special and unusual youth. You always make us happy!"
