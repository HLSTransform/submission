Tom was a chubby boy who liked to cook with his mom. He helped her stir the soup in the big pot on the stove. He liked to watch the steam go up in the air and smell the yummy food.
One day, Tom wanted to make his own soup. He found a small pot and some water and put it on the stove. He added some salt and pepper and some things he found in the fridge. He stirred and stirred and waited for his soup to be ready.
But he forgot to turn down the heat. The water boiled and boiled and spilled over the pot. It made a big mess and a lot of smoke. The smoke alarm went off and made a loud noise. Tom got scared and ran to his mom.
Mom saw the smoke and the mess and turned off the stove. She was not happy with Tom. She told him he should never cook alone and he could have burned himself or the house. She hugged him and said she was glad he was okay.
Tom felt sorry and said he was sorry too. He helped mom clean up the mess and promised to be more careful next time. Mom said she loved him and they could cook together again later. She gave him a cookie and a glass of milk and they sat on the couch and read a book. Tom felt better and learned his lesson.
