Once upon a time, there was a big, magical crystal. It was very beautiful and sparkly. All the people in the land loved it.
One day, a bad creature stole the crystal. Everything looked dark and gloomy without it. The people were very sad.
The people did not give up. They all worked together to find the original crystal. They asked all the creatures and looked high and low, but still, they could not find it.
Finally, they found a clue. It said the crystal was hidden in a deep cave. The people were so excited! 
They all gathered together and went off to find the crystal. After a long journey, they finally reached the cave and carefully searched it. Amazingly, they found the original crystal! Everyone was so happy and relieved.
The people brought the crystal back to their land and it sparkled as bright as ever. From that day on, the people of the land always kept the crystal safe and guarded it with love.
