Once upon a time, there was a happy little bird named Tweety. Tweety loved to fly and sing all day long. One day, Tweety saw a big box on the ground. The box was very heavy and Tweety couldn't lift it.
Suddenly, Tweety saw a kind mailman walking by. Tweety asked the mailman if he could deliver the box to Tweety's friend, who lived far away. The mailman said it would be easy, and he picked up the box and put it in his truck.
As the mailman drove away, Tweety saw a flame in the distance. Tweety got worried and flew to see what it was. It was just a campfire, and Tweety was relieved. Tweety flew back home and waited for the mailman to deliver the box to his friend.
