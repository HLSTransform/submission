Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Max. Max was a loyal friend to his owner, a little girl named Lily. Lily loved Max very much and Max loved Lily too. 
One day, Lily went to school to learn new things. Max wanted to go with her, but he couldn't because dogs aren't allowed in school. So, Max promised to protect Lily while she was away. 
When Lily came back from school, Max was waiting for her at the gate. Lily was happy to see Max and gave him a big hug. Max was happy too because he had kept his promise to protect his pupil.
