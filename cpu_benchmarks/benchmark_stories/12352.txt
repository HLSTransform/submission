Mia was playing in the garden. She was so excited because it was a beautiful day. She ran around and spun in circles until she was dizzy. Suddenly, Mia heard a strange sound. She looked all around but couldn't see where it was coming from. She asked her mom, "What's that sound?"
Mama said, "It's coming from the swing. The swing is dependable. It can always be trusted." She pointed at the swing in the garden.
Mia walked towards the swing. She was curious. She grabbed the swing and gave it a push. The swing started to fall gently back and forth, each time it moved making the same pleasant sound. Mama smiled as she watched her daughter play. 
Mia was so happy. She could play on this dependable swing for hours each day.
