Once upon a time, there lived a big hairy bear. He liked to sleep in his cozy den and eat lots of honey.
One day, he heard a loud rumbling noise. He was curious and looked out of his den. He saw the ground shaking!
The bear had never seen an earthquake before, so he was very scared. He covered his head with his paws, but the shaking kept going. He didn't know what to do!
Then suddenly, the ground stopped shaking. The bear could see that the trees and bushes were all OK. He took a deep breath and was relieved.
The big hairy bear never forgot the day he saw his first earthquake.
