The sun shone brightly on the warm summer day. Two little children played happily in the garden. Suddenly, the gate opened and a stranger walked in.
The little girl gasped. She hid behind her brother's legs, as the strange man stepped closer. He was bigger than them and his face was angry.
The little boy stepped in front of his sister. He knew he had to protect her from the stranger.
The stranger said in a gruff voice, "You naughty kids, you should not be playing here!" He raised his hand and it looked like he was going to slap the little boy.
The little girl was so scared. She wanted to help her brother, so she shouted out loud, "No, don't hit him!"
The stranger stopped. He looked at the little girl with surprise and then he smiled. He said, "You are very brave and I can tell you are a good big sister". He winked and walked away.
The little girl looked relieved, she knew her brother was safe. She was glad that she had spoken up and that she had been brave.
