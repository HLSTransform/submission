Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was playing outside when she fell and hurt her knee. Her mommy put a bandage on it to make it feel better.
The next day, Lily wanted to play with her friends again. But her mommy said she couldn't because her knee needed to heal. Lily got upset and said, "I want to play with my friends now!" 
Mommy said, "I know you do, but we need to wait until your knee is all fit again. Remember how much it hurt when you fell?" 
Lily thought about it and remembered how much it hurt. She didn't want it to hurt again, so she decided to wait until her knee was all better.
