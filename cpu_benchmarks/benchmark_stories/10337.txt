Lily and Ben were friends. They liked to play together in the park. One day, they saw a big house with a fence. The house had many windows and a door with a bell.
"Who lives there?" Lily asked.
"I don't know. Maybe someone rich," Ben said.
They walked closer to the fence. They saw a switch on the wall. It had a sign that said "Do not touch".
"What does it do?" Lily wondered.
"Let's find out," Ben said. He reached for the switch.
"No, don't!" Lily said. "The sign says no."
But Ben did not listen. He pushed the switch. Suddenly, the house made a loud noise. Lights flashed and music played. The door opened and a man came out. He looked angry.
"Who are you? What are you doing here?" he shouted.
Lily and Ben were scared. They ran away from the fence. They did not look back.
They ran to the park. They sat on a bench. They were out of breath.
"That was not fun," Lily said.
"No, it was not," Ben agreed.
They looked at each other. They smiled. They were still friends. They decided to play something else. Something safe and nice. They did not touch the switch again.
