Mommy was busy organizing her things. She had a big notebook and held it tightly in her hands. She carefully opened it, and inside it were some papers. She looked at them sadly. Some of them were dead. 
Mommy closed the notebook and put it away. She went to the kitchen and made a snack for her and her little three year old daughter. They both sat down on the couch and snuggled together. 
Mommy looked at her little girl and smiled. She said, “let’s organize the things in your room, shall we?” 
The little girl jumped off the couch and ran to her room. She came back with a pile of toys and started to organize them. She put them away in her shelves, stacked them up and put different shapes and colors together. It made her so happy when everything was neat and tidy. 
Mommy was happy too. She looked around the room, proud of her little girl. Then she hugged her tightly and said, “I love you so much!”
