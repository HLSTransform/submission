Lily and Ben like to play pretend. They have many toys and costumes. Today, they want to pretend to be hippos. They put on big gray suits and masks. They make loud noises and splash water.
"Look at me, I am a big hippo!" Lily says. She opens her mouth wide and shows her teeth.
"Me too, I am a big hippo!" Ben says. He wiggles his ears and tail.
They run around the yard and pretend to eat grass and swim in the pond. They have a lot of fun.
But then, they see a funny thing. A real hippo is standing by the fence. He is looking at them with curiosity. He thinks they are his friends.
"Hello, hippos!" the real hippo says. He tries to join them.
Lily and Ben are very surprised. They stop playing and look at the real hippo. They are scared and excited.
"Wow, a real hippo!" Lily says.
"Where did he come from?" Ben says.
They run to their mom and dad and tell them about the real hippo. Mom and dad are also surprised. They call the zoo and ask for help.
The zoo people come and take the real hippo back to his home. They say he escaped from his cage and wandered around the neighborhood. They thank Lily and Ben for finding him.
Lily and Ben are happy. They say goodbye to the real hippo. They think he is very funny and nice.
They go back to their toys and costumes. They decide to pretend to be something else. Maybe lions or monkeys or birds. They have many ideas and they have a lot of fun.
