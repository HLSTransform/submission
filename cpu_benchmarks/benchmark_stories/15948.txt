Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He loved to play with his toys and pretend he was on an adventurous ship. One day, Tim's mom came into his room and said, "It's time to go to bed, Tim." 
Tim didn't want to go to bed. He wanted to keep playing with his toys. "Can I play for just a little longer, Mom?" he asked. 
"No, Tim," his mom said. "It's time to close your eyes and go to sleep." 
Tim sighed and put his toys away. He climbed into bed and closed his eyes. As he drifted off to sleep, he dreamed of sailing on an adventurous ship with his favorite toys.
