Lily liked to go to class. She learned many things with her teacher and friends. She liked to draw, sing, and play games. But she did not like to pay.
Every day, Lily had to pay one coin to the teacher. The teacher said it was for the books, the crayons, and the snacks. Lily did not want to give her coin. She wanted to keep it for herself. She liked to look at her coin and make it shine.
One day, Lily had a plan. She hid her coin in her pocket and did not pay the teacher. She thought she was very smart. But the teacher saw her. She called Lily to her desk.
"Lily, did you pay your coin today?" the teacher asked.
Lily felt scared. She lied to the teacher. She said, "Yes, I did."
The teacher shook her head. She said, "No, you did not. I saw you hide your coin in your pocket. That is not nice, Lily. You have to pay your coin like everyone else. It is not fair to the other children."
Lily felt ashamed. She knew the teacher was right. She took out her coin and gave it to the teacher. She said, "I'm sorry, teacher. I was wrong. I will not do it again."
The teacher smiled. She said, "Thank you, Lily. I'm glad you told the truth. That is very brave of you. You can go back to your seat now."
Lily felt happy. She learned a lesson. She learned that paying is good and lying is bad. She learned that being brave is better than being smart. She went back to her seat and joined her friends. She enjoyed the rest of the class.
