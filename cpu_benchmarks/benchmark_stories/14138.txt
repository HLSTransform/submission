One day, Mommy was in the kitchen and something smelt funny! She wondered what it was. She asked her three-year-old daughter, "What did you do?" The little girl smiled and said, "I was spoiling myself in the bathtub!"
Mommy said, "Oh, that sounds fun!" She peeked into the bathtub and saw that the little girl was surrounded by lots of bubbles and floating toys.
Mommy said, "Wow! That looks like so much fun! You must have really enjoyed that." The little girl laughed and said, "Yes, it was a great time!"
Mommy said, "It's time to get out of the bathtub now so we can go play outside and get some fresh air." The little girl said, "Ok, can we go play with the bubbles too?" Mommy said, "Of course! That sounds like a lot of fun! Let's go!"
And so, the mother and daughter went outside and played with the bubbles, laughing and squealing in delight. It was one of the most fun days they had ever had!
