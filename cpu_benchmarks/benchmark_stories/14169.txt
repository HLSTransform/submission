One day, a little boy was playing outside. He was feeling warm and cozy in his new socks. He wanted to touch them and feel how soft they were. He bent down, slowly reached out his little hand, and touched the sock. Suddenly, his hand felt a prickly sensation and he pulled it away quickly. He looked down and saw the ground was covered in prickly thorns. The sock had caught on one of the thorns. He tugged and tugged, but the sock wouldn't come off. He started to cry and scream. His mom came running to help him and carefully pulled the sock off the thorn. Unfortunately, the sock was ruined and now has a big hole in it. The little boy was very sad that his warm and cozy sock was ruined.
