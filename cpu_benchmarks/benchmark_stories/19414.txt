Once upon a time there was a loyal boy. He lived by himself in a small house. One day, he noticed some water coming in from outside. It was a leak!
The boy wanted to stop the leak, so he looked around for something to do it with. He found some stones and he put them in the leaky spot. Then he got some mud and tried to seal the stones in place.
The boy worked hard, and it worked! The leak stopped and his house was safe. He was a loyal boy, and it made him proud that he had solved his problem.
The end.
