Once upon a time there was a little boy names Mike. He was so happy and he loved to joke!
One day Mike was looking around and he saw a symbol. It was a circle with a line through it. He didn't know what it meant.
 Mike laughed and said, "That looks funny. What does that mean?" 
He asked his mom, who was sitting nearby. She said, "That's a soft symbol. It means 'no.'" 
Mike said it was silly and laughed so hard. He made a joke, "Maybe it means 'yes'!" 
His mom smiled and said, "Yes, it means 'no' and 'yes.' It can mean different things." 
Mike thought that was really funny and kept laughing. He kept on making jokes about the symbol and everyone enjoyed it. 
The End
