Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to play. One day, she decided to go explore the park. As she walked, she saw a model. She wanted to catch it, so she reached out and grabbed it with both hands. 
When she held the model in her hands, she saw that it was an original. It had never been played with before! She liked it so much that she decided to take it home with her. 
Back in her room, the little girl spent hours playing with the model. She pretended that it was a boat, then a train, and then a spaceship. She loved it so much and it made her very happy. 
The end!
