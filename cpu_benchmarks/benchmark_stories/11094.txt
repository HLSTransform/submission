One day, a pale cat named Kitty and a little boy named Tim went for a walk. They walked and walked until they were very tired. Tim looked at Kitty and said, "I am thirsty. Do you have a bottle?"
Kitty said, "Yes, I have a bottle of water. We can share it." They sat down under a big tree and Kitty gave the bottle to Tim. Tim drank some water and then gave it back to Kitty.
After they had their drink, they played with a ball. They laughed and had lots of fun. When it was time to go home, Tim said, "Thank you for the bottle of water, Kitty." Kitty smiled and said, "You're welcome, Tim. I am happy we are friends."
