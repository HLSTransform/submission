Once upon a time there was a girl named Sue who loved to play. One day she was walking in the park when she spotted something that made her very excited. It was a big playhouse with a bright yellow door. 
She quickly ran up to the door and impatiently turned the doorknob. All of a sudden, the door opened and she got to enter the playhouse. Inside, there were all kinds of fun things to do. She saw colorful blocks, puzzles and dolls.
Sue was so happy that she forgot to be impatient. She squeaked and bounced around the playhouse as she explored each thing. She spent so much time playing with the toys that before she knew it, the sun was setting and it was time for Sue to go home.
But Sue had had so much fun in the playhouse that she couldn't wait to go back the next day. For now though, it was time to say goodbye.
