Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jake. Jake lived by a big ranch and he loved visiting it every day.
One day, Jake got scared when he heard a loud noise coming from the ranch. He ran away and hid in his mom's closet.
When his mom found him, she asked him, "What is wrong, Jake?".
Jake answered, "I heard a loud noise from the ranch and it scared me."
His mom said, "It's ok, just be brave and let's go see what it was".
When they got to the ranch, they saw that it was just a big windy storm.
Jake felt better, and he was no longer scared.
