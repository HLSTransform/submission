Once there was an enormous lake. All around it were lots of trees and animals.
One day, a mother and her little boy sat by the lake. They had a special camera, and the mother said she was going to take a photo. She looked out over the lake, and clicked the button.
The mother and the little boy watched as the photo dried in the sun. After a few minutes, it was dry, and the little boy held the photo in his hand.
The photo was so big and so beautiful. It showed the enormous lake and all the trees and animals around it. The little boy was so happy and smiled widely. He loved the photo and never wanted to let it go.
