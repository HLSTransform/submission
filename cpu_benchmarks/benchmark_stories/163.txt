Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. While she was playing, she found a shiny rock on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her friends. "Look at this pretty rock I found!" she said.
One of her friends said, "That's not just any rock, it's a mineral! My dad told me about them. They come from deep underground and are very rare." Lily was fascinated by the mineral and decided to keep it in her pocket.
Later that day, Lily was walking home when she heard a loud noise. She looked around and saw a big dog running towards her. She was frightened and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, the mineral in her pocket started to glow and the dog stopped in its tracks. Lily realized that the mineral had magical powers and it saved her from the scary dog.
When she got home, she told her mom about the mineral and how it helped her. Her mom was amazed and proud of her brave daughter. From that day on, Lily kept the mineral with her wherever she went, knowing that it would always come to her rescue if she was ever frightened again.
