Once upon a time there was a boy and a girl who were best friends. They liked to play together and were always together. They loved to laugh and have fun.
One day, a problem came between them. The boy did something bad and the girl felt hurt. She was so angry she became distant and stopped wanting to play with the boy.
The boy was sad. He tried to make her happy but she still stayed distant. Finally, he decided to do something special. He got a treat and took it to the girl. He said he was sorry and asked her to forgive him.
The girl was happy and decided to forgive him. She took the treat and they started to play together again. From that day on they were best friends again, and they never let anything come between them.
