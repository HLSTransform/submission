Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sandy. She was only three years old and loved to learn new things.
One day, Sandy wanted to learn how to tie a tight knot in a piece of plastic string. So she went to her mom and asked, "Mommy, can you help me learn how to tie a knot?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Sure! Let's get the plastic string and figure it out together!"
Sandy grabbed a piece of plastic string and her mom started to show her how to tie it into a knot. First she showed Sandy how to loop the string around twice. Then she taught Sandy how to pull it tight and make sure it was secure.
Sandy watched closely and did exactly what her mom showed her how to do. After a few tries, Sandy had successfully created a tight knot in the plastic string! She was so excited and proud of herself for learning something new.
Sandy's mom smiled and hugged her tightly. "See, I told you could do it!" she said.
Sandy smiled and said, "Yes Mommy, I learned how to tie a knot!" She hugged her mom back and felt so happy that she had learned something new that day.
