Once upon a time there was a family. They were a mom, dad, brother and sister. One day the mom said it was time to introduce a new friend to the family.
 The dad opened the door and the family peered inside. They saw a big, cold, ready refrigerator! Everyone was very excited. They put their yummy food inside and they tried to think of a good name for the new friend; they decided to call it Fridgey! 
From then on, Fridgey was part of the family. It kept their food cold so it was always ready to eat. They shared snacks, drinks and meals together happily. 
The family was so glad to have Fridgey as part of their home. 
The end.
