Timmy loved waffles. He liked to eat them with honey and butter. But today, he had a problem. His mom said he could only have one waffle for breakfast. She said he had to choose between a big waffle and a small waffle.
Timmy looked at the waffles. The big waffle was brown and crispy. The small waffle was soft and fluffy. He wanted both. He did not want to choose. He felt sad and angry.
He said to his mom, "I want both waffles! Why can't I have both?"
His mom said, "Timmy, you have to choose. You can't have both. That's too much. You have to share with your sister. She wants a waffle too."
Timmy did not like his mom's words. He thought they were harsh. He did not want to share with his sister. He wanted both waffles for himself. He said, "No! I don't want to share! I don't like my sister! She is mean!"
His mom said, "Timmy, that's not nice. You have to be kind to your sister. She is your family. You have to share with her. Now, choose a waffle or you will have none."
Timmy did not want to have none. He knew his mom was serious. He looked at the waffles again. He thought hard. He decided to choose the big waffle. He thought it would make him more full. He said, "OK, I choose the big waffle."
His mom said, "Good. Here is your big waffle. And here is your sister's small waffle. Now, eat your breakfast and say sorry to your sister."
Timmy took his big waffle. He put honey and butter on it. He took a bite. It was yummy. He looked at his sister. She was eating her small waffle. She looked happy. He felt a little sorry. He said, "Sorry, sister. I was mean. Do you want some of my waffle?"
His sister said, "That's OK, Timmy. I forgive you. You are my brother. I love you. And yes, I would like some of your waffle. Thank you."
Timmy smiled. He broke off a piece of his waffle and gave it to his sister. She took it and said, "Thank you, Timmy. This is very nice of you. Your waffle is yummy."
Timmy felt happy. He said, "You're welcome, sister. Your waffle is yummy too. I'm glad we can share."
They ate their waffles and hugged each other. Their mom watched them and smiled. She was proud of them. She said, "That's my good kids. I love you both."
