Once upon a time, there was an old man. He liked to study a lot. He had many books. He read them every day.
One day, he found a big box. Inside the box, there was a network. The network was made of ropes. The old man wanted to learn about the network.
He studied the network every day. He played with the ropes. He made new shapes with the network. The old man was very happy. And he shared his network with his friends. They all had fun together.
