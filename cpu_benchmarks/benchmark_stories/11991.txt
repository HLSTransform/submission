Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his toys, especially his favorite teddy bear named Teddy. One day, Timmy's friend Jimmy came over to play. Jimmy wanted to play with Teddy, but Timmy didn't want to share. 
Jimmy said, "Timmy, it's not honest to not share your toys." 
Timmy felt bad, so he decided to let Jimmy play with Teddy too. But then, when it was time for Jimmy to go home, he didn't want to give Teddy back. He squeezed Teddy tight and said, "I want to keep him!" 
Timmy felt sad and didn't know what to do. But then he remembered what his mom always said, "If you're kind to others, they'll be kind to you." So, Timmy told Jimmy that he could borrow Teddy sometimes, but he needed to give him back. Jimmy agreed, and they both learned that sharing is the best way to play together.
