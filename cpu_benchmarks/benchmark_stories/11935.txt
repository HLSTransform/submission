Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mom. She saw a big space with lots of grass and flowers. She ran around and played with her ball.
Suddenly, she saw her friend Timmy. He looked sad. She asked him what was wrong. Timmy said he lost his sandwich and he was hungry. Lily said she had an idea. She spread her blanket on the grass and shared her sandwich with Timmy. Timmy was happy and thanked Lily for being so helpful.
Lily and Timmy played together for the rest of the day. They had so much fun in the park. When it was time to go home, Lily said goodbye to Timmy and went home with her mom. She told her mom about her day and how she was able to be a helpful friend to Timmy. Her mom was proud of her and gave her a big hug.
