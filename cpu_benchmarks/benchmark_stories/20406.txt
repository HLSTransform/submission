Once upon a time, there was a wise owl named Hootie. Hootie lived in a big tree in the forest. One day, Hootie felt sick and had a fever. His friend, a squirrel named Nutty, wanted to help him feel better.
Nutty knew he had to prepare something to help Hootie. He went to his home and got a thermometer to check Hootie's temperature. Nutty saw that Hootie's temperature was high, so he decided to make him some tea with honey.
Nutty went to the kitchen and boiled some water. He put a tea bag in the hot water and added honey. He stirred it and let it cool down a bit. Then, he brought the tea to Hootie. Hootie drank the tea and started to feel better. Nutty was happy that he could help his friend.
