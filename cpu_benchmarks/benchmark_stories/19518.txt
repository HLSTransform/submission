Once upon a time, there were two friends. They wanted to go on an adventure and explore something new. With a blanket, lunch, and water bottles, they set out on a trail.
The path was long and bumpy, but the friends were having fun. Suddenly, the trail got very dark, and the friends felt very scared.
They kept walking and soon arrived at the entrance of a cave. At the entrance was a big sign that said, "Warning: Do Not Enter. It's very dangerous in here." But the friends were brave and decided to enter anyway.
Inside, the cave was terrible. There were dangerous animals and creepy caves. The friends started to get very scared, and they quickly decided it was time to go back home. They ran as fast as they could until they were back at the cave entrance.
The friends stopped, panted and caught their breath. Then they slowly closed the entrance of the cave. They were glad to be out of the terrible place, and together, the two friends made their way home happy.
