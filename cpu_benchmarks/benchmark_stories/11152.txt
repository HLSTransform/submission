Once upon a time, there was a bunny named Benny. He loved to eat carrots and he always shared them with his friends. One day, he met a squirrel named Sammy who wanted to trade nuts for carrots. Benny agreed and they made a deal.
As they were trading, Sammy tasted one of Benny's carrots and said, "Wow, these are the best carrots I have ever tasted!" Benny felt happy and polite because Sammy liked his carrots.
But then, the next day, Sammy came back and wanted to trade again. However, this time he didn't have any nuts to trade. He asked Benny if he could have some carrots for free. Benny felt conflicted because he wanted to be polite, but he also didn't want to give away all his carrots for free.
Benny remembered what his mom had told him about being careful when trading. He politely told Sammy that he couldn't give away all his carrots for free, but he would be happy to trade again another day. Sammy understood and they said goodbye. Benny felt proud of himself for remembering his mom's advice and for being polite to his friend.
