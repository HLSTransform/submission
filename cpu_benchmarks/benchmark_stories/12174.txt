Once upon a time, there was a girl named Clara. She was very adventurous. One day, Clara decided to visit an airport.
When she arrived, Clara saw a plane. She was very excited to explore the airport. She waved goodbye to her parents and then hopped onto the plane.
When Clara arrived to her destination, she was amazed by the sight she saw. She decided to take a walk and explore all the shops and attractions. She saw so many sights and took so many pictures.
On the way home, Clara spoke to one of the passengers. She said, “This was the best and most adventurous day ever! I’m so happy I decided to come to the airport!”
The other passenger smiled and nodded. Clara waved goodbye to everyone at the airport and then boarded the plane. Soon, she was back home with her family. Clara had had the most adventurous day ever!
