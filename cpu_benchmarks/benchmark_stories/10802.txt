Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they were playing hide-and-seek when Lily found a shiny medal on the ground. She was so happy and showed it to her friends. 
One of her friends asked, "Where did you get that medal, Lily?" 
"I found it on the ground," replied Lily. 
Her friend said, "You should call your parents and tell them you found a medal!" 
So, Lily called her parents and told them about her medal. They were very proud of her and told her she was a good girl. From that day on, Lily wore her medal everywhere she went.
