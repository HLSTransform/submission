Sadie was taking a tour. She got to the top of a tall hill and looked around. The view was so beautiful that she started to cry. Her mummy came over and gave her a gentle hug.
Mummy was so gentle. She wiped away Sadie's tears and said, "I know, it's a wonderful sight."
Mummy took Sadie's hand and they walked around the top of the hill. Sadie saw more pretty things like flowers, trees and birds. She smiled through her tears and felt happy again. 
When it was time to go, mummy gave Sadie one last gentle hug and said, "Let's go on another tour soon." Sadie nodded, still smiling as she wiped away the last of her tears.
