Once upon a time, there was a grumpy bear. He was always sad and didn't like to play with his friends. One day, his friend asked him to come to a party. The grumpy bear said no because he didn't want to have fun.
But then, his friend told him that there would be lots of honey at the party. The grumpy bear loved honey, so he changed his mind and decided to go. He put on his favorite hat and loaded his backpack with snacks.
At the party, the grumpy bear had so much fun! He ate lots of honey and danced with his friends. He realized that life was better when he was happy and with his friends. From that day on, he was never grumpy again.
