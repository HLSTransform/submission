Bob was a little boy. He wanted a motorcylce. One day, he found a hairy motorcylce in the forest. He shouted in excitement.
He called to his mom, "Mom look! I found a motorcylce! Can I have it?" 
His mom said, "No, you can't. It belongs to someone else." 
Bob was sad and he started to cry. He wanted the motorcylce so much.
Suddenly, a big man appeared on the motorcycle. He said, "That's my motorcycle. What are you doing here?"
The man was mad. He shouted at Bob. He took back his motorcycle. Bob was scared and he started to cry even louder.
The man got angry and quickly rode away on his motorcycle. Bob was left alone, crying in the forest.
