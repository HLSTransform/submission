Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jane. Jane was three and she loved to play at the park with her friends. One day she took her mom to the park to play with her little friends. While they were playing, Jane had an accident and spilled her juice all over her dress.
She started to complain, but her mom gave her an open napkin to help clean it up. Jane smiled and thanked her mom for the napkin. She cleaned up her dress and then went back to playing with her friends.
After playing for a while, Jane started to feel very sleepy, so she asked her mom if she could take a nap. Her mom said yes and she laid down on the open napkin. She fell asleep quickly while mom watched, and they both had a nice nap in the park.
