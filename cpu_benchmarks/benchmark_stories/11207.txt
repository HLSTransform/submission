Once there was a little girl named Jane. She was three years old. One day, she decided to go for a walk in the park.
As Jane walked through the park, she saw something gray. It was a big oyster! She was so excited!
Jane wanted to take a closer look, so she entered the oyster. When she got in, it was dark and cozy inside.
Suddenly, Jane heard a voice. "Hello little girl!" It was the voice of the oyster.
Jane was very surprised. She said, "Hello!"
The oyster said, "Would you like to stay for a while?"
Jane was so happy! She said, "Yes, I would love to stay!"
So Jane spent the day inside the gray oyster, playing and exploring. It was a wonderful adventure!
