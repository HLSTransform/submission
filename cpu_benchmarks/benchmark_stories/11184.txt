Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going on picnics with her family. One day, her mom packed a yummy lunch and they went to the park. Lily saw a big, dirty puddle and wanted to jump in it. 
Her mom said, "Lily, don't jump in that puddle, you'll get your clothes dirty." 
Lily replied, "But I want to jump and jog in it!" 
Her mom said, "No, Lily. It's not good to get dirty. Let's have our picnic and then we can play on the swings." 
Lily learned that it's important to listen to her mom and not always do what she wants. She had a fun picnic and played on the swings, feeling happy and clean.
