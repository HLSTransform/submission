Once upon a time there lived a little girl named Izzy. Izzy loved to play in her jungle. Every day, she would run and swing amongst the trees, make tiny hiding places in the bushes and even pretend to roar like one of the animals. It was so much fun!
One day, Izzy was so excited to go to her jungle that she ran there before her mom could tell her goodbye. She had the best time ever playing there!
But suddenly, she heard a loud scream! Izzy was scared and ran back home. When she saw her mom, she screamed and hugged her tightly.
Her mom was happy to see her, but saw that Izzy was untidy. She took her inside and asked her what happened. Izzy was too scared to say what she heard, so he mom looked around in the jungle. She soon noticed that one of the animals had made a realy tidy nest. 
"That's alright Izzy," said her mom, giving her a hug. "I'm glad you're safe." 
Izzy was happy to be back home. She knew now that her jungle was not only fun but safe, too.
