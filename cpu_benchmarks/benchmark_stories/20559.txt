Once upon a time, there was a light quiz. It was fun and juicy! 
The quiz had many questions and it asked the kids to think and answer. 
But the kids couldn't answer the questions on their own. 
So their teacher fed them the answers! This made them so happy. 
The kids learned lots from the light quiz. At the end of it, they cheered with joy!
