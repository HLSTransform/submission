Sam and Lily are twins. They like to play outside in the yard. They have a big red ball and a small yellow car. They throw the ball and push the car on the grass. They have fun.
But then the sky becomes gray. The wind blows hard. The rain falls fast. Sam and Lily are wet and cold. They run inside the house. They see Mom in the kitchen.
"Mom, we are wet and cold!" they say.
Mom smiles and hugs them. "You need to wash and change, my loves. It is time for a warm bath and some hot soup. Come with me."
Mom takes them to the bathroom. She fills the tub with water and bubbles. She helps them take off their wet clothes and put them in the hamper. She washes their hair and body with soap and a soft sponge. She rinses them with clean water. She wraps them in big fluffy towels. She dries their hair and body. She puts on their pajamas and slippers.
They feel warm and cozy. They go to the kitchen. They see Dad at the table. He has a big pot of soup and some bread. He smiles and kisses them.
"Hello, my loves. You look clean and happy. Are you ready for some soup?"
They nod and sit down. They eat the soup and bread. They drink some milk. They talk about their day. They thank Mom and Dad for the bath and the soup. They hug and kiss them.
They go to their bedroom. They brush their teeth and go to bed. They snuggle under the blanket. They close their eyes. They dream of sunny days and fun games. They are happy.
