Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a blue ball that he loved to play with. One day, Tim's mom took him to the shop. Tim did not want to go to the shop. He wanted to play with his blue ball. But his mom said, "We need to buy food."
At the shop, Tim saw a big man. The big man was mean. He took Tim's blue ball away. Tim was very sad. He told his mom, "I hate the big man. He has my blue ball." His mom tried to help, but the big man would not give the blue ball back.
Tim and his mom went home without the blue ball. Tim was very sad. He missed his blue ball. The big man had made the day bad. Tim did not want to go to the shop ever again.
