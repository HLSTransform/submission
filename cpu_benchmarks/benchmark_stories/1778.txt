One morning, mommy and daddy were feeling very thoughtful. They were going to raise something special! They opened the door and brought in a puppy! When the puppy saw mommy and daddy, he wagged his tail and jumped with joy. Mommy and daddy gave the puppy lots of love. They named him Rover and took him outside to play and go for walks. Everyone in the family was so happy to have Rover as part of the family. He even got to join them at the table for dinner! Each and every morning, Mommy and Daddy loved to raise Rover with love.
