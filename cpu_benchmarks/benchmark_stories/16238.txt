Once upon a time there was a player who really wanted to play. She was so eager to try out a new game. She picked up the game pieces and made a few moves. Suddenly the player made a mistake, and the pieces all fell down. 
The player was very sad, and felt like she had made a big mistake. She didn't know if she would ever be able to fix it. 
Just then, a gentle voice said, "You can always try again. Everything can be forgiven". The player looked up and saw a kind old lady. She looked so friendly and wise. 
The player smiled and thanked the old lady. She was so happy to have a chance to try again. She knew she could do it this time. 
The player began to play the game again. She was so eager to get it right and learn from her mistake. In the end, she won the game! The player was so proud of herself. She was thankful for the kind old lady and her wise words of forgiveness.
