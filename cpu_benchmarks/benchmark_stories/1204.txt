Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play basketball with his friends. One day, Timmy's dad bought him a new basketball. Timmy was so happy and couldn't wait to play with it.
When Timmy went to play with his friends, one of them asked to borrow his new basketball. Timmy didn't want to share because he was afraid it would get dirty or broken. But then, Timmy's dad reminded him that sharing is important and that he should let his friend play with the new basketball.
Timmy decided to share and let his friend play with the new basketball. His friend was so happy and thanked Timmy. Timmy felt good inside and realized that sharing is always the right thing to do. And after the game, Timmy and his friends went to get some ice cream. Timmy tried a new flavor and said, "Wow, this tastes great!"
