Once upon a time, there was a little kitten named Mittens. Mittens was very popular with all the other animals in the forest because she was so cute and cuddly. One day, Mittens met a wise old owl who asked her, "Mittens, do you know what it means to weigh something?"
Mittens shook her head, "No, Mr. Owl. What does it mean?"
"To weigh something means to see how heavy it is," replied the owl. "You see, Mittens, it's not just about being popular or cute. It's also important to be strong and healthy. You should eat good food and exercise so you can weigh the right amount for your size."
Mittens listened carefully and realized that being healthy was just as important as being popular. From that day on, she made sure to eat well and play outside every day. And all the animals in the forest still loved her, not just because she was cute, but because she was strong and healthy too.
