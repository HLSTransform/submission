John saw his mother. He thought she was so smart. His mother seemed so happy and neat. She was wearing a big red ribbon in her hair.
John's mother was always teaching him. She taught him shapes, colours, and counting. She read him stories and sang him songs.
John knew his mother was the smartest of them all. He wanted to be just like her.
John was so proud. He was learning everything quickly. It seemed like he was getting smarter every day.
