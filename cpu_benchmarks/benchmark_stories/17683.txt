Once upon a time there was a little girl called Sarah. She was three years old. 
One day, Sarah went for a walk in the forest. She was very excited. She saw all sorts of interesting things, like animals and plants. Then she saw a mushroom. 
Sarah was very happy. She bent down and admired it. She thought it was very pretty. 
Suddenly, a fairy flew down from above and landed next to the mushroom. She thanked Sarah for admiring her mushroom. The fairy was so grateful and made a wish for Sarah. 
Sarah thanked the fairy and then she went home. She was very happy and always remembered the magical moment.
