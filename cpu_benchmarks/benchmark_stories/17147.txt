Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. He had a nice teddy bear that he loved to cuddle with every night.
One day, Timmy went to the park to play with his friends. He had so much fun playing on the swings and the slide. But when it was time to go home, Timmy forget his teddy bear at the park.
Timmy was very sad when he realized that he had left his teddy bear behind. He went back to the park to look for it, but it was already gone. Timmy cried and cried, but his teddy bear was lost forever.
From that day on, Timmy learned to always remember his things and never forget them again. He missed his teddy bear very much and wished he could have it back. The end.
