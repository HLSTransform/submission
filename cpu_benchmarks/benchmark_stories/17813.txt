Once upon a time there were twin brothers. They were both very pale. Everyday, they would go outside and play together. After playing, they would come inside and have to wash. The first brother would take a shower and the other a bath. 
When they got out, they both felt so clean and fresh. Then they could play more. Later on at night, the twin boys would even brush their teeth before bed.
They both seemed to enjoy brushing their teeth. Then, their teacher asked them about washing and said that it was very important to keep clean! Both the twins said yes, and proudly told her that they wash every single day. 
The teacher smiled in satisfaction, knowing that the twins understood how important it was to stay clean. 
The twins went on playing and being clean, happy together as ever.
