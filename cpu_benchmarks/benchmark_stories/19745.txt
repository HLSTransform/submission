Once there was a friendly boy called Jimmy. He loved to zoom around on his scooter. One day, Jimmy was zooming down the street when he noticed something strange. It was a giant apple with a sharp tooth. It was glaring at Jimmy with an evil look.
Suddenly, the giant apple lurched forward and bit Jimmy's arm! Jimmy cried out in pain and fear, but he was brave and ran away from the monster apple. 
Luckily, Jimmy wasn't injured too badly, but he was still scared. He ran to his house and told his mom about the scary apple. His mom laughed and said, "That's silly! That was probably just a friendly apple. A friendly apple wouldn't bite anyone!" 
Jimmy wasn't sure what had happened, but he was relieved to feel safe. From then on, every time he went out to zoom around on his scooter, he brought his mom with him just in case - to keep him safe from any friendly apples!
