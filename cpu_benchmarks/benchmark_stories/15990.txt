One sunny day, Sally and her father were walking in the garden. Sally saw a snake. It was coiled up in the grass.
Sally asked her father, "What is that?"
Her father smiled and said, "That's a snake. It's harmless."
Sally was excited. She asked her dad, "Can I join it?"
Her father was hesitant but he said, "Sure, if you stay close to me."
Sally carefully stepped closer to the snake. She waved at it. The snake waved back with its tail.
Sally laughed in delight. She sat down and started playing with the snake.
Sally's dad watched with a smile on his face. He said, "See, I told you it was harmless!"
