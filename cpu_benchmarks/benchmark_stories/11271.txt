"Look, I can do this!" shouted John, jumping around and flailing his arms in the air. His younger sister, Emily, laughed.
"John, what are you doing?" Emily asked, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.
"I'm flying," John said, flapping his arms.
Emily laughed again, shaking her head. "No, you're not," she said.
John frowned. "I'm not? Then what am I doing?" he asked.
"You're playful," Emily said, brushing her brown hair out of her face.
John smiled, understanding what his sister meant. "Yes, I am," he said, as he jumped and twirled around the room. Emily laughed, watching her brother act so silly. Together, the two siblings played.
