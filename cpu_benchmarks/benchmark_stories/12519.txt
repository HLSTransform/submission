Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a big bookcase in her room. One day, the bookcase broke and all the books fell down. Lily was sad because she liked her bookcase. 
Her dad came into the room and saw the mess. He said, "Don't worry, Lily, I will fix it." He got his tools and started to work. It took him a long time, but finally, he fixed the bookcase. 
Lily was happy because her bookcase was unique. It had different colors and shapes on it. She put all her books back on the bookcase and it looked perfect again. She thanked her dad for fixing it and hugged him.
