Johnny was a naughty boy. He didn't like to listen to his mom. Every day he disobeyed her. So one day his mom decided to punish Johnny.
She took him to a big gray building. Inside, Johnny saw a big cross in the front. He knew he was in trouble. 
The man there told Johnny that he had to sit for a long time and think about what he'd done wrong. He had to stay still, without making any noise. It was boring but Johnny had to stay there until his mom said it was time to go home.
After a long time, Johnny's mom said he could leave. Then she told him that he must obey her from now on or he would have to go back to the big gray building.
Johnny was so scared he promised to always listen to his mom. He has kept his promise ever since.
