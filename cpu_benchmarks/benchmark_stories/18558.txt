Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, Lily's mommy was feeling very tired and her back hurt a lot. So, Lily decided to help her mommy by giving her a massage. 
Lily gently rubbed her mommy's back and it made her feel better. Her mommy was so happy and calm. She thanked Lily for being such a good helper. 
From that day on, Lily loved to help her mommy and give her massages whenever she needed them. It made her mommy feel so much better and they both felt happy.
