Tom and his mom went to the museum. They wanted to see the big dinosaurs. Tom loved dinosaurs. He had many dinosaur toys at home.
When they got to the museum, they had to unpack their bags. The museum lady said they could not bring food or drinks inside. She checked their bags and gave them a sticker. Tom put the sticker on his shirt. He was proud.
"Look, mom, a T-rex!" Tom said, pointing to a huge skeleton. He ran to the dinosaur and looked up. It was taller than his house. He wanted to touch it, but there was a rope around it.
"Be careful, Tom. Don't cross the rope. The dinosaur is very old and fragile. We have to respect it," his mom said, following him.
"Why is it old and fragile, mom?" Tom asked.
"Because it lived a long time ago, before people. It was a real animal, not a toy. The museum people found its bones and put them together. They want to show us how it looked like and what it ate and how it moved," his mom explained.
"Wow, that's amazing, mom. Can we see more dinosaurs?" Tom asked.
"Of course, Tom. There are many more dinosaurs in the museum. Come on, let's go and explore," his mom said, holding his hand.
Tom smiled and nodded. He was happy. He loved the museum. He loved his mom. He loved dinosaurs.
