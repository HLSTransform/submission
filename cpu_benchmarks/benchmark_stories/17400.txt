Anna liked to demand things from her mom and dad. She wanted luxury toys, like a big dollhouse, a shiny bike, and a fluffy unicorn. She did not like to share or say thank you. She thought she was the best and deserved everything.
One day, Anna's mom and dad had to go to work. They asked Anna's grandma to watch her. Anna did not like her grandma. She thought she was old and boring. She did not have any luxury toys at her house. She only had books, puzzles, and a wooden horse.
Anna tried to demand things from her grandma. She said, "I want a dollhouse! I want a bike! I want a unicorn!" But her grandma did not listen. She said, "No, Anna. You have enough toys at home. Here, you can play with these. They are simple, but dependable. They will not break or get lost. They will help you learn and have fun."
Anna was angry. She threw the books, puzzles, and horse on the floor. She said, "I don't want these! They are boring and ugly! You are mean and stingy!" She ran to the corner and cried.
Her grandma was sad. She picked up the toys and put them on the table. She said, "Anna, I love you. But you are being rude and selfish. You do not need luxury toys to be happy. You need to be grateful and kind. You need to share and say thank you. You need to respect and love others. That is what makes you the best and deserves everything." She hugged Anna and kissed her cheek.
Anna felt sorry. She realized her grandma was right. She said, "I'm sorry, grandma. You are not mean and stingy. You are wise and generous. You are not old and boring. You are fun and loving. You are not ugly. You are beautiful. You are dependable. You are my grandma." She hugged her grandma and said thank you. She played with the books, puzzles, and horse. She learned and had fun. She was happy.
