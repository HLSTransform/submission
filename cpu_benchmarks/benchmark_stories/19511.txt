There was an elephant who really wanted to succeed. He tried hard every day. He would try and lift heavy logs, do tricks and practice running. He kept trying and trying, but he just couldn't seem to succeed.
One day, he tried something new. He stood on a big rock and started to jump up and down. Every time, he got higher and higher. He kept jumping until he could touch the clouds! He jumped so high he had succeeded at last!
He was so glad that he jumped with joy and made a trumpet noise. All the other animals looked at him in amazement. They had never seen an elephant fly so high! From that day on, he became known as "The Flying Elephant".
