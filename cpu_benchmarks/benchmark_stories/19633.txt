Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Joe. He had a pet pan named Pam and they were best friends. Joe loved to play with Pam, but sometimes she teased him too much.
Every day when Joe came home from school he would play games with Pam. He would try to sneak up on her and she would giggle and run away. She was so silly! Joe loved it when she teased him.
One day, Joe had a great idea. He decided to make a surprise for Pam with his pan. He put some of her favorite tiny treats in the pan and added some yummy juices. When she saw the pan, her eyes lit up! Joe was so happy to see his pet happy.
From then on, Joe and Pam had all kinds of fun together. They would run and dance around the house, while Joe chased Pam with his pan. It was so much fun! Joe and Pam were the best of friends.
