Jacob was feeling excited. He was getting a haircut! Every month his dad took him to the salon. He got to pick the colour of his hair and today he wanted it to be bright.
When they arrived, the hairdresser welcomed him with a big smile. She wet his hair, cut it and then asked him what colour he wanted. Jacob said "bright"! The hairdresser then mixed up some bright colours and painted them into Jacob's hair. It looked so beautiful.
Jacob wanted to keep his bright hair forever so he asked his dad if he could go for a haircut every week. His dad laughed and said that he couldn't repeat a haircut every week. But he promised to take Jacob for a cut once a month so he can keep his hair bright and beautiful. 
Jacob smiled and gave his dad a hug. He couldn't wait for his next haircut.
