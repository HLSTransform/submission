Once upon a time there was a family. They were very happy and had a peaceful life. One day the mother decided to buy them an automobile. The automobile was very big and shiny. All three family members were so excited to go on a ride in it.
The first time they took it to the park. It was a very sunny day and they were able to enjoy the ride very much. In the park they went on the swings, slides and even spoiled their mom with an ice cream!
After that, they took the automobile to the beach. It was so peaceful there and they enjoyed it a lot. They made a sandcastle and soaked up the sun rays in the sun.
The family had so much fun in their new automobile. It gave them many fun and peaceful memories.
