Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the store to buy some new clothes. Timmy picked out a shirt with his favorite superhero on it. 
The next day, Timmy went to play outside with his friends. While playing, Timmy fell and ripped his new shirt. His friends were sad for him. Timmy was serious and didn't know what to do. 
Timmy's mom told him they could spend some time together sewing the cloth back together. Timmy was happy to spend time with his mom and learn how to sew. After they finished, Timmy's shirt was as good as new and he was happy to show his friends.
