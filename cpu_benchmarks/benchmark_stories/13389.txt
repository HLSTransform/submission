Once upon a time, there was a little monkey named Max. Max loved to climb trees and eat bananas. One day, Max climbed too high and got stuck on a branch.
Max cried out, "Help! Help! I'm stuck!"
A kind giraffe heard Max's cries and came to help. The giraffe used her long neck to reach the branch and helped Max down. Max was grateful and thanked the giraffe.
The moral of the story is that it's important to ask for help when you need it. Even though life can be harsh sometimes, there are always kind animals who are willing to help.
