Once upon a time, there was a big castle. It was very impressive and had many towers. The king lived there with his family. But one day, a big storm came and destroyed the castle's structure. The king was very sad and didn't know what to do. 
Then, a kind wizard appeared and offered to restore the castle. The king was very happy and agreed. The wizard worked very hard and soon the castle was as impressive as before. The king was very grateful and thanked the wizard. 
But the king soon forgot the wizard's kindness and became very selfish. He didn't share his wealth with the poor and didn't help those in need. One day, the wizard came back and saw how the king had changed. He was very disappointed and decided to leave. 
The moral of the story is that we should always be kind and grateful to those who help us. If we forget their kindness, we may lose their help forever.
