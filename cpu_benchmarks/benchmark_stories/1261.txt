Once there was a kind-hearted ant. He wanted to be clean so he went in search of something to wash himself with. He found a gentle stream nearby and hopped in. He felt the water on his body and the stream washed him clean. After he was finished, he felt refreshed and happy.
The ant made his way back home and went to see his friends. He told them of his experience and encouraged them to wash too. His friends were so grateful for his guidance and compassion.
The little ant helped his friends find a stream and showed them how to wash. They also felt refreshed and happy once they were clean. Now the little ant and his friends could get back to enjoying the warm sunshine and fresh air.
