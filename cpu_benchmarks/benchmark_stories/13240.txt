Once upon a time, there was a lion named Leo. Leo spent a lot of his time sleeping and being quiet. One day, he decided to take a walk in the meadow and look for food. As he walked, he suddenly heard a noise and was very surprised!
When he looked around, he saw a rabbit. The rabbit was crying and looked very scared. Leo had a compassionate heart, so he decided to help. He asked the rabbit what was wrong.
The rabbit told Leo that he had been lost for a long time and was looking for his family. Leo felt so sad for the rabbit and told him he would help. He started to look and after a while, he found a family of rabbits. 
Leo was excited and he ran to the family to surprise them with the news. The rabbit family was so happy to see their lost baby and thanked Leo for helping. Leo felt proud that he was able to help the rabbit and his family. 
Afterwards, Leo the lion and the rabbit family became the best of friends and spent a lot of time together. Leo was very happy to have such a good friend and knew he would cherish this friendship forever.
