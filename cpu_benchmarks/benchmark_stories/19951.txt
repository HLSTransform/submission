Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run, jump and slide on the grass and the swings. They were very happy and laughed a lot.
"Look, Lily, the sunshine is brilliant today!" Ben said, pointing at the sky. "It is very bright and warm. Do you like the sunshine?"
"Yes, I like the sunshine very much. It makes me feel good. And it makes the flowers and the birds happy too. See, they are so colorful and cheerful!" Lily said, looking around.
They decided to sit on a bench and enjoy the sunshine. They found a seat that was not too hot or too cold. They shared a sandwich and a juice that their mom had packed for them.
"Thank you for being my friend, Ben. You are very kind and fun. I like to play with you in the park." Lily said, smiling at Ben.
"Thank you for being my friend, Lily. You are very sweet and smart. I like to play with you in the park too." Ben said, hugging Lily.
They finished their snack and continued to play in the park. They were very happy and grateful for the sunshine and their friendship.
