Once upon a time, there was a mom and a very excited 3 year old. The little boy wanted to go to the park to play his favourite sport - hockey! 
The mom put on her shoes and they headed to the park together. When they arrived, the little boy ran straight to the hockey court. The court was big and open, and there were sticks and balls available.
The mom helped the 3 year old to pick up the sticks, and the little boy jumped around the court, chasing after the ball. Mom smiled, watching as the little boy laughed and played. 
They played for a long time, but eventually it was time to go home. 
The little boy and his mom said goodbye to the park and walked home together, both happy after a great day of playing hockey.
