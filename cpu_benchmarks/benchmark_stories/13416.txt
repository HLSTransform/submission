Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved cars and trains, especially the ones with big engines. He would watch them go by for hours and dream of riding on them.
One day, Timmy found a toy train with a big engine. It was so interesting to him! He played with it all day, pretending he was the conductor. He even tried to measure how fast it could go.
But then, something terrible happened. Timmy accidentally broke the train. He was so sad and didn't know how to fix it. He cried and cried, wishing he could go back in time and not break it. From that day on, Timmy learned to be more careful with his toys.
