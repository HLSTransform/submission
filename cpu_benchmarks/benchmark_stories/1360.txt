Once upon a time, there was a happy girl called Emma. She was playing outside in the sunshine and having a great time. But then she felt a tickly feeling in her nose. She knew it was time! She said "Ah-ah-CHOO!" and she sneezed.
Then something very strange happened. All of a sudden, there was a loud noise. It was an emergency vehicle, an ambulance. It was coming down the street with its lights flashing and its siren blaring. Emma stopped playing and looked around. She saw the ambulance, and she was very surprised.
But soon it was gone and the street was quiet again. Emma finished her game and went inside. She was still happy, even though the ambulance had been an emergency. She went to bed, happy that she knew what an emergency was. But she was also glad that it hadn’t been her having an emergency – that it was just her sneeze!
