One day, a yellow bird flew over a big forest. He saw many other birds of different colors and shapes. He wanted to make friends with them, but they did not like him. They said he was too bright and loud, and they chased him away.
The yellow bird was very sad. He flew and flew until he saw a big castle. He landed on a window and looked inside. He saw a king sitting on a throne. The king was wearing a yellow crown and a yellow cloak. He looked very lonely and bored.
The yellow bird knocked on the glass and said, "Hello, king. Can I be your friend?"
The king heard the bird and looked up. He smiled and said, "Hello, yellow bird. You are very pretty and brave. Yes, you can be my friend. Come in and sit with me."
The yellow bird flew inside and perched on the king's shoulder. He sang a happy song and made the king laugh. The king said, "You are the best friend I ever had. You make me feel happy and warm. Will you stay with me?"
The yellow bird said, "Yes, king. I will stay with you. You are very kind and wise. We are both yellow and we both like to sing. We are a good match."
The king and the yellow bird became very close. They shared stories and secrets and jokes. They united their hearts and their voices. They made the castle a happier place. And they lived happily ever after.
