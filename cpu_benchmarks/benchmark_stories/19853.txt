Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the forest near her house. One day, she found a big log on the ground. It was very heavy, but she wanted to move it. She pushed and pulled until she finally moved the log to a new spot. 
Lily was very happy because she completed a big task all by herself. She sat down on the log to rest, but then she noticed something. The log was spoiled! It had bugs crawling all over it. Lily didn't want to sit on a spoiled log, so she decided to find a new place to rest. 
She looked around and saw a beautiful flower field. She ran over to it and sat down in the soft grass. The sun was shining and the flowers smelled so sweet. Lily was happy she completed her task and found a new place to rest.
