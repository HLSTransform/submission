Ben and Mia liked to play in the park. They had a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. They also had a lot of friends who came to play with them. But there was one boy who was not nice. His name was Tom. He was rude. He always pushed, shouted, and took toys from others.
One day, Ben and Mia were making a castle in the sandbox. They used a bucket, a shovel, and some sticks. They were very happy with their castle. They pretended it was a home for a dragon. They made a dragon out of sand and gave it a name. They called it Fluffy.
"Look at our dragon, Fluffy!" Ben said. "He is big and strong and friendly. He protects our castle from bad guys."
"Yes, he is the best dragon ever!" Mia said. "He likes to play with us and share his toys. He is not rude like Tom."
But Tom heard them. He did not like their dragon. He did not like their castle. He did not like anything. He was jealous and mean. He decided to ruin their fun. He ran to the sandbox and kicked their castle. He smashed their dragon. He laughed and said, "Your dragon is stupid and ugly. He is not real. He is just sand. I am the real dragon. I am big and strong and mean. I can destroy anything I want."
Ben and Mia were very sad and angry. They cried and shouted. They tried to stop Tom, but he was too fast and too strong. He pushed them away and kept kicking their sand. He did not care how they felt. He was rude.
But then, something happened. Something that Tom did not expect. Something that Ben and Mia did not expect. Something that made everyone stop and stare. A loud roar came from the sky. A big shadow covered the sun. A real dragon arrived. He was big and strong and friendly. He was Fluffy. He had seen what Tom did. He did not like it. He flew down to the sandbox and breathed fire at Tom. He did not hurt him, but he scared him. He said, "You are not a dragon. You are a bully. You are rude. You should not destroy other people's things. You should say sorry and be nice. Or else I will come back and teach you a lesson."
Tom was very afraid. He dropped his toys and ran away. He did not say sorry. He did not say anything. He just ran and ran and ran. He never bothered Ben and Mia again.
Ben and Mia were very happy. They hugged Fluffy and thanked him. They said, "You are our hero. You are our friend. You are the best dragon ever."
Fluffy smiled and said, "You are welcome. You are my friends too. You are the best kids ever. I like your castle and your toys. Can I play with you?"
Ben and Mia nodded and said, "Yes, of course. You can play with us anytime. We have a lot of fun things to do. We can slide, swing, and make more sand castles. We can also share our snacks and stories. We can have a lot of fun together."
Fluffy agreed and said, "That sounds great. Let's go and have fun then. But first, let me fix your castle and your dragon. I have a magic breath that can make anything out of sand."
He breathed on the sand and made a new castle and a new dragon. They were bigger and better than before. They looked like real ones. Ben and Mia were amazed and delighted. They clapped and cheered. They said, "Wow, you are amazing. You are magic. You are the best dragon ever."
Fluffy blushed and said, "Thank you. You are too kind. You are the best kids ever."
They all smiled and hugged. They went to play and have fun. They were happy. They were friends. They were not rude.
