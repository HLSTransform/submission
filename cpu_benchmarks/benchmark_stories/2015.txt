Nina and her mum went to the market. They walked around and looked at all the fruits, vegetables and sweets. Nina was so excited. 
Suddenly, she felt something slip out of her hand. She looked down and saw that she had lost her favourite toy. She started to cry.
Her mum could see that Nina was very upset. She quickly asked some of the people around the market if they had seen it. But no one had.
Nina's mum was becoming angry. She bought Nina some sweets and a balloon to cheer her up. 
They continued to look for Nina's toy. After some time they finally found it! Nina was so happy and hugged her mum tight.
