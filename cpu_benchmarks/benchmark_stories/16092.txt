One day, Timmy was outside playing with his scooter. It was a very lively day and the sun was shinning brightly.
But then it started to rain. Timmy was so upset as he saw the rain pouring down. He quickly raced to his house to stay dry.
When he got home, Timmy noticed that his scooter was soaked! He was so sad and angry at the same time. Timmy did not want his scooter to be ruined.
So, Timmy quickly grabbed a towel and dried off his scooter. He wiped it with the towel until it was dry and safe. Timmy was so glad that he had saved his scooter from getting too wet and ruined.
