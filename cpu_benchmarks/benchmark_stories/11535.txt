Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily wanted to have a picnic with her friends. She thought it would be great fun. So, she asked her friends to come and play with her.
On the day of the picnic, Lily and her friends went to the park. They had a great time. They ate yummy food and played fun games. They laughed and played all day long.
Then, Lily realized she had forgotten her favorite toy at home. She was sad. But her friends told her not to worry. They shared their toys with her. Lily felt happy again. They all had a great day at the picnic.
