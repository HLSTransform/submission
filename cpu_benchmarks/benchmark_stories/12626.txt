Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a messy room with clothes and toys all over the floor. One day, her mom came in and said, "Lily, your room is so messy! We need to clean it up."
Lily didn't want to clean her room because she hated cleaning. She said, "I don't want to clean. Can't we just watch TV instead?"
But her mom said, "No, we can't watch TV until we clean up this cable mess on the floor. It's not safe to have cables all over the place."
Lily sighed and started to pick up her toys. As she was cleaning, she found a lost toy that she had been looking for. She said, "Mom, I found my toy! I'm glad we cleaned up."
Her mom smiled and said, "See, it's not so bad to clean up. Now let's finish so we can watch TV together."
