Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a purple dress that she loved to wear all the time. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. While playing, Lily's friend Jack accidentally cut his finger. 
Lily saw Jack's finger bleeding and she got worried. She asked Jack if he was okay. Jack said, "It's just a little cut. Don't worry." Lily replied, "I know a joke that will make you feel better!" 
Jack smiled and said, "Tell me the joke!" Lily told him a silly joke and they both laughed. Jack's finger didn't hurt anymore and they continued to play together. From that day on, Lily and Jack were the best of friends and they always joked around together.
