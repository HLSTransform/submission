Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved picking berries. Every day she would go out and pick the juicy, sweet berries. One day while she was out picking, a fake berry caught her eye and she quickly scooped it up and put it in her basket.
When she arrived home with the fake berry, her mom saw it right away. She said to the little girl, "You know you can't eat fake berries. You must clean this basket before you can eat any more berries."
The little girl was upset as she did not want to spend time cleaning the basket. She wanted to eat her berries. She also wondered why the fake berry was so important.
But the mom was very adamant about her rule, so the little girl finally agreed to clean the basket. She slowly and carefully wiped each berry from the basket and when she was finished, she proudly showed her mom.
Mom smiled and said, "Good job my darling. Now you may enjoy your breakfast of juicy, sweet berries!"
The little girl smiled as she ate her berries and knew she had learned an important lesson: only pick and eat real berries.
