Once upon a time, there was a fearfuly little mouse. He loved peace and quiet, and he never wanted to draw attention to himself. One day, he heard a loud noise and he ran away. He found a hole in the wall and he marking it with coins so that he would be able to come back to this spot again.
At night, the mouse was sleeping inside his special spot and he heard some strange noises. He was so frightened, he thought the noise was coming from a huge scary monster. He quickly ran out of the hole he had marked and the noise stopped.
The next day, the mouse returned to the hole in the wall and he was embraced by its quietness. He realised that had marked the spot to keep his peace and quiet and that it was important to have a special place he could always go to feel safe and secure.
The mouse learned a valuable lesson that day - to choose a place of peace and respect it. We can all find a place of quiet and mark it with coins, or something that is important to us, so that we can always go back and enjoy the peacefulness.
