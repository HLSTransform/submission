Once there was a boy named Jack. He wanted to play, but his bedroom had no furniture! He wanted a bed to sleep in, a table to put things on, and a chair to sit on. He was so sad that he started to weep.
Suddenly, he heard a noise! Jack went to the door to see what it was. He was so surprised when he saw who was there. It was his grandma! She opened up a big box and inside it was all kinds of furniture. Jack was so happy that he forgot to weep.
He got to choose what he wanted and he chose a bed, a table and a chair. After everything was all set up, his grandma pulled something delicious out of her bag. It was some yummy cookies! Jack munched on the cookies and thanked his grandma. Now his bedroom was nice and cozy with all the furniture!
