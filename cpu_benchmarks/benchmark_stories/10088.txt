Lila and Tom were twins. They liked to play in the forest near their house. One day, they saw a big pine tree with many cones. They wanted to take some cones home.
"Let's choose some cones, Tom," Lila said. "They are pretty and smell good."
"OK, Lila," Tom said. "But we have to be careful. The pine tree is very tall and the cones are high up."
They looked for a stick to reach the cones. They found a long and thin stick. Lila held the stick and Tom helped her. They poked the stick at the cones.
But the stick was not strong enough. It broke in half. The broken part fell down and hit Tom on the head. Tom cried out loud. He felt a lot of pain.
"Tom, are you OK?" Lila asked. She dropped the stick and ran to Tom. She saw blood on his head. She was scared.
"Help, help!" she shouted. "Tom is hurt! We need help!"
But no one heard her. They were too far from their house. They were alone in the forest. The pine tree was not pretty and smell good anymore. It was big and scary. The cones were not fun to play with anymore. They were hard and dangerous.
Lila and Tom wished they had not chosen the pine tree. They wished they had played with something else. Something boring but safe.
