Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a special key that she kept safe in her pocket. One day, Lily went to a store to buy candy. She saw a toy that she wanted to play with, but the store owner was rude and wouldn't let her touch it. 
Lily felt sad and angry. She wanted to show the store owner how she felt, so she decided to display her key. She took it out of her pocket and waved it in the air. The store owner didn't like this and told Lily to leave. 
Lily went home feeling upset. She told her mom what happened and her mom explained that it's not okay to be rude to others, but it's also not okay to show off or be mean. Lily learned that it's important to be kind and respectful to others, even if they are not kind to us. 
The moral of the story is that being rude and showing off can lead to bad consequences. It's better to be kind and respectful to others, even if they don't treat us the way we want to be treated.
