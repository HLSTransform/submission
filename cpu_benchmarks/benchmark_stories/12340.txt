Once upon a time there was an ancient eye. The eye was so old no one knew where it came from.
Two children were playing in the garden when they saw the eye.
The first child said, "What is that?"
The second child replied, "I think it's an ancient eye."
The first child said, "Let's use it!"
The second child said, "How can we use it?"
The first child said, "Let's make a wish when we look into it."
The two children held hands and looked into the ancient eye. They closed their eyes and wished for something special.
Suddenly, they felt a warmth on their skin and they opened their eyes.
Their wish had come true! They were both so happy and amazed. They thanked the ancient eye and ran off to share their wish.
