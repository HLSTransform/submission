One day, a young boy wanted to go outside. He ran to the door, but it was shut. He was sad and didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, his mom came into the room. She was holding two cups of coffee. She gave one to the boy and said, "Let's sit together and talk."
The boy smiled and took the coffee. Then they both sat down and talked. He asked his mom why the door was shut.
"I had to shut the door," she said. "Your dad and I don't want you to go outside right now. You're still too young."
The boy nodded and decided to sit quietly and enjoy his coffee. It was nice to sit with his mom and talk. He was happy he didn't have to be outside.
