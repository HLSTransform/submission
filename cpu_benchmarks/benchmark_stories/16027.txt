Once there was a brave little girl named Ruby. She lived with her parents in a small house in the countryside. 
One day, after school, Ruby’s mum asked her to help make dinner. But Ruby refused and said she wanted to go and play outside instead.
Her mum was worried, so she asked her, “Are you sure that you are being brave? It’s getting dark outside.”
Ruby thought for a while and said, “Yes. I am brave. I can still play in the garden until it gets dark.”
So Ruby went outside and played until the sun had set. Her mum was proud that Ruby was brave enough to play alone in the dark.
