Once upon a time there was a rat. The rat was reliable and worked hard every day. One day, the rat had an idea. It believed that if it worked even harder it could make a surprise for its friends, so that's what it did.
The rat worked hard, day and night, and finally, it was finished. It had made a beautiful surprise cake! The rat was so excited to share it with its friends and could not wait to show them.
So the rat invited all its friends over to enjoy the surprise cake. When the ratâ€™s friends arrived, they were so excited and they all believed that the rat was really reliable and had done a great job! They cheered and thanked the rat for the delicious cake.
The rat felt so happy that its friends believed in it and had enjoyed the surprise cake. From then on the rat kept believing in itself and worked hard every day.
