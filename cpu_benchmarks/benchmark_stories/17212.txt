Once upon a time, a bunny was hopping in a field. The bunny saw a hole and wanted to explore it. The hole was open, so the bunny went inside. 
The bunny found a treasure in the hole! It was shiny and sparkly. The bunny was so happy that it started to jump and spring around the hole. 
But then, the bunny realized it was time to go back home. The bunny hopped out of the hole and went back to its burrow. The end.
