Sally and her mom were walking along the street one day. Sally really wanted a new toy but it was too expensive for her mom. Suddenly, Sally saw a toy in the window of a shop.
"Mommy, can I get it?" Sally asked.
Mommy shook her head. "I'm sorry, that toy is too expensive."
But then Sally spotted something even better. It was a toy that was only one year old and it was very cheap.
"Mommy, can I please get that one?" Sally begged.
Mommy nodded. "Yes, you can get it. That one is much cheaper."
So Sally and her mom went into the shop. Sally reached out and picked up the toy. She couldn't believe it! With a big smile, she turned around and showed it to Mommy. They both smiled as they paid for the toy and left the shop.
Sally hugged the toy all the way home. She was so excited to have her new toy!
