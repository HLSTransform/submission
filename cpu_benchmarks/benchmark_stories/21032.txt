Once upon a time, there were two best friends called Tom and Sarah. Tom and Sarah were both very excited to go play with their new toy.
They both ran to the toy shop and found it locked. They didn't know what to do because they didn't have the key. Tom shouted to Sarah, "Let's find the key". They both began to look for the key. 
Finally, Tom saw it. It was under a regular rock. He shouted for joy and took the key for the toy shop. They opened the door and found their new toy. 
After they had played with their new toy, they both learned an important lesson. Sarah said to Tom, "We both can have fun together, and we don't have to worry about keys if we do things the regular way!"
