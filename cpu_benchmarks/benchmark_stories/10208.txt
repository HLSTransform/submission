Once upon a time, there was a young duck named Ducky. Ducky loved to play in the water. One sunny day, Ducky went to the pond to soak in the cool water. Ducky splashed and splashed with his friends.
Ducky's friend, Froggy, said, "Ducky, let's play a game! We can swim to the left side of the pond and back." Ducky smiled and said, "Yes, let's do it!" So, Ducky and Froggy swam to the left side of the pond and back as fast as they could.
When they were done playing, Ducky and Froggy sat on a big rock to rest. They talked and laughed about their fun day. As the sun went down, they said goodbye to their friends and went home. Ducky and Froggy were happy to have each other as friends and couldn't wait to play in the pond again.
