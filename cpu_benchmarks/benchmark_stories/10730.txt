Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the garden with her mom to pick some tomatoes. Lily loved tomatoes, but she didn't like the ones that looked weird and ugly.
"Mommy, these tomatoes are disgusting!" she said, pointing at a misshapen tomato.
Her mom replied, "Well, Lily, sometimes things that look different can still be good. Maybe we can design a way to use this tomato in a yummy recipe."
Lily thought about it and agreed to give it a try. They took the tomato home and made a delicious tomato soup. Lily was surprised that the disgusting tomato actually tasted really good.
From that day on, Lily learned that sometimes things that look strange can still be useful and tasty. And she was proud that she helped design a new recipe using a tomato that she once thought was gross.
