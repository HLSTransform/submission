Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. Jack loved to play games with his friends at the park. They would run around and try to score points by throwing a ball into a basket. Jack was very good at this game and he always won.
One day, Jack and his friends found an ancient box buried in the ground. They wondered what was inside. Jack opened the box and found a mysterious object. He didn't know what it was, but he thought it was very cool.
Later that day, Jack started to feel sick. He didn't know why, but he felt very tired and weak. His mom took him to the hospital, but it was too late. Jack had touched a dangerous object and it had made him very sick. He couldn't play with his friends anymore and he was very sad. His friends wondered what had happened to him and they missed him very much.
