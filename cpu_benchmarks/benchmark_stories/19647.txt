Mark had a spicy food. He wanted it but he couldn't eat it. He kept looking at it and wanted it more and more. He asked his mom if he could have it, but she said no. Mark started to cry. He really wanted the spicy food. 
Then his mom had an idea. She drew a mark on the spicy food. She told Mark that if he wanted to have the spicy food he would have to find another mark just like it. Mark was so excited. He started running around the house, looking for a mark like the one his mom had made. He searched everywhere but he couldn't find another one. 
Finally, Mark gave up. He asked his mom if she could help him find the mark. His mom said yes and took him outside. She showed him another spicy food with the same mark. Mark was so happy. He was able to eat the spicy food he wanted!
