Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play with their toys. One day, they found a big box in the garage. It had many shiny things inside. They were happy and took some things out to play.
Lily found a necklace with a cross. She put it on and said, "Look, Ben, I have a pretty necklace. It is like Mommy's. She says it is for praying."
Ben found a wallet with some paper and coins. He said, "Look, Lily, I have money. It is like Daddy's. He says it is for buying things."
They played with their new things for a while. Then they heard Mommy and Daddy coming home. They quickly put the things back in the box and ran to their room.
Mommy and Daddy opened the garage and saw the box. They were angry and sad. The box had their old things that they wanted to sell. They needed money to fix their broken car.
They went to Lily and Ben's room and asked them, "Did you play with the things in the box?"
Lily and Ben nodded and said, "Yes, we did. We are sorry. We did not know they were yours. We thought they were toys."
Mommy and Daddy hugged them and said, "It's okay. We love you. But you should not take things that are not yours. They are not toys. They are important to us. The necklace is Mommy's. She got it from Grandma. It is for praying. The wallet is Daddy's. He got it from Grandpa. It is for money. We need money to fix our broken car. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben nodded and said, "Yes, we do. We are sorry. We will not do it again. Can we help you fix the car?"
Mommy and Daddy smiled and said, "Yes, you can. You can help us by being good and by praying. Praying is talking to God. He loves us and helps us. Do you want to pray with us?"
Lily and Ben nodded and said, "Yes, we do. We want to pray with you."
They all held hands and prayed. They thanked God for their family and their things. They asked God to help them fix their broken car. They said, "Amen."
