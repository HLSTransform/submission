Once upon a time, there was a big, wild jungle. In the jungle, there were many animals like lions, tigers, and monkeys. They all lived together and were very happy.
One day, a little human boy came to the jungle. He was scared and didn't know what to do. The animals saw him and wanted to help. They encouraged him to come closer and not be afraid.
The boy felt better and started to play with the animals. They all had so much fun together. From that day on, the boy visited the jungle often and the animals became his friends. They were happy to have a new friend and encouraged him to come back whenever he wanted.
