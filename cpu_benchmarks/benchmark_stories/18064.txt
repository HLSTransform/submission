Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toy trucks and cars. One day, Timmy's dad asked him to help load the groceries into the car. Timmy was happy to help.
As they were putting the groceries in the car, Timmy saw a weird looking flag on a nearby building. "Daddy, what's that weird flag?" Timmy asked. "That's the flag of our country," his dad replied.
Later that day, Timmy and his dad went to the park to play catch. Timmy threw the ball and it went over the fence. "I'll go get it," Timmy said. As he was climbing the fence, a man walked by and said, "That's a weird way to get a ball." Timmy laughed and said, "I like doing things my way!"
