Once upon a time, there was a soldier. He was strong and brave. Every morning, he would kneel outside his house and pray. It was boring, but he did it anyway. One day, a little girl saw him. She was only three years old.
She asked her mom why he was kneeling. Her mom explained that the soldier was praying. The little girl thought it was so special that a big brave soldier would pray. She wanted to pray too.
So, she went outside and knelt down next to him. She prayed for peace and happiness. The soldier smiled. He knew that praying was never boring when you do it with a friend.
