Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, but he didn't like to share them with his friends. One day, Timmy's friend came over to play. Timmy didn't want to share his toys, so his friend went home feeling sad.
That night, Timmy couldn't sleep. He felt guilty for not sharing his toys. The next day, Timmy went to his friend's house and said sorry. His friend forgave him and they played together happily.
Timmy learned that not sharing his toys could result in losing his friends. He promised to always share and never make his friends scream or feel sad again. The end.
