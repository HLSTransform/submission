Once upon a time there was a mighty aunt. She had the power to make things rot at a moments notice. Everywhere she went things she touched went bad. One day she went to the market and as usual, she made the apples and tomatoes rot in minutes. All of the customers were so angry about their wasted money. 
The aunt was very sad. She didn't understand why she had this power and why couldn't she just be like everyone else. But deep down, she knew she was special and had amazing powers. 
One day her niece, a sweet little 3 year old girl, came with her to the market. Remembering that little child, her aunt softened her heart. She touched the most rotten apples and suddenly they were as fresh as the morning dew. Everyone was amazed. 
The aunt smiled. She knew she could make things better despite her very special and mighty powers.
