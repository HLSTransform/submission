Once, there was a fireman who was walking in the park. He was happy. Then all of a sudden a little boy came running up to him and said, "I want to be just like you." The fireman smiled at the boy and said, "What can you do?" The boy said, "I can play pretend games, I can tease my friends, and I can be a fake fireman."
The fireman laughed and said, "That sounds like fun but let me show you something." He pulled out his firefighting tools and showed them to the boy. He said, "This is what I use to fight fires. Can you show me how you do pretend games?" The boy smiled and began to play a pretend game while the fireman watched.
He was so excited that he teased the fireman and said, "I'm the best fake fireman." The fireman looked pleased and replied, "You sure are!" Then he gave the boy a high five and said, "Good job!"
The little boy was happy and continued playing pretend games. He smiled at the fireman and said, "Thank you!" The fireman smiled back and said, "Any time."
