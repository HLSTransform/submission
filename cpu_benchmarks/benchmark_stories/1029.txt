Once upon a time there was a big house. Inside the house, there was a little boy. His name was Tim. One day, Tim wanted to go outside and take a walk. 
Tim took a step out the door. He could see an amazing sky. It was so clear! He stepped further outside, and he saw some trees. They were so tall. He stepped some more and he saw a pond. It sparkled in the sunlight.
Tim stepped closer to the pond. He spotted something on the ground. It looked like sauce! He heard a voice. It was coming from the pond. Tim stepped closer to hear it. 
The voice said, "You will be a happy boy. Just remember to stay clear of the sauce!" Tim smiled and thanked the voice. He stepped away from the pond, and went back inside the house. 
The end.
