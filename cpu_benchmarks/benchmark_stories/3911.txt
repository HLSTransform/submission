Once there was a mother and daughter. The daughter loved to explore the world. Everywhere she went she found interesting objects. Today, her mother wanted to encourage her to explore the nearby woods. 
The mother was a bit worried since she had never been this far before. She smiled at her daughter and said in a gentle voice, "Let's go explore the woods. I'm sure we'll see something lovely there."
They set off on their adventure and soon they started to see things they hadn't seen before. They could hear birds singing from the treetops and discover different kinds of rocks and leaves. Then, they came upon a pond.
In the pond, the daughter was delighted to see a frog. The mother chuckled as her daughter ran to get a closer look.
Together, they spent the time exploring and observing the different objects their eyes found. When the sun started to set, the daughter thanked her mother for encouraging her on this lovely adventure. The mother smiled, happy that her daughter had such a wonderful day.
