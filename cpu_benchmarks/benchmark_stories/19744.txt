Billy was playing outside with his friends. He saw something shiny in the grass and he wanted to see what it was. He pushed the grass away and he found the scissors. They were ordinary scissors but they were special to Billy. He could use them to cut paper and play with them. Everyone was very excited so he showed his friends the scissors. They all took turns pushing the scissors as they were fascinated with it. Billy and his friends had so much fun playing with the scissors! They laughed and ran around, pushing the scissors around the garden.  By the end of the day, the ordinary scissors were the best toy for all the children.
