Tom and Lisa were friends who liked to sing. They had a big toy microphone that they shared. They took turns to sing their favorite songs and pretended to be rich and famous.
One day, Tom had a new idea. He said to Lisa, "Let's go to the park and sing for the people. Maybe they will give us money and candy. Then we will be really rich!"
Lisa thought that was a fun idea. She agreed to go with Tom. They packed their toy microphone and some snacks in a bag and walked to the park.
At the park, they saw a lot of people. Some were playing, some were walking, some were sitting on benches. Tom and Lisa found a spot near a fountain and set up their toy microphone. They started to sing loudly and happily.
But not everyone liked their singing. Some people told them to be quiet. Some people laughed at them. Some people threw things at them. Tom and Lisa felt sad and scared. They wanted to stop singing and go home.
But then, a big man came up to them. He looked angry and mean. He grabbed their toy microphone and said, "This is mine now. You kids are making too much noise. Go away and don't come back!"
Tom and Lisa were shocked and scared. They tried to get their toy microphone back, but the man was too strong and fast. He ran away with their toy microphone and disappeared into the crowd.
Tom and Lisa cried and hugged each other. They had lost their toy microphone and their money and candy. They had no fun and no friends. They were not rich and famous. They were sad and poor. They wished they had never gone to the park. They wished they had stayed home and played with their toy microphone. They learned a hard lesson that day.
