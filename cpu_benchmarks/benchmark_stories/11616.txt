Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lou who wanted to go on an adventure. She asked her Mum if she could go outside and ride her bike. Her Mum said yes and Lou was so happy that she quickly put on her shoes and helmet, hopped on her bike and headed out of the house.
Lou rode around the corner and saw an old chamber. She had never seen it before, but it was big and looked very nice. She walked over to it, curious about what it might be.
Suddenly the chamber started to move and Lou realised it was actually a ride. She jumped on it and the ride started. Lou laughed and shouted as the ride went faster and higher.
When the ride finished, Lou felt so happy that her adventure had been so fine. She waved goodbye to the chamber, knowing that she had had a wonderful time.
