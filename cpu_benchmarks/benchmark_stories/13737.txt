Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars and trucks. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the park to play. 
While Timmy was playing with his toy truck, he saw a pale bird flying in the sky. "Look, Mommy! A bird!" Timmy said. 
Suddenly, Timmy saw a missile flying through the sky. "Mommy, what's that?" Timmy asked. 
"It's a missile, Timmy. It's very sharp and can hurt people," his mom explained. Timmy was scared and hugged his mom tightly. "Don't worry, Timmy. We're safe here," his mom said. 
After a few minutes, the missile disappeared and Timmy went back to playing with his truck. "I'm glad the missile didn't hit us," Timmy said. His mom smiled and said, "Me too, Timmy. Let's go get some ice cream."
