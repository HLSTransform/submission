Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Joe. Joe loved playing in the rain. Whenever it was cloudy, he would put on his raincoat and boots, and run outside and play.
One day, it was raining very hard. Joe wanted to take his boat out and soak in the rain. So, he clambered into his boat, grabbed the oars and sailed away. 
As he sailed, he heard a bell ringing. He kept going and soon he came across a small island with a bell tower. He hopped out of his boat and went to the bell tower. It was so big and shiny!
He looked around and saw a small bowl filled with something that smelled really tasty. He tasted it and it was so delicious! He soaked some of the food into his finger and licked it off. It was delicious! 
Joe was so happy he shouted, "This is the best taste ever!"
He stayed on the island until it stopped raining and then went home with a big smile on his face.
