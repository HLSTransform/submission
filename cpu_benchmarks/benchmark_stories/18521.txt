Mia loved to draw pictures of fairies. She used many colors and made them look happy and pretty. She wished she could see a real fairy someday. She always put her pictures under her pillow before she went to sleep.
One night, she heard a tiny voice near her ear. She opened her eyes and saw a fairy flying over her bed. The fairy had a big bag on her back and a smile on her face.
"Hello, Mia. I am Faye, the fairy of dreams. I deliver good dreams to children who are kind and creative. I saw your pictures and I liked them very much. Do you want to come with me and see the fairy world?"
Mia was so excited that she nodded yes. She got out of bed and held Faye's hand. Faye sprinkled some fairy dust on Mia and they flew out of the window.
The fairy world was amazing. There were flowers and stars and rainbows everywhere. Mia saw many other fairies who were friendly and playful. They showed her their magic and their games. Mia had so much fun that she forgot about the time.
But Faye did not forget. She knew that Mia had to go back to her home before the sun came up. The sun was harsh for fairies and could hurt them. She told Mia that they had to say goodbye.
"But I don't want to leave. I want to stay with you and the fairies. Please, Faye, can I?" Mia begged.
"I'm sorry, Mia. You can't. You belong to the human world. But don't be sad. I will come back and visit you every night. And you can always draw more pictures of fairies. They will make you happy and help you have good dreams."
Mia hugged Faye and thanked her for the wonderful adventure. She felt a little sad, but also happy. She flew back to her bed with Faye and fell asleep. She dreamed of fairies and colors and magic. She knew that Faye would deliver more good dreams to her. She was glad that she had a fairy friend.
