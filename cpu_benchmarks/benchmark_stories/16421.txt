Sara and Tom are twins. They like to play outside in the snow. They make a snowman and a snow fort. They throw snowballs at each other. They laugh and have fun.
But soon they feel cold and wet. They want to go inside and get warm. They run to the house and knock on the door. Mom opens the door and smiles.
"Come in, come in, you must be freezing!" Mom says. "I have a surprise for you in the kitchen."
Sara and Tom take off their boots and coats. They follow Mom to the kitchen. They smell something good. They see two big mugs on the table. They are filled with hot cocoa. The cocoa is thick and brown. It has marshmallows on top.
"Wow, cocoa!" Sara says. "Thank you, Mom!"
"Yes, thank you, Mom!" Tom says. "Can we have some now?"
"Of course, my loves. But be careful, it's very hot. Blow on it first." Mom says. She gives them a kiss and a hug.
Sara and Tom sit on the chairs and sip their cocoa. They feel warm and cozy. They smile and say, "Mmm, this is the best cocoa ever!"
