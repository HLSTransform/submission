Once upon a time there was a modern day room. It was very dark and the walls were made of black stones.
But, one day the walls started to glow. They lit up with a wonderful warm light.
It was so amazing, no one knew why it happened but it lit up the entire room. Everybody wanted to know how it worked!
The little girl suggested it might be a light that fit inside the walls. Sure enough, they found a tall, modern lightbulb and it fit perfectly in the dark hole.
Once they installed it, the room lit up even brighter than before. Everyone was so happy and celebrated the new light that fit perfectly. The End.
