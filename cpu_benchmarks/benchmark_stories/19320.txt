Once there was a small boy who was very stubborn and liked jazz a lot. He had a toy truck that he played with whenever he could. One day he was playing with his truck and he made it snap. He was very sad and tried and tried to fix it, but it wouldn't work. Then one day he was listening to some jazz and he had an idea. He grabbed his toy truck and snapped his fingers to the music and it started to work again. He was so happy, he couldn't believe it! He kept playing with his truck and listening to jazz, he was very happy. From that day on he was never too stubborn to try something new.
