Once upon a time, Farmer Joe had a big bucket full of food. He had to feed all of his animals, so every day he would go out to the barn. One day, Farmer Joe noticed that there was a troubled little bunny in the barn.
When Farmer Joe approached the bunny, it began to hop away. Farmer Joe knew that the bunny needed help and he had just the thing - food! He reached down, picked up his bucket, and started to feed the bunny.
The bunny was so excited that it began to nibble the food right out of Farmer Joe's hands. It ate and ate until it was full. The bunny was so happy and grateful, it hopped around Farmer Joe's feet joyfully.
Farmer Joe laughed and said to the bunny, “I’m glad I could help feed you.”
The bunny smiled up at Farmer Joe and said, “Thank you!”
