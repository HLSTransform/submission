Once there was a little girl. Her name was Bella. Bella was very happy. One day, Bella was playing outside with her friends and she saw a puppy. She wanted the puppy very badly. She asked her mom if she could have the puppy as a reward, but her mom said no. Bella was very upset and started to cry.
Bella's dad heard her crying and came to get her. He asked her why she was upset, and she told him she wanted the puppy. So Dad told her if she cleaned her room and did her chores, he would get her a puppy as a reward.
Bella was so excited, she ran off to clean. She worked so hard that soon her room was all clean, and she was so proud. When Dad saw what a good job she did, he told her he was getting her the puppy she wanted so much. 
Bella was so happy she jumped up and down and started to cry tears of joy. Her Dad hugged her and told her how proud he was of her. That was the best reward ever!
