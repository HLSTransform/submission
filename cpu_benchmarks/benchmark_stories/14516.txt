Once there was a tall boy. He loved to play with footballs. Every day he would reach down and grab one from his toy box. He ran around the garden, kicking it with his feet.
One day, he decided to see how far he could kick it. He reared back, gave the football a strong kick, and watched as it flew high and far across the garden. It soared over the hedges, and flew higher and higher until it was out of sight.
The boy ran as fast as he could, trying to reach the football. He wanted it back! But it was no use. He searched high and low, but the football was nowhere to be found.
The boy had to give up. He was sad, but he still loved to kick footballs in the garden. He knew that one day he would reach a football even higher than before!
