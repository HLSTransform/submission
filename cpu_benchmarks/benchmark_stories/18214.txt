One day, a little girl named Lucy went to the park. She saw a pretty flower. The flower was red and yellow. Lucy wanted to pick the flower, but she did not know how.
A friendly bird saw Lucy. The bird said, "Hi, Lucy! Do you need help?" Lucy said, "Yes, I want to pick the flower, but I can't." The bird said, "I can help you. Let's do it together."
Lucy and the bird worked together. They managed to pick the flower. Lucy was happy. She said, "Thank you, bird!" The bird said, "You're welcome, Lucy! It's a clear day, let's play!" So, Lucy and the bird played in the park all day.
