Once there was a little girl who was feeling very miserable. She had no one to play with and nothing to do.
So, the little girl decided to make a scarf. She took out some yarn and colored paper and got to work. She made the yarn into lots of loops and cut out some leaves and flowers from the paper. She put the leaves and flowers on the yarn and the yarn on the scarf.
When she was done, the little girl tried on the scarf. It looked so pretty around her neck! Wearing the scarf made her much less miserable, she no longer felt alone. 
From then on, whenever the little girl felt down, she would make a new scarf. Being creative always made her feel better and wearing her creations made her so proud. She was never miserable again.
