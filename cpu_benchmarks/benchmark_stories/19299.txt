Once there was a little fish who lived under the sea. He had bright blue scales and a sharp fin. The little fish was very proud of his home, the coral reef. He would explore all around it, looking for food and finding fun places to play. 
One day, he discovered an old broken shell on the reef. He decided to make it into something special, so he swam to find a sharp rock. He used the rock to make a hole in the shell and then hung it from a tall rock. 
Now, every morning the little fish would swim to the shell, admiring it and feeling so proud. He turned the old broken shell into something beautiful and it reminded him how special his reef was. 
The little fish had made his reef even more special with his clever idea. He was very proud of himself and it made him smile every day.
