One day, a little girl named Lucy went to the park. She wore her favorite shirt with a big, happy sun on it. Lucy loved to play with her friends and show them her shirt. She was always polite and kind when she played.
At the park, Lucy saw a boy named Tim. Tim was sad because his shirt was dirty. He had fallen in the mud and now his shirt was all brown. Lucy wanted to help Tim, so she thought of a plan.
Lucy took Tim to her house and showed him her special box of shirts. She let him pick a shirt to wear. Tim picked a shirt with a big, happy sun just like Lucy's. They both wore the same shirt and went back to the park. Tim was very happy and said "thank you" to Lucy. They played together and had lots of fun.
The other kids at the park saw Lucy and Tim being polite and sharing. They all wanted to be kind and share too. Soon, everyone was playing nicely and sharing their toys.
The moral of the story is to always be polite and share with others. When you are kind, it makes everyone happy and helps make new friends.
