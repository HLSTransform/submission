Mira and Sam are twins. They like to play together. They have many toys, but their favorite is a big map of the world. They pretend to travel to different places and learn new things.
One day, they are playing with the map when they see a picture of a panda. They think it is a funny bear with black and white fur.
"Look, Sam, a panda!" Mira says.
"Wow, it is so cute! Where does it live?" Sam asks.
Mira points to a green spot on the map. "It lives here, in China. It eats bamboo and sleeps a lot."
Sam nods. "I want to see a panda. Can we go to China?"
Mira shakes her head. "No, we can't. China is very far away. We need a plane to go there. And we need money and passports and tickets."
Sam frowns. "That is too hard. Why can't we see a panda?"
Mira hugs him. "Don't be sad, Sam. We can see a panda in a book or on TV. And we can imagine we are there. Maybe one day we can go to China for real."
Sam smiles. "You are right, Mira. We can still have fun with the map. And we can learn about other animals and places. The world is big and amazing. There are so many things to see and do."
Mira agrees. "Yes, the world is wonderful. And we are lucky. We have each other and we have our map. We are unique and special. We can explore the world in our own way."
