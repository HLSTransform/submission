Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play in the living room. They had many toys, but their favorite thing was to climb on the fireplace. The fireplace was big and gray, and had a nice shelf on top. Sometimes, they pretended to be cats or monkeys, and jumped from the shelf to the couch.
One day, their mom told them not to climb on the fireplace anymore. She said it was dangerous, and they could fall and hurt themselves. She also said that sometimes, there was fire in the fireplace, and they could burn themselves. Tom and Lily did not like this. They wanted to climb on the fireplace. They thought it was fun and not scary.
When their mom went to the kitchen, they decided to climb on the fireplace again. They did not listen to their mom. They thought they were smart and fast, and nothing bad would happen. They climbed on the shelf, and looked for something to play with. They saw a shiny metal thing, and a long black thing. They did not know what they were, but they looked interesting.
Tom reached for the shiny metal thing, and pulled it. It made a loud noise, and sparks flew out of the fireplace. Tom was scared, and dropped the metal thing. It was a poker, and it hit the long black thing. The long black thing was a hose, and it had gas in it. The gas came out of the hose, and caught fire. The fire spread quickly, and made a lot of smoke and heat.
Lily saw the fire, and screamed. She jumped off the shelf, and ran to the kitchen. She told their mom what happened. Their mom was angry and worried. She grabbed a fire extinguisher, and ran to the living room. She saw Tom, who was still on the shelf, and scared and crying. She sprayed the fire extinguisher, and put out the fire. She took Tom off the shelf, and hugged him. She checked if he was hurt, and he was not. She was relieved, but also very mad.
She scolded Tom and Lily, and told them they were very naughty and foolish. She told them they could have died, or burned the house down. She told them they had to listen to her, and never climb on the fireplace again. She told them they had to say sorry, and go to their room. Tom and Lily said sorry, and went to their room. They felt bad, and ashamed. They learned their lesson, and never climbed on the fireplace again.
