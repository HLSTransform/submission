Anna was a naughty girl. She did not like to sleep at night. She wanted to play with her toys and read her books. She did not want to listen to her mom and dad.
One night, Anna had a plan. She waited until her mom and dad said good night and turned off the light. Then she got out of her bed and tiptoed to the living room. She saw a lamp on the table. She wanted to turn it on and see what it looked like.
She reached for the lamp and pulled the cord. But the lamp was too heavy for her. It fell off the table and broke with a loud crash. Anna was scared. She started to cry.
Her mom and dad heard the noise and ran to the living room. They saw Anna and the broken lamp. They were angry and sad.
"Anna, what did you do?" her mom asked.
"I wanted to see the lamp," Anna sobbed.
"Anna, you were very naughty. You should not touch things that are not yours. You could have hurt yourself or started a fire. You need to go back to your bed and say sorry," her dad said.
Anna felt bad. She knew she did something wrong. She said sorry to her mom and dad and hugged them. They took her back to her bed and tucked her in. They gave her a kiss and said they loved her.
Anna learned her lesson. She did not want to be naughty anymore. She wanted to be a good girl and sleep at night. She closed her eyes and dreamed of a nice lamp.
