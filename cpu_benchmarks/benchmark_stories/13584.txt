Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to school and playing with her friends. One day, Lily's friend Emma came to school with a new toy. Lily was jealous and wanted the toy too. Emma saw that Lily was sad and decided to offer to share her toy with her.
Later that day, Lily's teacher talked to the class about sharing and being kind to others. Lily remembered how Emma offered to share her toy and felt happy. The next day, Lily brought her favorite doll to school and offered to share it with Emma. Emma was happy and they played together all day.
The moral of the story is that sharing is important and can make others happy. Sometimes, when we offer to share, we can make new friends and have more fun.
