Lily and Tom were playing in the living room. They liked to pretend they were in a big castle. Lily was the princess and Tom was the knight. They had a lot of toys to play with.
Lily saw a white shelf on the wall. It had some books and a vase on it. She wanted to see what was in the books. She said to Tom, "Can you help me get a book?"
Tom nodded. He was a strong knight. He climbed on the sofa and reached for the shelf. He tried to pull a book out. But he pulled too hard. The book came out, but so did the vase. It fell down and broke on the floor.
Lily and Tom heard a loud noise. They were scared. They knew they had done something bad. They looked at the broken vase. It was white and blue and had flowers on it. It was Mom's favorite vase.
Mom heard the noise too. She came into the living room. She saw the mess on the floor. She saw Lily and Tom hiding behind the sofa. She was angry. She said, "What happened here? Who broke my vase?"
Lily and Tom felt sorry. They came out from behind the sofa. They said, "We did, Mom. We are sorry. We wanted to get a book. But we pulled too hard. And the vase fell down. And it broke. We are very sorry."
Mom looked at them. She saw their sad faces. She was still angry, but she was also kind. She said, "I'm glad you told me the truth. But you should not pull things from the shelf. You could get hurt. And you should not touch my vase. It was very special to me. You need to be more careful. And you need to say sorry to Dad too. He gave me the vase for our anniversary."
Lily and Tom nodded. They said, "We are sorry, Mom. We are sorry, Dad. We will be more careful. We will not pull things from the shelf. We will not touch your vase. We love you."
Mom hugged them. She said, "I love you too. But you still have to clean up the mess. And you have to go to your room for a time out. No more playing in the living room today."
Lily and Tom said, "OK, Mom." They helped Mom clean up the mess. Then they went to their room. They learned their lesson. They did not pull things from the shelf again.
