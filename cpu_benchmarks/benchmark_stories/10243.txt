Once upon a time, there was a huge bus. It was so big that it could fit many people inside. One day, a little girl named Lily wanted to ride the bus to go see her grandma. She asked her mom if they could take the bus.
"Mommy, can we ride the big bus to grandma's house?" Lily asked.
"Yes, we can," her mom replied. "I will support you as we get on the bus."
Lily was happy that her mom would help her. They got on the bus and found a seat. Lily looked out the window and saw all the other huge buses driving by. She knew that her mom would always be there to support her, no matter what.
