John was excited for his safari. He was going to go with his mom and catch some animals. They started out in the morning and drove for hours on the bumpy road. When they finally arrived, John felt fit and ready. He was so happy that he jumped out of the car. 
John started running around and looking for animals. He was so excited that he was running faster and faster. He was enjoying himself and catching so many animals. He even caught a zebra! 
John wanted to keep running, but his mom stopped him. She said it was time to go home. John was sad but he got in the car. As they were driving away, a lion ran towards them! All of a sudden, the lion jumped on the car and it crashed. John and his mom were so scared. 
John had a bad ending to his safari. He was so sad but he was glad his mom was fit and safe. Hopefully he will be able to catch animals on his next safari!
