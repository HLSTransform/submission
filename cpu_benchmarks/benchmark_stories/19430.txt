Once upon a time, there was a kind man. He wanted to help everyone in his town, so every day he would teach them something new. 
One day he came up with a great plan. He wanted to teach a group of kids about helping each other and staying away from trouble. 
He gathered the kids in a circle and started talking. He explained how it is important to be nice and kind to each other. He also talked about how to stay away from trouble, like fighting and stealing. 
The kids all started to understand and they were so impressed by the kind man's story. They told him thank you and promised to always be kind to each other and stay away from trouble. 
The kind man smiled. He was so proud that he was able to teach these kids something so valuable and he knew they would use it to stay away from trouble in their lives.
