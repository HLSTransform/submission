Tommy loves his orange jacket. It is warm and soft and has a big zipper. He wears it every day when he goes outside to play. He likes to run and jump and climb with his jacket on.
One day, Tommy goes to the park with his mom and dad. He sees a big slide and runs to it. He slides down fast and laughs. He wants to slide again and again. He forgets about his jacket and leaves it on the bench.
After a while, Tommy feels cold. He looks for his jacket, but he cannot find it. He feels sad and scared. He runs to his mom and dad and cries. "Where is my jacket? I want my jacket!"
His mom and dad hug him and calm him down. They ask him where he left his jacket. Tommy tries to remember. He thinks hard. He remembers the slide and the bench. He points to them and says, "There! There is my jacket!"
His mom and dad smile and take him to the bench. They see his orange jacket on the bench. They pick it up and give it to Tommy. Tommy is happy and relieved. He puts on his jacket and zips it up. He hugs his mom and dad and says, "Thank you! I love my jacket!"
The end.
