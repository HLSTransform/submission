Once there was a little boy named Bobby. Bobby was three years old and liked to play outside. One day Bobby was visiting his grandpa and grandpa had a surprise for him. He gave Bobby a brand new pair of boots. They were orange and felt very comfortable on Bobby's feet.
Bobby was so excited to play in his new boots that he ran outside to the garden. He ran around and around in them and when he was tired he stopped for a snack. Grandpa had a special treat for him. He gave Bobby some tasty strawberries from the garden. Bobby was so happy and enjoyed the sweet taste.
After his snack Bobby continued playing and later on went back inside. He thanked his grandpa for giving him the boots and the yummy snack. Bobby was very content knowing he had such a wonderful grandpa.
