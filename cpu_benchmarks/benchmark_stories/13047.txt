Once upon a time, there was an independent hedge. It was tall and proud, and it blocked the way. But the hedge was tired of being there. It wanted to be free. So one day it asked a helpful bird to help release it from the ground. The bird flew over to the hedge and sang a sweet song. The hedge was filled with joy as it felt the earth beneath it start to move. Slowly but surely it was released from the ground. The hedge was so happy. It ran off, free at last. It thanked the bird for helping it find its independence. And from that day forth, the hedge was always free.
