Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to jump and play in the meadow. One day, he saw a sign that said "Do not jump on the rocks". Benny thought it was a stupid sign because he loved to jump on the rocks.
Benny's friend, a wise old owl, saw him and said "Benny, that sign is important. If you jump on the rocks, you could get hurt." Benny didn't want to get hurt, so he listened to his friend and didn't jump on the rocks.
The moral of the story is that sometimes we may not understand why there are rules or signs, but they are there to keep us safe. It's important to listen to those who are wiser and have more experience than us.
