Once upon a time, there was a bunny. He was a very funny bunny! He liked to hop around the garden, looking for carrots and playing with the other animals.
One day, he hopped all the way to the river. The river was so big and blue that it made the bunny stop and stare. He was about to hop down to the water's edge to have a drink, when he spotted something else. In the river was a pot of ink. It was cold, just like the river.
The bunny hopped closer to take a look, and noticed that the ink was a very special shade of blue. He thought it must be special ink, and he wanted it for himself.
So he hopped closer still, and tried to reach in and grab it. But it was too slippery and cold, and he could not catch it. But with five hops, he splashed the ink pot, spilling it on the ground. The ink spread out, turning the bunny's fur a beautiful blue.
And ever since, the bunny has always hopped around with a blue tinge - a reminder of that special ink.
