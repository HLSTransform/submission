Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and make things with his hands. One day, he found some coal in his backyard. He picked it up and showed it to his mom.
"Look, Mommy! I found coal!" Timmy exclaimed.
His mom smiled and said, "That's very creative, Timmy. What are you going to do with it?"
Timmy thought for a moment and said, "I want to cover my toy car with it and make it look like a real race car!"
His mom helped him cover the toy car with the coal and they both admired Timmy's creative idea. Timmy was so happy with his new race car and he played with it all day long. From that day on, Timmy loved to use his imagination and make new things with his hands.
