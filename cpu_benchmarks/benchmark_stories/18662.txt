Once upon a time, there were two friends named Timmy and Tommy. They loved to play together every day. One day, Timmy brought some chocolate to share with Tommy. They ate the chocolate and it was yummy. 
But then, they started to fight over who had more chocolate. Timmy said Tommy had more and Tommy said Timmy had more. They started to push and hit each other. 
Their mom came in and saw them fighting. She said, "Stop it! Fighting is not nice. You are friends." Timmy and Tommy felt stupid for fighting over chocolate. They said sorry to each other and hugged. From that day on, they shared their chocolate and never fought again.
