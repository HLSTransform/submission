Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a little girl named Mia. She had a dog named Spot. Mia and Spot were best friends. They loved to play together all day.
One day, Mia's mom was making dinner. Mia and Spot were very hungry and impatient. They wanted to eat right away. But Mia's mom said they needed to wait a little longer. So Mia and Spot went outside to play.
While they were playing, Mia saw her friend Tom. Tom had a big, red ball. Mia asked if she could borrow the ball to play with Spot. Tom said yes, and Mia and Spot played with the ball until dinner was ready. When they heard Mia's mom call, they went inside to eat their yummy dinner.
