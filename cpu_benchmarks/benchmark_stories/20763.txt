Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mina. She was three years old and loved to play tag with her friends. One day Mina wanted to show one of her friends, who she called Jimmy, something new. She ran to the closet and came back with a folder. Inside was a picture of Mina's mommy and whom she said was her daddy. 
Mina said to Jimmy, "See! They are gonna marry!"
But Jimmy was confused. He asked, "What does marry mean?"
Mina explained, "When two people love each other very much, they get married and share their love forever."
Jimmy was so happy for Mina, but looking at the picture made him feel a little hurt. He wished his own parents could be together and share the same kind of love. 
Mina saw Jimmy's hurt expression and smiled at her friend, then said, "Don't worry Jimmy, maybe you will get married one day too!"
