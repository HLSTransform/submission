Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She lived in a small house with her mom, dad, and dog. One day, Lily wanted to pick apples from a tree. She said, "I need a basket to hold the apples."
Her dad gave her a big basket. Lily and her dog went to the apple tree. They saw a lot of apples. Lily picked the apples and put them in the basket. Her dog helped her too.
When they had a full basket, they went back to the house. Lily's mom looked at the apples and said, "Some of these apples are bitter. We should taste them first." They tasted the apples and found the sweet ones. They were happy and ate the sweet apples together.
