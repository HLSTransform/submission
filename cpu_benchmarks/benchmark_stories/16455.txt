Ben and Lily are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a big orange toy car in the park. It is shiny and fast. They both want to play with it.
"Let me have it!" Ben says. He tries to grab the toy car from Lily.
"No, it is mine!" Lily says. She holds the toy car tight.
They fight over the toy car. They pull and push and shout. They are not nice to each other.
A man sees them fighting. He is the owner of the toy car. He is angry.
"Hey, stop that!" he says. "That is my toy car. You are breaking it. Give it back to me!"
Ben and Lily are scared. They let go of the toy car. They say sorry to the man.
The man takes his toy car and leaves. Ben and Lily look at each other. They feel bad.
"Sorry, Ben. I was mean to you," Lily says.
"Sorry, Lily. I was mean to you, too," Ben says.
They hug and make up. They decide to share their own toys. They are friends again. They are happy.
