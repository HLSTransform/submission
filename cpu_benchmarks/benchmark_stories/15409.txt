Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Jake. Jake had a lot of things that he liked to do and they included playing with his toys and drawing with crayons. One day, he went to visit his Grandma's house and she had a big surprise for him.
She had a new mug for him! It was blue and had a picture of a fish on it. Jake was very excited about his new mug and he wanted to give it a big hug.
Grandma said that first he had to make sure that it was clean and dry. So she took him outside and put the mug under the tap. She sprinkled some water on it until it was wet.
Then Jake dried it with a cloth, and was now ready to give it his hug. He put his arms around the mug and gave it a big squeeze. Grandma smiled and said that was really nice.
Jake was very happy with his new mug and he promised to always keep it safe and dry. He thanked his Grandma and went off to play. 
The end.
