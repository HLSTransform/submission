Once upon a time, there was a prince. The prince loved to play outside. One day, he saw a big ice block. He was very excited to see what was inside.
The sun was shining, and the ice began to melt. The prince could see something inside the ice. He was a little frightened, but he wanted to know what it was. Slowly, the ice melted more and more.
When the ice was all gone, the prince found a toy horse inside. He was so happy! He played with the toy horse all day long. The prince was not frightened anymore.
