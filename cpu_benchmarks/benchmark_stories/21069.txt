Tom and Anna liked to play hide and seek in the house. They took turns to count and look for each other. One day, Tom decided to hide in the cabinet in the kitchen. He opened the door and crawled inside. He closed the door and waited for Anna to find him.
Anna counted to ten and shouted, "Ready or not, here I come!" She looked in the living room, the bedroom, and the bathroom, but she could not find Tom. She wondered where he was hiding. She went to the kitchen and saw the cabinet. She thought, maybe Tom is in there.
She opened the cabinet door and saw Tom. He smiled and said, "You found me!" Anna said, "Yes, I did. But why did you hide in there? It is dark and scary." Tom said, "No, it is not. It is safe and cozy. There are pots and pans and plates and cups. They keep me company." Anna said, "But they are not alive. They cannot talk to you or play with you. And what if Mom or Dad need something from the cabinet? They will be surprised to see you in there."
Tom said, "I don't care. I like it here. It is my secret place. You can join me if you want." Anna said, "No, thank you. I don't like it here. It is too small and stuffy. I prefer to play outside or in the toy room. There are more things to do and see. And I don't want to leave Mom and Dad alone. They might worry about us." Tom said, "Fine. Then you can leave. I will stay here." Anna said, "OK. But don't stay too long. It is not good for you. And don't forget to come out when Mom or Dad call us for lunch." She closed the cabinet door and left.
Tom stayed in the cabinet for a while. He pretended that the pots and pans and plates and cups were his friends. He made up stories and songs with them. He had fun. But after some time, he started to feel bored and lonely. He missed Anna and Mom and Dad. He wondered what they were doing. He wanted to play with them. He realized that the cabinet was not so safe and cozy after all. It was just a cabinet. He opened the door and came out. He looked for Anna and Mom and Dad. He found them in the living room. They were happy to see him. They hugged him and asked him where he was. He told them about his hiding place. They laughed and said, "That was a clever idea. But we are glad you came out. We love you and we want you to be with us." Tom said, "I love you too. And I want to be with you too. The cabinet is not my secret place anymore. It is just a cabinet." They smiled and said, "That's right. It is just a cabinet. And you are our precious son." They played and talked and had lunch together. Tom felt happy and warm. He knew he was safe and cozy with his family.
