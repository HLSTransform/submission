Lily and Sam liked to play in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They gave him a carrot nose and two rocks for eyes. They named him Bob.
One day, it was very sunny and warm. Lily and Sam saw that Bob was melting. His hat was falling off and his nose was drooping. They were very worry. They did not want to lose their friend.
They ran to the house and asked their mom for help. Mom gave them a big bowl of ice. She said they could put some ice on Bob to keep him cold. Lily and Sam thanked their mom and ran back to the snowman.
They put some ice on Bob's head, nose and body. They fixed his hat and scarf. They hoped he would be okay. They told him they loved him and gave him a hug.
Bob looked at them with his rock eyes. He smiled with his carrot mouth. He was very happy. He had the perfect friends.
