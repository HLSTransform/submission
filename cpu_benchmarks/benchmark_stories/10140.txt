Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to a big park with her mom and dad. They found a maze in the park. Lily was excited and wanted to go inside. 
Inside the maze, Lily and her parents got lost. They walked and walked but couldn't find the way out. Suddenly, Lily's dad slipped on a sour lemon and fell down. Lily laughed and said, "Daddy, you look funny!" 
Her dad laughed too and said, "Let's find the way out of this maze before we get more sour lemons!" Finally, they found the way out and went home happy.
