Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved music and wanted to start a band with her friends. One day, she asked her friend Timmy if he wanted to be in her band. Timmy said yes and they were very happy.
Lily said, "We need more friends to complete our band. Who else can we ask?" 
Timmy said, "My sister is good at singing. Let's ask her!" 
They asked Timmy's sister and she said yes. They practiced their music every day. Lily played the drums, Timmy played guitar, and Timmy's sister sang. 
One day, they had a big concert. Lily was nervous because her drums were delicate and she didn't want them to break. But the concert went well and everyone loved their music. They were a complete band and had so much fun playing together.
