Once upon a time there was a bright little girl named Jane. She had an exam to do and she was excited to finish it. Jane opened her notebook and started to mark her answers on the page. She made sure to mark her answers very carefully. When she finished, she looked at her marks and was very happy to see that she had done well. So she jumped with joy and ran out to show her family her marks!
