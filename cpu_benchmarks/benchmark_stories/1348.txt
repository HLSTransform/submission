Once upon a time there was a little girl who really wanted a present. She asked her mom and dad, but they said sorry - they didn't have any presents to give her. The little girl was very sad.
Suddenly, outside her window she saw something amazing! A beautiful flower was blooming. It was so big and colorful. The little girl smiled and felt better.
She turned to her parents and said, "Look! A present just for me!" She opened the window and picked the flower for a present. She gave it to her mom and dad and said "I love you".
Her mom and dad were very happy and gave her a big hug. From then on, the little girl always remembered that sometimes presents can bloom right in front of you - even when you're feeling sorry.
