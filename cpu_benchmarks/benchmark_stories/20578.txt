Once upon a time there was a jolly old man. He had a soft voice and he liked to sing. Every morning he would walk around the village spreading joy with his singing.
One day, he was given a big box. It was full of dirt! He grabbed a little shovel and started to dig a hole. He buried the box deep in the ground and then he filled it back up with the dirt.
As he patted down the soil, he heard a voice. He looked up and saw a tiny bird fly away. It was the happiest little bird he had ever seen!
The old man smiled and waved goodbye. He knew that the bird had thanked him for burying the box in the ground. From then on, he always sang with an extra jolly voice.
