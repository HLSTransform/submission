Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Timmy. He loved to read books and would spend hours flipping through the pages. One day, he found a special book that had a surprise at the end.
As Timmy read the book, he noticed that the characters were always kind to each other. They helped each other and shared their things. Timmy thought this was a good lesson to learn.
Finally, Timmy reached the end of the book and found the surprise. It was a picture of all the characters holding hands and smiling. Timmy felt happy and decided that he would always try to be kind like the characters in the book.
From that day on, Timmy made sure to be kind to his friends and family. He learned that being kind can make others happy and that makes him happy too.
