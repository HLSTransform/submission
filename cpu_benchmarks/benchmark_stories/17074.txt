One day, a big dog and a little cat lived in a house. They did not like to play together. The big dog liked to play with his ball. The little cat liked to play with her toy mouse. They did not want to unite and be friends.
One morning, their mom made a cup of coffee. The big dog and the little cat saw the coffee. They thought it was interesting. They both wanted to smell it. They both went to the cup at the same time.
When they got to the cup, the big dog and the little cat looked at each other. They both wanted to smell the interesting coffee, but they did not want to fight. So, they decided to unite and be friends. They smelled the coffee together and played all day. The big dog and the little cat were happy.
