Once there was a young bull. He was alone in the field but he didn't mind. He just liked to lean against the big tree. From there he could look out and see the whole world.
One day, two kids came to the field. They were only three years old, just like the bull! One of the kids looked at the young bull and asked the other, "What is that?". The other kid said, "It's a bull, and it's leaning against that big tree".
The three kids were so excited! They came closer and closer to the young bull and he didn't move away. The kids patted and hugged the young bull. He was so happy! The kids stayed there for a long time, laughing and playing with the young bull. 
When it became dark, the kids said goodbye to the young bull. He waved at them and went back to leaning against the big tree. He was happy and contented.
