Once there were two people named Jack and Jane. They both had been walking all day long when they arrived to a meadow full of delicious, juicy apples. 
The two were so excited to eat the apples that they quickly split them between them. They shared the apples with great delight and ate every last bit of them.
When all the apples were gone, both Jack and Jane felt very content. They thought the apples were the most delicious thing they had ever tasted. 
They went off happily and continued their journey, forever remembering the delicious apples they had split.
