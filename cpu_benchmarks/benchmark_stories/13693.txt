Once upon a time, there was a poor little girl named Lily. She lived in a small house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily found a shiny piece of candy on the ground. She was so happy and showed it to her mommy.
"Look mommy, I found a candy!" Lily said.
Her mommy looked at the candy and smiled. "That's great, Lily. You can have it as a treat."
Lily was so happy and ate the candy with joy. From that day on, she would always look for more pieces of candy on the ground whenever she went outside to play.
