Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy who had a little baby. The baby was very small and could not talk yet. One day, mommy and daddy started to quarrel about who would take care of the infant. The baby was scared and started to cry.
Suddenly, the baby stopped crying and looked very still. The mommy and daddy realized that the infant was not moving anymore. They were very sad because the baby was dead. They hugged each other and cried.
After a while, mommy and daddy talked to each other and said sorry for quarreling. They knew that they needed to work together to take care of the baby. They promised to always love and take care of each other and the new baby they would have one day.
