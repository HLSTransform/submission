Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He loved to play outside. One day, Tim saw a dirty map on the ground. He picked it up and saw a big "X" on it. He thought it was a treasure map!
Tim showed the map to his friend, Anna. "Look, a treasure map!" Tim said. Anna was excited too. They decided to follow the map together. They took big steps and little steps, just like the map said.
After some time, they found the big "X" on the ground. Tim and Anna dug and dug until they found a box. Inside the box, there was treasure! It was full of shiny gold coins. They were so happy and shared the treasure with their friends.
