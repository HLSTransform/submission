Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy's mom said it was time to go to the store. Timmy didn't want to go, but he had to.
At the store, Timmy saw a toy he really wanted. He asked his mom to buy it for him, but she said no. Timmy got mad and started to cry. His mom took him to the toilet to calm down.
When they got to the toilet, Timmy saw something disgusting in it. He didn't want to go near it, but his mom said it was okay. Timmy clapped his hands and said he was brave. His mom was proud of him for being so brave.
In the end, Timmy didn't get the toy he wanted, but he learned that being brave is more important than getting a toy. And he also learned that sometimes toilets can be disgusting, but it's okay to be brave and face your fears.
