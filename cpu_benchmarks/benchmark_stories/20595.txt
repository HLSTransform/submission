Once upon a time, there was a popular stadium. Every day, lots of people came to watch the games. After the games were over, the people would go home and take a nap. 
One day, a little girl named Ella came to the stadium. She had never been there before and was amazed by how big it was. She asked her dad if she could take a nap in the stadium and he said yes. 
So Ella lay down on the grass and closed her eyes. She was so tired from watching the games that before she knew it, she was asleep. The sun was setting, the birds were singing and Ella took the best nap ever. 
When Ella woke up, she was surprised to find that everyone had gone home and it was very quiet. She stood up, stretched and smiled. Ella had such an amazing nap in the popular stadium!
