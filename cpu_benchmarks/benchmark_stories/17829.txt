Once upon a time there was a smart bird. He was always on the lookout for something tasty to eat. One day he saw a case that was filled with treats! He was so excited. He flew over and bit the case, trying to open it. He kept biting and biting, but the case wouldn't open. Suddenly, his beak got stuck! He was so scared and couldn't get free. 
Then a smart dog came along. He saw the bird and wanted to help. He used his sharp teeth and started to bite the case. The case opened and the bird flew away with a relieved heart. The dog was happy he had helped the bird, gave him a big smile and they both went on their merry way.
