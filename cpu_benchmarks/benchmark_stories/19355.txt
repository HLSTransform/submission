Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Bob. He was just three years old and had a cheeky grin. Bob's mom was always very kind and gentle with him, but one day she wanted to ask him something tricky. She wanted him to accept a task that was quite difficult.
Bob thought it over and over again. He was scared to say 'yes' and he was scared to say 'no'. But his mom kept smiling and talking to him nicely, so he decided to accept the task.
The task was to keep his mouth shut - that is, not talk - whenever his mom asked him too. It was a difficult thing to do, as Bob was always chatting away. But he promised his mom that he could do it, so he accepted the challenge. 
From then on, whenever his mom wanted some quiet, she would ask Bob to keep his mouth shut, and he would nod and obey. His mom was so happy that he would try his best to do something quite difficult, and she rewarded him with a big hug and a kiss. 
Bob had shown his mom that even though he was only a little boy, he could understand and accept things that weren't always easy.
