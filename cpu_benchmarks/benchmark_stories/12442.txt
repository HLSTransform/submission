Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to smell the roses and look for bugs. Lily saw a big rose with many petals. She wanted to pick it and give it to her mom.
"Look, Ben, a pretty rose!" she said. "I will take it to mom. She will be happy."
Ben shook his head. "No, Lily, don't do that. That rose is not ours. It belongs to the old lady next door. She is very mean. She will be angry if you take her rose. She will yell at us and maybe hurt us."
Lily did not listen to Ben. She thought he was just scared. She reached for the rose and pulled it hard. But the rose had many thorns. They pricked Lily's hand and made it bleed. Lily cried out in pain.
The old lady next door heard Lily's cry. She came out of her house and saw Lily holding her rose. She was very angry. She had an unknown thing in her hand. It looked like a stick with a sharp end. She pointed it at Lily and Ben.
"Who are you? What are you doing in my garden? How dare you steal my rose? You are bad children. I will teach you a lesson. Come here!" she shouted.
Lily and Ben were very scared. They dropped the rose and ran away. But the old lady was faster. She caught them and hit them with the unknown thing. It hurt a lot. Lily and Ben screamed and cried. They wished they had listened to Ben. They wished they had not taken the rose. They wished they had not made the old lady angry. They worried that they would never see their mom again.
