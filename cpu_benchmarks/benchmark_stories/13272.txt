Mia was walking down the street when she saw something that made her surprise. It was a rare box made of cardboard. She could not believe it because she had never seen a cardboard box like this before! She was so excited that she quickly grabbed it and ran back home. 
When she opened the box she was even more surprised. Inside were lots of different toys, more than she had ever seen before. She could not believe her luck! She quickly began playing with all the toys and having lots of fun. 
Later, Mia asked her mom where the box came from. Her mom said it was a rare present from a flower fairy! Mia was so happy to have found such a special present. She thanked the flower fairy with a big hug!
