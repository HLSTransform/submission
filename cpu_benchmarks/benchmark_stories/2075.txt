Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to draw and cut paper with his scissors. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a new pair of scissors. They were shiny and sharp, unlike his old, dirty ones. Timmy was very happy and hoped to make many new art projects with them.
Timmy's little sister, Lily, also liked to play with scissors. But she was too little and might hurt herself. So Timmy promised to always keep his scissors away from Lily. He hoped she would understand.
One day, Timmy's friend came over to play. They made paper airplanes and cut out pictures from magazines. But Timmy's friend accidentally dropped the scissors on the ground and they got dirty. Timmy was sad, but he knew he could clean them and make them shiny again. He hoped his friend would be more careful next time. The end.
