Once there were two friends, Sam and John. Sam had a simple dress, but John had a beautiful dress made of silk. Sam was jealous when he saw how nice John looked in his dress.
One day, they were walking on a beach when they saw a palm tree. John wanted to climb the tree, so he took off his dress and put it down on the sand. Sam couldn't resist the temptation. He quickly put on John's dress and went to the palm tree.
When Sam got to the top, he saw that there was a delicious fruit. He wanted to take it, but then he saw how sad John looked down below. He remembered how he had stolen John's dress, so he knew it would be wrong to take the fruit. He quickly got down the tree and gave the dress back to John. John was so glad he had his dress back that he picked the fruit and shared it with Sam.
They enjoyed the delicious fruit, but more importantly, Sam learned an important lesson. He realised that it was better to be honest and generous, rather than taking what wasn't rightfully yours.
