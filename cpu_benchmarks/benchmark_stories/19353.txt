Once, there was a baseball. It was round and red, and it shone in the sun. Timmy loved to play with it. He liked to throw it up in the air and it would shine as it came back down.
One day, Timmy went for a walk with his mom. They passed a funny clown, and Timmy laughed. The clown saw the baseball and said, "That's a beautiful ball you have there!"
Timmy got excited and started throwing it up in the air and running around. His mom smiled. He was so happy that his baseball was shining and it made the day even better.
The mother and son went on their way. Timmy would never forget his baseball shining in the sun. It was so fun and made the day special.
