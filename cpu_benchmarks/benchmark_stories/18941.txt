Once upon a time, in a small forest, there lived a clever little fox named Foxy. Foxy loved to gather things he found while playing outside. One day, Foxy saw something shiny up in the sky. It was the moon! Foxy wanted to gather the moon and keep it as his own.
Foxy thought and thought about how to get the moon. He had an idea! He would use a big stick to reach the moon. Foxy searched for the biggest stick he could find. He knew this would help him get the moon. Foxy was excited about his plan.
Foxy stood on his back legs and tried to use the big stick to reach the moon. But, the moon was still too far away. Foxy felt sad, but then he looked around and saw the moon's light shining on all the things he gathered. Foxy realized that even though he couldn't gather the moon, its light made his things look even more special. Foxy was happy, and he knew he was still a clever little fox.
