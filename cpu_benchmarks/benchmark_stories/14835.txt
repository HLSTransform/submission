One day, a boy and a girl went to the park to play. They saw a big slide and ran to it. But when they got there, they saw a giant sitting on top of the slide. The giant was very big and very loud. He was laughing and throwing things at the birds and the people.
"Hey, giant, can we use the slide?" the boy asked. He was not afraid of the giant.
"No, you can't! This is my slide! Go away!" the giant shouted. He was very mean and very rude.
The girl was scared of the giant. She wanted to go back to her mom. But the boy had an idea. He saw a big ball near the slide. He picked it up and threw it at the giant.
"Ow! That hurt!" the giant cried. He was very surprised and very angry.
"Sorry, giant, but you are crazy. You can't take the slide from everyone. You have to share and be nice." the boy said. He was very brave and very smart.
The giant looked at the boy and the girl. He saw that they were right. He felt bad for being crazy. He got off the slide and gave it to them.
"OK, you can use the slide. I'm sorry for being mean and rude. Can we be friends?" the giant asked. He was very sorry and very lonely.
The boy and the girl smiled at the giant. They saw that he was not so bad. They decided to give him a chance.
"Sure, we can be friends. But you have to be careful and gentle. You are very big and very loud." the girl said. She was very kind and very polite.
The giant nodded and agreed. He was very happy and very grateful. He played with the boy and the girl on the slide. They had a lot of fun. They learned to get along and to respect each other. They became good friends. The end.
