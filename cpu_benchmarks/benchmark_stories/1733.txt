Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy's dad was using a saw to cut some wood. Timmy wanted to help, but his dad said he was too little to use the saw.
Timmy felt sad, but then he saw his helpful dog, Spot. Spot loved to play fetch and run around with Timmy. Timmy threw a ball and Spot ran to get it. But when Spot brought the ball back, he accidentally knocked over the saw. The saw fell on Timmy's dad and hurt him badly.
Timmy's dad had to go to the hospital and Timmy felt very scared. He wished he could stand up and make everything better. But he was just a little boy and didn't know what to do. In the end, Timmy's dad was okay, but Timmy learned to always be careful around dangerous tools like saws.
