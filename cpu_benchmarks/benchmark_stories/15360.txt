Once upon a time there was a girl named Emma. She liked to play tag with her friends outside in the park. One day, Emma's mommy took her to a special room in the house. Emma saw a new thing on the ceiling of the room. It was very shiny and sparkly.
Mommy said, "This is going to replace the old ceiling and make it look lovely. Can you help me put it up?"
Emma was very excited and said yes. She and Mommy worked together to put up the new ceiling. They even picked out some pretty stars to put on the ceiling.
When they were done, Emma was very proud. They stepped back and admired their work. The ceiling was so sparkly and lovely. Emma smiled and hugged her mommy tight. Her Mommy hugged her back and said, “I love you”.
