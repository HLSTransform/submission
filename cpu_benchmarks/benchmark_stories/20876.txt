Once upon a time, there was a prince. He lived in a castle. The prince was very sad. He wept and wept. His sadness was heavy and he could not stop weeping.
Then, one day, a magical bird flew down from the sky. The bird told the prince to close his eyes and make a wish. When the prince opened his eyes, his wish had come true!
But, then the magical bird flew away. The prince realised that his sadness was still heavy and that he still could not stop weeping. He was sadder than ever before.
The prince was never the same again. He wept and wept until the end of his days. The prince lived his life in sadness and his story ended sadly.
