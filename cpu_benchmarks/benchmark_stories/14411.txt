Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toy cart. It was red and had four wheels. She would push it around the house and pretend she was going on adventures. 
One day, Lily's little brother, Max, came over to play. He wanted to play with the cart too, but Lily didn't want to share. They started to argue and it got very noisy. 
Suddenly, the phone rang and their mom answered it. She told them that their grandma was coming over and that they needed to clean up their toys. Lily and Max quickly put away the cart and worked together to clean up the rest of their toys. When their grandma arrived, she was so happy to see how helpful they were being. She even brought them a surprise - a new toy cart to share! Lily and Max were so excited and they played with it together all day long.
