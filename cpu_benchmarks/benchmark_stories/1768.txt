Once upon a time there was a foot. It belonged to a little boy. Everyday, the boy would zoom around on his foot. Everyone thought it was so polite of him. But one day, his foot went too fast. He zoomed across the garden, through the park and around the pond. His foot was going so fast that it was almost magic. Suddenly it stopped. The little boy was out of breath. He opened his eyes and saw a rainbow and a butterfly. He smiled at all the beautiful colours around him. After that, the boy zoomed around the garden, park and pond in a very polite way. He was careful this time and smiled the whole time. He had learned that sometimes you need to slow down and appreciate the world around you. The end.
