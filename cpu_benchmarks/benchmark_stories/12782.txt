John was an impatient boy but his parents always said to him, "Slow down and care about everything around you." So one day, John decided to listen to his parents. He closed his eyes and waited patiently at the door. Suddenly, his dad pushed open the door and handed him a big brown box.
John was fascinated by the mystery that the box held. He shook it by his ear, listening intently. Whispers of secrets and musings fell from the box. He couldn't keep still and impatiently opened the box without hesitations.
Inside the box was a robot! John was amazed at the robot's shiny metal body and sparkling lights. His parents had given him the robot. In that moment, John felt like he really knew what it meant to care. He never wanted to ignore their words again.
