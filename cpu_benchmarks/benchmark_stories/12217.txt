Once upon a time there was a little girl called Jess. Jess was only 3 years old, but loved wearing beautiful summer dresses. One day Jess wanted to go out sailing in her daddy's boat on the lake. When they got to the lake they realized they had forgotten to bring the sail!
Jess was very embarrassed and started to cry. Her dad said to her "There's no need to be embarrassed Jess, sometimes we forget things and that's ok. OR, we can find a solution if we use our imagination!"
So, Jess and her dad used a big blanket to make a sail. After lots of hard work, the sail was ready! Jess and her dad were so proud of their sail and went sailing on the lake.
The moral of the story is: it's ok to make mistakes, but it's even better if we use our imagination to find a solution.
