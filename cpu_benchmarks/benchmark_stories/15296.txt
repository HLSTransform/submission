John had a wallet. It was red and squishy. Inside were lots of things, but the best thing was secret.
John wanted to share his secret with his friends, so he decided to choose someone. He chose Carla, because she was his best friend.
John and Carla went outside together. John took out his wallet and showed Carla the hidden thing inside. It was a sparkling crystal! It was so shiny, Carla had to rub her eyes.
John said, "This crystal is very special. I chose to share it with you because you're my best friend." Carla was so happy, she ran around and around with the crystal.
John smiled. He was glad he chose to share his secret with Carla.
