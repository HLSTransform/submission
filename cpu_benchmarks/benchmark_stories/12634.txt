Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a toy boat that she loved to play with in the bathtub. One day, she decided to pour water from a cup into her boat. She loved watching the boat float around in the water.
Suddenly, there was a loud noise outside. It was a hurricane! The wind was blowing so hard that it knocked down trees and made the windows shake. Lily was scared and didn't know what to do.
She tried to grab her boat and run, but it was too late. The wind was too strong and it blew her and the boat away. The boat was flexible and could bend with the wind, but Lily couldn't. She was hurt and couldn't get up.
In the end, the storm passed and Lily was found by her parents. They took her to the hospital, but her leg was broken. She couldn't play with her boat for a long time, but she was happy to be safe and sound.
