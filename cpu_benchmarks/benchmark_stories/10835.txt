Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had two feet that she liked to wiggle and move around. One day, Lily and her mom went for a walk in the park. Lily was very alert and looked at all the birds and flowers.
Suddenly, Lily saw a butterfly and wanted to catch it. She told her mom, "I want to go and catch the butterfly!" Her mom said, "Okay, but be careful not to step on any bugs with your feet." Lily nodded and ran after the butterfly. She was very fast and her mom had to run to keep up with her.
Finally, Lily caught the butterfly and was very happy. She showed it to her mom and they both looked at it together. Then, they went back home and Lily fell asleep with a big smile on her face, dreaming of all the fun things she would do with her feet tomorrow.
