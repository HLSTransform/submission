Once upon a time, there was a little puppy named Spot. Spot loved to play in the park with his friends. One day, while Spot was playing, he saw a big flame coming from a tree. Spot was scared, but he knew he had to help. He barked and barked until someone came to rescue the tree. 
After the flame was gone, Spot saw something shiny in the tree. It was an unknown object! Spot was very curious, so he climbed up the tree to get it. When he got closer, he saw that it was a toy. Spot was so happy to have found the toy, and he knew he had done a good job rescuing the tree. 
From that day on, Spot was known as a brave puppy who could rescue anything. He was very proud of himself and played with his new toy every day.
