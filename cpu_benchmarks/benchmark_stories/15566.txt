Tim and Anna like to eat sausage for breakfast. They like to cut it with a knife and dip it in ketchup. But today, they have a problem. The sausage is too noisy.
"Crackle, crackle, pop, pop!" The sausage makes loud sounds in the frying pan. Tim and Anna cover their ears.
"Mom, why is the sausage so noisy?" Tim asks.
"Because it is very hot and has a lot of fat," Mom says. "The fat makes bubbles and the bubbles make noise. But don't worry, it will be quiet soon."
Tim and Anna wait for the sausage to be quiet. They look at the clock. They are hungry and want to go to school.
"Mom, can we eat the sausage now?" Anna asks.
"Yes, you can," Mom says. "But be careful, it is still very hot. Blow on it before you bite it."
Tim and Anna take a plate of sausage and ketchup. They blow on it and bite it. It is yummy and crispy. They feel happy and full.
"Thank you, Mom, for the sausage," Tim and Anna say.
"You're welcome, my loves," Mom says. "Now, hurry up and get ready for school. And don't forget your backpacks."
Tim and Anna put their plates in the sink. They grab their backpacks and kiss Mom goodbye. They go to school and have a fun day. They don't hear any more noisy sausage.
