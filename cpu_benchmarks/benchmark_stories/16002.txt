Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. Sally was a very calm and gentle girl.
One day, Sally's mum told her that she needed to take an exam. Sally didn't know what an exam was, so her mum explained that it was a test.
Sally was so scared that she started to cry. But then her mum said, “It’s okay, Sally. Just kneel down here and close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths and stay calm - you can do it.”
So Sally knelt down on the floor. She was still nervous, so she kept taking deep breaths. After a few minutes, she finally felt calm.
“Look at me, Sally,” her mum said. “You can do this exam. You are very brave.”
“Okay, Mum,” said Sally. And with that, she stood up and went off to take the exam.
