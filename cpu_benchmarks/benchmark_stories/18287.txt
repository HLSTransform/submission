Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside in the park. One day, he found a shiny metal coin on the ground. He picked it up and looked at it closely. It was so pretty!
Later that day, Tim went to take a nap. He was feeling very sleepy. As he closed his eyes, he thought about the metal coin he found. He wondered where it came from and who it belonged to. He decided to look for more shiny things in the park tomorrow.
The next day, Tim went back to the park and looked all around. He found more metal coins and even a metal key! He was so happy and couldn't wait to show his mommy. She was surprised and proud of him for finding such special treasures. From that day on, Tim loved to look for shiny metal things and would always feel sleepy after a long day of exploring.
