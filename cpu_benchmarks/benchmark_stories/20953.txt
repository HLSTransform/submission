Once upon a time, there was a girl named Jane. She loved pink but one day she saw a really cool purple shirt. She asked her mom if she could borrow it. Her mom said yes and she was really excited. She put it on and looked in the mirror. She felt like a princess in her new purple shirt.
The next day, she decided to borrow some purpl style from her friend. Her friend had lots of purple accessories and clothes. Jane noticed a purple scarf which matched her shirt perfectly. She asked if she could borrow it and her friend said yes.
That day at school, everyone complimented her on her purple style. She felt so proud of her outfit and the way she had put it together. Jane felt so happy with the new style she had borrowed. She knew it was worth borrowing from her mom and her friend.
