Jack was at the beach with his family. He wore his new blue pants but he felt very uncomfortable in them. 
He saw a girl in the distance and wanted to meet her, so he waved to get her attention. The girl kept walking and Jack kept waving, but the girl couldn't see him.
He asked his mom why the girl couldn't see him. His mom said it was because of his pants. She said they were so big that they were covering his waving arm.
Jack felt very frustrated, he wanted to play with the girl, but his pants were getting in the way. He asked his mom if he could take them off, but she said no.
Jack was so mad, he wanted to throw a tantrum, so he crossed his arms and started to pout. His mom said it would be ok, she said he just had to try harder to wave with his other arm. 
Jack tried to obey his mom and he waved with his other arm. This time the girl saw him and waved back. 
Jack felt much better, he was so happy he could finally play with the girl. He felt comfortable and happy again!
