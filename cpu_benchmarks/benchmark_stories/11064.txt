Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big animal with a long neck. It is a giraffe.
"Wow, look at that!" Anna says. "It has a long, long neck. How can it eat the leaves?"
Ben says, "Maybe it can stretch its neck very high. Or maybe it can bend its neck very low. Let's go and see."
They run to the giraffe. The giraffe is friendly. It lowers its neck and lets them touch it. It feels soft and warm.
"Hello, giraffe," Anna says. "You have a nice neck. Can you tell us how you eat the leaves?"
The giraffe says, "I can eat the leaves in different ways. Sometimes I stretch my neck high and reach the top of the trees. Sometimes I bend my neck low and nibble the grass. Sometimes I eat the leaves that people give me. I like all kinds of leaves."
Anna and Ben are happy. They spend a long time with the giraffe. They give it some leaves and some water. They hug it and thank it.
"Goodbye, giraffe," they say. "We had fun with you. You are a good friend."
The giraffe says, "Goodbye, Anna and Ben. You are good friends too. Come and visit me again."
Anna and Ben wave to the giraffe. They go back to their parents. They tell them about the giraffe and its long neck. They say they want to see it again. Their parents smile and say they will.
