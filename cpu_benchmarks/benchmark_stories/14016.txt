Once upon a time, there was a pretty girl named Sue. Sue loved to run and play. One day, she found a big bottle of glue.
Sue took the glue and ran to the park. She saw her friend, Tom. Tom asked, "What do you have, Sue?" Sue said, "I have glue! Let's play!"
Sue and Tom used the glue to make pretty pictures. They glued leaves and flowers on paper. Then, they ran and showed their moms. Their moms were very happy. Sue and Tom had a fun day with the glue.
