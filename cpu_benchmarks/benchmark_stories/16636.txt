Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big box under a tree. They were curious. They wanted to see what was inside.
"Let's open it!" Lily said.
"OK!" Ben said.
They ran to the box and lifted the lid. Inside, they saw many shiny things. They looked like toys, but they were not. They were weapons. Guns, knives, bombs.
"Wow!" Lily said. "Look at these!"
"Be careful!" Ben said. "They might be dangerous!"
But Lily did not listen. She picked up a gun and pointed it at Ben. She thought it was a game.
"Bang! Bang!" she said. "You are dead!"
She pulled the trigger. But the gun was not a toy. It was real. It made a loud noise and a flash. Ben felt a pain in his chest. He fell to the ground. He did not move. He did not talk. He disappeared.
Lily dropped the gun. She was scared. She did not know what she did. She cried and cried. She wanted Ben to come back. But he did not.
The end.
