Ben has a big red bow on his head. He likes to wear it when he plays with his toys. He thinks it makes him look funny and cute. He has many toys, but his favorite is a rubber duck. He calls it Quack.
One day, Ben is playing with Quack in the bathtub. He makes Quack swim and splash in the water. He makes Quack talk to him and say silly things. He is having a lot of fun. But then, he drops Quack by mistake. Quack falls out of the tub and rolls under the sink.
Ben is sad. He cannot reach Quack. He tries to stretch his arm, but it is too short. He tries to move the sink, but it is too heavy. He cries and calls for help. He misses Quack.
Mom hears Ben crying. She comes to the bathroom and sees what happened. She smiles and hugs Ben. She says, "Don't worry, Ben. I will get Quack for you." She bends down and picks up Quack from under the sink. She gives Quack to Ben.
Ben is happy. He hugs Quack and kisses Mom. He says, "Thank you, Mom. You are the best. I love you and Quack." He puts the bow on Quack's head and says, "You look funny and cute, too." He makes Quack bow to Mom and say, "Thank you, Mom. You are the best. I love you and Ben."
Mom laughs and kisses Ben and Quack. She says, "You are welcome, Ben. I love you and Quack, too. You are both funny and cute. And very grateful." She puts them back in the tub and watches them play. She is happy.
