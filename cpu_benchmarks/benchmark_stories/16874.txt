Once upon a time, there was a busy bee. The bee flew around the flowers all day long. One day, the bee saw a big red flower. The bee thought it was the prettiest flower it had ever seen. 
The bee wanted to decorate the flower with some pollen. So, the bee flew into the flower and collected some pollen. Then, the bee flew to another flower and collected more pollen. 
After a while, the bee had collected enough pollen to decorate the red flower. The bee flew back to the red flower and sprinkled the pollen all over it. The flower looked even prettier with the yellow pollen on it. The bee was very happy that it could decorate the flower.
