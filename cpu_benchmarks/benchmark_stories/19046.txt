Once upon a time, there was a busy bee named Buzzy. Buzzy lived in a hive with many other bees. Buzzy loved to fly from flower to flower to collect nectar. One day, Buzzy got lost and couldn't find the way back to the hive. 
Buzzy felt scared and alone, but then he saw a kind ladybug. The ladybug was very helpful and showed Buzzy the way back to the hive. Buzzy was so happy and grateful that he nodded his head to say thank you. 
From that day on, Buzzy made sure to always stay close to the hive and never get lost again. And whenever he saw the ladybug, he would nod his head to say hello and remember how she had helped him.
