Once there was a family of four, a mom, a dad, a baby and an older brother. The older brother was three years old. 
One day, they all went out in the car to find a place to explore. When they looked outside the window, they noticed a tornado in the sky! The mom said to the three year old in the tightest voice, "We have to find shelter now!" 
They managed to find a cave and went inside. The tornado went on its way and the family was safe. 
The moral to this story is that you should never ignore warnings. It's always best to pay attention to others and follow their advice. It could save your life!
