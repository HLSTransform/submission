Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to run and slide and swing. But they did not like the witch who lived in the old house near the park. She was mean and scary and sometimes yelled at them.
One day, the witch came out of her house and saw Tom and Lily. She wanted to catch them and make them do chores for her. She ran after them with a big stick. Tom and Lily were afraid and ran away.
They saw a big pile of leaves. They thought it was a good place to hide. They jumped into the leaves and covered themselves. They hoped the witch would not find them.
But the leaves were scratchy and wet and cold. Tom and Lily felt uncomfortable. They sneezed and coughed and itched. The witch heard them and came closer. She lifted the leaves and saw them.
"Ha! I found you, you naughty children!" she said. "Now you will come with me and clean my house!"
Tom and Lily were very scared. They wished they had not hidden in the leaves. They wished they had run to their mom and dad. They wished the witch would go away.
