Once there was a big, huge elephant. The elephant was so big that it could hardly move through the forest. All the other animals in the forest trusted the elephant and they knew it was kind. Every day the elephant went to the lake to get a drink. One evening, instead of going to the lake, the elephant decided to take a nap in the shade. As the elephant was falling asleep he felt something soft and warm behind him. It was a little bunny who had come to trust the elephant. The bunny snuggled up to the elephant for warmth and the elephant was so happy to have a friend. From that day on, the elephant and the bunny were best friends and the bunny trusted the huge elephant to keep it safe.
