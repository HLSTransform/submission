Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play together. Today, they are going to the festival. The festival has many games, food, and music. Lily and Ben are excited.
They hold hands and walk to the festival with their moms. They see a big sign that says "Welcome to the Festival". They see many people and tents and balloons. They hear a loud noise. It is a band playing music. Lily and Ben clap their hands and dance.
"Look, Lily, there is a face painting tent!" Ben says. "Do you want to paint your face?"
"Yes, Ben, I do!" Lily says. "Let's go!"
They run to the face painting tent. They see a lady with a brush and many colors. She smiles at them.
"Hello, little ones. Do you want to paint your face?" she asks.
"Yes, please!" Lily and Ben say.
"What do you want to be?" she asks.
"I want to be a butterfly!" Lily says.
"I want to be a tiger!" Ben says.
The lady paints their faces. She makes Lily's face pink and blue and yellow. She makes Ben's face orange and black and white. She adds glitter and stickers. She shows them a mirror.
"Wow, you look amazing!" she says.
Lily and Ben look at themselves. They laugh and hug each other.
"Thank you, lady!" they say.
"You're welcome, sweeties. Have fun at the festival!" she says.
Lily and Ben leave the tent. They see more games and food and music. They have a lot of fun. They are happy. The festival is organized and fun. Lily and Ben love the festival.
