Once upon a time there were two friends, Sam and Lia. Sam and Lia loved to play together and make each other laugh.
One sunny day, Sam and Lia were walking in the park. Suddenly, they saw a bright light in the sky. It was a magical rainbow that split into two ways. One was pink and one was blue!
Lia was so happy about the rainbow that she jumped and started to run. Sam followed her. Together, they chased the rainbow until it disappeared.
The two friends were so excited that Sam started to laugh and Lia smiled the biggest smile ever. They knew they had discovered a special, magical moment that they would never ever forget.
