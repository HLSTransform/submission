Billy and Jane were playing outside in the park. They were playing hide and seek and having so much fun. Suddenly, an icy drop came from the sky. "Oh no" said Jane, looking up. Billy followed her gaze and saw a cop in the sky. He was flying in a big and shiny helicopter carrying a bag filled with money.
Billy and Jane were so excited. They watched the cop drop the money from the helicopter. Then the cop came down to join them and share some of the money with the two kids. They were so happy; they had never seen so much money before!
Soon Billy and Jane were playing with their newfound wealth. They had more money than they ever dreamed of. With the cop's help, they started a lemonade business and shared their new riches with the whole neighbourhood. 
As they watched the sun go down, they looked up at the sky and waved goodbye to their cop friend. They thanked him for his generous gift of money and promised to always remember the day he made them wealthy.
