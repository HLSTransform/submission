Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play together and share toys. But they also like to do things by themselves sometimes. One day, Anna wants to go to the bathroom. She tells Ben to wait for her in the living room.
But Ben is nosy. He wants to know what Anna is doing in the bathroom. He thinks she is hiding something from him. He follows her quietly and opens the door. He sees Anna sitting on the toilet. He says, "What are you doing, Anna?"
Anna is angry. She says, "Go away, Ben! This is my bathroom time. You are not supposed to see me here. You are rude and nosy!" She tries to close the door, but Ben pushes it back. He says, "No, I want to see. I want to discuss with you. Why are you sitting there? What is that paper for?"
Anna and Ben start to fight. They pull and push each other. They yell and cry. They make a lot of noise. They do not hear their mom coming upstairs. She hears them and runs to the bathroom. She sees them fighting and making a mess. She is very angry and sad. She says, "Stop it, Anna and Ben! You are both in big trouble. You are not supposed to fight in the bathroom. You are not supposed to be nosy and rude. You are supposed to respect each other and wait for your turn. You have to say sorry to each other and to me. And you have to clean up this mess. Now!"
Anna and Ben feel bad. They say sorry to each other and to their mom. They help to clean up the bathroom. They learn their lesson. They do not fight or be nosy in the bathroom again. But they still have to go to bed early as a punishment. They do not like their bad ending. They wish they had played nicely and waited for their turn.
