Once upon a time, there was a jet. The jet was very big and fast. It could fly high up in the sky. One day, the jet saw a spicy pepper on the ground. The jet wanted to be friends with the spicy pepper.
The jet flew down to the ground and said "Hi" to the spicy pepper. The spicy pepper said "Hi" back. They talked and laughed all day. The jet and the spicy pepper became very good friends. They wanted to hug each other.
But when the jet tried to hug the spicy pepper, it started to feel hot. The jet's nose got very hot because the spicy pepper was too spicy. The jet was sad and started to cry. The jet and the spicy pepper could not hug each other, and they could not be friends anymore. The jet flew away, feeling very sad.
