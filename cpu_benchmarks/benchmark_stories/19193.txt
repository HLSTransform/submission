Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toy animals and sing songs. One day, her mommy took her to see a band play music in the park. Lily was so excited to see the band play, she couldn't wait!
When they got to the park, the band was already playing. Lily danced and sang along with the music. But then, she saw a big dog that was running towards the band. The dog looked anxious and scared. The band stopped playing and tried to shoo the dog away, but it wouldn't leave.
Lily felt sad that the dog was scared and didn't know what to do. So, she ran over to the dog and gave it a big hug. The dog felt better and ran away happily. The band started playing again and Lily danced and sang along. She was happy that she could help the scared dog. The end.
