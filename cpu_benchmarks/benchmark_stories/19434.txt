Once there was a little girl. She was three years old. She was very curious and loved to read. She often sat in her room and read her favourite books. One day, when she was reading, she saw a bee. The bee was doing a funny dance. The girl jumped up, excited to learn more. 
The bee kept dancing around her while she read. The girl was envious of the bee, who seemed to be having so much fun. She wished she could dance like the bee. She decided to try and learn the bee dance. Soon, the girl was flying around the room just like the bee. 
When the bee flew away, the girl said goodbye and thanked the bee for teaching her how to dance. She waved goodbye and went to find another book to read. The girl continued to read every day, and never forgot the bee dance.
