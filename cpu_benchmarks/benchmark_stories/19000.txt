Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a small village with her family. One day, Lily saw a new family move into the village. They looked very pale and tired from their long journey.
Lily wanted to make the new family feel welcome, so she went to their house with a basket of fresh apples. She knocked on the door and said, "Hello! Welcome to our village! I brought you some apples to eat."
The new family was very happy to meet Lily and thanked her for the apples. From that day on, Lily and the new family became good friends and played together every day. The village was now even more special with new friends to share it with.
