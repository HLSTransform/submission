Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to pretend they were lions and chase each other. Tom was the big lion and Lily was the little lion. They ran fast and roared loud.
They saw a big slide and wanted to go on it. Tom went first and slid down. He roared at the bottom and waited for Lily. Lily climbed up the steps and looked down. She was scared. The slide was very high and steep.
She heard Tom roar again. He wanted her to slide down. She closed her eyes and let go. She felt the wind in her hair and the slide under her. She opened her eyes and saw Tom smiling at her. She slid into his arms and they hugged.
They were happy. They had a surprise. The slide was fun and not scary. They roared together and laughed. They wanted to go on the slide again and again. They were brave lions.
