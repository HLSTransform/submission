Once upon a time, a little girl named Jane was playing in the garden. Suddenly, she found a lemon and wanted to taste it. She asked her mom, "Mom, may I taste the lemon?" Her mom replied, "No, Jane. That lemon is too bitter for you." Jane understood and said, "Okay, I won't eat it."
After a while, Jane asked her mom, "Mom, may I make lemonade with the lemon?" Her mom said, "Yes, Jane, you may but make sure to add some sugar, or else it will be too bitter for you.
So Jane collected some sugar and mixed it with the lemon juice. She made a delicious and sweet lemonade. She took a sip and said, "Thanks mom! This lemonade tastes so good, not bitter at all!" 
Her mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you liked it. I'm so happy I permitted you to make lemonade."
