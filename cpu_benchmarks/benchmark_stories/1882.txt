Jack was very excited. It was his first time to write. He had a special pencil and paper and he couldn't wait to get started.
“What should I write first?” he asked his mom. 
His mom looked down and smiled. “Maybe you could draw a picture of a secret nightmare and write a story to go with it.”
Jack was so excited that he started to write right away. He drew a picture of a huge dragon and wrote a story about a brave knight who had to fight the dragon. 
He kept writing and writing until he had finished his story. Then, he showed his mom what he had written and she was so proud. 
Jack was so happy and excited that he had written his first story. His mom gave him a big hug. Writing was something he wanted to do again and again.
