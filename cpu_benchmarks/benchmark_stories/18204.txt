Once upon a time, there was a new cabin in the woods. A boy named Tom and a girl named Sue lived in the cabin. They were very happy in their new home.
One day, Tom and Sue saw a big ball. They wanted to play with it. They started to pass the ball to each other. They were having fun and laughing. The ball was their new friend.
But then, the ball went too far away. It went into the dark woods. Tom and Sue were scared, but they wanted their ball back. They went into the woods to find it. They looked and looked, but they could not find the ball. They were lost and could not find their way back to the cabin. Tom and Sue were very sad and scared.
