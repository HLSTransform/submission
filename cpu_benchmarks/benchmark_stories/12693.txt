Jill and Jack were walking in the park on a sunny day. They loved spending time in the park with each other. They were feeling so safe and happy.
Jack said to Jill, "Let's run!" Jill smiled and agreed.
They ran and laughed together. They felt the warmth of the Sun and looked around to take in the beauty of the park.
After a while, they rested and hugged each other. Jack said he was so glad they were having such a wonderful day.
Jill smiled, "Me too."  They hugged again and enjoyed the happy feeling they had.  After a while, they said goodbye and each went home feeling safe and content.
