Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. Jack loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, Jack's mom asked him to clean up his toys. Jack didn't want to clean up, he wanted to keep playing. 
His mom said, "Jack, you have to clean up your toys. It's important to stay organized." Jack didn't listen and continued to play. 
Later that day, Jack's little sister came over to play. Jack's toys were all over the floor and his sister tripped and fell. She started crying and Jack's mom was very upset. She told Jack that he needed to quit being selfish and start being more helpful. 
Jack didn't listen and continued to play with his toys. Later that night, Jack's mom stepped on one of his toys and hurt her foot. She was very angry and told Jack that his toys were not useful if they were just causing harm. Jack learned a valuable lesson that day, but unfortunately, it was too late.
