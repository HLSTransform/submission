Once there was a girl named Mia. She had a bird in a birdcage. The bird was red and blue. Mia loved her bird very much. One day, it was wet outside. Mia's mom told her to put the birdcage inside the house, so the bird would not get wet. Mia did not want the bird to be wet and cold, so she listened to her mom.
Mia put the birdcage near the window. The bird could see the trees and the sky. Mia played with her toys and forgot about the bird for a little bit. The bird saw something outside. It was a big tree with lots of other birds. The bird wanted to play with them, but it was stuck in the birdcage.
Later, Mia looked at the birdcage, but the bird was not there. The cage door was open! Mia was sad and she missed her bird. She looked outside and saw the bird with the other birds in the tree. The bird was happy. Mia smiled and knew that her bird was having fun. She closed the window, so her bird would not get wet when it came back home.
