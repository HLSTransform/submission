Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play with cars and balls. But they do not like to share. One day, they have a big fight over a brown car. Tom says it is his car. Sam says it is his car. They pull and push and yell.
"Stop it!" Mom says. "It is time for meal. Come and eat." She puts some food on the table. There are bread and cheese and soup and fruit. It looks good and smells good.
Tom and Sam do not listen. They keep fighting over the brown car. They do not want to eat. They do not want to stop. They make a big mess. They knock over the table. The food falls on the floor. The soup spills on the rug. The fruit rolls away.
Mom is very angry. She takes the brown car and throws it in the trash. She says, "No car for you. No meal for you. Go to your room. Now!" She points to the door.
Tom and Sam are sad and sorry. They cry and hug. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We love you. We love the brown car. Please, can we have it back? Please, can we have some meal?"
But Mom does not answer. She is too mad. She leaves them alone in their room. They have no car, no meal, and no fun. They have a bad day. The end.
