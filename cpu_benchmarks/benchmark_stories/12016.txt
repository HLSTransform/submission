Once upon a time, there were two birds who were best friends. They loved to play together and fly in the sky. One day, they saw a big crane who was trying to catch some fish in the river. The birds were worried that the crane might hurt them, so they decided to unite and make a plan to help the fish.
One bird distracted the crane by flying around it, while the other bird went to the river and helped the fish escape. The birds were very happy that they could help their friends. They knew that they were reliable friends who always looked out for each other.
From that day on, the birds and the fish were friends too. They played together and had fun in the river. The crane never tried to catch the fish again because it knew that the birds were watching. The birds were happy that they could unite and make a difference in their world.
