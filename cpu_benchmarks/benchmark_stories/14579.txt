Ma and Pa had a puppy. It was so small and cute. All day, it would run and play with Ma and Pa. It would sometimes forget their rules. 
One day, Ma was making dinner. She was busy and forgot about the puppy. The puppy was very sad. It wanted to be able to play with Ma and Pa. 
Suddenly, it had an idea. It ran up to Ma and hugged her very tight. Ma was surprised and gave the puppy a big hug back. She wasn't mad anymore! 
The puppy was so happy. Ma and Pa played with it all evening. They would never forget this special moment.
