Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived on a farm with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily and her mommy went to the barn to feed the animals. 
Lily saw a horse and said, "Mommy, the horse is beautiful!" 
Her mommy smiled and said, "Yes, she is very pretty. Do you want to give her some water to drink?" 
Lily nodded her head and said, "Yes, please!" So, her mommy helped her pour some water into the horse's bucket. 
The horse drank the water and Lily giggled. Then, she turned to her mommy and said, "Mommy, can we come back to the barn tomorrow?" 
Her mommy replied, "Of course, we can come back every day and see all the animals." And Lily smiled, happy to have a new friend in the barn.
