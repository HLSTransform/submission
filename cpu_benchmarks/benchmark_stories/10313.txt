Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play in the park. They see a big slide. They want to go on the slide.
"Me first!" Tom shouts. He runs to the slide. He climbs up the ladder. He sits on the slide.
"Wait for me!" Sam shouts. He runs after Tom. He climbs up the ladder. He tries to sit behind Tom.
But Tom is too big. He takes up all the space. Sam cannot fit on the slide. He pushes Tom. Tom pushes back.
"Stop it!" Tom shouts. "You are too heavy. You make the slide slow."
"No, you stop it!" Sam shouts. "You are too hairy. You tickle my nose."
They start to fight. They pull each other's hair. They kick each other's legs. They make a lot of noise.
A lady sees them. She is the park keeper. She has a whistle. She blows the whistle. She walks to the slide.
"Hey, you two!" she shouts. "What are you doing? You are not supposed to fight on the slide. You are supposed to slide down and have fun. Now get off the slide and say sorry to each other."
Tom and Sam stop fighting. They look at the lady. They feel ashamed. They slide down the slide. They say sorry to each other. They hug.
The lady smiles. She says, "That's better. Now go and play nicely. And remember, sharing is caring."
Tom and Sam nod. They say, "Thank you, lady." They run to the swings. They take turns. They have fun. They are happy.
