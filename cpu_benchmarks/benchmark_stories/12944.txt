Once upon a time there was a kind old lady who lived all by herself in a house made of stones. She was very compassionate and every day she would prepare food for the animals.
One day, the lady went to the berry bush to pick some fruit for the animals. When she was there, she heard some chirping coming from a little nest next to the bush.
The old lady peered closer and saw three little chicks in the nest. "Oh, my," she said. She picked the chicks up gently and took them home with her.
She decided to take care of them and give them a nice home. Every day, the lady would feed the chicks wheat, and take extra care to make sure they were warm. All the animals around were grateful for the old lady's compassion.
The chicks grew up big and strong. They were very thankful for everything the old lady had done for them. She smiled, she had prepared the freshest wheat for them every day and they showed their appreciation.
