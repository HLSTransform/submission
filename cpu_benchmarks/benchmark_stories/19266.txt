Once upon a time there was a needle. He lived with his family - a big, happy needle family. They were a very persistent family and they loved to record everything. Every day, they went out looking for new things and experiences that they could record.
One day, they arrived at a beautiful meadow. As they explored, they saw lots of different things they could record. But then they saw something they had never seen before!
It was a giant pink flower! The thought of recording it was exciting so they got very close. But then, their needle family noticed one big problem. The flower was covered in thorns!
So the persistent needle family kept looking for a way to record the flower without the thorns. And then at last, someone had an idea!
They asked a big, strong bird for help. And it agreed! The bird carefully lifted the flower and the needle family was able to record it safely.
Everyone was so happy and excited. This is a memory they'll never forget and can return to anytime they want.
