One day, a little boy named Tim went to the store with his mom. They needed to buy some food for dinner. Tim's mom asked him to pick out a reliable vegetable, so he chose celery. He was very proud of his choice.
As they walked home, Tim's mom asked him to balance the celery on his head. Tim thought it was a fun game. He put the celery on his head and tried to keep it from falling. "Look, Mom!" he said, "I can balance the celery on my head!"
His mom smiled and said, "Great job, Tim! You're really good at balancing the celery." They laughed and continued walking home, with Tim balancing the celery on his head the whole way. When they got home, they cooked dinner together and enjoyed their meal with the reliable celery.
