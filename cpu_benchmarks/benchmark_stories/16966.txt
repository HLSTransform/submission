Anna and Ben are twins. They share a room and a crib. They like to play with their toys and talk to each other. Sometimes they make funny noises and laugh.
One day, Mom comes in and says, "It's nap time, my sweeties. Time to go to the crib and sleep." She picks up Anna and puts her in the crib. Then she picks up Ben and puts him next to Anna. She kisses them and says, "I love you. Have a good nap."
Anna and Ben do not want to nap. They want to play more. They look at each other and whisper, "Let's get out of the crib." They try to climb over the rails, but they are too high. They try to push the crib, but it is too heavy. They try to call Mom, but she does not hear them.
They get tired and frustrated. They start to cry. Anna says, "This is a stupid crib. I hate it." Ben says, "Me too. It's not fair. Why do we have to nap?" Anna says, "I don't know. Mom says it's good for us. But I don't like it."
Ben shrugs. He does not know what to do. He says, "Maybe we should sleep. Maybe it will make Mom happy. And maybe we will have a nice dream." Anna thinks for a moment. She says, "Maybe you are right. Maybe it's not so bad. Maybe we can play later." She yawns and cuddles with Ben. Ben yawns and cuddles with Anna. They close their eyes and fall asleep.
