Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily wanted to go to the park but her mom was too busy to take her. Lily felt sad because she really wanted to go. 
Suddenly, a bus stopped in front of her house. A nice bus driver asked her if she wanted to go for a ride. Lily was so happy and said yes. 
When they arrived at the park, Lily saw a boy who had a big, disgusting ice cream cone. She really wanted one too but she didn't have any money. The boy saw that she was sad and said, "I can share my ice cream with you, but you have to pay me." 
Lily didn't know what to do. She didn't have any money. The bus driver saw what was happening and said, "Don't worry, Lily. I will pay for the ice cream." Lily was so happy and thanked the bus driver. She had a wonderful day at the park and made a new friend.
