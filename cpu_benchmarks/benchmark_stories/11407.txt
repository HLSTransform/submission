Once upon a time there lived a very brave boy. His name was Ricky, and he was only three years old. 
One day, Ricky went for a walk in the woods and he noticed an old oak tree. Ricky liked the tree and he wanted to do something special for it. He decided to remove all the old, dull leaves from the tree. 
Ricky carefully removed all the dull leaves from the tree. Then he heard a strange thumping noise. He looked up and there in the branches of the old oak tree sat a baby owl. 
The owl said to Ricky, "Thank you for removing the dull leaves from my tree. Please let me repay you with a special gift." Ricky was very excited and he said, "Yes, please!" 
The baby owl opened his wings and he flew away. Ricky watched him fly away with a knowing smile on his face. 
The next day, Ricky heard the same thumping noise. He looked up and the baby owl was back with a small present in his mouth. Ricky opened the present, and it was a beautiful shiny feather from the baby owl. Ricky smiled and he knew his kindness had been repaid.
