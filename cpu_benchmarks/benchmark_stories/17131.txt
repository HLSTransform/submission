Once upon a time, there was a kind rabbit named Benny. Benny loved to play in the forest with his friends. One day, Benny and his friends decided to have a race to see who could run the fastest. Benny really wanted to win the race, but he knew his friend, the speedy squirrel, was very fast.
Before the race, Benny's friend, the wise owl, mentioned that sometimes the one who runs the fastest doesn't always win. Benny thought about what the owl said and decided to run as fast as he could but also be kind to his friends. During the race, Benny saw his friend, the turtle, struggling to keep up. Benny remembered what the owl said and decided to help the turtle by cheering him on.
In the end, Benny didn't win the race, but he felt happy because he was kind to his friends. The wise owl was right, sometimes winning isn't the most important thing. Benny learned that being kind is just as important as winning.
