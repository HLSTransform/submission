Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Ben. Ben loved to play in the forest, but one day he saw a big scary log. He wanted to climb it, but he was too afraid. 
His friend, a little bird named Lily, saw him and came to help. She said, "Don't be scared, Ben. I will help you climb the log." But Ben refused. He didn't want to try. 
Lily didn't give up. She said, "I know you can do it, Ben. You are strong and brave." Finally, Ben agreed to try. With Lily's help, he climbed the log and felt very proud of himself. From that day on, Ben learned that sometimes it's okay to be scared, but it's important to try and not refuse help from friends.
