Once there was a little girl named Maria. She was three years old and loved playing with her friends. One day Maria's mom gave her a flower bulb to plant. Maria was so excited and couldn't wait to get started.
She put the bulb in the ground and added some water. Days went by and still nothing happened. Maria was so sorry that her bulb wouldn't grow.
Suddenly one day Maria saw a tiny stem growing from the soil. She couldn't believe it! Maria was so excited.
Next morning when Maria woke up the stem had grown a little flower! She was so happy and accepted the gift that the bulb had given her. Maria gave the flower to her mom and said "I'm so sorry it took so long to grow." Her mom hugged Maria and told her that it was okay and that she was proud of her.
