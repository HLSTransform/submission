Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play dress-up and wear pretty clothes. One day, she asked her mommy if she could wear a new dress. "Mommy, can I wear a new dress please?" Lily requested. 
Her mommy went to the closet and showed her a beautiful dress. "This is the style of the season, Lily. It will look impressive on you," her mommy said. 
Lily put on the dress and twirled around. "Wow, mommy! This dress is so pretty! Thank you for letting me wear it," Lily said happily. 
Her mommy smiled and said, "You're welcome, Lily. You look very impressive in that dress. Now let's go show daddy!" And they went to show Lily's daddy her new dress.
