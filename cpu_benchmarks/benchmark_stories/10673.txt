Once upon a time, there was a mama bear who lived in the forest with her two cubs. Mama bear was very proud of her cubs, and was always watching out for them. 
One day, the cubs were playing in the forest when they heard a loud noise. Mama bear was nearby and heard it too. Worried, mama bear rushed to her cubs, and asked what it was. 
"It's trouble," said one cub, pointing to a mean-looking wolf.
Mama bear quickly stepped in to protect her cubs. She growled fiercely at the wolf and showed it her big and sharp teeth. The wolf quickly ran away.
Mama bear and her cubs were very relieved, and mama bear was so proud of her cubs. She hugged them tight and told them that she would always protect them.
