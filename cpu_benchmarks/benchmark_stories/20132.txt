Tom and Sue were friends who liked to play on the beach. They made sand castles and looked for shells and crabs. One day, they saw a big boat on the water. It was long and had many sails.
"Wow, look at that boat!" Tom said. "I want to go on it and see the world."
"Me too," Sue said. "But how can we get there? It is too far and the water is deep."
They thought for a while. Then Tom had an idea.
"I know! We can make a raft with wood and rope. Then we can paddle to the boat. It will be fun!"
Sue liked the idea. They found some wood and rope on the beach and worked hard to make a raft. They used their jackets as paddles. They were proud of their raft.
"Are you ready?" Tom asked.
"Yes, let's go!" Sue said.
They pushed their raft into the water and climbed on. They paddled towards the boat. They were happy and excited.
But they did not notice that the tide was changing. The water was moving away from the shore. The boat was getting farther and farther. The raft was getting smaller and smaller.
"Tom, I'm scared," Sue said. "We are too far from the beach. How can we go back?"
Tom looked around. He saw that they were in trouble. He wished they had not left the shore.
"Don't worry, Sue," he said. "We will be okay. We have to support each other. We have to paddle harder. We have to wait for the tide to change again. Then the water will bring us back."
He tried to sound brave, but he was scared too. He hoped that someone would see them and help them. He hoped that the tide would change soon. He hoped that they would see the beach again.
