Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Susie. She was very curious and loved exploring.
One day, Susie went to the park with her mom. While walking down the path, Susie saw something that made her giggle. It was a big bowl of candy! She wanted to pull it out of the bowl, but her mom said no.
That made Susie feel terrible, so she began to cry. Then her mom said she could have one piece of candy if she was very careful.
So Susie carefully reached in and pulled out a piece of candy. Then she popped it into her mouth and smiled. It was the best candy she ever tasted! Susie couldn't wait for the next time she could go to the park to get some more candy.
