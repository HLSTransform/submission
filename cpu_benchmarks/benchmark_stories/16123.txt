Once upon a time, there were two black bears. The bears were having an argument. Both of them wanted to tell a different story. 
The first bear wanted to tell a funny story. He said, "I know a funny story about a bee!" 
The second bear disagreed. He said, "No, I want to tell a serious story. It's about a mountain!" 
The first bear said, "That sounds boring."
The second bear replied, "It's not boring. Just wait and see!"
The two bears disagreed for a long time. Neither of them would give in. Finally the first bear said, "Fine, let's hear your story about the mountain!" 
The second bear smiled. He had found a way to show the first bear how exciting his story was. 
The second bear began to tell a story about a mountain. It was its very own mountain and it was black. On the mountain there was an adventure that the bear had never seen before. 
The first bear was amazed. He had been so wrong to disagree. The second bear's story was full of excitement and adventure! He never wanted the story to end. 
The two bears hugged each other and enjoyed their adventure together. They agreed that the second bear had the best story of all.
