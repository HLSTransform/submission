Billy and Michael were in the living room, playing with their toys. Billy had a playhouse, and Michael had a truck.
"Let's pretend there's an emergency," said Michael.
"Okay," replied Billy.
The two boys put all the toys away, and Billy covered the playhouse with a blanket.
Suddenly, the doorbell rang.
"Who could that be?" asked Billy in surprise.
The two boys opened the door and saw a fireman.
"We need to get out of the house. There's a fire!" the fireman said.
The boys grabbed their toys and quickly followed the fireman outside.
"See, I told you we needed an emergency plan," said Michael, looking at Billy with a smile.
Billy felt foolish. He thought they were just playing a game and didn't think a real emergency would come. But now he knew it was important to always be prepared.
