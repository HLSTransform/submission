Once upon a time there was a poor little girl named Rose. Rose didn't have much, but she had a staff to carry with her wherever she went. One day, she took her staff and went to a beautiful meadow. As she walked through, she saw the most amazing thing. Everywhere she looked, the ground was blooming with colorful flowers. Rose smiled with joy and started to dance around. She twirled and spun in a circle until she felt dizzy. Joy and laughter filled the air and Rose felt happy. Finally, it felt like the flowery meadow was blooming for her.
