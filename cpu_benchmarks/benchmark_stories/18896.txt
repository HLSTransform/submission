Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her toys. She had many animals, like a bear, a cat, a dog, and a rabbit. She liked to make them talk and have fun. But one day, she was very tired and her mom said she had to nap.
"No, no, no!" Lily said. "I don't want to nap! I want to play with my animals!"
"You have to nap, Lily," her mom said. "It's good for you. You can play with your animals later."
Lily was very mad. She did not listen to her mom. She ran to her room and slammed the door. She took her animals and threw them on the bed. She said, "You are my friends. You don't want me to nap, right?"
The animals did not say anything. They were just toys. But Lily pretended they said, "No, we don't want you to nap. We want to play with you. You are the best."
Lily smiled. She said, "See, mom? They don't want me to nap. They want me to play. I will play with them all day and all night."
She picked up her bear and hugged it. She said, "You are my favorite. You are so big and soft and brown. You are a serious animal. You can protect me from anything."
But the bear was not a real animal. It was just a toy. And it had a button on its back. When Lily hugged it, she pressed the button by mistake. The bear made a loud noise. It said, "Roar! I am a scary bear! I will eat you!"
Lily was very scared. She dropped the bear and screamed. She said, "No, no, no! You are not my friend! You are a mean animal! You want to hurt me!"
She ran to the door and tried to open it. But it was locked. She had locked it when she slammed it. She cried and banged on the door. She said, "Mom, mom, mom! Help me! The bear is scary! It wants to eat me!"
But her mom did not hear her. She was downstairs, doing some work. She thought Lily was napping. She did not know Lily was in trouble. She did not know Lily was scared. She did not know Lily was sorry.
