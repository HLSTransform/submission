Once upon a time, there was a young engine. He was so excited to explore the world. One day, he was in the sun and it had started to get very warm. The engine began to melt. He melted and melted until there was nothing left of him.
The engine was so sad that he had melted away. He wished he could go out and explore the world. Then, one day, something magical happened.
A young girl came along and saw the melted engine. She was very creative and she had an idea. She took some materials from the ground and started to build the engine a brand new body!
When she was finished, the young engine was amazed. He looked around and saw a brand new world that he could explore. He thanked the young girl for bringing him back to life.
The young engine was so happy. He could start his adventure and explore the world.
The end.
