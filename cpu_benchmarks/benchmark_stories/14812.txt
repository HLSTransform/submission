Lila was a good daughter. She liked to help her mom and dad with the house and the farm. She also liked to play with her doll, Anna. Anna had a pretty dress and long hair. Lila loved Anna very much.
One day, a bad man came to the farm. He saw Lila playing with Anna. He wanted Anna for himself. He was ugly and mean. He had a big nose and a dirty beard. He sneaked behind Lila and grabbed Anna from her arms.
"Hey, give me back my doll!" Lila cried. She ran after the bad man. She was brave and strong.
The bad man laughed. He said, "No, this is my doll now. You can't have her. She is too pretty for you. You are ugly and small."
Lila was very sad and angry. She said, "No, you are ugly and mean. You can't steal my doll. She is mine. I love her. You are a bad man."
The bad man ran away with Anna. He thought he was smart and fast. But he did not see the big dog that was guarding the farm. The dog saw the bad man and heard Lila's cry. The dog barked and chased the bad man. He bit his leg and made him fall.
Lila caught up with the bad man and the dog. She took Anna back from his hand. She hugged Anna and thanked the dog. She said, "You are a good dog. You helped me get my doll back. You are my friend."
The bad man was scared and hurt. He said, "Please, don't hurt me. I'm sorry. I won't steal again."
Lila said, "You should be sorry. You should not steal. Stealing is bad. You should be nice and share. You should go away and never come back."
The bad man nodded and limped away. He learned his lesson. He never stole again.
Lila went back to the house with Anna and the dog. She told her mom and dad what happened. They were proud of her. They said, "You are a good daughter. You are brave and strong. You are pretty and smart. We love you very much."
Lila smiled and said, "I love you too. And I love Anna. And I love the dog. We are a happy family."
