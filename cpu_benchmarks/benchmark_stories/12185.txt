Once upon a time, there was a kind lady who wanted to sail to a far away land. She grabbed some flowers from her garden and put them into her boat. 
As she sailed, she looked out across the water and enjoyed the gentle breeze that was blowing against her face. She waved to some friendly fish as she passed them by.
Suddenly, a little voice said, “Where are you going? Can I come with you?”
The kind lady turned around and saw a small mouse standing in her boat.
The man looked up and said, “I want to sail to the end of the rainbow and pick the most beautiful flower of all. Will you come with me?” 
The mouse nodded and said, “Yes, I would like to come with you.”
The kind lady smiled, and the two of them sailed away. When they reached the end of the rainbow, they found the most beautiful flower in the world. They picked it, put it in their boat, and sailed home.
