Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved Christmas and he wanted to make a pretty ornament for his tree. He got some paper and some crayons and started to draw. He drew a big star with lots of colors. Then he cut it out and put a string on it to hang it on the tree.
But when he looked at his tree, he saw that it was empty. He didn't have any more ornaments to put on it. So he decided to make more. He got some more paper and drew some more stars. He colored them all different colors and cut them out. Now his tree was full of pretty ornaments that he made all by himself.
