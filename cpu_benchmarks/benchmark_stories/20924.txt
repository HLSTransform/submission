Once upon a time a lonely deer had to leave his family. He was all alone in the forest and he felt very sad. 
He wanted to find a friend but he just couldn't find one. He was sitting all alone in a meadow and he was feeling hopeless.
Suddenly he heard a voice and saw a squirrel by his side.
The squirrel said: "Hi deer! Why are you so lonely?"
The deer said: "I am alone, I don't have any friends."
The squirrel replied: "Well, you can come and stay with me and my family. We can be friends!" 
The deer felt so happy and said: "Yes, I would love that!"
So the deer and the squirrel became friends and the lonely deer was not lonely anymore.
