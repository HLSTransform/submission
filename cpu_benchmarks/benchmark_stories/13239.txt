Molly was a very curious girl. She was always exploring the world and talking to everyone she could. One day, Molly was walking around her neighborhood when she spotted something unknown. It was something bright, colorful, and round. She bent down to take a closer look and saw that it was a piece of gum! She couldn't believe she found gum all on her own. She quickly looked around and when she was sure no one was watching, she grabbed the gum and put it in her pocket.
Molly ran home to show her mom the gum. She was so excited and couldn't wait to talk about her discovery. When she got home, she showed the gum to her mom. Her mom smiled and said, "That's actually my gum, Molly. I dropped it when I was walking." Molly was surprised. She had no idea the gum was her mom's.
Molly's mom decided to let her keep it and gave her permission to chew it whenever she wanted. Molly was delighted and thanked her mom. From that day forward, Molly always looked around for new and unknown things while she was walking. She never stopped looking and talking.
