Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and draw pictures. One day, her mom gave her a shiny silver necklace with a graceful butterfly pendant. Lily loved it so much that she wore it every day.
One afternoon, Lily's mom asked her to help fold the laundry. Lily was happy to help and started folding the clothes. She noticed her mom's favorite shirt was missing. Her mom told her that it was in the washing machine and that they would fold it later.
After they finished folding, Lily's mom went to the washing machine and found that her shirt was ruined. She was very upset. Lily remembered the necklace her mom gave her and decided to give it to her mom to make her feel better.
When Lily's mom saw the necklace, she was surprised and touched by Lily's kind gesture. She hugged Lily and told her how much she loved her. From then on, Lily learned that sometimes, even small acts of kindness can make a big difference. And every time she wore her necklace, she remembered how much her mom loved her.
