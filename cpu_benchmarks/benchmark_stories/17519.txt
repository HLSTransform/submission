Tom is a big boy who likes to help his dad. Every morning, he wakes up early and goes with his dad to the shop. His dad sells newspapers to people who want to read them. Tom thinks his dad is very successful, because he has many customers and always smiles.
One day, Tom sees a big truck outside the shop. The truck has many newspapers inside. The driver says he is late and he needs to rush. He asks Tom and his dad to help him unload the newspapers. Tom is excited and says yes.
Tom and his dad work hard and fast. They take the newspapers from the truck and put them in the shop. They make a big pile of newspapers. Tom feels proud and happy. He says to his dad, "Look, dad, we did it! We helped the driver!"
His dad hugs him and says, "Yes, Tom, we did it! You are a great helper! I am very proud of you!" He gives him a newspaper and says, "This is for you. You can read it later and learn new things."
Tom smiles and says, "Thank you, dad! I love you!" He holds the newspaper and looks at the pictures. He thinks he will be a successful newspaper seller like his dad when he grows up.
