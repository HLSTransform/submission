Once upon a time there was a pumpkin who was feeling very sad. He had been having a difficult day and nothing seemed to be going right.
He mentioned his problem to a nearby tree. The tree was very kind, and patiently listened to the pumpkin's problems.
The tree said he should talk to the farmer. So the pumpkin made his way to the farmer.
The farmer was very understanding. He said he could help make things better. He smiled and said he had the perfect solution.
The farmer took out a big knife and started cutting the pumpkin. Inside was lots of yummy pumpkin seeds!
The pumpkin was so happy. He thanked the farmer for helping him. With his friends, he spent the day eating the pumpkin seeds and laughing. It was a much better day after all.
