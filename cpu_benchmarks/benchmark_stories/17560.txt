Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and trucks. They have many cars and trucks, but they want more. They have an idea. They can supply cars and trucks to other kids and get something in trade.
They go to the park with their cars and trucks. They see Lily and Ben. Lily and Ben have dolls and books. Tom and Sam ask them, "Do you want to play with cars and trucks?"
Lily and Ben say, "Yes, we do. But we only have dolls and books. Can we trade with you?"
Tom and Sam say, "Yes, you can. We will supply you with cars and trucks, and you will supply us with dolls and books. Then we can all play."
They agree and trade. Tom and Sam get dolls and books, and Lily and Ben get cars and trucks. They are happy and start to play.
But then they hear a loud noise. It is a big dog. The big dog runs to them and barks. The big dog likes cars and trucks. He grabs one with his mouth and runs away.
Tom and Sam are sad. They say, "Oh no, our car! Our trade is gone!"
Lily and Ben are sorry. They say, "Don't worry, we will help you. We will get your car back from the big dog."
They all chase the big dog. They shout, "Stop, big dog! Give us our car!"
The big dog is scared. He drops the car and runs away. They get the car back. They are happy again.
They say, "Thank you, big dog. You are loud, but you are not bad. You can play with us, too."
The big dog wags his tail. He likes them. He joins them and plays with them. They have fun. They are friends. The end.
