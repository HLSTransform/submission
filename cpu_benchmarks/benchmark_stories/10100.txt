Lily and her mom went to the theater to see a show. Lily was very excited. She liked the songs and the costumes and the lights. She clapped her hands and smiled.
But then, something bad happened. The show had a sad part. A big dog got hurt and had to go away. Lily loved dogs. She felt sorry for the big dog. She started to weep. She wept very loud.
"Shh, Lily, it's okay," her mom said. "It's just a story. The dog is not real. He is fine."
But Lily did not listen. She wept louder and louder. She wanted the dog to come back. She did not like the sad part.
Some people in the theater got angry. They did not like the noise. They wanted to hear the show. They turned around and said mean things to Lily and her mom.
"Be quiet, kid. You are ruining the show."
"Take her out of here. She is too young for this."
"Can't you control your child?"
Lily and her mom felt bad. They did not want to make people angry. They did not want to ruin the show. They got up and left the theater. They walked to the car.
On the way, they met an elderly lady. She had white hair and a kind face. She saw Lily's tears and smiled.
"Hello, dear. What's wrong?" she asked.
Lily told her about the big dog and the sad part and the mean people. The lady nodded and hugged her.
"I understand, dear. I love dogs too. And I don't like sad parts either. But you know what? Sometimes stories have sad parts to make us feel things. To make us care. To make us think. And sometimes, sad parts have happy endings. Maybe the big dog will come back. Maybe he will find a new home. Maybe he will be happy again. You never know."
Lily looked at the lady. She felt a little better. She wiped her tears and smiled.
"Really?" she asked.
"Really," the lady said. "And you know what else? You are a very brave and sweet girl. You have a big heart. And that is a wonderful thing. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
Lily hugged the lady. She thanked her for her words. She felt happy again.
"Can we go back to the theater?" she asked her mom.
Her mom looked at the lady. The lady nodded and winked.
"Sure, honey. Let's go back to the theater. Maybe we can catch the happy ending."
