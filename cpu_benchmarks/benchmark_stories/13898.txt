Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a hat that he loved very much. It was an old hat, but it was his favorite. Tim wore the hat every day when he played outside.
One day, the hat got a big hole in it. Tim was very sad. His mom saw him crying and asked, "What's wrong, Tim?" Tim showed her the old hat with the hole. His mom said, "Don't worry, we can replace it with a new hat."
The next day, Tim and his mom went to the store. They looked at many hats. Tim found a new hat that he liked. It was blue and had a picture of a car on it. Tim was very happy to replace his old hat with a new one. Now, he could play outside with his new hat and not be sad anymore.
