Lily liked to play with her kite. She had a red kite with a long cord. She ran with the kite and made it soar in the sky. She felt happy when she saw the kite fly high and fast.
One day, she went to the park with her kite. She saw other children playing with their kites. They had different colors and shapes. Some had tails and some had bows. Lily wanted to play with them, but she was shy. She felt lonely with her red kite.
She saw a boy with a blue kite. He smiled at her and said, "Hi, I'm Ben. Do you want to play with me?"
Lily nodded and said, "Hi, I'm Lily. I like your kite."
"Thank you. I like yours too. It's very red. Can I see it?"
"Sure. Here you go."
Ben took Lily's kite and looked at it. He said, "It's very nice. Can I try it?"
"Okay. But be careful. Don't let go of the cord."
Ben ran with Lily's kite and made it soar in the sky. He said, "Wow, it's very fun. It flies very high and fast."
Lily smiled and said, "Yes, it does. I'm glad you like it."
They took turns flying each other's kites. They laughed and talked. They became friends. Lily felt happy and not lonely anymore. She liked playing with Ben and his blue kite. She liked sharing her red kite with him. She learned that kites are more fun when you have someone to play with.
