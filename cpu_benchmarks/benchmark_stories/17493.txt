Lily liked to ride her motorcycle. It was red and shiny and made a loud noise. She felt independent when she rode it, like she could go anywhere she wanted. She did not like to share her motorcycle with anyone.
One day, she took her motorcycle to the park. She saw a boy playing with a ball. He looked at her motorcycle and smiled. He ran over to her and said, "Hi, I'm Ben. Can I try your motorcycle?"
Lily shook her head. "No, this is mine. Go away."
Ben frowned. He did not like her answer. He reached for her motorcycle and tried to pull it away from her. Lily got angry. She bit his hand hard.
"Ow!" Ben cried. He let go of the motorcycle and ran away. He had a red mark on his hand where Lily bit him.
Lily felt proud. She had defended her motorcycle. She got on it and rode away. She did not care about Ben or his ball. She only cared about her motorcycle. She was independent.
