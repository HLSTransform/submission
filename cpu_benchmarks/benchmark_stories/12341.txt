Momma and Daddy said, "We are going to get a fragile new toy for you and your siblings, and we will play with it together!"
The three year old was so happy that they cheered and cheered. Momma and Daddy said, "Let's go find something special to celebrate!" So, off they went to celebrate with a fragile new toy.
