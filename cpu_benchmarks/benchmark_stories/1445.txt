One day, a little girl named Sarah wanted to take her puppy to the veterinarian. She promised her puppy that it was going to be fun.
The veterinarian was really nice, and he promised Sarah he would take good care of her puppy. He said it would be quick and cheap. 
The veterinarian checked if her puppy was healthy. He checked all of its eyes, ears and teeth. Everything looked good. 
The puppy was so happy everything was ok. Sarah promised to take better care of her pet and to take it to the veterinarian more often. 
The little girl and her puppy thanked the veterinarian for being so kind and for helping her puppy, and then they both left the clinic very happy.
