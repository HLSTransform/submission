Once upon a time, there was a big house with lots of rooms. A family of bears lived there. Mama bear, Papa bear and Baby bear. Baby bear liked to play hide and seek. One day, Baby bear went upstairs to hide. Mama bear called out, "Baby bear, where are you?" But Baby bear didn't answer. Mama bear looked everywhere but couldn't find Baby bear. She thought Baby bear was lying and hiding. Finally, she found Baby bear in a big closet. Baby bear giggled and said, "You found me!"
