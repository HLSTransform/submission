Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play with marbles. One day, he was playing with his favorite marble near a river. Suddenly, he slipped and the marble fell into the water. Timmy was very sad and didn't know what to do.
Just then, a kind man saw what happened and came to rescue Timmy's marble. He was very brave and jumped into the river to get it. Timmy was so happy and grateful. He thanked the man and went home to play with his marble again.
From that day on, Timmy was more careful and less clumsy when playing near the river. He knew that he had someone to rescue him and his marbles if anything ever went wrong.
