Tom and Lily were playing in the park with their dog, Spot. They liked to run, jump and slide on the grass and the swings. Spot liked to chase the birds and the squirrels. He was a very fast and funny dog.
One day, they saw a big and loud truck on the road. It was making a lot of smoke and noise. Tom and Lily were curious and wanted to see it closer. But Spot was scared of the truck. He barked and hid behind a tree. He did not want to go near the truck.
Tom and Lily tried to call Spot to come with them. They said, "Spot, Spot, come here. It is just a truck. It will not hurt you. Come and see." But Spot was stubborn. He did not listen to them. He stayed behind the tree and shook his tail.
Tom and Lily were worried about Spot. They did not want to leave him alone. They did not want him to be scared. They decided to go back to him and give him a hug. They said, "Spot, Spot, we love you. You are a good dog. You do not have to be scared. We are here with you."
Spot felt better when he heard their voices and felt their hugs. He wagged his tail and licked their faces. He was happy to have Tom and Lily as his friends. He was not scared of the truck anymore. He followed them to the other side of the park, where they played some more. They had a lot of fun.
