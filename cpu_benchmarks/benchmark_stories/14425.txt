Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Blink. Blink lived near a big fountain in the park. Every day, Blink would visit the fountain to drink water and play with his friends.
One day, Blink noticed that the fountain wasn't working like it used to. The water didn't come out in a regular way and it made Blink sad. Blink knew that the fountain made people happy and he wanted it to work properly again.
So, Blink decided to do something about it. He gathered his bird friends and they worked together to fix the fountain. They cleaned it and made sure the water flowed regularly again. When they were done, the fountain was beautiful and working perfectly.
People who passed by the fountain were happy and grateful to Blink and his friends. Blink learned that even small actions can make a big difference and that helping others can bring joy to everyone.
