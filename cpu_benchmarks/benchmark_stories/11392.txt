Once upon a time, there was a little boy. His name was Bob and he was three years old. One day, Bob wanted to build a tower. So he asked his mom to bring him some bricks. But his mom only had one brick, and it was different than the kind of brick Bob wanted.
"No, Mom, I need a different kind of brick!" shouted Bob.
His mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, Bob. I will find a different brick for you!"
So his mom searched all around her house for a different brick. Finally, she found it and brought it back to Bob. When he saw it, Bob was so happy. He immediately began to build his tower. When he was done, it was the tallest tower in the world!
From then on, Bob would always remember his mom and the special brick she had brought him.
