Sara and Tom are playing in the park. They like to slide and swing and run. Sara has a shiny key in her pocket. It is her mom's key to the house. She likes to hold it and pretend it is a magic key.
"Can I see your key?" Tom asks Sara.
"No, it is mine. You can't have it," Sara says.
"Please, just for a minute. I want to play with it too," Tom says.
"No, no, no. Go away," Sara says. She runs away from Tom.
Tom is angry. He runs after Sara. He wants to take the key from her. He catches up with her near the fence. He grabs her pocket and pulls it hard.
"Ow, ow, ow. Stop it, stop it, stop it," Sara cries. She tries to push Tom away.
But Tom is stronger. He takes the key out of her pocket. He laughs and runs away.
"Ha, ha, ha. I have the key now. You can't get it back," Tom says.
He sees a small door in the fence. It has a lock on it. He wonders what is behind the door. He puts the key in the lock and turns it. He hears a click. He opens the door.
Suddenly, a big, noisy dog jumps out of the door. It barks and growls and shows its teeth. It is very angry. It sees Tom and chases him.
"Help, help, help. Get it off me, get it off me, get it off me," Tom screams. He drops the key and runs away.
Sara hears Tom's scream. She sees the dog and the key. She picks up the key and runs to the door. She locks the door and keeps the key in her pocket.
She sees Tom hiding behind a tree. He is crying and shaking. He is very scared.
"Are you okay?" Sara asks Tom.
"No, I'm not okay. That dog was very mean. It almost bit me," Tom says.
"I'm sorry. That was not a nice thing to do. You should not have taken my key," Sara says.
"I'm sorry too. That was not a nice thing to do. You should have shared your key," Tom says.
They look at each other. They feel sorry for each other. They hug and say sorry.
"Can we be friends again?" Sara asks Tom.
"Yes, we can be friends again," Tom says.
They smile and hold hands. They go back to the slide and the swing and the run. They play and have fun. They share and care. They are happy.
