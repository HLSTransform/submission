Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved animals and had many pets. He had a dog, a cat, and a bird. Timmy liked to write stories about his pets. He would write about how his dog would chase his cat and how his bird would sing. Timmy's mom said he was reliable because he always took care of his pets. One day, Timmy wrote a story about a big animal that lived in the jungle. He showed it to his mom and she was so proud of him. Timmy loved to write stories and he loved his animals even more. The end.
