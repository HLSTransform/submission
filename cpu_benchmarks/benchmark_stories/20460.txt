Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Maddie. She was very serious, and loved wearing her special mask. It was pink and sparkly, and she wore it everywhere. 
One day, Maddie wanted to borrow her friend Sally's mask. Sally let her borrow it and Maddie was so happy! She wore it all over the playground. 
Maddie loved Sally's mask more than hers. She knew she had to give it back, but it was so hard to do. Finally, Maddie said goodbye and gave the mask back to Sally. 
She was sad to give it back, but Maddie knew it was the right thing to do. Sally was happy to get her mask back and Maddie kept being serious and wearing her special pink and sparkly mask. 
The end!
