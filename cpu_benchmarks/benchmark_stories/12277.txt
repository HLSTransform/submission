Jill was a wild 3 year old. She always liked to explore new places and try new things. One day, she saw a big ear on the ground. She picked it up and was so excited. "I will take this home," Jill said.
Jill went to show her mother what she had found. But when her mother saw the ear, she said, "Put it back where you found it, Jill! It doesn't belong to you."
Jill was angry and replied, "No! I want to keep it!" But her mother said, "No! You must remove it."
Jill was very angry and did not want to listen. She shouted back at her mother, "No! It is mine!" But then her mother said sternly, "Jill, you must remove the ear. Now!"
Jill understood that she had to do what her mother said. With a heavy heart, she removed the ear from her pocket and put it back on the ground. With one last look, she sighed and went inside.
