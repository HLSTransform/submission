Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars and trucks all day long. One day, Timmy's mommy told him that he needed to study for his big test at school. Timmy didn't want to study, he just wanted to play with his toys.
As Timmy was playing with his cars, he noticed a police car driving by. The police car was very smooth and shiny. Timmy thought it was the coolest thing he had ever seen. He ran outside to get a closer look at the cop car.
The police officer saw Timmy and stopped to say hello. "Hi there little buddy, what are you doing?" asked the cop. "I'm looking at your smooth car, it's so cool!" Timmy replied. The cop smiled and said, "Thanks, I have to go now. Be good and study hard for your test!" 
But Timmy didn't listen to the cop. He went back inside to play with his toys instead of studying. The next day at school, Timmy failed his test. He was very sad and wished he had listened to the cop. From that day on, Timmy promised to always study and listen to the wise words of the police officer.
