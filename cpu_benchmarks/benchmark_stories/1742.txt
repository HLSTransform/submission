Once upon a time, there was a boy. He was very sad because his toy was broken. The toy, a truck, was a wreck now. So he decided to sit in a nearby chair and think.
Then, he had an idea. He found a jar and opened it. He saw some sour berries inside! He put the berries in the truck's broken pieces and it started to work again!
The boy was so happy that he jumped up, whooping with joy! He picked up his toy and brought it to the playground. He sat in the sandbox and showed it to all his friends.
The truck was like new. His friends were impressed and the boy was so proud. He had fixed the wreck all by himself!
The End.
