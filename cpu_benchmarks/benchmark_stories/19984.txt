Tom and Lily were young friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a new boy sitting on a bench with a thick book. He looked sad and lonely.
"Who is he?" Lily asked Tom.
"I don't know. Maybe he is new here. Do you want to join him?" Tom said.
Lily nodded. They walked to the bench and said hello to the boy. His name was Sam and he liked to read about animals. He showed them his book and told them some facts.
"Wow, you know a lot!" Tom said.
"Can we be your friends?" Lily asked.
Sam smiled. He was happy to have someone to talk to. He said yes and they played together. They learned new things from each other and had fun.
The moral of the story is: You can make new friends by being kind and curious. Everyone has something to share and learn.
