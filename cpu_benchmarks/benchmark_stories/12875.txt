Once upon a time, there were two best friends called Bob and Jack. Bob was a 3-year-old child who was very curious and liked to explore new things.
One day, Bob and Jack were playing in the park when suddenly they saw a mysterious man. The man had a big bag and he told them he had a secret promise for them. 
 
Bob and Jack were so excited and asked the man what it was. He said, "If you accept my promise, you will have a very special surprise!" 
 
Bob and Jack accepted the promise immediately! The man opened his bag and gave them two colourful balloons. Bob was so happy to get a surprise!
 
Bob and Jack hugged each other and they thanked the man for his mysterious promise. They started playing with the colourful balloons and had a lot of fun!
