Once upon a time, there was a shy little bunny named Benny. Benny was always afraid to try new things and make new friends. One day, Benny saw all the other animals playing outside in the rain. They were wearing their rain gear and having so much fun.
Benny wanted to join in, but he was too shy to ask. He watched from his window as the rain poured down. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew his window open and the rain came pouring in. Benny was scared at first, but then he realized how refreshing the rain felt on his fur.
He put on his rain gear and ran outside to join the other animals. They welcomed him with open arms and Benny realized that it was okay to be shy sometimes, but it's important to try new things and make new friends. From that day on, Benny was never too shy to join in on the fun, even in the rain.
