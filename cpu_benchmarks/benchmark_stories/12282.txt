Once upon a time, there was a jolly farmer who had a big basket. Every day he would fill it with eggs to take to town to sell. 
One day, the farmer decided to take a different way to town. As he walked, he noticed a big tree with lots of oranges. He reached up to grab one and his basket fell off, with all the eggs inside. 
The farmer was so sad and he started to cry. Then he heard a voice coming from behind the tree. 
"Why are you so sad?" said the voice. 
"I was taking eggs to sell in town. But I dropped them all and now I don't have any to sell!" the farmer replied.
"Don't be sad!" said the voice. 
The farmer peered around the tree and saw a jolly little elf. 
"I can help‚Äù said the elf. 
He took the farmer's basket and filled it with oranges. Then he smiled and said "Throw it over your shoulder, and you can take these to town to sell!" 
The farmer was so happy that he hugged the elf. Then he threw the basket over his shoulder and went off to town with a smile on his face.
