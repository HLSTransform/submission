Lily and Tom went to the farm with Mom and Dad. They saw many animals there. They saw pigs, chickens, horses and cows. Lily liked the cows best. They were big and brown and had soft noses.
"Can I pet a cow, Mom?" Lily asked.
"Sure, honey, but be careful. They are very big and strong. And don't go near their horns. They might hurt you," Mom said.
Lily and Tom walked to the fence where the cows were eating grass. One cow came close to them and looked at them with big eyes. Lily reached out her hand and touched the cow's nose. It felt wet and warm.
"Hello, cow. You are very nice. What is your name?" Lily said.
The cow did not say anything. It just made a sound like "moo". Then it bowed its head and licked Lily's hand with its tongue. Lily giggled.
"Wow, the cow likes you, Lily. It gave you a kiss," Tom said.
Lily smiled. She liked the cow too. She gave it a hug and said, "Thank you, cow. You are my friend."
The cow mooed again and nodded its head. It was happy to have a friend.
But then Lily felt something hot on her head. She looked up and saw the sun. It was very bright and hot. She felt sweat on her face.
"Mom, I'm hot. Can we go inside?" Lily asked.
"Sure, honey. Let's go. Say goodbye to the cow," Mom said.
Lily and Tom waved to the cow and said, "Bye, cow. We will come back soon."
The cow waved its tail and said, "Moo, moo. Bye, Lily. Bye, Tom."
Lily and Tom followed Mom and Dad to the farmhouse. They drank some cold water and ate some cookies. They had a fun day at the farm. They liked the animals, especially the cow. They hoped to see it again.
