Once upon a time, there were two friends, Harry and Joey. One day, they decided to go to the park to play. Joey carried a bucket with him, and Harry had a powerful toy truck. 
They played for a long time, racing the truck and making sandcastles with the bucket. But soon, they had an argument about who was going to play with the truck and the bucket. Joey wanted the truck and Harry wanted the bucket. They both wanted to be the one with the powerful toy, and neither would back down. 
Then, Harry had an idea. He said that both of them could play with the truck and the bucket, by taking turns each time. Joey was a bit hesitant, but he finally decided to give it a try. They both smiled, and had a lot of fun taking turns with the truck and the bucket.
