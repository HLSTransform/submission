Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their toy cars and trucks. They liked to make noises and pretend they were driving on the road. They saw a big crane near the park. It was lifting heavy things and putting them on a building.
"Wow, look at that crane!" Ben said. "It is so mighty and strong. It can lift anything!"
"I want to see it closer!" Lily said. "Let's go there and introduce ourselves to the crane driver. Maybe he will let us ride the crane!"
Ben and Lily ran towards the crane, but they did not see a sign that said "Keep Out". It was a dangerous place to go. The crane driver saw them and shouted.
"Hey, kids, stop! You can't come here! It is not safe for you! Go back to the park!"
Ben and Lily were scared and confused. They did not understand why the crane driver was angry. They thought he would be friendly and let them play with the crane.
"But we just want to say hello and see the crane!" Lily said.
"Sorry, kids, but you can't. The crane is not a toy. It is a tool for work. It can hurt you if you get too close. Please, go back to the park and play with your own toys. I have to finish my job here." The crane driver said.
Ben and Lily felt sad and disappointed. They wanted to see the mighty crane, but they also did not want to get hurt or make the crane driver mad. They decided to listen to him and go back to the park.
"Maybe we can come back another day and see the crane again." Ben said.
"Maybe. But we have to be careful and follow the rules. The crane is not for us. It is for the workers." Lily said.
They went back to the park and played with their toy cars and trucks. They still liked to make noises and pretend they were driving on the road. But they also looked at the crane from afar and wondered what it was like to ride it.
