Once upon a time, there was a hungry bear. He was feeling so hungry he had almost forgotten his own name. He looked around and he saw a glass on the floor. He reached out for it and took a big sip. It was the most bitter drink he had ever tasted. 
He was so angry that he roared: "Who made this glass so bitter?". Just then a little rabbit hopped by. He stopped jumping and he said: "Oh, that was me! I made the glass bitter. I don't forget easily". 
The bear was so surprised that he forgot all about his hunger. He told the rabbit he had never tasted anything as horrible as that glass of drink. The rabbit said sorry and promised to never make anything so bitter again. 
The bear and the rabbit became friends. Whenever the bear wanted a drink, the rabbit remembered to only make drinks that were sweet and tasty.
