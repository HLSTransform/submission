Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and make things. One day, she decided to design a special picture for her mommy's birthday.
Lily's daddy asked, "How much do you think it will cost to make this picture?"
Lily replied, "It will not cost anything, Daddy. I am making it with my own crayons and paper."
Daddy was proud of Lily's creativity and did not want to make her feel ashamed for not knowing the price of things.
He said, "That's wonderful, Lily. I can't wait to see your special picture for Mommy!"
