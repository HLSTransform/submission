Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean up his room. Timmy didn't want to clean up his toys because he was tired from playing all day. 
Timmy's mom said, "If you clean up your toys, I will give you a surprise." Timmy got excited and started to clean up his room. While he was cleaning, he found an old toy car that he forgot about. Timmy was happy to find the toy car in his junk pile.
After Timmy finished cleaning up his room, his mom gave him the surprise. She gave him a big piece of chocolate cake. Timmy was so happy that he rubbed his tummy and said, "Yummy!" From that day on, Timmy learned that cleaning up his room would make him happy and he would find cool things in his junk pile.
