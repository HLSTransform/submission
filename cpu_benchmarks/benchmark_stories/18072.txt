Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play dress-up. One day, she saw a big, shiny mask in a store window and wanted it very much. She asked her mommy if she could have it, but her mommy said no because it was too expensive.
Lily was sad and didn't know what to do. She decided to invite her friend Timmy over to play. When Timmy arrived, Lily showed him the mask and told him how much she wanted it. Timmy had an idea and said, "Let's make our own masks!"
Lily was excited and they spent the whole day making masks out of paper and glitter. They had so much fun and forgot all about the big, expensive mask in the store window. When it was time for Timmy to go home, he said, "I had so much fun today. Thanks for inviting me over, Lily."
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you for helping me make my own mask. I don't need the big, expensive one anymore." And they both lived happily ever after, playing dress-up and making masks together.
