Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved taking photos with his camera. One day, he went to the park with his mom and dad. Timmy saw a cool bird and wanted to take a photo of it. He asked his dad to help him take the photo.
"Dad, can you help me take a photo of that cool bird?" Timmy shouted.
"Sure, Timmy. Let's go closer to the bird," said his dad.
When they got closer, the bird flew away. Timmy was sad and disappointed. But then, his mom showed him a photo of the same bird she took before they got there. Timmy was happy again and thanked his mom for the cool photo.
