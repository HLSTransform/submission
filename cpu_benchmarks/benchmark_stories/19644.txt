Once there was a little girl named Jenny. She was three years old and loved cherries. She wanted to try a daring thing and thought if she ate a cherry off the highest tree she could.
So Jenny went to the orchard and found the highest tree she could. She was a brave girl and she dared to climb it all the way to the top.
When she got to the top, the cherries were so noisy. They were singing and shouting, making a lot of noise. Jenny was scared, but she was brave and she dared to reach out and pick the biggest cherry on the tree.
She held it in her hands and was so proud of herself for doing such a daring thing! She ate the cherry with a big smile on her face, and then went home, happy she had dared to do something so brave.
