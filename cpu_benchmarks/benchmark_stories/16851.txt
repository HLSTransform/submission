Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the forest near her house. One day, she went on a trail and found a big puddle. 
Lily said, "I want to jump in the puddle, but I don't want to get wet!"
Her friend, a talking squirrel, said, "Why don't you soak your feet in the puddle? That way, you won't get too wet!"
Lily thought that was a great idea. She took off her shoes and socks and soaked her feet in the puddle. It felt cold and squishy, but also fun! 
From that day on, Lily and her squirrel friend would go on many adventures together. They would always find new trails to explore and new puddles to soak their feet in.
