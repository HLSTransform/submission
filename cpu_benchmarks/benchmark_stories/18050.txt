Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved playing with his toys, but he wanted to play with something new. So, he went to his mom and asked her if she had any new toys. His mom replied, "Yes, I have some great equipment for you to play with."
Timmy was very excited and asked his mom to show him the equipment. His mom took him to the basement and showed him a big box filled with different tools and gadgets. Timmy was amazed and couldn't wait to play with them.
He spent the whole day playing with the equipment and had so much fun. He even made a robot using some of the tools. When his dad came home from work, Timmy showed him what he had made. His dad was very impressed and said, "Wow, Timmy, that's great! You're so creative." Timmy was very happy and proud of himself for making something so cool.
