Once there was a small dog named Sandy. Sandy was very curious. One day, Sandy was out for a walk and he saw a fat cat. Sandy decided to follow the cat. Everywhere the fat cat went, Sandy followed.
The fat cat stopped in front of a big house and went inside. Sandy followed the cat until they both reached the kitchen. Sandy was very excited and wanted to see what was inside.
Inside, the fat cat was eating a big steak. Sandy's mouth watered as he watched the cat eat.
 Suddenly, the cat said, "Come here, Sandy. You can have the rest of my steak. I'm too fat to finish it."
Sandy was so happy he began to eat the steak right away. He enjoyed it very much and thanked the fat cat for sharing. 
From that day forward, Sandy and the fat cat became good friends. Everywhere the fat cat went, Sandy followed.
