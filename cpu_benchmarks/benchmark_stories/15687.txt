Once there was a rich man who had a daughter. Her name was Tammy and she was three years old. Tammy's dad wanted to make sure she was always safe, so he bought her a special gift. 
He brought her a wire fence to surround her garden. It was a long, sturdy fence that would keep Tammy safe when she wanted to play outside. 
When Tammy saw the fence, she asked her dad what it was for. He smiled and said, "It's to promise you will always be safe." 
Tammy was so excited that she hugged her dad tight. Then, she asked, "Will the fence always keep me safe, Daddy?" 
Her dad hugged her back and replied, "Yes, Tammy, the fence will always promise to keep you safe." 
Tammy smiled with joy and ran outside to check out her wire fence. She said goodbye to her dad and waved as she went outside. From then on, Tammy was always excited to play in her garden because she knew the fence would promise to keep her safe.
