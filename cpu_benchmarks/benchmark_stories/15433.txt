Once upon a time, there was a wild animal. He liked to hop around the forest. He hopped through the trees, over rocks, and through meadows. The wild animal hopped very high in the sky. He hopped and hopped and hopped until he became tired. 
He stopped to rest on a big rock in the middle of the forest. While he was resting, he heard a noise. A little animal was hopping towards him. She was hopping very fast. Soon, the two animals were hopping together. They hopped and hopped, until they were laughing. The wild animal and the little animal became friends. 
They hopped around the forest together, enjoying the day. Suddenly, the wild animal saw something in the bushes. He hopped towards it, and found a large bowl of food. He shared it with his new friend. The animals enjoyed the food, before hopping away.
They spent the day playing and hopping together. The wild animal was so happy to have a new friend. He thanked the little animal for being his friend. Then, the two animals hopped away, off into the wild.
