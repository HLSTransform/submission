One day, after many months of trying, the family reached the top of the mountain. It was a hard journey, but they had finally succeeded! Everyone was so happy that they danced and laughed with joy.
The family had kept believing that they would succeed, no matter what. They kept going, even when it seemed impossible. They worked together, and in the end they did what they set out to do - they succeeded! 
From that day on, the family was known as the fiercest around. Everyone was so proud of them, they just knew they could succeed no matter what. 
And they lived happily ever after.
