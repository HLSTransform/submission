Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with clay. He would make all sorts of things with it, like animals and cars. One day, Timmy was playing with his clay when he accidentally dropped it on the ground. 
Timmy felt sad because his clay was ruined. But his mom told him not to worry because they could buy more clay at the store. When they got to the store, Timmy saw that there were many different types of clay. Some were regular and some were special. Timmy decided to get the regular clay because it was his favorite. 
When Timmy got home, he started playing with his new clay. He was very careful not to drop it this time. Timmy made a big castle and was very proud of himself. He showed his mom and she was very impressed. Timmy was happy because he had made something great with his regular clay.
