Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Kayla. She was three years old and loved to explore the world around her.
One day, Kayla was in the garden playing with some flowers when she saw something strange. What she saw made her eyes grow wide with fear - it was a monster!
Kayla was scared and started to cry. The monster grumbled and stepped towards her in a very harsh way. She tried to run away, but the monster was too fast. It growled and looked very angry.
Just then, Kayla's mom came running out of the house. She asked the monster what it wanted. The monster didn't answer. Kayla's mom then asked it to leave her daughter alone.
The monster hesitated for a moment, but then stepped back and left. The harsh monster had been defeated by Kayla's mom.
Kayla was so happy and hugged her mom. She was very grateful that her mom had kept her safe from the growling monster. From that day forward, Kayla was always careful to stay close to her mom when she played outside.
