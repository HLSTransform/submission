Tom and Lucy were very happy. They had a beautiful baby and everything was going great. One day, Tom and Lucy were taking a walk with their baby when a strange man appeared. He looked very angry and said he wanted to take their baby away. Tom and Lucy were very scared, but they refused to give the baby away. They both stood tall and shouted "No!"
Tom was not going to let anyone take his baby away. He came up with a plan. He said to the strange man, "If you can beat me in a race around the block, you can have the baby". The strange man smiled and accepted the challenge.
Tom and the strange man ran around the block. After a few minutes, Tom appeared, panting and beaming. He had been successful! His heart leapt for joy. The strange man had given up after a few turns and left, never to be seen again.
Tom and Lucy hugged their baby and felt relieved. They had their beautiful baby safe and sound, and they knew they could handle anything. Tom and Lucy were successful!
