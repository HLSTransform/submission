Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play in the mud. He would get filthy from his head to his toes. One day, Tim had a big idea. He wanted to cook mud pies for his friends.
Tim's friends came to play. He showed them the mud pies he cooked. But his friends did not want to eat the mud pies. They said, "Yuck! We can't eat mud, Tim!" Tim felt sad. He wanted his friends to like his mud pies.
Tim's mom saw him feeling sad. She had an idea. She helped Tim cook real pies with fruit inside. Tim and his friends ate the yummy pies. They were all happy. And from that day on, Tim learned to cook real pies, not mud pies.
