Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they want to visit the zoo. They ask their moms to take them.
The moms say yes. They drive to the zoo. It is very hot. The sun is bright. Tom and Sue are thirsty. They see a stand with drinks. They ask their moms for money.
The moms give them money. Tom and Sue buy drinks. Tom chooses a lemonade. Sue chooses a soda. They drink their drinks. Tom makes a face. His drink is sour. He does not like it. He says, "Yuck! This is bad!"
Sue laughs. She says, "Mine is good. Try it." She gives her drink to Tom. Tom takes a sip. He spits it out. His drink is sour too. He says, "This is worse! What is wrong with these drinks?"
They look at the stand. They see a sign. It says, "Sour drinks for a sour day. Only 50 cents." They realize they have been tricked. They are angry. They want their money back.
They go to the stand. They see a man. He is smiling. He has a lot of money. He says, "Hello, kids. Did you enjoy your drinks?"
Tom and Sue say, "No! They are sour. They are bad. We want our money back!"
The man says, "Sorry, kids. No refunds. You should have read the sign. It is a sour day. You need sour drinks. They are good for you."
Tom and Sue say, "No, they are not. They are awful. You are mean. You are a cheat!"
The man says, "Too bad. You can't do anything. Go away. Leave me alone."
Tom and Sue are sad. They are mad. They have no money. They have no drinks. They have no fun. They cry. They want to go home.
The moms hear them. They come to see what is wrong. They see the sign. They see the man. They see the drinks. They understand. They are sorry. They hug Tom and Sue. They say, "Don't worry, kids. We will find another stand. We will buy you good drinks. We will have fun at the zoo."
But Tom and Sue are not happy. They do not want to stay. They do not want to visit the zoo. They do not like the heat. They do not like the sour drinks. They do not like the man. They say, "No, thank you. We want to go home. We do not like this place. It is a bad place."
The moms are sad too. They say, "Okay, kids. We will go home. Maybe we can visit the zoo another day. A better day. A sweet day."
They drive away. They leave the zoo. They leave the man. They leave the sour drinks. They hope to forget this day. It is a bad day. A sour day.
