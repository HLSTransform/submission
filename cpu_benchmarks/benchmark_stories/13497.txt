Once upon a time, there was a funny man who liked to joke around. He wore a cozy bathrobe all day long because he thought it was very comfortable. One day, he went to the store to buy a new bathrobe. He saw many bathrobes, but only one was very attractive to him. He tried it on and it felt very soft. The man thought it was a joke that he found the perfect bathrobe so easily. From that day on, he wore his new attractive bathrobe all the time and continued to make people laugh with his jokes.
