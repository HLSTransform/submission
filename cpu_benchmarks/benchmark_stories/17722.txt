Once upon a time there was a bad little boy who didn't want to behave. He ate his dinner too quickly and shouted too loudly. His mommy and daddy were always telling him to be quiet but he didn't listen.
One day he decided to take a walk in the forest. As he was walking he began to wonder. He saw the bright and shiny trees, the bright and colourful birds, and the loud and chirpy animals. Everything about the forest made him feel happy and excited.
Suddenly his attention was drawn to something far away. It was a dull, grey rock. He walked over and touched it. It felt wet and slippery. He didn't know what it was or why it was in the forest. But he could feel a mystery and wonder coming from the rock. He knew he had to explore it! 
So he began to behave. He was very quiet and careful and slowly he uncovered the secret of the rock. He found out it was a magic rock and it could grant him any wish! Now he was very thankful he had behaved. 
The end.
