Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but her favorite toy was her train. She liked to watch the steam come out of the train's chimney.
One day, Lily's mom needed to iron her clothes. She turned on the iron and steam came out of it. Lily thought the steam was useful because it made her mom's clothes smooth and pretty.
Lily then went back to playing with her train. She wanted to make steam come out of the train like the iron. She blew on the train's chimney, but nothing happened. She then realized that the train needed water to make steam. She filled the train with water and soon enough, steam was coming out of the chimney. Lily was very happy because she got to see her train make steam just like the iron.
