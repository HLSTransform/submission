Once upon a time there were two best friends, a rhinoceros and a lion. The lion and the rhinoceros were very different, the lion had a mane and the rhinoceros had horns, but they would always have lots of fun together. 
One day they decided to go on a trip to explore the jungle. But while they were exploring they got lost and they couldn't find their way back. They both got very scared and started to argue. 
The lion said, “It’s all your fault that we’re lost. Do something to help us find our way back!”
The rhinoceros said, “No, it’s not my fault. You’re the one who said to go here in the first place!” 
The lion was so angry that he roared and chased after the rhinoceros. But just as the lion was about to strike the rhinoceros, he stopped and said, “I’m sorry. Please forgive me.”
The rhinoceros hugged the lion and said, “I forgive you, let’s never argue again. Let’s find our way home together as best friends.” 
So the lion and the rhinoceros worked together, and eventually they found their way back. From then on they never argued
