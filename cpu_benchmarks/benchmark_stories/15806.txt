Molly had a secret and she wanted to keep it all to herself. She had a piece of gum in her pocket and she was feeling so happy and excited.
Molly wanted to share the gum with her best friend, Sam, at school. But when the teacher saw them, he got angry. He said, 
"That gum is not allowed in the classroom! Put it away, now!" 
Molly felt embarrassed and put the gum away.
When it was time to go home, Molly whispered 
"Sam? I have to tell you a secret. I still have the gum in my pocket." 
"Really?" Sam said. "Let's go outside and share it."
The two friends went out behind the school and chewed the gum together while they talked and laughed. They both felt so happy and enjoyed their special secret.
