Lily and Ben like to play with blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes. They can build towers, houses, bridges and more. Sometimes they play together and sometimes they play alone.
One day, Lily and Ben decide to build a big wall with all their blocks. They gather all the blocks from their toy box and the floor. They put them in a big pile. Then they start to stack them up, one by one, to make a wall. They make the wall as long as they can and as high as they can.
But then, their dog Spot comes in. Spot is a friendly dog, but he is also very curious and playful. He sees the wall and thinks it is a fun game. He runs towards the wall and jumps on it. The wall falls down with a loud crash. The blocks fly everywhere. Lily and Ben are sad and angry. They shout at Spot and tell him to go away.
Spot feels sorry and runs away. He hides under the bed. Lily and Ben look at the messy room. They see blocks on the floor, on the couch, on the table and even on the lamp. They sigh and start to pick up the blocks. They put them back in the toy box and the floor. They are tired and bored.
Then, they hear a whimper. They look under the bed and see Spot. He looks sad and scared. He wags his tail and licks their hands. Lily and Ben feel sorry for Spot. They know he did not mean to ruin their wall. He just wanted to play. They hug him and tell him they are not mad at him. They ask him if he wants to play with them.
Spot barks and wags his tail. He is happy. Lily and Ben are happy too. They decide to build something else with their blocks. Something that Spot can join. They gather some blocks and make a dog house. They put a blanket inside and invite Spot to go in. Spot goes in and snuggles in the blanket. He looks cozy and cute. Lily and Ben smile and pat him. They are proud of their dog house. They think it is better than a wall.
