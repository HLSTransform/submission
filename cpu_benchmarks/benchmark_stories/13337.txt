Once upon a time, there was a loyal dog named Spot. Spot lived with a nice girl named Lucy. They loved to play and have fun together.
One day, Lucy's mom asked her to go to the store to buy salt. Lucy took Spot with her. On their way, they met a big mean dog. The mean dog growled at Spot and Lucy. Spot wanted to protect Lucy, so he barked loudly at the mean dog.
"Go away, mean dog!" Lucy said. The mean dog listened to Lucy and went away. Spot and Lucy went to the store and bought the salt. They went back home and told Lucy's mom about their adventure. Lucy's mom was very proud of them, and they all lived happily ever after.
