Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Emily. She was only three years old and loved to wear bright jewelry. She had a bright blue bracelet which she wore everyday. 
One day, Emily was playing with her friends at the park and noticed that one of her friends had a beautiful pink bracelet. Emily wanted the same bracelet, but did not want to tell her friend. 
In the evening, Emily's mom noticed that Emily was looking for something. She asked Emily what she wanted and the little girl said, "I want the pretty pink bracelet my friend has."
Emily's mom smiled and said, "I'm sorry sweetheart, I don't have the money to buy you that bracelet." Emily started to cry and said, "But I hate my bracelet!" 
Her mom said, "Don't worry, one day you will have a beautiful collection of jewelry. For now, appreciate your blue bracelet. It's just as bright and special as your friend's pink bracelet." 
Emily smiled and hugged her mom. She realized that she didn't need to hate her blue bracelet. She loved it and hugged it tight.
