Once upon a time there was an old man. He used to be strong and full of energy, but now he was very weak. He used to love to play in the garden, but now it was too hard for him to move. 
The old man was very sad. He not only felt tired and lonely, but he suffered greatly. Every day he looked around and saw other people playing and having fun, but he couldn't do the same.
One day, the old man found a disgusting old bug. He was so surprised and scared by it, he said "Hello old creepy bug - why you here?"
The old bug said, "I suffer too, just like you. Look around, there is suffering everywhere. We must try to be kind to each other, even when it is hard." 
The old man was very thankful for the old bug's wise words. They said goodbye and the old man went away feeling much happier than before.
