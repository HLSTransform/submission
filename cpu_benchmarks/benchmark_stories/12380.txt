Once upon a time, there was a very lucky cat. His name was Golf. He was always so happy - no matter what happened.
One day, Golf decided he wanted to sing. He opened up his mouth and started to make sounds. They were loud and happy. All the other animals around him stopped to listen.
Golf sang and sang until he had finished. When he stopped, everyone clapped. Golf was so pleased with himself.
He hopped around the grass, singing and laughing. He had never felt so happy. All the other animals were also happy and joined him in singing.
They sang and danced until it was time to go home. Golf said goodbye and hopped off, still singing.
He knew he had been very lucky to have such a fun day.
