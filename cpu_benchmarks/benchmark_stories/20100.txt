Ben and Mia are playing in the garden. They have a spray bottle and a can of tuna. They want to make a surprise for their cat, Luna.
"Let's spray some water on the tuna and put it on the grass," Ben says. "Then Luna will smell it and come to eat it."
"OK, but we have to hide behind the tree," Mia says. "Or Luna will see us and run away."
They spray some water on the tuna and open the can. They put it on the grass and run to hide behind the tree. They wait and watch.
Soon, Luna comes out of the house. She sniffs the air and walks towards the tuna. She looks around and sees no one. She thinks it is her lucky day.
She starts to eat the tuna, but it is wet and cold. She does not like it. She makes a face and spits it out. She meows loudly.
Ben and Mia laugh. They think they are very clever. They come out of their hiding place and call Luna.
"Luna, Luna, come here! We have a joke for you!" they say.
But Luna is not happy. She feels tricked and angry. She hisses and runs away. She does not want to play with them.
Ben and Mia are sad. They did not mean to make Luna mad. They love their cat. They want to say sorry.
They go inside the house and look for Luna. They find her under the bed. They have a bowl of dry tuna and a toy mouse. They try to coax her out.
"Luna, Luna, we are sorry! We have a treat for you! And a toy! Please come out and play with us!" they say.
Luna peeks out from under the bed. She sees the bowl of tuna and the toy mouse. She smells them and feels curious. She thinks maybe Ben and Mia are not so bad after all.
She comes out of her hiding place and walks towards them. She rubs her head against their legs and purrs. She forgives them.
Ben and Mia are happy. They hug Luna and give her the tuna and the toy. They play with her and tell her she is a good and clever cat. They promise not to spray her again.
The end.
