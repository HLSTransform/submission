Once upon a time, a little girl named Lucy was eating her breakfast. She was eating toast with her parents. She looked out the window and saw a bird, chirping and hopping around the yard. 
"What kind of bird is that, Mommy?" asked Lucy.
"It's a robin!" her mom replied. "See how it marks the ground with its feet, as if it's looking for food?" 
Lucy nodded, and watched eagerly as the bird stopped and pecked at the ground. Then, it hopped away with a tiny worm in its mouth, much to the little girl's delight. Suddenly, a little idea sparked in Lucy's mind. 
The next morning, Lucy asked her parents for a piece of toast. After spreading it with butter and jam, she carried it outside and placed it on the ground. Then, she stepped away and waited. 
Soon, a robin arrived and began to mark the ground with its feet. Then it spotted the toast and flew over to it, pecking at it with delight. 
Lucy clapped her hands in delight as she watched the bird eat her little offering. From that day on, the little girl and the robin were good friends. Every morning, Lucy would put a piece of toast on the ground for her feathered friend.
