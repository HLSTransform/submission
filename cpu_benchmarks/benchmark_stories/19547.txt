Once upon a time there was a rich boy who loved to crawl. Every day he would crawl around his house and garden, exploring every single corner!
One day, he and his family were going on holiday to an airport. But first, they had to get there. So they got on an airplane, and took off into the air. The little boy loved looking down at the clouds below him.
Once they arrived at the airport, the boy couldn't wait to get off the airplane and crawl around. He raced around the airport, being careful not to bump into anyone. He discovered lots of exciting things, and most importantly, many places to hide!
At the end of the holiday, the boy was sad to leave the airport. But he looked forward to crawling around his cozy home once again the next day.
