Once there was a boy. His name was Bill. He wanted a melon. He saw one in a tree and he thought it looked so good. It was big and round and clear. So he stretched his arm up as high as he could and he jumped up to try and reach it.
But it was too high up and he couldn't get it.
He asked his dad to help. He said, "Dad, can you help me get the melon, please?"
His dad said no, it's too high up. You'll never be able to reach it.
So Bill was sad. He wanted the melon so much, but he couldn't get it.
