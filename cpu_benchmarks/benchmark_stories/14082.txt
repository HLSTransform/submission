Once there was a person who was very foolish. They thought they could do whatever they wanted without any consequences.
One day, the foolish person decided to cover a hole in a boat with their hands. It seemed like it would be an easy job, but before long the hole was full of water and the boat started to sink! 
The person quickly realised their mistake and started to cry. They had been so foolish to try and cover the hole with their hands instead of getting something to plug the hole properly. 
The person decided to never be so foolish again and started to think more before acting.
This story has a moral to it: it’s not wise to be too quick and careless when making decisions. It’s important to take time and think things through before taking action.
