Once there was a furry comet. It stayed in the sky night after night. One night, a boy named Jack looked out of his bedroom window and saw the comet. He was so excited! The comet was so big and furry. It made Jack smile.
He wanted to stay up and watch the furry comet, but he had been very tired all day, so his mom said he had to go to bed. Jack was so sad. He wanted to stay and watch the furry comet for just a few more minutes. But his mom said no.
Jack had an idea. He crept down the stairs very quietly and opened the front door. He ran outside and laid down in the grass. He saw the furry comet in the sky and smiled - he could stay out for just a few more minutes!
He laid there, looking up at the furry comet and its bright sparkly tail. Jack felt like he was the only one in the world watching it. He didn't want to ever go back inside. 
Finally, his mom called him back in. He went back inside, but he was still happy knowing he had gotten to stay and watch the furry comet just a little bit longer.
