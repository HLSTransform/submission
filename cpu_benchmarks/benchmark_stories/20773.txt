Max had big dreams of sails, waves, and adventure. He wanted to build a ship, climb aboard and sail away. But Max didn't have any building supplies.
He asked everyone he knew, but no one would help. Max felt very sad and frustrated.
But then he got an idea. He smiled and clapped his hands. He set off with a small bag.
Max spoke humbly to anyone who would listen. People were impressed by his ambition and they helped him to find the things he needed.
Soon enough, Max had gathered enough wood, nails and rope to build his own ship.
He worked hard and finally he had his ship complete. Max was so excited because he had succeeded.
Max invited all his friends to the beach and held a sail away party. They cheered and clapped as Max's ship slowly sailed away.
Max had done the impossible. He had worked hard and remained humble and, with a little help from his friends, he was living his dream.
