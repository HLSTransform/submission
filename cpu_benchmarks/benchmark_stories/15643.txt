The little girl was very frustrated. She had puzzles to match, but she couldn't seem to get them right.
"Mama," she said, looking up at her mother, "I can't do it!"
Mama smiled. "I understand, sweetheart," she said. "Let me help you."
She sat down and showed the little girl how to match the puzzle pieces. She took the pieces and put them together, making a big head.
The little girl smiled. She tried it with her own pieces and soon her puzzle was done.
"Look, Mama! I did it!"
Mama beamed. "I'm so proud of you," she said, giving her a hug.
The little girl was happy. She had done it! She had matched the head and now she could play with her new puzzle.
