The news said that a big party was going to happen! The tree was so happy, it started to dance and sing! Everyone around was so surprised to see the tree dance! Everyone laughed and danced with it. The ancient tree was so happy! The party went on for hours and hours until it was time for the tree to go to bed. Everyone said goodbye and thanked the tree for the wonderful day. The ancient tree knew it had enjoyed a very special day.
