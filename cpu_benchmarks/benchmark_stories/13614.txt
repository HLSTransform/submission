Sara and Tom were playing in their room. They had many toys and books, but they wanted to do something new. Sara had an idea.
"Let's dress up like mom and dad!" she said. "We can use their clothes and hats and shoes."
Tom liked the idea. He ran to their closet and found a big shirt and a tie. Sara found a dress and a scarf. They put on the clothes and looked at each other. They laughed.
"We look funny!" Tom said.
"Let's go to the kitchen and pretend to cook!" Sara said.
They went to the kitchen and saw a big oven. Mom had put a cake in the oven before she went to the store. She told them not to touch the oven, because it was very hot. But Sara and Tom did not remember.
Sara opened the oven and saw the cake. It smelled good. It had thick chocolate on top.
"Wow, look at the cake!" Sara said. "Can we have some?"
Tom nodded. He reached for the cake. But he did not see the oven mitts. He touched the cake pan with his hand. It was very hot. He screamed.
"Ow, ow, ow!" he cried. "It hurts!"
Sara was scared. She closed the oven and ran to Tom. She saw his hand was red and swollen.
"Tom, are you okay?" she asked. "We need to tell mom!"
They heard the door open. Mom came back from the store. She heard Tom crying and Sara calling. She ran to the kitchen and saw what happened.
"Oh, no!" she said. "What did you do?"
She took Tom to the sink and put his hand under cold water. She hugged him and Sara and said sorry.
"We were playing dress up and we wanted some cake," Sara said. "We forgot you said not to touch the oven."
Mom sighed. She was angry, but she was also glad they were not hurt more.
"I know you were playing, but you have to listen to me," she said. "The oven is very dangerous. You could have burned yourself badly. You have to be careful."
Sara and Tom nodded. They said sorry too. They learned their lesson. They did not play with the oven again. They waited for the cake to cool down and then mom gave them a slice. It was still good. They said thank you and hugged mom. They loved her. She loved them too.
