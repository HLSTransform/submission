"Time to go outside!" said Mom. Little Robbie nodded eagerly and put on his sneakers. He reached for the staff and headed out the door.
In the backyard, he waved the staff around like a sword. He was fit and strong, ready to fight! He shouted, "I am the master!"
Just then, a fierce gust of wind blew in. The staff flew out of his hands, spinning through the air. Robbie yelled and tried to catch it, but it was too late.
The wind did not stop and the staff landed in the pond. Robbie's face went pale. The staff was stuck and he could not reach it. 
He ran inside to get help, but no one was home. Robbie collapsed on the floor and began to cry. He was fit and strong but he could not end the battle. He had lost the staff forever.
