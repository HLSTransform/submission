Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Teddy. Teddy loved going on picnics with his friends in the forest. One day, while they were eating sandwiches and cookies, they heard a loud noise. It was their friend, the rabbit, who got stuck in a tree. Teddy knew he had to rescue him. 
Teddy was very flexible, so he climbed the tree to save the rabbit. The rabbit was very happy to be rescued and thanked Teddy. They all continued their picnic and had lots of fun. From that day on, Teddy became a hero in the forest and everyone wanted to be his friend.
