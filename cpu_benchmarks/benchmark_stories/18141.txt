Once upon a time, in a big sea, there was a little fish named Fin. Fin liked to swim around and find new friends. One day, Fin saw something new. It was a jellyfish. Fin was excited to meet the jellyfish.
Fin said "Hi" to the jellyfish, but the jellyfish did not say anything back. Fin thought the jellyfish was rude. Fin was sad and swam away. He told his friends about the rude jellyfish. His friends told him that jellyfish cannot talk.
The next day, Fin went back to the jellyfish. He wanted to be friends, even if the jellyfish could not talk. Fin swam around the jellyfish and played. Soon, other sea friends came to play too. They all had fun together. In the end, Fin was happy he could find a new friend, even if they could not talk.
