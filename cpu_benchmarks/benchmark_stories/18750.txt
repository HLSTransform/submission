Tom and Mia like to play pretend. They have a big box that they use as a van. They take turns to be the driver and the passenger. They make noises like a van and go to different places.
One day, they pretend to go to the zoo. Tom is the driver and Mia is the passenger. Tom says, "Look, there is a lion. It is big and yellow. It roars like this: Rrrrr!" Mia says, "Wow, the lion is scary. I want to see the monkeys. They are funny and brown. They jump like this: Eee-ee-ee!"
Tom says, "OK, we will go to the monkeys next. But first, we have to pay for the ticket. The ticket man is here. He is green and has a hat. He says, 'Hello, welcome to the zoo. How many tickets do you want?'"
Mia says, "We want two tickets, please. How much are they?" Tom says, "They are five coins each. Here, I have ten coins. I will give them to you." He pretends to give the ticket man some coins.
The ticket man says, "Thank you. Here are your tickets. Have a nice day. Bye-bye." Tom says, "Bye-bye. Thank you. Come on, Mia. Let's go to the monkeys."
But Mia does not want to go. She says, "No, I want to be the driver now. You were the driver for too long. It is my turn." Tom says, "No, I am still the driver. You can be the driver later. We have to go to the monkeys now."
Mia gets angry. She says, "No, no, no. I want to be the driver now. Give me the wheel. Give it to me." She tries to grab the wheel from Tom. Tom gets angry too. He says, "No, no, no. I am the driver. You are the passenger. Let go of the wheel. Let go of it." He tries to push Mia away.
They start to fight. They pull and push and shout. The box van shakes and falls over. They both fall out of the box. They both cry. They both have boo-boos.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to see what is wrong. She sees Tom and Mia on the floor. She sees the box van broken. She says, "Oh, no. What happened? Why are you fighting? Why are you crying?"
Tom and Mia tell Mom what happened. They both say, "It is not fair. I want to be the driver. He/she does not let me." Mom says, "I see. You both want to be the driver. But you cannot be the driver at the same time. You have to share and take turns. That is how you play nicely. Do you understand?"
Tom and Mia nod. They say, "Yes, Mom. We understand. We are sorry. We will share and take turns." Mom says, "That is good. I am glad you are sorry. Now, give each other a hug and say sorry." Tom and Mia hug and say sorry. They feel better.
Mom says, "Now, do you want to fix the box van and play pretend again?" Tom and Mia say, "Yes, Mom. We want to play pretend again. We want to go to the zoo. We want to see the animals." Mom says, "OK, then. Let me help you fix the box van. Then you can go to the zoo. But remember, share and take turns. And have fun." Tom and Mia say, "OK, Mom. Thank you. We love you." Mom says, "I love you too. Now, let's go to the zoo."
