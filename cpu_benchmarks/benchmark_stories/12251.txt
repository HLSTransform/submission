Once upon a time, there was a man and a woman who lived in a cottage. The man was silly and always made funny faces. He was the only one who could feed the animals outside the cottage. 
One day, the man decided to make a special symbol for the animals. He made a funny sign full of bright colors. 
The man wanted to show the animals the symbol, so he whistled to get the animals' attention. He held up the symbol and said with a silly voice, "Share this and you can eat!" 
But the animals were scared of the symbol and started to run away! The man had accidentally scared them away and he did not fed them anymore. He was so silly and the animals never came back.
