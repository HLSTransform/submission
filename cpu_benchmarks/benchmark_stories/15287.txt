A family was driving in their car one day. It was an icy day and the roads were slippery.
The dad drove the car with care, but suddenly the car stopped. He got out of the car to check what was wrong and discovered that the engine was not working. He decided they needed to take the car to the auto shop for an operation.
The family got out of the car and took the bus to the auto shop. Everyone was very sad that the car had stopped. They wanted to arrive at the auto shop soon.
Finally, the bus arrived at the auto shop. The mechanic took the car and said he would do an operation to fix it. The family waited anxiously for the car to come back.
At last, the car arrived back at the auto shop. Everyone was very happy and the dad gave the mechanic a big thank you! The family climbed into their car and drove off, excited to be together again.
