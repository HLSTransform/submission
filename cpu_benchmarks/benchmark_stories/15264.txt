Once there was a little boy named Timmy. He was very young and curious. He wanted to try new things. So one day he grabbed his dad's brush. He wanted to mark on the walls like his dad did when he painted pictures.
So Timmy started using the brush to make marks on the wall. He was careful and gentle as he made more and more marks. But soon his dad came home and saw what he was doing. His dad was very angry and he said in a very rude voice: "Timmy, don't you dare! That's not how you use a brush!"
The dad was very stern and he made Timmy put the brush away. He then took a cloth and wiped the marks away. He told Timmy that it was not nice to make marks like that. That it was not polite.
Timmy was sad but also he was now sure of one thing. That is, he would always need to ask permission before using a brush. He would never make marks on the wall again, without asking his dad first.
