Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mommy said, "Lily, we will have a party today. Can you help me tidy up the room?" Lily said, "Yes, mommy. I will help you."
Lily and her mommy started to tidy up the room. They put the toys in the toy box and the books on the shelf. Suddenly, Lily's mommy said, "Lily, let's pause for a while and have some juice." Lily said, "Okay, mommy."
While they were having juice, Lily's mommy said, "Lily, can you help me make some cupcakes for the party?" Lily said, "Yes, mommy. I love cupcakes!" So, they started to make cupcakes together.
Later that day, Lily's friends came to the party. They played games and ate cupcakes. Lily's mommy was happy because the room was tidy and everyone had fun. Lily said, "Thank you, mommy. This was the best party ever!"
