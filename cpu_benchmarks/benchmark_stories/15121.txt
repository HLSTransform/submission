Once upon a time there was a little animal in the forest. The animal was sad because it had an ugly mark on its foot.
The animal thought, "I wish I could make it go away".
Then one day, an owl flew down and said, "I know what will help you. Go and find a bandage, and I will help you put it on your foot".
The animal was so happy. It went to the river and found a bandage, and the owl helped him put it on.
After the bandage was marked on the foot, it was soft and warm. And soon the mark disappeared.
The animal was so happy that it began to dance around. It thanked the owl, who said, "You are welcome. It's always nice to help a friend".
