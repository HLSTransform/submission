Once upon a time, there was a big mountain called a volcano. It was very hot and made fire come out of its top. One day, something happened and the volcano started to shake. The ground shook too and the people who lived nearby were scared.
A bossy bird named Sammy saw what happened and flew to warn everyone. "The volcano is going to erupt!" he squawked loudly. The people listened and quickly ran away to a safe place. 
Suddenly, the volcano exploded and hot lava flowed down its sides. The people were sad to see their homes destroyed, but they were happy they listened to Sammy and were safe. They thanked him for being a bossy bird and saving their lives.
