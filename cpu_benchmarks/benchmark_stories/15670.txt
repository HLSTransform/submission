Once upon a time, there was a cow who liked to slide. He had a thick coat that made it easy for him to slide.
One day the cow saw a hill and said to himself, "I must slide down that hill!" So, he ran to the top of the hill and slid all the way down.
"Woo-hoo!" he said.
But then he saw something. There was a little girl at the bottom of the hill that was watching him. He went up to her and said, "What do you think of my slide?"
The little girl smiled. "I think it was great! You were sliding so fast!"
The cow laughed. "Thanks! I love to slide."
And that's how the cow made a friend with the little girl. From then on, the cow and the little girl slid down the hill together.
