Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Emily. She was very hungry and wanted something to eat. Her mommy gave her a mint to make her feel better. Emily loved the mint and ate it quickly.
Later that day, Emily and her mommy went to the park. Emily saw a shiny red balloon and wanted to play with it. She asked her mommy to buy it for her, but her mommy said no. Emily was sad and started to cry.
Suddenly, a gust of wind blew the balloon towards Emily. She was so happy and grabbed the string to pull it towards her. But as she pulled, the balloon popped loudly and scared her. Emily cried even harder and her mommy hugged her tightly. From that day on, Emily learned to be careful when pulling things too hard.
