Once upon a time, there was a normal nest. It was nestled in a tree, far away in the forest. In it lived a mother bird and her babies. One day, the mother bird noticed that the nest was starting to rot. She called to her babies, "Come here my chicks, we must leave this nest. It isn't safe here anymore." 
The frightened chicks started to scurry around, trying to find a new place to live. However, the mother bird stopped them. "Wait, have faith. I have a plan. We will build a new nest. It will be better and stronger. We can do this together." 
The chicks had hope in their mother's words. So, they began to quickly make a nest from twigs and leaves. After they finished, they felt relieved and proud of their new home. It was stronger and more normal than their old nest. 
Sure enough, their new nest stood the test of time. The mother bird and her chicks were able to stay in their new nest, safe and sound.
