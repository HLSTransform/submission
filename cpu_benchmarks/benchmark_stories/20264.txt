Once upon a time, in a small home, there lived a little boy named Tim. Tim had a pet bird named Blue. Tim and Blue played together every day. One day, Tim saw a big, unknown bird outside. The unknown bird was very different and Tim wanted to play with it.
Tim opened the window to let the unknown bird in. But when the window opened, Blue flew away. Tim was very sad. He tried to catch Blue, but Blue was too fast. Tim wanted to release the unknown bird, but it did not want to leave.
The unknown bird stayed in Tim's home. Tim missed Blue very much. The unknown bird did not play with Tim like Blue did. Tim learned that sometimes new things are not always better. The unknown bird stayed, and Blue never came back.
