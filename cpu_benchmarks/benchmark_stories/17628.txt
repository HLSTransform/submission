Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to draw with his pen. He drew pictures of his family, his pets, and even his favorite foods. 
One day, Timmy's friend Bobby came over to play. Bobby wanted to draw too, but he didn't have a pen. Timmy had an idea. "I can separate my pens and give you one!" he said. Bobby was happy and said, "You are so smart, Timmy!" 
As they drew together, Timmy asked, "What are you drawing, Bobby?" Bobby replied, "I am drawing a picture of my house and my mommy and daddy." Timmy smiled and said, "That's a great idea! I will draw my house too." 
They drew and drew until it was time for Bobby to go home. Timmy said, "Let's keep our pictures safe and show them to each other next time you come over." Bobby agreed and said, "Thanks for sharing your pen with me, Timmy. You are a good friend."
