One day, a little girl named Lily went for a walk with her mommy. They saw a dog on the street. The dog was very sad. Lily asked her mommy why the dog was sad. Her mommy said that maybe the dog lost his toy or his owner. Lily wanted to help the dog. She asked her mommy if they can give the dog a treat. Her mommy said yes. They gave the dog a treat and the dog looked happy. Lily was happy too.
