Sara likes to write. She writes on paper, on walls, on books. She writes her name, her friends' names, and things she sees. Mommy and Daddy are not happy when she writes on walls and books. They say, "No, Sara, no! That is bad. Use paper only."
Sara wants to write a story. She thinks of a story about a flute. A flute is a thing you blow and make music. Sara likes music. She has a flute, but it is smelly. It is smelly because it is old and dirty. Sara does not like to play the smelly flute. She wants a new flute.
Sara writes her story on paper. She writes, "Once there was a girl who had a smelly flute. She did not like the smelly flute. She wanted a new flute. One day, she saw a fairy. The fairy said, 'I can give you a new flute, but you have to do something for me. You have to write me a song.' The girl said, 'OK, I can write you a song.' She wrote a song for the fairy. The fairy liked the song. She gave the girl a new flute. The new flute was shiny and pretty. It made beautiful music. The girl was happy. The end."
Sara shows her story to Mommy and Daddy. They are happy. They say, "Wow, Sara, you wrote a good story. You are a good writer. We are proud of you." They give Sara a hug and a kiss. They say, "But please, do not write on walls and books. Only on paper." Sara says, "OK, Mommy and Daddy. I will write on paper only." She smiles. She is happy. She plays her smelly flute. She thinks, "Maybe the fairy will come and give me a new flute." She hopes. She dreams.
