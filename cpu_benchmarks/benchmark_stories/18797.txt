Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big dog with a staff in its mouth. The staff was long and hard and had a shiny thing on the end. The dog looked happy and wagged its tail.
"Let's go and pet the dog!" Sam said. He ran towards the dog, but Tom stopped him.
"Wait, Sam! We don't know the dog. Maybe it is not kind. Maybe it will bite us. Mom always warns us to be careful with strange dogs." Tom said.
But Sam did not listen. He wanted to touch the staff and the shiny thing. He went closer and closer to the dog. The dog saw Sam and growled. It did not like Sam. It wanted to keep the staff for itself.
Tom was scared. He shouted, "Sam, come back! The dog is angry! It will hurt you!" He tried to pull Sam away, but it was too late. The dog bit Sam's hand and made him cry. The staff fell to the ground and the shiny thing broke. It was a glass ball that made rainbows in the sun.
Tom and Sam ran back to their mom. She saw Sam's hand and took him to the doctor. The doctor was kind and gave Sam a bandage and a sticker. He said Sam would be okay, but he had to be more careful next time.
Tom hugged Sam and said, "I'm sorry, Sam. I wish you had listened to me. I only wanted to warn you and keep you safe."
Sam nodded and said, "I'm sorry, Tom. I was silly and did not listen. You were right. The dog was not kind. The staff was not fun. The shiny thing was not worth it. Next time, I will listen to you and mom."
