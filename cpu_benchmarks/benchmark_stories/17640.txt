Once upon a time, there was a small bird. This bird liked to sit on a comfortable branch and stare at the world. The bird liked to look out at the seas, rivers and hills that could be seen from its comfortable spot.
One day, the bird noticed something strange and stared at it for a long time. It was a big fish swimming up the river! This made the bird stare in amazement.
The bird watched the fish swimming up the river until it eventually disappeared. The bird was very happy and went back to its comfortable branch.
The bird sat on the branch and stared out at the world. It was a happy bird as it looked out at the sky, trees and other animals. The bird never forgot the amazing fish it had seen and often thought about it while sat on the comfortable branch.
