Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She loved to dance. Mia danced in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. Dancing made her happy.
One day, Mia had a test at school. She was scared. But her mom told her, "Be honest and do your best." So Mia went to school with a smile.
Mia took the test and did her best. When she got home, she danced with joy. She was happy because she was honest and tried her best.
