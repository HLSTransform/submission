Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny was very small and loved to play in the garden. One day, Benny saw a big carrot and wanted to eat it. But, the carrot was too big for Benny to carry. So, Benny started to worry that he wouldn't be able to eat the carrot.
Suddenly, Benny saw a magic fairy. The fairy said, "Don't worry little bunny, I can help you." The fairy waved her wand and the carrot became small enough for Benny to carry. Benny was so happy! He thanked the fairy and ate the carrot. From that day on, Benny knew that he didn't have to worry because magic could make big things small.
