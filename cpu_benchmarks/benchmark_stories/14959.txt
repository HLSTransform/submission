Andy opened his eyes and saw the sun was shining brightly. He got up from his bed and went to the window. The bright light opened the door of his home and lit the carpet. He felt happy today and he took off his socks and ran out.
Andy went over to his mother who was sitting on the sofa. "Mom, I want to go outside and play", he said excitedly. His mom looked at him. "Andy, you know you can't go out like that", she said firmly. "You must first put your shoes on and then go outside".
Andy frowned. He felt embarrassed because he had forgotten to put on his shoes. He bowed his head. He was ashamed. He slowly walked to his bedroom and put on his shoes. When he came out, his mom smiled and said "Andy, you look so grown-up now". Andy smiled back.
Andy went outside and the sun was still shining. He felt the warmth on his body and enjoyed the beauty of the day. He lay down on the grass and watched the clouds slowly move across the sky. He smiled and screamed with joy. He felt so happy and free. 
Suddenly, he heard a voice. "Andy, come inside. Dinner is ready." Andy got up and walked back into his house. He knew that no matter how hard he tried, the sun would always shine.
