Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue liked to play with her yarn. She was an adventurous girl. One day, Sue saw her mom with a big box. Sue asked, "What's in the box?" Her mom just shrugged and smiled.
The next day, Sue went to play with her yarn. But she could not find it. She looked everywhere. Sue felt sad. She thought about the box her mom had. Maybe the yarn was in there.
Sue went to the box and opened it. Inside, she found her yarn and more! There were new toys and games. Sue was so happy. Her mom knew she loved yarn and got her a surprise. Now, Sue could be more adventurous with her new toys and her yarn.
