Lisa and Tom were twins who liked to play outside. One sunny day, they went to the park with their mom. They saw a big slide and ran to it. Lisa put on her sunglasses and said, "I'm going to slide first. I'm the coolest."
Tom wanted to slide too, but he waited for his turn. He said, "Okay, Lisa, but be careful. The slide is high and fast. And your sunglasses are delicate. They might break if you fall."
Lisa did not listen to Tom. She climbed up the ladder and sat on the slide. She shouted, "Whee!" and slid down. But she slid too fast and lost her balance. She fell off the slide and landed on the grass. Her sunglasses flew off her face and broke into pieces.
Lisa started to cry. She hurt her knee and her sunglasses were gone. She said, "Ow, ow, ow! My knee hurts and my sunglasses are broken. I'm not cool anymore."
Tom ran to Lisa and hugged her. He said, "I'm sorry, Lisa. Are you okay? Don't cry. I'll help you. Mom will put a band-aid on your knee and we can share my sunglasses. You're still cool to me."
Lisa smiled and said, "Thank you, Tom. You're a good brother. I'm sorry I was mean to you. I should have listened to you. You were right. The slide was high and fast. And my sunglasses were delicate. I learned my lesson."
Mom came and helped Lisa. She put a band-aid on her knee and gave her a kiss. She said, "I'm glad you're okay, Lisa. And I'm proud of you, Tom. You were kind and helpful to your sister. You both learned something today. It's important to be careful, to listen, and to share. Those are cool things to do."
Lisa and Tom nodded and hugged mom. They said, "We love you, mom. You're the coolest." They put on Tom's sunglasses and walked to the swings. They played together and had fun. They were happy.
