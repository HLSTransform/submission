Once upon a time, there was a big ranch with lots of animals. There was a cow, a horse, and a goat. They all lived together and were very happy. One day, the sun started to shine very bright and it was very hot outside. The animals were thirsty and needed water, but the ranch didn't have any water left.
The cow said, "I'm thirsty, we need to find some water!" The horse said, "I know where we can find some water, but we have to walk a long way." The goat said, "That sounds crazy, but we have to do it!"
So, they all started walking and walking until they found a big lake. They drank the water and were very happy. They walked back to the ranch and everything was okay again. They learned that when they work together, they can overcome any problem.
