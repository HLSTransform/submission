Once upon a time, in a big park, there was a happy little boy named Tim. Tim was very enthusiastic to play outside. He loved to run, jump, and laugh with his friends.
One sunny day, Tim went to the park with his mom. He saw the bright sun shining in the sky. He looked up and said, "Thank you, sun, for making it a warm and happy day!" Tim played with his friends all day long.
As the sun began to set, Tim knew it was time to go home. He waved goodbye to his friends and said, "Thank you, sun, for a fun day at the park!" With a big smile on his face, Tim walked home with his mom.
