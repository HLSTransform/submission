Katie was playing in the park with her friends. They loved playing all sorts of sports together. They went to the park every evening to play basketball, football and baseball.
One day, her friends brought a new sport to the park. They called it 'Panko' and it was very different from all the other sports. Instead of a ball, Panko uses blocks.
Katie was a bit scared at first and didn't understand the rules. One of her friends, Sarah, said: "It's okay Katie, you can join us. It's not so difficult - let's just try it, okay?"
Katie still wasn't sure if she wanted to try this new sport. But all her friends said they were having fun and assured her that she would too. So she accepted the invitation and joined them.
Katie found out that the game was really fun. She had a great time playing with Sarah and all the other friends. She was really happy that she accepted this new and different sport.
