Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy car. He would pull it all around the house and make it go fast. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play.
"Wow, Timmy! That car goes really fast!" said Billy.
"I know, I like to pull it hard," replied Timmy.
The two boys played with the car for hours, trying to make it go faster and faster. They raced it down the hallway and around the kitchen. Timmy was having so much fun, he didn't even notice when it was time for Billy to go home.
"Thanks for playing with me, Billy!" said Timmy.
"Thanks for letting me play with your cool car," said Billy.
Timmy was happy to have a friend to play with and he couldn't wait to pull his toy car around again tomorrow.
