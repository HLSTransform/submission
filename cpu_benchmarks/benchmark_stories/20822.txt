Molly and her dad had gone to town to buy some groceries. While they were crossing the street, they noticed a strange-looking vehicle parked on the side of the road. It had a pale yellow colour, and was very big.
Molly's dad stopped and said, "Molly, look at that vehicle! It looks like something we've never seen before!"
Molly squinted her eyes and said, "It's like a big box!" 
They both paused for a second and then continued across the street. They couldn't take their eyes off of the strange vehicle. As they walked past the car, Molly pointed to a big window on the side and said, "Look Daddy! It has a window!"
Molly's dad smiled and said, "Let's go home, Molly. It's time to go home". They both started walking home and as they did, they looked back at the pale, yellow vehicle and laughed.
