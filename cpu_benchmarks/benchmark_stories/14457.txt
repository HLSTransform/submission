One day, two friends were playing with a tank in the park. They were full of excitement, and glad to be together. Suddenly, the tank slipped from their hands and broke on the ground. 
The friends were very sad. They looked at the pieces of the tank and couldn't believe it had broken. They wanted to put it back together again. 
Just then, the friends heard a loud whirring sound coming from the sky above. It was a magical spaceship! It was coming closer and closer to the ground. 
The spaceship stopped right above the shattered pieces of the tank, and the magical being inside came out. The magical being told the friends, “I can help you put the tank back together with some magic. Would you like that?” 
The friends were filled with joy. They smiled and said, “Yes!” 
The magical being waved his wand, and suddenly, the tank was whole and perfect again! The friends were so glad and thanked the magical being for making their tank whole again. 
The magical being smiled and flew off into the sky. The two friends hugged each other and thanked their lucky stars that their tank was ok again!
