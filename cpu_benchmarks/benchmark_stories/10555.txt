Timmy was very excited when he woke up and realised it was a train day. He loved riding on the train and playing with his friends. Every day, he would take a comfortable seat and watch out of the window as the train moved along. 
Today, however, was different. When he got to the station, he couldn't find his mom. He looked around but she wasn't there. Timmy started to worry. Maybe she had forgotten about the train. 
Suddenly, he heard his mom shouting from behind him. She had been waiting but he hadn't seen her! "I'm so sorry, Timmy! I was so tired that I almost forgot about the train," she said. 
Timmy was relieved and gave his mom a big hug. They both got on the train and found a comfortable seat. They waved goodbye to the station as they set off on a wonderful journey. Despite the scare, they still had a great day on the train.
