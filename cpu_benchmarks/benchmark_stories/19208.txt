Once upon a time, there was a little bird who loved to fly. One day, the bird saw a big pool of water and wanted to dive in. So, the bird flew high up in the sky and then dove down into the water. It was so much fun!
After that, the bird saw a track and wanted to run on it. So, the bird ran and ran on the track. It was so much fun!
But then, the bird got sad because it couldn't fly anymore. It had hurt its wings when it dove into the water. The bird tried to fly again, but it couldn't. It was stuck on the ground.
The bird was very sad and didn't know what to do. It couldn't fly or run anymore. The end.
