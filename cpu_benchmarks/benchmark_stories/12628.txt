Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside in the sun. One day, she went to the park with her mom. It was very hot outside, but Lily didn't mind.
Lily saw a big slide and wanted to go down it. Her mom said she could, but only if she was careful. Lily climbed up the stairs to the top of the slide. She looked down and saw a bunch of kids waiting at the bottom. She felt excited and happy.
Lily started to slide down, but she went too fast. She couldn't stop herself and she hit a point on the slide. She cried out in pain. Her mom rushed over to help her. Lily's arm was broken. She had to go to the hospital and get a cast. From that day on, Lily always remembered to be careful when playing on hot days and to number her steps on the slide.
