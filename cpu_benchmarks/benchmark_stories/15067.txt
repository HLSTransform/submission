Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He loved to rub things. He rubbed the cats, his toys, and the walls. One day, he was rubbing something very fancy. He rubbed it until it sparkled and smelled yummy. His mom said, “Honey, that was steak. Let’s have steak for dinner.”
The little boy was so excited. He couldn’t believe that the fancy thing he had been rubbing was actually steak. He thought it was a toy or something else. His mom said, “Yes, honey, we can have steak for dinner.” He couldn’t wait for dinner time. 
When it was time for dinner, the little boy couldn’t believe his eyes. His mom had cooked the steak he had been rubbing. He had rubbed it with all his might and now it was a delicious looking steak on their table. He was so happy and ate it all. From that day on, he knew not to rub things he wasn’t supposed to.
