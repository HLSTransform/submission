Lily and Ben were bored. They had no toys to play with and no books to read. They looked around the room and saw nothing fun. Only a big wall with some pictures on it.
"Let's examine the wall," Lily said. "Maybe we can find something interesting."
"OK," Ben agreed. "But how do we examine it?"
Lily thought for a moment. She had an idea. She ran to the kitchen and came back with a stool and a magnifying glass.
"We can use this to see the wall better," she said. "You go first."
Ben climbed on the stool and held the magnifying glass to his eye. He looked at the wall closely. He saw some tiny dots of color and some lines and shapes. He saw a picture of a cat, a picture of a flower, and a picture of a car.
"Wow, this is cool," he said. "The wall has many things on it. Look, this is a cat. It has whiskers and a tail. And this is a flower. It has petals and a stem. And this is a car. It has wheels and a door."
Lily was curious. She wanted to see the wall too. She waited for Ben to finish and then took the stool and the magnifying glass. She looked at the wall carefully. She saw some more dots and lines and shapes. She saw a picture of a house, a picture of a star, and a picture of a bird.
"Wow, this is amazing," she said. "The wall has more things on it. Look, this is a house. It has a roof and a window. And this is a star. It has points and shines. And this is a bird. It has wings and a beak."
Lily and Ben were happy. They had found something fun to do. They examined the wall for a long time. They learned many new things. They forgot they were bored.
But there was someone who was not happy. It was their mom. She was watching them from the door. She was angry. She had painted the wall yesterday. She had spent a lot of time and money on it. She wanted the wall to look nice and clean. She did not want the wall to be examined.
"Hey, you two, stop that!" she shouted. "What are you doing to my wall? You are ruining it with your dirty fingers and your magnifying glass. Get down from there right now!"
Lily and Ben were scared. They dropped the magnifying glass and jumped off the stool. They ran to their mom and hugged her. They were sorry. They did not mean to make her mad. They just wanted to have some fun.
"We're sorry, mom," they said. "We were just examining the wall. We found many things on it. It's a beautiful wall. We like it."
Mom sighed. She was not really angry. She was just tired. She had worked hard on the wall. She wanted it to be perfect. But she also loved her children. She knew they were curious and creative. She knew they did not understand.
"It's OK, my loves," she said. "I'm glad you like the wall. But you can't examine it like that. You can look at it with your eyes, but not with your hands or your magnifying glass. You can damage it and make it dirty. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They understood. They did not want to damage or dirty the wall. They wanted to respect it and admire it.
"OK, mom," they said. "We won't examine the wall like that again. We'll just look at it with our eyes. We promise."
Mom smiled. She hugged them and kissed them. She was proud of them. They were good and smart children. She forgave them.
"Good," she said. "Now, how about we do something else? Something more fun and less messy. How about we read a story? Or play a game? Or make a snack?"
Lily and Ben cheered. They liked those ideas. They followed their mom to the living room. They left the wall behind. They had examined it enough. They had learned a lot. But they also learned a lesson. They learned to be careful and respectful. They learned to listen to their mom. They learned to have fun in other ways. They were not bored anymore. They were happy.
