Once there was a little girl named Lucy. She was 3 years old and loved to explore and play. One day, Lucy decided to go for a walk. As she was walking, she noticed a box beside the road. She decided to turn and look inside the box. Inside, she found a journal. She picked it up and opened it. 
The pages were filled with pictures and words. Lucy was so excited to see what was inside. She started to turn the pages and saw drawings of animals, buildings, and more. She felt busy exploring each page and admiring the artwork.
Lucy spent so much time admiring the journal that she forgot the time. When she looked up, the sun was going down. Lucy carefully put the journal back in the box and then she turned to go home. She went on her way, feeling happy to have discovered the journal.
