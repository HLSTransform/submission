Sara and Tom like to play in the park. They have a big board that they use to slide down the hill. They take turns to hold the board and run to the top of the hill. Then they sit on the board and slide down fast. They laugh and have fun.
One day, they see a small dog in the park. The dog is alone and looks sad. Sara and Tom want to pet the dog, but the dog is nervous. He runs away from them and goes to the pond. The pond has water and ducks. The dog sees a duck and barks. He jumps into the water and tries to catch the duck.
But the dog is not good at swimming. He sinks and splashes. He is scared and cries. Sara and Tom hear the dog and run to the pond. They see the dog in the water and want to help him. They look for something to rescue the dog. They see their board and have an idea.
They put the board in the water and push it to the dog. The dog sees the board and climbs on it. He is wet and cold, but he is safe. Sara and Tom pull the board to the shore and hug the dog. The dog licks their faces and wags his tail. He is happy and grateful. Sara and Tom are happy and proud. They have rescued the dog. They decide to take the dog home and ask their mom if they can keep him. They hope she will say yes. They love the dog and the dog loves them. They are friends.
