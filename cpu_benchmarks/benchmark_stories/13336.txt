Once upon a time, there was a cool frog. The frog loved to swim. Every day, he would swim in the pond near his home. He was very happy.
One day, the frog found a basket. He was very excited. He decided to take the basket to the pond with him. The frog put the basket on his back and jumped into the water.
The frog started to swim with the basket. But the basket was heavy. The frog tried to swim, but he could not. The frog was very sad. He could not swim with the basket. The frog got tired and could not swim anymore. The cool frog and the basket sank in the pond.
