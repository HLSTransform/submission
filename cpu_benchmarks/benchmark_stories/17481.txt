Lila was a clever girl who liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes and papers. She painted flowers and trees and animals and people. She was happy when she painted.
One day, she wanted to paint the sea. She had never seen the sea, but she heard stories from her dad. He said the sea was big and blue and had waves and fish and boats. Lila wanted to paint the sea like her dad.
She took a big paper and a blue paint. She dipped her brush in the paint and started to spread it on the paper. She spread and spread and spread. She wanted to make the sea as big as she could. But she did not notice that she was spreading the paint too much. She spread the paint on the table and on the floor and on the wall. She made a big mess.
Her mom came in and saw the mess. She was angry and sad. She said, "Lila, what have you done? You have ruined the table and the floor and the wall. You have wasted the paint and the paper. You have to clean up this mess right now."
Lila was sorry and scared. She said, "Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to paint the sea like dad. I wanted to make it big and blue and beautiful. I did not mean to make a mess."
Her mom sighed and hugged her. She said, "Lila, I know you are clever and you love to paint. But you have to be careful and respectful. You have to use the paint and the paper wisely. You have to protect the table and the floor and the wall. You have to think before you spread. The sea is big and blue and beautiful, but it is also powerful and dangerous. It can make waves and storms and floods. It can hurt people and animals and things. You have to respect the sea and learn from it."
Lila nodded and said, "Mom, I understand. I will be careful and respectful. I will use the paint and the paper wisely. I will protect the table and the floor and the wall. I will think before I spread. I will respect the sea and learn from it."
She helped her mom clean up the mess. She kept her painting of the sea. She looked at it and remembered her mom's words. She learned a lesson that day. She learned to be careful and respectful. She learned to think before she spread. She learned to respect the sea and learn from it. She was still a clever girl who liked to paint, but she was also a wise girl who liked to learn.
