Ben and Mia liked to play in the garden. They had a big pot that they filled with dirt and stones and seeds. They pretended it was their farm and they watered it every day.
One day, a big dog came into the garden. He saw the pot and thought it was a toy. He ran to it and knocked it over. The dirt and stones and seeds spilled out. The pot broke into pieces. Ben and Mia were very sad. They cried and shouted at the dog.
"Bad dog! Go away! You broke our farm!" Ben said.
"Sorry, sorry, sorry!" the dog said. He wagged his tail and licked their faces. He did not mean to be harsh. He just wanted to play.
Ben and Mia did not want to play with the dog. They wanted to restore their farm. They picked up the pieces of the pot and tried to put them together. But they could not. The pot was too broken.
"Maybe we can get a new pot," Mia said.
"Maybe we can use something else," Ben said.
They looked around the garden. They saw a big bucket. It was empty and clean. They decided to use it as their new pot. They filled it with dirt and stones and seeds. They watered it and put it in a sunny spot.
"Look, our farm is back!" Ben said.
"Yay, our farm is back!" Mia said.
They hugged each other and smiled. The dog watched them and smiled too. He was happy that they were happy. He hoped they would let him play with them someday. He wagged his tail and barked. He did not want to be harsh. He just wanted to be their friend.
