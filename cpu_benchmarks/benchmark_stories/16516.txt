Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She went to the park with her mom and dad. At the park, there was a big slide. Lily loved the slide and wanted to go on it. Her mom and dad said it was okay, but Lily had to be careful.
Lily climbed up the ladder to the top of the slide. She was so excited to slide down. But then, she saw another slide that looked even more fun. She had to choose which one to go on. She decided to go on the new slide.
But the new slide was not reliable. It broke when Lily went down it. She fell and hurt herself. Her mom and dad took her to the hospital. Lily learned that it is important to be careful and choose things that are safe.
