Once there was a happy little girl named Grace. Grace liked to learn new things every day. One day, her teacher offered her a quiz. She was a bit afraid, but she was determined to do her best.
Grace took the quiz and did very well. She was so proud of herself! Her teacher was very compassionate and praised her. They both smiled and hugged each other.
After the quiz was done, Grace's teacher offered her a special treat. She was so excited! She was given a big cookie and a glass of her favourite juice. She thanked her teacher and enjoyed her delicious snack. 
Grace was very thankful that her teacher was so compassionate and encouraging. She smiled and thought to herself how lucky she was to have such a wonderful teacher.
