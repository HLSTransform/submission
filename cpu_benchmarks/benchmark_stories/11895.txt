Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a little clock in her room that would tick-tock all day long. One day, Lily's mommy brought her a big box and told her to unpack it. Lily was very excited and opened the box. Inside, there were lots of little toys that made her very happy. She played with them all day and when it was time for bed, she looked at her little clock and fell asleep with a smile on her face.
