Once there was a family. They wanted to build something special. So Mom, Dad, and their little one went outside to build something cool.
When they got there, Mom and Dad said, “Let’s make a pool!”
Little one clapped and said, “Yay! I wanna help!”
Mom and Dad smiled and said, “Yes!”
They got to work. Mom and Dad moved big rocks and dug deep in the ground. Little one filled the pool with water from a hose.
When the pool was finished, little one jumped in. He said “I love our new pool! It’s so cool!”
Mom and Dad hugged each other and said, “We did it! We built something together!”
Little one splashed and laughed. They were so happy!
