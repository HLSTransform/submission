Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat cookies and cake every day, but her mommy always reminded her to eat healthy food too. One day, Lily went to a restaurant with her family. She ordered a big burger and fries, but her mommy said she had to eat some vegetables too. Lily didn't want to eat them, so she threw her napkin on the floor and said "no!".
Suddenly, Lily felt sick and her tummy hurt. Her mommy asked her what was wrong, but Lily didn't answer. She felt worse and worse until she had to go to the hospital. The doctor said that Lily's tummy was sick because she didn't eat healthy food. Lily felt sad and wished she had listened to her mommy. From then on, she promised to always eat her vegetables and be healthy.
