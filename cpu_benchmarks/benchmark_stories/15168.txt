Once upon a time, there was a furry cat. His name was Jerry. Every day, he enjoyed playing with his friends and asking them to borrow things.
One day, a hurricane came to town. It was very windy. Jerry and his friends had to stay inside. They were all scared. 
Fortunately, the hurricane passed quickly. The next day, the friends looked outside and saw that everything was okay. To celebrate, Jerry asked his friends to borrow their toys so they could play together. Everyone said yes, and they all had a great time.
When the day was over Jerry was so glad that everyone was safe. He was also glad that he was able to borrow his friendsâ€™ toys so that they could all have fun together. 
The end.
