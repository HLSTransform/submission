Once there were two friends, Jack and Jill. They decided to have a race. They started running and Jack was very fast, but Jill was faster. She was running so fast that she didn't see the tight turn at the end of the street. So, instead of turning, Jill kept running straight. She ended up going in reverse into a mint field.
Jack was so surprised. He ran after her, shouting out 'Jill, reverse!'. But Jill just kept going backwards and didn't stop.
Jack was getting very worried. He knew that Jill wouldn't be able to reverse out of the mint field by herself. So he ran back to his house and grabbed a rope. Then he ran back to Jill and tied one end of the rope around her waist and the other end around a tree.
He then yelled 'Reverse, Jill, reverse!' With a little bit of help from Jack, Jill managed to reverse herself out of the tight mint field. Finally they were both safe.
