Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toys and watch cartoons. One day, Timmy's mom asked him what he wanted for breakfast. Timmy had to choose between cereal or pancakes. He chose pancakes.
After breakfast, Timmy went outside to play. He saw a spaceship in the sky! Timmy was so excited and wanted to go to space. He asked his mom if he could go, but she said no. Timmy was worried that he would never get to go to space.
Later that day, Timmy's mom took him to the park. Timmy saw a boy playing with a toy spaceship. Timmy asked the boy if he could play with it too. The boy said no. Timmy was sad and went to play on the swings.
Suddenly, Timmy fell off the swing and hurt his arm. He had to go to the hospital. Timmy was scared and worried. At the hospital, the doctor said Timmy needed a cast on his arm. Timmy was sad because he couldn't play with his toys or go to space.
The end.
