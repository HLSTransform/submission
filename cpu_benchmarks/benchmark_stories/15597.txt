Ben and Mia are best friends. They like to play together every day. They have a lot of toys, but their favorite is a big box. They can make the box into anything they want. Sometimes it is a car, sometimes it is a house, sometimes it is a spaceship.
One day, they decide to make the box into a phone. They cut out a hole on one side and draw some buttons. They find a string and a can and make a ring. They tie the string to the can and the box. They put the can in another room and the box in their room.
"Let's call each other," Ben says. He picks up the box and presses a button. He puts the box to his ear and says, "Hello, Mia. This is Ben. Do you copy?"
Mia hears the ring in the can. She runs to the can and picks it up. She puts the can to her ear and says, "Hello, Ben. This is Mia. I copy. Over."
They giggle and talk to each other for a long time. They pretend they are spies, or astronauts, or doctors. They have a lot of fun with their box phone.
They love their box phone because it is dependable. It always works and it always makes them happy. They think it is the best toy ever. They are very proud of their box phone. They thank each other for being such good friends. They say goodbye and hang up.
They put the box and the can away and go to have a snack. They smile and hug. They can't wait to play with their box phone again. They are very happy. The end.
