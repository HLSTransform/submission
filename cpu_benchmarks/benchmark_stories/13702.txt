Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. One day, Timmy fell and hurt his leg. His mommy took him to the hospital. Timmy was upset because he didn't like going to the hospital. 
At the hospital, the doctor asked Timmy some questions. Timmy had to answer the questions so the doctor could help him. The doctor put a bandage on Timmy's leg and gave him a lollipop. Timmy felt better and wasn't upset anymore. 
When they got home, Timmy's mommy made him his favorite dinner. Timmy was happy and told his mommy all about his trip to the hospital. He was proud that he answered the doctor's questions. From that day on, Timmy wasn't afraid of going to the hospital anymore.
