Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. They had so much fun playing on the swings and the slide.
After a while, Lily got very tired and wanted to go home. Her friend asked her, "Why do you look so tired?" Lily replied, "I played a lot and now my face is red."
Her friend said, "Let's go home and take a nap." Lily agreed and they went home together. They fell asleep quickly and when they woke up, they were ready to play again. The end.
