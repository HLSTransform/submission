Once upon a time, there was a beautiful cat. She had a soft, shiny fur. She lived in a big house with a kind girl named Amy. Amy loved her cat very much.
One day, Amy and her cat went outside to play. They ran and jumped in the green grass. The sun was shining, and the birds were singing. While they were playing, Amy fell down and hurt her knee.
Amy sat down and began to cry. The beautiful cat saw Amy's knee and knew she was sad. So, the cat sat down next to Amy and stared at her knee. The cat wanted to make Amy feel better.
Amy saw the cat staring at her knee and smiled. She knew her cat cared about her. The cat's love made Amy's knee feel better. They played together all day, and Amy's knee was not hurt anymore. They were very happy and loved each other very much.
