Once there was a little girl named Abigail who loved to paint. She had a box full of paints and brushes to create all kinds of pictures.
One day she decided to paint a tiger. She was so excited to paint the animal she had only seen in books. She mixed the paints together, then carefully painted its stripes and eyes until it looked just right. It was so real it almost seemed to move!
But when Abigail was done, she was a little sad. It looked so lonely on the paper.
"How can I make it more fun? I know," she exclaimed.
Abigail grabbed her paints again and began to add something more. She painted a small tree with leaves and several playful birds around the tiger. All of a sudden, the tiger sprang to life!
Abigail smiled at her work. She had learned a valuable lesson that day. Helping things come alive was as simple as adding a bit of love and kindness.
