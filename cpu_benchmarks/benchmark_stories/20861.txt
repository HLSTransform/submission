Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to surprise her mom and dad. She thought to herself, "What can I give them?". Suddenly, she had an idea. 
The little girl skipped over to the kitchen and searched through the cupboards. Finally, she found a cookie and smiled. She knew it would be perfect. 
The little girl went back to her room. She carefully unwrapped the cookie and held it up with her own two hands. She then ran off to find her mom and dad. 
When she found them, she carefully said, "Mom, Dad, I have a present for you. It is a thoughtful cookie!"
Her mom and dad smiled. They thanked her and gave her a big hug. 
The little girl was so happy that she gave them another hug back. They then all shared the cookie together. It was delicious!
