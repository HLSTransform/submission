Once upon a time there was a nation of very obedient people. Everyone in the nation obeyed all the rules, every day.
One day, the ruler of the nation took a trip to a far away place. He asked the people of the nation to stay obedient while he was away. They all agreed.
The ruler left, and the people started to take care of their nation. They planted trees and cleaned the streets. 
But when the ruler came back from his trip, he saw something very surprising. There were beautiful flowers growing everywhere! He was so happy that the people had followed his instructions.
The ruler said, “Thank you for being so obedient. You have made our nation even more beautiful!”
