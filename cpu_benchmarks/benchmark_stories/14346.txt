Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was very kind to his friends and always shared his toys. One day, Timmy's mommy told him it was time to turn off the TV and go outside to play. Timmy didn't want to stop watching his favorite show, but he knew his mommy was right. So, he turned off the TV and went outside to play with his friends. They had lots of fun playing games and running around. When it was time to go back inside, Timmy felt happy that he had been kind to his friends and listened to his mommy. The end.
