Once there was a good deer who lived in a big forest. Every morning he would wake up early and act in lots of different ways. He would run around, jump over logs, and hop through the trees. He would even race against the birds who stopped to say hello.
The deer was so fast that even the strongest wind could not catch him! Then, one day, he saw a small stream by the edge of the forest. He decided to act differently. He slowly walked until he was in the middle of the stream. The cold water felt good on his feet.
The deer closed his eyes, listened to the sound of the water and took a nap. Suddenly, he was awoken by the sound of a strong wind. He opened his eyes, smiled and ran back home.
The good deer remembered how good it felt to be quiet. From then on, he was always happy and he acted like this whenever he was in the stream.
