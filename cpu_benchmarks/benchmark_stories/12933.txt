Once upon a time there was a little girl who was out playing in the park with her best friend. She was feeling very happy and so she wanted to hang from the monkey bars. The girl's friend said, "That looks hard! Are you sure you can do it?" But the little girl laughed and said, "Of course I can!"
So she reached up and tried to hang from the monkey bars, but she was too short to reach the bar. She was very disappointed, but she was determined. She reached up and carefully pressed a button on the side of the monkey bars and suddenly it began to move down.
The girl quickly grabbed the bar and hung from it with a big, happy smile on her face. But then something went wrong. The monkey bars started to move back up too quickly and the girl suddenly lost her grip as she was thrust back up into the air. She crashed to the ground with a thud and was left feeling very sad.
