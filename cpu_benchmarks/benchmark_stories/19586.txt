Once upon a time there was a nosy girl named Sally. She loved to look at the earth outside her window. Every morning Sally would wake up, look out the window and say hello to the big earth.
One day Sally was feeling extra nosy. She wanted to know the names of all the things she saw outside. Sally grabbed her walking stick and decided to go on an adventure to explore the world outside her window. 
As Sally walked around it was fun to hear all the different names of the things she was seeing. She learned the names of the birds in the sky, the flowers in the bushes and the trees in the forest. Sally was so excited to know all the names! 
When the day was done, Sally went back inside her house with a smile on her face. She had learned the names of many things on the earth and she couldn't wait to go on another nosy adventure.
