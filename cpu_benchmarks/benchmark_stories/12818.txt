Once upon a time there was a little girl called Ella. She was very lively and loved going on adventures.
One day, Ella decided to go on a journey. She packed her bag and said goodbye to her mummy.
Ella began her journey and it wasn't long before she met a friendly dragon.
The dragon asked Ella where she was going and why. Ella told the dragon that she wanted to have a lovely and lively adventure.
The dragon smiled and said "I will take you on an adventure like no other."
Ella was so excited and she said, "Yes please!"
The dragon then took Ella on the most wonderful and lively journey. They had the best time and Ella was so excited to tell her mummy all about the adventure when she returned home.
