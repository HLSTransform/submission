Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with chalk on the wide sidewalk outside her house. One day, her friend Jack came to play with her. Jack asked, "What are you drawing, Lily?" She shrugged and said, "I don't know yet." Jack said, "Can I draw with you?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, please!"
They drew together for a while, making wide circles and lines. Suddenly, Lily's chalk broke in half. She looked sad and said, "Oh no, my chalk is broken." Jack shrugged and said, "Don't worry, I have more chalk at my house." They ran to Jack's house and got more chalk. They came back and drew until the sun went down. Then they said goodbye, promising to draw again soon.
