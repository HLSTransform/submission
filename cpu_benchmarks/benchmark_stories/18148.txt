Once upon a time, there was a messy little boy named Tim. Tim liked to play in the snow. One day, he went outside to play with his friends. They made snowballs and threw them at each other. Tim was having so much fun.
While they were playing, Tim saw a big snowman. He wanted to pinch its nose. Tim thought it would be funny. He walked up to the snowman and pinched its nose very hard. But the snowman's nose was not soft. It was very cold and icy.
Tim's hand hurt a lot. He started to cry. His friends came to see what was wrong. They told Tim not to pinch the snowman's nose again. Tim's hand was very cold and red. He went home feeling sad. The snowman's nose was still there, but Tim learned not to pinch it again.
