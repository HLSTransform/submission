Once upon a time, there was a bird that lived in a tree with a strong branch. Every day he would wake up and work hard to find food for himself and his family. One day, he was flying around looking for food when he felt something strange. It was mild, like the sun on a hot day.
He looked around and noticed that the branch of his tree was bending and creaking. He tried to fly away, but it was too late. The branch broke and he fell to the ground.
He was so scared and in pain. He cried for help and begged for someone to help him. Suddenly, a little girl heard him and ran to help. She carefully picked up the bird and brought him back to the tree.
The bird thanked the little girl and promised to be more careful. He said, "Thank you for teaching me that no matter how strong it may seem, even the hardest of branches can break if we don't take care of them. We all have to work together to keep the world safe and healthy". The little girl nodded in agreement and ran off.
The bird kept his promise and kept an eye on the branch, to make sure it didn't break again. He learned a valuable lesson that day, one that could help other creatures too â€“ that we must work together to protect the world in which we live.
