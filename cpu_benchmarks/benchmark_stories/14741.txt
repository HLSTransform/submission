Lily and Ben were playing in the kitchen. They liked to pretend they were chefs and make food with the pots and pans. Lily saw the freezer and opened it. She saw a big tub of ice cream. She wanted some.
"Ben, look! Ice cream!" she yelled.
Ben ran over and saw the ice cream too. He wanted some as well.
"Can we have some, please?" he asked.
Lily nodded. She grabbed a spoon and scooped some ice cream. She put it in her mouth. It was very cold and bitter. She made a face and spat it out.
"Yuck! This is not ice cream!" she cried.
Ben looked at the tub. It said "Lemon Sorbet". He did not know what that meant. He thought it was ice cream too. He took a spoonful and tried it. He also felt the cold and bitter taste. He spit it out too.
"Yuck! This is not ice cream!" he agreed.
They threw the spoons in the sink and ran away from the freezer. They did not like lemon sorbet. They wanted real ice cream. They decided to play with something else. They hoped their mom would come home soon and give them some real ice cream. They liked sweet and creamy ice cream. Not cold and bitter ice cream.
