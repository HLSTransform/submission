Once upon a time, there was a girl. She had a very special cake. It was her birthday cake. She was very excited and wanted to show her friends. Her friends were very noisy when they saw the cake. Everyone cheered and clapped because it was so pretty. 
The girl decided to bury the cake in the backyard. She dug a deep hole and put the cake in it. She covered it with dirt and flowers. She said a special wish and then the cake was buried. Everyone was so happy. 
They all sang a song and danced in celebration. The girl was so proud of her special cake and everyone was very happy. In the end, everyone had a wonderful time.
