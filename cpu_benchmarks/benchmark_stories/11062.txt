Lily loved to read books. She had many books in her room. She liked to read about animals, and princesses, and cars. She read every day before bed.
One day, Lily saw a poster. It said there was a parade in the park. The parade had floats, and balloons, and music. Lily was eager to go. She asked her mom if they could go.
"Mom, can we go to the parade?" Lily said.
"Sorry, Lily, we can't go today. I have to work. Maybe next time," Mom said.
Lily was sad. She wanted to see the parade. She did not want to stay home. She cried.
Mom hugged Lily. She said, "I know you are sad, but I have an idea. Why don't you read a book about a parade? You can imagine you are there. You can see the floats, and the balloons, and the music in your mind."
Lily stopped crying. She thought about it. She said, "OK, Mom. I will read a book about a parade. Maybe it will be fun."
Mom smiled. She said, "Good girl. I will be back soon. I love you."
Lily went to her room. She found a book about a parade. She opened it. She saw pictures of floats, and balloons, and music. She read the words. She imagined she was there. She felt happy. She read until Mom came back.
