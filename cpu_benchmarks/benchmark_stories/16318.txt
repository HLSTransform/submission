Once upon a time, there was a dog named Spot. Spot loved to run and play in the park. One day, Spot's owner gave him a big, juicy steak for dinner. Spot thought it was brilliant! He ate every last bite and licked his lips.
After dinner, Spot went outside to play. He saw a squirrel and started to chase it. The squirrel ran up a tree and Spot tried to follow, but he couldn't climb that high. Spot was sad he couldn't catch the squirrel, but he didn't give up. He ran around the tree and marked it with his pee. That way, he knew he had been there and could come back to try again later.
