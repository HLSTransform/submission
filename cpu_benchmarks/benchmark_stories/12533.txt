Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a big box. Timmy was very happy and received the box with a big smile on his face.
Timmy opened the box and saw a huge teddy bear inside. He was so excited and hugged the teddy bear tightly. He played with the teddy bear all day long and had so much fun.
The result of Timmy receiving the box was a huge smile on his face and a new toy to play with. Timmy was very grateful for his new teddy bear and hugged it every night before going to sleep.
