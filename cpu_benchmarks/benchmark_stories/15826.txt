Once upon a time there was a tall bear called Ted. He was a very kind bear who loved to hug. One day, he decided to take a drive in his car. As he drove off, his car got a flat tire. Ted felt sad and on the verge of tears.
Just then, he heard a strange noise from nearby. As he looked around, he spotted a little fox. The fox was also sad because he had gotten a flat tire on his bike.
Ted smiled and said to the fox, "Don't feel sad, let me help you." So, Ted went over and hugged the fox. The fox gave him a big smile and thanked Ted for his help. Afterward, Ted took his spare tire and helped the fox fix his bike.
Once the tire was fixed, the fox gave Ted a big hug and said, "Thank you so much for helping me, Ted! You're the best!" Then the fox waved goodbye and drove off on his bike.
Ted smiled and waved goodbye. He loved helping others and giving hugs. Ted was a tall, kind bear and he loved to hug!
