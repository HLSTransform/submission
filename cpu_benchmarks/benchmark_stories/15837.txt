Once upon a time, two kids named Jack and Jill went to the harbor. It was a rare sunny day and the harbor was bustling with excitement.
"What should we do today?" asked Jack. Jill thought for a moment.
"Why don't we use these boats?" she suggested, pointing to the wooden boats in the harbor. Jack was so excited that he immediately jumped in.
"What do we do? How do these boats work?" he asked.
Jill laughed. "That's easy! You use the oars to move around in the water. Let me show you."
So, together, Jack and Jill used the boats and explored the harbor. They saw all sorts of sea creatures and rare birds, and played games with all of the other kids in the harbor. They had a wonderful time, so wonderful that they stayed in the harbor all day. 
When it was time to go home, Jack and Jill said goodbye to the harbor. They knew that their adventure was rare and special, and they would never forget it.
