Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to ride the subway with his mommy. One day, Timmy and his mommy got on the subway and sat down. Timmy saw a sad man who looked upset. Timmy's mommy explained that sometimes people feel upset and hope things will get better. Timmy felt bad for the man and hoped he would feel better soon. When they got off the subway, Timmy's mommy gave the man a smile and it made him feel a little better. Timmy was happy that his mommy could help the upset man.
