Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toys and do puzzles. One day, Timmy's dad gave him a toy laser that was white. Timmy was so happy to have a new toy!
Timmy played with the laser and pretended to be a superhero. He would shoot the laser at imaginary bad guys and save the day. The laser was so cool because it made a bright white light.
Timmy loved his new toy so much that he brought it to show-and-tell at school. All of his friends thought the laser was awesome and wanted to play with it too. Timmy felt proud to show off his cool toy to his friends.
