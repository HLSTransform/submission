Once upon a time there was a black cow. She loved to eat wheat. Every day she would look for the brightest and juiciest wheat in the fields. She was so happy when she found it.
One day, she found a big wheat field. The wheat looked the juiciest and the sweetest! She ate it until she couldn't eat anymore. She was so full and happy. 
The farmer was so surprised to see his wheat field looking so empty. He was a bit angry at the cow for eating all the wheat. But he also saw she was happy and knew she was just very hungry. So he decided to let her stay and gave her more wheat every day. 
The cow and the farmer became friends. The cow was so thankful and happy to the farmer. Every day she would eat the wheat he had given her and was very content. 
The end.
