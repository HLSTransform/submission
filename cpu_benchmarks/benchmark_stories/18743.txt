Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a big box. They use the box to make a car. They pretend to drive to the west.
But the park is not flat. There are hills and holes. It is difficult to push the box up and down. Lily and Ben get tired. They stop and drink some water.
They see a slide. It is shiny and smooth. They have an idea. They take the box to the slide. They put the box on the slide. They sit in the box. They hold hands.
They slide down very fast. They laugh and scream. They feel the wind in their hair. They have fun. They use the box to make a car and a slide. They are happy.
