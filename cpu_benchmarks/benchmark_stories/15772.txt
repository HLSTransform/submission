Lola was a three-year-old girl. She loved playing with her pink bracelet. She wore it everyday and never wanted to take it off.
One day, she decided to explore the garden. She ran around, feeling free and happy. But then she saw a big hole. She wanted to investigate the hole, so she crawled inside. When she stepped deeper, she realized she couldn't get out. She felt helpless!
Lola started to cry. Thankfully, her mummy heard her cries and found her. She smiled and hugged her daughter. Lola didn't want to let go of her bracelet, so mummy said "Lola, why don't you wear the bracelet outside the hole and I'll pull you out."
Lola was relieved. She passed the bracelet to her mummy, and the latter pulled her out easily. Lola hugged mummy tightly, and she never forgot how mummy saved her that day. Mummy promised to never let her get lost again, and Lola promised to always wear her bracelet.
