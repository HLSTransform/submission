Once upon a time, there was a girl. She was silly and playful, and liked to tell stories. One day, she had a funny idea. She wanted to take a trip to the moon!
The girl knew this was a foolish plan, so she shrugged her shoulders. It seemed like there was no way it could happen.
But then, something magical happened. Big clouds in the sky opened up, and the girl found a ladder made of stars. She quickly climbed up and was soon high above the ground.
The girl blinked in surprise. She saw she was now on the moon! She never thought it was possible.
The girl jumped with joy and waved to the people below. She was happy that her story had come true.
