Once upon a time there was a little girl named Anna. She wanted to go on a trip around the world. So she grabbed her passport and skipped to the airport.
When she reached the airport, she was asked to tie the laces of her shoes. She was so excited about her trip that she did it in a careless way.
Anna's mom saw what she was doing and warned her: "Anna, it's very important to tie your shoes tightly. You don't want to lose your passport!" 
But Anna didn't listen. Instead, she just smiled and said: "I'm sure it's ok, Mom. I tied the laces quickly!" 
So the mom showed Anna how to tie the shoelaces properly and explained to her why it was important: "It's important to tie the laces tight so you can keep your passport safe and sound. If you're careless while tying it, your passport might get lost and you won't be able to have your trip."
Anna listened to her mom and tied the laces carefully. Then she hugged her mom goodbye and set off on her trip around the world. The end.
