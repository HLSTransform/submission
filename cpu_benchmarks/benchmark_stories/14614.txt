Bob the bear was walking down the street when he saw a big old bus. He was so excited he ran to get on it. But when he tried, Bob found that the door was too tight. He was very sad and he hung his head. 
Suddenly, Bob felt a gentle paw on his shoulder. He turned around and saw a kindly old owl.
“I’m sorry the door is too tight,” the owl said. “Maybe you can use the help of a friend.”
Bob looked around and saw his best friend, Lola the cat. She came over and pushed the door with all her strength until it opened. Bob smiled to his friend and thanked her. 
"You are a great friend," Bob said. "I forgive you for not being able to open the door on your own. Let’s get on the bus and have some fun!"
Bob and Lola both hopped onto the bus and had a wonderful time together. They were never afraid to ask for help and always knew how to forgive.
