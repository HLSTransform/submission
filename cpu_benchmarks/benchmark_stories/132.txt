Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to watch the sunset every day with her mommy. One day, as they were watching the sunset, Lily fell asleep. When she woke up, the sun had already set and it was dark outside.
Lily started to cry because she missed the sunset. Her mommy hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. The sunset will come again tomorrow." Lily's mommy was very compassionate and always knew how to make her feel better.
From that day on, Lily made sure to stay awake and watch the sunset every day. She learned that sometimes we miss things when we're not paying attention, but we can always try again tomorrow.
