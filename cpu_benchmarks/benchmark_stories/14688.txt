Amy was walking in the woods. She noticed the rhythm of her feet on the leaves and dirt. Every step was like a drumbeat, keeping Amy's beat.
She also noticed a bird flying up in the sky. It moved quickly, but with a steady rhythm. Amy thought it was like a dancer, twirling with such grace.
As the bird moved away, Amy found a special stick on the ground. It wasn't big or fancy, but she liked it. It had a cheap price tag on it, but she decided to keep it.
Amy walked back home, twirling her new stick in the air. She noticed the rhythm of swaying back and forth, feeling so magical. Amy had a lot more fun on her walk in the woods now that she had her special stick.
