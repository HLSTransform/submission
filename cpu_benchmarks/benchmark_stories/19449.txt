Once upon a time there was a little girl. She saw a pink path that looked cheerful to her. She followed the path and suddenly heard a ringing sound. She looked around to see where the sound was coming from. It was coming from a pink bell that was on the pink path. She got excited and ran to it.
She picked up the bell and it kept ringing. She decided to take it home and show her parents. She took the bell home and showed them. They thought it was so cute and said 'Thank you' to the little girl.
The little girl was so happy. She hung the bell up outside her house, so it could ring whenever it wanted. Whenever she wanted to play with it, she would just go outside and it would ring.
She had so much fun with the bell! Whenever she went for a walk on the pink path, she would always take the bell with her. She always had a smile on her face whenever the bell would ring.
