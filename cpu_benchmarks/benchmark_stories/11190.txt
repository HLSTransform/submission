Once, there was a old farmer. He was a very friendly man and would always share his food with others. One day, he was working in his field and he saw a little boy wander by. The farmer called out to the little boy and asked if he wanted to have lunch. The boy said yes and so the farmer shared his food. The little boy was so excited. After they had finished eating, the farmer said to the little boy that if he wanted to make something of himself, he must learn to share. The little boy nodded and thanked the farmer. 
As the little boy was walking home, he saw a game that two children were playing. He asked if he could join them, and they said yes. The two children explained the rules of the game and the little boy understood. The three of them played the game and they laughed and cheered together. Whenever one of them scored, they always shared their joy with the others. 
The little boy was filled with happiness that day. He had learned an important lesson from the farmer that day - the importance of sharing. By learning to share, he had made friends and found joy.
