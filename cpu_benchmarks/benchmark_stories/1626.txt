Lily was sick. She had a fever and a sore throat. She felt very hot and very cold at the same time. She shivered under her blanket and hugged her teddy bear. She wanted her mommy to make her feel better.
Mommy came into Lily's room with a tray. She had a glass of water, a spoon and a bottle of pink medicine. She smiled at Lily and said, "You are a very brave and patient girl, Lily. I know you don't like the medicine, but it will help you get well soon. Can you try to take some for me?"
Lily nodded and opened her mouth. Mommy poured a little bit of the pink medicine on the spoon and gave it to Lily. Lily swallowed it and made a face. It tasted bitter and yucky. She wanted to spit it out, but she didn't. She drank some water to wash it down. She said, "Thank you, Mommy. I love you."
Mommy kissed Lily's forehead and said, "I love you too, Lily. You are a very good girl. Now, try to rest and sleep. I will check on you later." She tucked Lily in and turned off the light. She left the door open a little bit.
Lily closed her eyes and cuddled with her teddy bear. She still felt hot and cold and shivery, but she also felt a little bit better. She knew Mommy was taking care of her and the pink medicine was working. She hoped she would be well soon and play with her friends again. She fell asleep and dreamed of happy things.
