Once upon a time, there was a vendor who was very excited to match people with the items they wanted. She always greeted customers happily and tried her best to help them.
One day, a little girl came to the vendor. She asked for a new dress but the vendor hadn't any in the girl's size. The vendor was very upset that she couldn't help the little girl. The girl was also upset, so she left the store.
Just then, the little girl's grandmother came into the store. She was very happy to match the little girl with a dress she needed. The grandmother said, "I'm so glad I'm here! I'm so sorry your vendor couldn't help you before, honey. I'm sure you'll look very pretty in your new dress."
The vendor was very happy. She was glad that the little girl had found a dress that matched. From that day onward, the vendor always reminded herself to stay happy, no matter how upset she got.
