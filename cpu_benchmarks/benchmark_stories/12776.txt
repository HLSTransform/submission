Once upon a time there was an iron. The iron was old and rusty. The iron had three magical powers. First, it could unite people. Second, it could turn gentle. Third, it could make things happen.
One day, the iron was very lonely. All days and nights went by, but nobody wanted to play with him.
He thought, "Why am I so lonely? What am I missing?"
A little bird flew by, and said to the iron, "Maybe you need to make yourself gentle first. People will like you then."
The iron wasn't sure what to do, but he followed the bird's advice. He took a deep breath, and slowly become gentle.
People suddenly noticed the iron. To their surprise, he was no longer rusty and old, but friendly and gentle.
One little girl named Sarah approached the iron and said, "Hello there! Can you help me unite my family tomorrow? We need your magic!"
The iron smiled and said, "Of course I can! Anything for my friends!"
The next day, the iron and Sarah gathered Sarah's family. With his gentle magic, he helped them unite into one big happy family.
The iron and Sarah were so happy that they laughed and celebrated all day. 
From then on, the iron was never lonely again. With his magical powers and gentle nature, he was never without a friend
