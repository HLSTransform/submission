Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and watch the clouds go by. One day, she saw a big, fluffy cloud that looked like a bunny. She pointed to it and said, "Look, Mommy! Bunny cloud!" 
Her mommy smiled and said, "Yes, it does look like a bunny. Do you trust me when I say that there are many different shapes of clouds?" 
Lily nodded her head and said, "Yes, Mommy. I trust you." 
Later that day, Lily was playing with her toys when her little brother came in and grabbed one of her favorite toys. Lily said, "Hey! That's mine! Give it back!" 
Her brother replied, "No! Mine now!" 
Lily's mommy heard the commotion and came in. She said, "Lily, it's important to share with your brother. You can trust that he will give it back when he's done playing with it." 
Lily thought about it for a moment and said, "Okay, Mommy. I'll share." 
Her brother played with the toy for a little while and then gave it back to Lily. Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, brother. You're a fast learner!"
