Once upon a time there was a chubby bear who loved to eat cereal for breakfast. Every morning the bear would take the box of cereal from the cupboard and pour the crunchy flakes into a bowl. He added some milk and a spoonful of sugar and it was the perfect meal.
One day, the bear was eating his cereal when he realized he was all out of bears. He was very sad because there was no more cereal for breakfast. He had to find a new way to fill his chubby tummy.
Just then, he heard chattering outside his window. He went to look and saw two happy birds with a whole box of cereal in their beaks!
The bear was delighted. He thanked the birds and they happily flew away. The bear quickly finished his cereal and was so full that he fell asleep in a big bear hug.
At the end of the day the chubby bear was happy and full and the birds had made his morning special!
