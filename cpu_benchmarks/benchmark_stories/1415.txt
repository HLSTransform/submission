Once there was a little girl named Amy. She was three years old. One day, Amy stepped outside to play in the garden. She was so happy! She hopped and skipped around the garden and had lots of fun. 
When she was ready to come inside, she wanted to see if her brother wanted to come too. She stepped up to his bedroom door and knocked. There was no answer, so she stepped inside. 
To her surprise, her brother was on the floor, crying. His shoulder was hurt! Amy was scared and didn't know what to do. She stepped over to her brother and tried to help by rubbing his shoulder gently. 
Amy was so brave and her brother was very grateful. After a few minutes he stopped crying and was feeling better. 
They both stepped outside together and played in the garden.
