Once upon a time, there was a stubborn boy who lived by a creek. He loved playing in the creek and splashing around in the water. One day, he heard about something called marrying. He didn't know what it was, but he thought it sounded like fun.
So he decided to marry the creek. He ran to his mom and dad and told them about his plan. His parents laughed and explained that you usually marry someone else, not a creek. But that didn't stop the stubborn boy.
He found some flowers in the meadow and brought them to the creek. He made a pretty garland and placed it around the creek. Then he said some special words that he did not understand. He hugged the creek and thanked it for being so special.
After a while, the boy realized that marrying a creek was a silly idea and that his dad was right. Even though it was silly, he had fun pretending and it was a fun way to spend the day.
