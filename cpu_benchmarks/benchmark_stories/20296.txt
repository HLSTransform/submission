Tom was a bird who liked to deliver things. He had a big bag of seeds that he took from the farm. He flew to his friends in the forest and gave them some seeds. They were happy and said thank you.
But Tom was lonely. He had no friends who were birds like him. He only saw them when he delivered things. He wished he had someone to fly with and talk to.
One day, he saw a bright green vine. It was hanging from a big tree. It looked like a long snake. Tom was curious. He flew closer and said hello.
The vine moved and said hello back. It was not a snake. It was a parrot. A parrot who had escaped from a cage. He was also lonely. He had no friends who were parrots like him. He only saw them in books and pictures.
Tom and the parrot became friends. They flew together and talked to each other. They shared their seeds and stories. They were not lonely anymore. They were happy.
