Cindy and Andy were two little friends who enjoyed playing together. One day Cindy had an idea.
"Let's make an office," she said to Andy, "where we can unite and draw pictures."
"That's a cute idea," Andy said.
So they set to work, looking around until they found the perfect spot in the garden. Then they got some chairs, a table, and some tools to draw with.
When they had finished, Andy looked around and said, "It's a nice office!"
Cindy and Andy then spent a lot of time in their office, uniting to draw pictures, sing songs, tell stories and have fun together.
Whenever they thought of something to do, they just went to their office and did it together.
It was such a cute office, and Cindy and Andy were very proud of it.
