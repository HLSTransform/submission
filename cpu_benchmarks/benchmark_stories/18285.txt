Once upon a time, there was a happy monkey named Mimi. Mimi loved to play in the jungle with her friends. One day, Mimi went to pick some oranges from a tree. She found a big, juicy orange that looked very tasty. Mimi ate the orange and it was delicious! 
After playing all day, Mimi went back to her tree to go to sleep. But she felt sad because she missed her family. She wished they were there with her. Mimi closed her eyes and fell asleep, dreaming of her family. 
The next day, Mimi woke up and saw that her family had come to visit her! They brought her some more oranges to eat. Mimi was so happy to see them and thanked them for the oranges. She hugged them and felt grateful for her original family.
