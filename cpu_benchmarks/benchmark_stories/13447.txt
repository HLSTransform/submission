Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a tall bicycle that he loved to ride. One day, Timmy went for a ride on his bicycle and saw a puppy. The puppy was lost and Timmy wanted to help. He asked the puppy a question, "Are you lost?" The puppy barked in response. Timmy decided to take the puppy home with him and asked his mom if they could keep it. His mom said yes and Timmy was very happy to have a new friend. From that day on, Timmy and the puppy went on many adventures together on Timmy's tall bicycle.
