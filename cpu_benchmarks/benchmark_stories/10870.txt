Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to school because he liked to learn new things. One day, Timmy's teacher, Miss Sarah, asked him to sign his name on the blackboard. Timmy was nervous because he had never signed his name before, but he tried his best.
After class, Timmy's friend Billy came up to him and said he didn't like Timmy's signature. Timmy felt sad because he thought his signature was great. The next day, Timmy showed Miss Sarah his signature and asked if it was great. Miss Sarah said it was wonderful and that everyone's signature is unique and special.
Timmy felt happy again and showed Billy his signature. Billy apologized and said he thought it was great too. Timmy learned that everyone is different and that's what makes the world a great place.
