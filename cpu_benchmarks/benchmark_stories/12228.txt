Once upon a time, there was a kind prince. He was very compassionate and generous, and always thought of others before himself.
One day, the kind prince came across a little boy. The little boy had no clothes and he was shivering in the cold. The prince immediately took off his own vest and put it on the boy.
The little boy was so happy and he smiled a big smile at the prince. He said, "Thank you! I feel so warm now." 
The prince smiled back and said, "I'm glad. That's why I gave it to you." 
Suddenly, the two were startled by a loud noise. It was the king! He had come to check on the prince and saw the little boy wearing his vest. The king was very angry and he struck the prince. 
The prince did not say anything, but the little boy was so angry. He shouted at the king, "Why did you strike him? He was just being compassionate!" 
The king was embarrassed and he said nothing. Instead, he motioned for the prince to take his vest back. 
The prince gratefully took his vest back and thanked the little boy. He said, "Thank you for standing up for me!" The two smiled at each other and the little boy ran away, still wearing his warm vest. The kind prince had given him a lasting gift.
