Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, she went for a walk with her mommy on a road. They saw a big tree and decided to sit under it. 
Suddenly, Lily saw a naughty squirrel climbing up the tree. She said to her mommy, "Look mommy, that squirrel is being naughty!" Her mommy replied, "Yes, he is being naughty, but he is also very cute." 
Lily wanted to catch the squirrel and squeeze him, but her mommy told her that it was not nice to squeeze animals. They continued their walk and saw a pretty flower. Lily picked it up and gave it to her mommy. Her mommy said, "Thank you, Lily. You are such a sweet girl." They continued their walk and had a lovely day together.
