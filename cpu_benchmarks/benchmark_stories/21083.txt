Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play outside with their ball. One day, they see a girl sitting on a bench. She looks sad and tired. She has a big bag next to her.
"Hi, what is your name?" Tom asks the girl.
"My name is Lily. I am waiting for my mom. She is in the hospital. She needs a new lung." Lily says.
"A new lung? What is that?" Sam asks.
"It is a part of your body that helps you breathe. My mom has a bad lung. She cannot breathe well. She needs a new lung from someone who is generous and gives it to her." Lily explains.
"That is very sad. We are sorry for your mom." Tom says.
"Can we play with you? Maybe that will make you happy." Sam says.
Lily smiles and nods. She puts her bag on the bench and joins Tom and Sam. They spend a long time playing with the ball. They laugh and run and have fun. Lily forgets about her worries for a while.
"Thank you for playing with me. You are very nice and generous." Lily says.
"You are welcome. We are happy to be your friends." Tom and Sam say.
They hug Lily and say goodbye. They hope that Lily's mom will get a new lung soon and be well again. They also hope to see Lily again and play with her some more.
