Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and pretend he was a superhero. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to tidy up his toys. Timmy didn't want to, but he knew he had to listen to his mom.
As he was tidying up, he accidentally knocked over his toy machine. The machine was very important to Timmy because it helped him pretend he was a superhero. Timmy started to cry because he didn't know how to fix the machine. 
His mom heard him crying and came to see what was wrong. Timmy told her what happened and his mom said she would try to fix it. She tried and tried, but she couldn't fix it. Timmy was very sad because he couldn't play superhero anymore.
Timmy's mom hugged him and said, "I'm sorry I couldn't support you by fixing your machine." Timmy didn't understand what "support" meant, but he knew his mom was trying to make him feel better. Timmy learned that sometimes things break and can't be fixed, but it's okay because he still had his imagination. The end.
