Amelia loved to dance. Every morning, she put on her track shoes and danced around the house. Today, she was feeling extra fancy. She spun around in circles and jumped up and down.
Amelia's mommy saw how much fun Amelia was having. So, mommy put on some music. Amelia twirled around the livingroom until the song was over.
The sun was shining outside, so Amelia and mommy decided to go to the park. Amelia ran to the field and started to dance. She moved her feet in big circles and whirled her arms around.
Suddenly, Amelia heard some fun music. She looked around and saw a big truck. It was parked in the parking lot playing music. Amelia started to dance, faster than ever before. She moved her body every which way, just like a fancy ballerina!
When the music was over, Amelia felt happy and tired. She ran over to mommy and said she wanted to go home now for a rest. Mommy agreed and off they went, with Amelia still dancing all the way!
