Sally was a gentle girl. She went on a walk to pick some flowers. As she walked, she saw an opera. It was singing beautifully. She was filled with happiness and decided to pick a flower from the opera. She stretched her hand out, picked the flower and caressed its petals with her fingers. She smiled and whispered to the flower, "You are so gentle". She continued to walk, picking more and more flowers along the way. She was filled with joy and her heart filled with love.
