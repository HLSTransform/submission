Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a big, dirty tornado. It was so filthy, it made everything it touched dirty too. The people in the town were not happy.
One day, a brave girl named Lily decided to stop the tornado. She took a big glove and went outside. She saw the tornado coming closer and closer. Lily was scared, but she knew she had to be brave.
As the tornado came near, Lily raised her hand and slapped it with her big glove. The tornado was so surprised that it stopped spinning. The town was safe, and the people cheered for Lily. They all worked together to clean up the mess the tornado had made, and the town was beautiful once again.
