Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie lived in a nest on a tree. One day, the birdie wanted to peek outside the nest. So, it looked through a crack in the nest. 
The birdie saw a big, thick cat walking under the tree. The cat looked up and saw the birdie peeking. The cat wanted to eat the birdie, so it climbed the tree. 
The birdie tried to fly away, but it was too scared. The cat caught the birdie and ate it for dinner. The end.
