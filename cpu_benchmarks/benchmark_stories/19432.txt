Once upon a time there was a fair girl called Jane. She was very ill and her mummy and daddy took her to the hospital. 
At the hospital, the doctors were very kind. They gave Jane some medicine that made her feel better. 
The doctors also said that Jane needed to do some special exercises to help her get better. So Jane worked really hard to complete the exercises every day. 
Gradually, Jane began to feel better and stronger. Eventually, Jane was able to complete the exercises the doctors had given her. She was so happy! 
Mummy and Daddy were so proud that Jane was feeling better. They took her back home so she could rest and get even better.
