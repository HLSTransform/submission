Anna and Ben like to go to the library with Mom. They can find many books with pictures and stories. They can also play with toys and puzzles. Mom says they have to be quiet and careful in the library, because other people are reading and working.
One day, Anna and Ben see a big shelf with many books. They want to see what is inside. They climb on the shelf and pull out some books. They see books with animals, cars, colors, and letters. They are playful and happy. They throw the books on the floor and make noises.
Mom hears the noises and comes to see what is happening. She sees the mess and the shelf. She is angry and sad. She says to Anna and Ben, "You are naughty and rude. You have to respect the books and the library. You have to say sorry and help me clean up. We have to go home now and you have no more library time for a week."
Anna and Ben feel bad and scared. They say sorry and help Mom pick up the books. They put them back on the shelf. They say bye to the library and follow Mom to the car. They are quiet and sad. They wish they had been good and careful in the library. They hope Mom will forgive them and let them go back to the library soon.
