Once upon a time, there was a big mountain that went up, up, up into the sky. It was so tall that it touched the clouds. This mountain was called a volcano. 
One day, a little girl went for a walk near the volcano. She was very curious and wanted to see it up close. But suddenly, the volcano started to shake and make loud noises. The little girl was scared! 
Luckily, a kind man saw the little girl and ran to her. He picked her up and carried her away from the volcano. "I care about you," he said. The little girl felt safe in his arms and was grateful for his help.
