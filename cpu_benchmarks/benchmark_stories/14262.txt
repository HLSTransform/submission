Once upon a time, there lived a child called Jennie. Every day, Jennie went to the park in her town and saw her friends. One day, Jennie was feeling very excited because a festival was coming. She got worried though, because she did not think she would be able to lift the things she would need for the festival by herself.
So, the night before the festival, Jennie stayed up late practicing lifting heavy things. She tried moving rocks, lifting apples, and even tried lifting her little brother! Finally, she was able to lift a large box with snacks, drinks and decorations for the festival.
The next day, as Jennie arrived at the festival, she felt proud of herself. She had been able to lift the items she needed and was not worried anymore! All her friends admired her for her strength and determination.
The festival was lovely and everyone had such a good time. Jennie knew that she would not have been able to have such a great festival without the power to lift the things she needed!
