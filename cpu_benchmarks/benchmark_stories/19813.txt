Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She was very excited to go to the park. Mia went to the park with her dad and when they arrived, it was quite dark. Mia was a little bit scared, but she decided to explore.
Mia played on all the swings and slides, but forgot to stay away from the pond. Suddenly, Mia got too close and accidentally fell into the pond. She was quickly rescued by her dad, but she was very wet and shivering.
Mia's dad held her tight and said, "Mia, I have to leave the park now because it is getting noisy. I am sorry". Mia felt sad and regretted not being careful. Dad took her back home and promised her that they would go back to the park again.
