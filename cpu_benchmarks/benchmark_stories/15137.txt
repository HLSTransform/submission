John and his mommy decided to go for a walk in the park together. John was so happy to be outside and ran in circles, feeling dizzy. Suddenly he spotted a big structure in the center of the park. As he got closer, he quickly realized that it was a tall tower. He begged his mommy to let him go up, which she eventually agreed to.
John and his mommy went to the top of the tower and John was amazed. He felt so tall and important. But suddenly he started to feel dizzy again and realized he had climbed too high. Suddenly his mommy grabbed him and they both quickly started to make their way back down. 
However, John was so nervous he stumbled and he and his mommy quickly lost their footing and both started tumbling down the steep tower. As they reached the bottom, the both lay motionless. John had realized climbing the tower was too dangerous and had a bad ending.
