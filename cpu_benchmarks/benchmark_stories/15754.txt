Once upon a time there was a little girl called Tina. She loved playing with water. One day, Tina was playing outside and she saw a cabin full of water. She couldn't help but jump in with her feet. She started splashing around and having loads of fun.
Her mum watched and said, "Tina, don't get too wet."
But Tina just smiled and said, "It's ok mum, I'm having fun."
So mum smiled too and watched her daughter play. The water was so cool and Tina was having a great time. She splashed and swam and laughed until she was all dry again. 
When she got out of the cabin, mum said, "That was lovely, wasn't it?"
Tina smiled and said, "Yes, it was the most fun ever!"
