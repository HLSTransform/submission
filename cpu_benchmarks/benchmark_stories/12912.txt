Once there was a little girl named Susie. She was playing with her toys in the garden. Susie had a special box with a map inside. The map was very colourful and had lots of interesting shapes. 
One day Susie's mother saw her playing and said, "Susie, why don't you finish the map?" Susie looked at the map and said, "It's too heavy, I can't do it!"
Susie's mother smiled and said, "No big job is too hard, but only if you work together. If you work together, you can finish anything." 
So Susie asked a few friends to help, and they worked together to finish the map. They had a lot of fun. They laughed, sang and worked until the map was completed.
The moral of this story is that working together makes hard things easier. We can all work together to achieve great things!
