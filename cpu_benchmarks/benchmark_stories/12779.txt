Mama and Papa were in the kitchen, packing up the last of their belongings. "We will have to keep all of our stuff together," Mama said as she reached for a roll of tape. 
Little Timmy had been playing in the corner of the room. He asked, "What are you doing, Mama?"
Mama smiled and said, "We are getting ready to go on a big trip. We need to keep all of our things together, so we are going to use this tape to do it." She covered the box with the tape.
Timmy's eyes were getting sleepy. He said, "Can I come too? Please?"
Mama laughed and said, "Yes, of course you can come. But first, it's time for a nap. We will keep packing up, and then we'll be ready to go." 
Timmy went off to his room for a nap, and Mama and Papa kept packing until all of their things were ready. Soon after, they were all off on their big adventure.
