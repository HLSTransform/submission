Once upon a time, a calm symbol changed. It was very big and sparkly and she wanted to take it home.
So she carefully picked it up, and it made her feel warm and happy. She looked at it every day and noticed that its colour had changed.
The symbol got brighter and brighter until it was blinding in the sun. She smiled because she knew that it was changing for the better.
She decided to take the symbol to show her friends. When she arrived, they were all surprised. They said she was very brave for bringing such a calm symbol to show them.
The friends were inspired by her courage, and the symbol was a reminder of how far they had come. They were ready for their next big adventure!
