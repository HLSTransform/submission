Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Joe. He was three years old and enjoyed playing with his uncle. One day, Joe and his uncle went out in the garden to collect something. 
"What do we need to collect, Uncle?" asked Joe. 
"We're going to collect leaves," replied his uncle. 
Joe and his uncle searched the garden and were so happy when they found some strong leaves. Joe carefully picked up the leaves and put them in a basket. 
"Look how strong these leaves are, Joe," said his uncle, smiling.
Joe's smile got bigger and bigger. He was so proud of collecting the leaves with his uncle and couldn't wait to show his mom. They collected leaves in the garden until the sun began to set. Joe hugged his uncle goodbye and thanked him for a wonderful day.
