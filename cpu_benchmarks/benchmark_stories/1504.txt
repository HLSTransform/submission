Once upon a time there was a loyal bear named Ben. Ben loved to sing and he sang all of the time. Every day he would help make meals for his family. He would help his mom stir the pot and he always remembered to stir it for a long time so the meal would be extra tasty.
Then one day his mom said he could pick any song he wanted to sing. Ben was so excited! He thought and thought about what song he would pick, but he couldn't decide. So, he just sang all his favorite songs. He sang so loudly that everyone in the house could hear him.
When he was finished singing, his mom said he did a wonderful job. She said she was so proud of how loyal he was to his family. Ben smiled and said that he had lots of love for his family. Then he went off to bed, dreaming of all the songs he wanted to sing.
