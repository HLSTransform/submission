Lily and Tom were playing in the kitchen. They liked to pretend they were chefs and make yummy food with pots and pans. Lily had a big spoon and Tom had a wooden spatula.
"Let's make soup!" Lily said. "We need water and carrots and peas and salt."
"OK!" Tom said. He raised the spatula and pretended to chop the carrots. "Chop, chop, chop!"
Lily poured some water into a pot and put it on the stove. She turned the knob to make the fire. "Be careful, Tom. The fire is hot. Don't touch it."
"I won't, Lily. I'm a good chef." Tom said. He added the carrots and peas and salt to the pot. "Stir, stir, stir!"
They smelled the soup and smiled. It smelled good. They wanted to taste it, but it was too hot.
"Let's wait a little bit." Lily said. "Then we can have some soup and share it with Mommy and Daddy. They will be happy."
"That's a good idea, Lily. You are very compassionate. You care about other people." Tom said. He hugged his sister.
Lily hugged him back. "You are compassionate too, Tom. You are my best friend."
They waited for the soup to cool down. Then they poured some into two bowls and carried them to the living room. They found Mommy and Daddy reading on the couch.
"Look, Mommy and Daddy! We made soup for you!" Lily said.
"Wow, thank you, Lily and Tom! You are very sweet and thoughtful." Mommy said.
"Yes, thank you, Lily and Tom! You are very creative and generous." Daddy said.
They took the bowls and tasted the soup. They made happy noises and praised the chefs.
Lily and Tom felt proud and happy. They had fun in the kitchen and made their parents happy. They loved their family.
