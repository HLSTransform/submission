Andy had a big box of clay. It was pink and very soft. Every day, Andy would take out a handful of clay and spend time with it. He would mold it with his hands and make pretty shapes. He made boxes, animals and even dolls. 
One day, Andy wanted to do something special with the clay. He decided to make a house. He began to shape and mold it the best he could, using the pink clay. It took a lot of time and soon the sun was setting. 
Andy spent the whole day making the house. Even when it got dark, he still kept going. By the time he finished, the house was really big and he was really tired. But Andy was so proud of what he had made. He couldn't wait to show it to everyone.
