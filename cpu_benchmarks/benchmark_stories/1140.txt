Once upon a time, there was a witch. She lived in a big, open house. The house was in the middle of the woods. The witch was nice and liked to help people.
One day, a little girl named Lily got lost in the woods. She saw the witch's house and went inside. The witch saw Lily and wanted to help her. She gave Lily some food and a warm place to sit.
The witch reminded Lily to always stay close to her home. She told Lily that the woods can be scary. Lily thanked the witch and went back home. From that day on, Lily never got lost again.
