Tom is a cat. He likes to play with his ball of yarn. He rolls it, chases it, and bites it. He is happy.
But one day, a new cat comes to his house. His name is Max. He is big and black. He sees Tom's ball of yarn and wants it. He runs to it and grabs it with his paws.
"Hey, that is mine!" Tom says. He runs to Max and tries to get his ball back. He scratches Max with his claws. Max scratches him back. They fight.
They fight hard. They bite and hiss and growl. They make a lot of noise. They knock over a vase and a lamp. They make a mess.
"Stop it, you two!" a voice says. It is Mom. She is angry. She picks up both cats and puts them in different rooms. She takes away the ball of yarn. She says, "No more fighting. You have to share and be nice."
Tom and Max are sad. They do not have their ball of yarn. They do not have fun. They sit and lick their wounds. They think about what they did.
They are sorry. They do not want to fight anymore. They want to be friends. They want to play together.
They meow softly. They hope Mom will forgive them. They hope she will give them back their ball of yarn. They hope they can share and be nice.
