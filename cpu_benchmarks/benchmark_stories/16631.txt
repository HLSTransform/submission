Lily and Ben are playing with blocks. They want to build a big tower. They have many blocks of different shapes and colors.
"Look, I have a red block. It is square. It can fit on top of this blue block. It is also square." Lily says.
"Good. I have a yellow block. It is round. It can fit on top of this green block. It is also round." Ben says.
They keep stacking blocks until they have a very tall tower. They are happy and proud.
"Wow, our tower is so big. It is perfect." Lily says.
"Yes, it is perfect. But wait, I have an idea. Let's put this star block on top. It is shiny and pretty." Ben says.
He picks up the star block and tries to fit it on top of the tower. But the star block is too big. It does not fit. It makes the tower fall down. All the blocks crash to the floor. Lily and Ben are sad and angry.
"Ben, why did you do that? You ruined our perfect tower. That was a bad idea." Lily says.
"Sorry, Lily. I just wanted to make it more perfect. I did not know it would not fit. That was a silly idea." Ben says.
They look at the mess of blocks on the floor. They feel sorry for each other. They hug and say sorry.
"It's okay, Ben. We can build another tower. Maybe we can use a smaller star block. Or a different shape. We can try again." Lily says.
"Okay, Lily. You are right. We can build another tower. Maybe we can make it even more perfect. We can have fun." Ben says.
They smile and pick up the blocks. They start to build another tower. They are happy and hopeful.
