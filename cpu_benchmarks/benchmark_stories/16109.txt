One day, a little girl called Sarah had a rare bowl. Her mum wanted her to share it but Sarah refused. 
"No," said Sarah, shaking her head.
"But why not?" asked her mum. 
"It's my bowl!" protested Sarah.
Her mum smiled. "That's true, but we can share it. I'm sure your friends would like to have a turn with the rare bowl."
But Sarah wasn't having it. She crossed her arms and tried to look stern. "No! It's my bowl and I'm not sharing it! My bowl is mine."
Her mum chuckled. "Okay Sarah, the bowl is yours. But remember to be kind to your friends and don't refuse to share too often." 
Sarah smiled, pleased that her mum understood. She hugged her mum and held the rare bowl close. From that day, she always kept the bowl to herself, but was happy to share it with her friends sometimes.
