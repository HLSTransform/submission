Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Emma. She loved to run around in her garden. One day, when it was hot outside, Emma noticed a poppy in her garden. The poppy was so very small and it was in danger! Emma had to save the poppy.
Emma quickly ran inside and grabbed a pail of water. Then she slowly and carefully walked back to the garden. She carefully poured the water around the poppy, so it wouldn't get too hot.
The poppy thanked Emma and said, "Thank you for saving me!" Emma smiled and said, "You're welcome, little poppy!" Emma was very happy. She knew she had done the right thing by saving the poppy.
