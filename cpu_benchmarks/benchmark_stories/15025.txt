Once there was a little boy who wanted to play baseball. He asked his mom, "Can I go play baseball?" She replied, "Not today, it's too icy outside!" The little boy frowned, but he knew that it was too dangerous to play in the icy weather.
The little boy aksed his dad, "Can I play baseball with you?" His dad smiled and said, "Yes, of course you can!" The little boy jumped up with joy.
Together they went to the backyard, and Dad brought out a baseball and bat. He taught the little boy how to catch and throw the ball, how to hold the bat, and how to swing it. The little boy copied his dad, and soon he and his dad were having a great time playing together.
The little boy was so happy, and he shouted out to his mom, "Look mom! I'm playing baseball with Dad!" His mom smiled and said, "Looks like you finally got your request!"
