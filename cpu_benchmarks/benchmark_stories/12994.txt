Jenny was hungry. She wanted something to eat. She saw some pickles in the fridge. She smiled and felt excited. She grabbed the jar, but it was too heavy for her. She pushed and pulled, but she couldn't open it. Then her mom came over. Her mom smiled and gave Jenny a big hug. She then put the jar on the counter. Mom used a spoon to push down on the lid. The lid opened and the pickles were inside. Jenny tasted one. It was sour and salty. She smiled and laughed. She ate the pickles and felt satisfied. She thanked her mom and gave her a big hug.
