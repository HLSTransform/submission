Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a sister named Anna. They lived in a small house with their furry dog, Max.
One sunny day, Lily and Anna went to the park with Max. They played and laughed all day. But then, Max started to bark. Lily did not listen to Max. She kept playing with Anna. Max barked louder and louder. Anna told Lily, "We should listen to Max."
Lily stopped and listened to Max. She saw that Max was trying to tell them something. They followed Max and found a lost little boy. The boy was sad and scared. Lily and Anna helped the boy find his mom. The mom was so happy and thanked them.
The sisters learned that it is important to listen. Sometimes, others know things we do not. By listening, we can help and learn from them.
