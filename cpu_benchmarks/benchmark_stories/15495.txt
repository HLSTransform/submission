There was a puppy named Rex who lived with a family. He was very loved and the family wanted to support him. Every Sunday, the family took Rex to see a modern veterinarian. The veterinarian was very nice and always checked Rex's health. The veterinarian asked Rex how he was feeling and would play with him. The veterinarian also gave Rex medicine to help him feel better. The family supported Rex by taking him to the veterinarian and making sure he took his medicine. Rex was very lucky to have such a supportive family and a modern veterinarian to look after him. He was a healthy and happy pup.
