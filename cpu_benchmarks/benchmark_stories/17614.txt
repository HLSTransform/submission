Once upon a time, there was a big van. It was red and had four wheels. One day, it rained a lot and the van got very wet. It was so wet that the driver had to soak up all the water with a towel. 
After the rain stopped, the driver noticed something unusual. A little bird was sitting on top of the van! The bird was very small and had bright blue feathers. The driver had never seen a bird like this before. 
The driver decided to wait until the bird flew away before driving the van. But the bird didn't fly away. It just sat there, looking at the driver. The driver thought it was very strange. Finally, the bird flew away and the driver drove the van home.
