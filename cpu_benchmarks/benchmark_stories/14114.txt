Once upon a time, there was a quiet girl. Every day she liked to pour water on the film she had in the backyard. One day she was pouring the water and suddenly a big wind came and blew away the film. The girl tried to grab it, but it was too late. The film had gone. 
The girl was very sad and started to cry. She asked her mum to help her find the film, but it was no use. They couldnâ€™t find it. The girl was very quiet after that. She never poured water again on the film in the backyard. The end.
