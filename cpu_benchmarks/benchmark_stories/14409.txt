Once upon a time, a little boy named Timmy went to the park with his mommy. They played on the swings and slides, but Timmy got tired and wanted to rest. 
As they sat on the bench, Timmy saw a man with a laser pointer. The man pointed it at the trees and the ground, making little red dots. Timmy thought it was funny and laughed.
Later that day, Timmy's mommy made him a cup of hot cocoa. Timmy took a sip and made a bitter face. "Yuck, mommy, this is bitter!" he said. His mommy smiled and said, "I'm sorry, Timmy. I forgot to put sugar in it." 
The next day, Timmy went to the park again. He saw the man with the laser pointer again, but this time, he pointed it at Timmy's eyes. Timmy closed his eyes and told his mommy. She quickly took Timmy away and called the police. The man was caught and Timmy learned to be careful around strangers.
