Once there was a little girl who was very restless. One day she decided to find something to do. She noticed something in her room that she hadn't noticed before, a pile of junk! She was very excited and decided to measure the piles of junk.
Using two wooden ruler she started measuring everything in the room. One by one, she carefully measured each of the piles of junk. She worked and worked until all of the junk was measured.
When she was finished, she was very proud of herself! She couldn't believe she had measured all the junk. She decided to show her parents what she had done and they were amazed! They thought it was a job well done.
The little girl was so happy she had something to do. She was happy that her restlessness had been relieved. She now spends her days measuring piles of junk, whenever she feels restless!
