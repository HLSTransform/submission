One day, a little girl named Mia went to the store with her mom. Mia saw a big mirror on the wall. She looked at herself in the mirror and made funny faces. 
Mia's mom said, "Mia, we need to choose a helpful thing to buy for our home. Do you think the mirror is helpful?" Mia thought about it and said, "Yes, mom! The mirror helps us see ourselves and make sure we look nice."
So, Mia and her mom chose the mirror and took it home. They hung it on the wall, and every day, Mia and her mom looked in the mirror to make sure they looked nice before going outside. The mirror was very helpful, and Mia learned that it is important to choose things that help us in our lives.
