Once upon a time there lived a little boy named David. David was always troubled. Everywhere he went he was sad and glum. 
One day David's mother took him on a special surprise journey. David's eyes lit up with excitement when he realised they were going to the park! 
At the park, David spotted a box of crayons. He reached out to grab them but his mother said, "You can't have them, David. But I have a special surprise if you wait and be patient." 
David waited and waited and soon he found himself inside an art shop. He saw a giant paint set with brushes and ink. David squealed with delight and he said to his mother, "Is this for me?!" 
His mother smiled and nodded. She said, "We can try it together. All you have to do is hope and keep believing." 
David smiled and looked at all the colours. He took out the ink and dipped his brush in it and started painting his first picture. He enjoyed it so much and it made him happy and no longer troubled. 
David's mother was so proud of him! Together, they kept hoping and believing that this was the beginning of beautiful art.
