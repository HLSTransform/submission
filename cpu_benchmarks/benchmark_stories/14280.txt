Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She liked to take things from the house. One day, when no one was looking, she took a knife from the kitchen drawer. It was a nice knife and it was very shiny. The little girl wanted to play with it. She ran outside, into the dark and far away woods. Suddenly, she felt scared. It was too dark and she couldn't find her way home. 
Just then, she heard an old wise voice coming from the trees. It said "Don't take things that don't belong to you, it will get you into trouble". The voice was right - the little girl was lost and she didn't know how to get home. 
The little girl was very sad and she put away the knife. Suddenly, a beam of light came down from the sky and it showed the little girl the way home. She was happy to find her way back and she never took things that didn't belong to her ever again. 
The moral of the story is that you should never take things that don't belong to you. You never know where it could lead you.
