Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy bunny named Bun Bun that she loved very much. One day, Lily and her family were going on a trip to visit her grandma. Lily was very excited to see her grandma and to bring Bun Bun with her.
But when they got to the train station, Lily realized that she forgot to pack Bun Bun in her bag. She was very sad and started to cry. Her mom tried to make her feel better by telling her they could buy a new toy at the train station, but Lily didn't want a new toy. She wanted Bun Bun.
Lily's dad had an idea. He asked the train station network if anyone had found a toy bunny. Luckily, someone had found Bun Bun and turned him in to the lost and found. Lily was so happy and excited to be reunited with her beloved toy. From then on, she made sure to always pack Bun Bun in her bag before going on any trips.
