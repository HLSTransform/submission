Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and twirl around. One day, her mommy took her to the mall. It was a big place with lots of stores and people. But as they walked around, Lily got scared because it started to get dark outside. 
Mommy saw that Lily was scared and picked her up. She hugged her tight and said, "Don't worry, my sweet girl. We'll dance our way out of here!" So, they started to dance and sing together. And soon, Lily forgot all about being scared. She felt happy and safe in her mommy's arms. They danced all the way to the car and drove home, feeling happy and tired from their fun adventure at the mall.
