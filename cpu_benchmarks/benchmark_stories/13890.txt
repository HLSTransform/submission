Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a bracelet that was very special. Her mom told her, "Lucy, when you wear this bracelet, you will feel powerful."
One day, Lucy and her friend Tim went to play in the park. They saw a big ball stuck in a tree. Tim said, "I wish we could get the ball down." Lucy smiled and said, "I can do it!" She put on her bracelet and felt powerful.
Lucy climbed the tree and got the ball down. Tim was so happy. He said, "Wow, Lucy! You are so strong!" Lucy smiled and said, "It's my special bracelet. It makes me feel powerful." They played with the ball all day and had lots of fun.
