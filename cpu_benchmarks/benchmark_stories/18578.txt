Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her dog, Max. One day, her mommy asked her if she wanted to go to the park. Lily was very eager to go and play on the swings.
But when they got to the park, Lily's mommy realized she had forgotten her driver's license. The park had a rule that said people needed a license to use the playground. Lily's mommy tried to explain this to her, but Lily didn't understand. She just wanted to play.
Lily's mommy had to refuse her request to play on the playground because they didn't have the license. Lily was sad, but her mommy promised they could come back another day when they had the license. They ended up having a fun day playing with Max in the grass instead.
