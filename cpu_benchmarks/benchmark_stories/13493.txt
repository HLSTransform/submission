Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars in his garage. But one day, it got too dark in the garage and Timmy couldn't see his cars. He was sad and didn't know what to do.
Then, Timmy had an idea! He planned to bring a flashlight to the garage so he could see his cars better. He went to his mommy and asked for a flashlight. She gave him one and Timmy was very happy.
He went back to the garage and turned on the flashlight. It was bright and he could see all his cars. Timmy played with them for a long time and had lots of fun. From that day on, he always planned to bring a flashlight to the garage when it got dark.
