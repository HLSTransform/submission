One day, Susie was playing with her best friend, Jax. They had some clay and decided to make something with it. They made a big sculpture of a flower. Jax was very proud and asked Susie to take a picture of it. But then, something unexpected happened! Jax accidentally bumped the sculpture and it fell to the ground and broke into lots of little pieces. Jax was so sad.
Susie gave Jax a hug. “It's okay, Jax. We'll make something else!”, Susie said.
Jax took a deep breath and said, “Okay.” They found some more clay and started making a new sculpture. This time, they made a sculpture of an animal. Jax was surprised to see how great it looked.
Susie smiled and said, “We worked together as a team and it turned out amazing! We should always be kind and patient with each other, as when we work together we can do great things.” Jax smiled and said, “I'm sorry for bumping the flower.”
Susie hugged him again and said, “It's okay. You don't have to be sorry.”
Jax and Susie had learned a valuable lesson that day. Working together as a team and being kind and patient with each other is always the right thing to do.
