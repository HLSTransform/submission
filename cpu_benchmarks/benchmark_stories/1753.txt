Once there were two friends, Tom and Jane. Tom wanted to buy a toy from the shop, so he asked Jane to come with him. When they arrived at the shop, Tom was very excited to look at all the toys. He saw a strong car he wanted, but he only had enough money for one toy.
Tom asked Jane for help to decide which toy to buy. Jane thought for a moment and then suggested the strong car. She said it was a great choice because the toy was very strong. Tom was very pleased with Jane's suggestion, so he requested the car from the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper happily gave him the car and it was the best toy Tom ever owned!
