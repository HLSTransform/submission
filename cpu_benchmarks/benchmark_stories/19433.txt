Jim had a funny cave. There were lots of things in the cave and some of them needed to be fixed. He asked his mom to help him. They went together to the funny cave and started to fix things. They got tools from the shed and took some time to fix the broken things. They worked hard and soon had finished fixing the cave. They looked around, smiled and were proud of all their hard work. They enjoyed the funny cave and all the things in it.
