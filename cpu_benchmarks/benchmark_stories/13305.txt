One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park. He saw a big, ugly bug. Tim was not scared. He wanted to play with the bug. So, he kicked a ball to the bug. The bug looked at the ball and kicked it back to Tim. They played together and had fun.
After playing, Tim was hungry. He took out a big chocolate bar from his bag. He broke it in half and gave one piece to the bug. The bug said, "Thank you, Tim!" They both ate the chocolate and smiled.
Tim and the ugly bug became good friends. They played and ate chocolate together every day. They were very happy.
