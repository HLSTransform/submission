Once upon a time, there was a man who was very rich. He had a lot of money and things, and he was called wealthy. One day, he went to the store to buy a gift for his daughter. He found a beautiful toy and bought it for her.
But when he got home, he realized that he had lost his wallet with all his money inside. He looked everywhere but couldn't find it. He felt very sad and worried because he didn't have any money left to buy food or pay his bills.
Days passed and the man became very poor. He had to sell all his things, including the gift he had bought for his daughter. She was very sad when she found out that she wouldn't get a gift from her dad. The man felt very bad and wished he had been more careful with his money. The end.
