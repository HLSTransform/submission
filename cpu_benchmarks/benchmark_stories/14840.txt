Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to talk on the telephone with her friends. One day, Lily's mom got a very special phone call. It was from her grandma who lived far away. Lily's mom was very happy because she didn't get to talk to her grandma very often. 
Lily knew that her mom was talking to her grandma because she could hear her mom's happy voice. After her mom finished talking on the phone, Lily asked if she could say hello to her grandma too. Her mom said yes and handed Lily the phone. 
Lily was so excited to talk to her grandma. She asked her how she was doing and told her about her day. Her grandma was happy to hear from her and told her she loved her very much. It was a rare treat for Lily to talk to her grandma on the phone, but she was happy she got to know that her grandma was doing well.
