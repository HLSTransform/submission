Lily and Tom were best friends. They liked to play in the park in summer. They liked to slide, swing and run. They also liked to pretend they were lions. They would roar and chase each other.
One day, they saw a big dog in the park. It was black and furry. It had sharp teeth and a loud bark. Lily and Tom were not afraid. They thought they could scare the dog away. They ran towards the dog and roared like lions.
The dog did not like their roar. It did not think they were lions. It thought they were annoying. It growled and snapped at them. Lily and Tom were scared. They turned around and ran away. But the dog was faster. It caught Tom by his leg and bit him hard.
Lily screamed and ran to get help. She found a grown-up and told him what happened. The grown-up called an ambulance and the police. They came and took Tom to the hospital. They also took the dog away.
Lily was very sad. She wished she had been more thoughtful. She wished she had not roared at the dog. She wished she had stayed away from it. She hoped Tom would be okay. She hoped they could still be friends. She hoped they could still play in the park in summer. But she knew things would not be the same. She knew they had made a big mistake. She knew they had learned a hard lesson.
