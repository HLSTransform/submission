Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the sand at the beach. He would go there every day and build sandcastles. One day, Timmy saw a girl named Sarah playing with his regular bucket. He got mad and said, "That's mine! You have to leave!" Sarah didn't want to leave, so they started to fight.
Timmy and Sarah were both very angry and started to throw sand at each other. Sand got in their hair and eyes, and they couldn't see. Timmy realized that he didn't want to fight anymore, so he said, "I'm sorry, Sarah. You can play with my regular bucket." Sarah smiled and said, "Thank you, Timmy!" They played together in the sand and built a big sandcastle. They had so much fun that they forgot about the fight. From that day on, Timmy and Sarah played together every day at the beach.
