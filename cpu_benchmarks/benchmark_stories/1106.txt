Ben was very excited. Today he was going to the supermarket with his Mum. He liked to go shopping with her. It was very popular.
As they walked in, he saw something exciting. There was a shelf full of milk. It was fat. He liked fat milk. It was white.
Mum asked Ben to help pick the milk for their breakfast. He was happy to help. He picked up one big carton and put it in their shopping trolley. He was so happy that he dropped the carton. It spilt on the floor and was all over. 
Ben and Mum cleaned up the spilled milk.  He was sad. He felt badly that he had dropped the milk. It was a big mess.
Mum said not to worry. She explained that it was a common mistake. Everyone drops things sometimes - even Mum.
After shopping, they went home. They made some yummy breakfast with the milk. It was very tasty. Ben knew that sometimes things don't always go as planned, but it can still be a fun day.
