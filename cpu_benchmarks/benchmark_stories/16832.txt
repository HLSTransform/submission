Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She wanted a cookie, so she asked her mommy if she could have one. She said, "Mommy, can I please have a cookie? I request it." 
Her mommy said, "Sure, Lily. But you have to wait a little bit because they are still baking in the oven." 
Lily waited patiently and smelled the lovely aroma of the cookies baking. Finally, her mommy took the cookies out of the oven and gave one to Lily. It was warm and delicious. Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, mommy. This cookie is lovely."
