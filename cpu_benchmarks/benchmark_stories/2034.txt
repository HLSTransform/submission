Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very curious about everything. She was always looking for new things to discover and explore. One day, she came across a box with a big red ribbon on it. Inside the box was a magic wand.
The little girl couldn't believe her eyes and immediately picked up the wand. She waved it around and said the magical words, "Abracadabra!" Suddenly, the wand began to glow and sparkle.
The girl was so excited that she began to laugh. She laughed and laughed until she accidentally broke the wand in two. "Uh oh," she said nervously.
Suddenly, a funny fairy appeared and said, "Don't be sad! I know how to fix it!" With one flick of her wand, the magic wand was fixed!
The girl was so happy to have her magic wand back that she danced around with glee. She thanked the fairy for helping her fix the broken wand and went on her way.
