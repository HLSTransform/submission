Anna and Ben were at the beach with their mom and dad. They liked to play in the sand and look for shells and rocks. Sometimes they saw crabs and fish in the water.
One day, they wandered away from their parents and found a big rock with many oysters on it. Oysters were animals that lived in shells. They were shiny and smooth inside.
"Look, Ben, oysters!" Anna said. "Can we take some home?"
"I don't know, Anna. Maybe they are not happy to leave their rock," Ben said.
They heard a splash and saw a dolphin jump out of the water. It was graceful and fast. It made a funny noise and waved its tail.
"Wow, a dolphin!" Ben said. "It is so pretty and friendly!"
"Hello, dolphin!" Anna said. "Do you like oysters?"
The dolphin nodded and swam closer to the rock. It opened its mouth and ate an oyster. It smiled and made another noise.
"Thank you, dolphin!" Anna said. "You can have some more oysters if you want."
The dolphin ate a few more oysters and then swam away. It jumped again and waved goodbye.
Anna and Ben waved back and smiled. They decided to leave the oysters on the rock. They ran back to their parents and told them about the dolphin. Their mom and dad were happy and proud of them. They had a fun day at the beach.
