Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Teddy. Teddy was very humble and always wanted to help his friends. One day, he saw his friend Bunny feeling sad. Teddy went over to Bunny and gave him a big hug. Bunny felt better and thanked Teddy. 
Later that day, Teddy saw his other friend Fox trying to build a tower out of blocks. Fox was having trouble and was getting frustrated. Teddy decided to add some blocks to the tower to help Fox. Fox was happy and thanked Teddy. 
But then, as Teddy was walking home, he got lost in the woods. He couldn't find his way back and started to get scared. The sun was setting and it was getting dark. Teddy tried to find his way, but he couldn't. He felt very alone and sad. 
Eventually, Teddy got so tired that he fell asleep. The next morning, his friends found him and brought him back home. Teddy was happy to be safe, but he realized that sometimes even the humblest of bears need help too.
