One day, a boy named Tim went to a big place called a stadium. He was very happy because he would see his original toy car race. The toy car was red and fast.
In the stadium, Tim saw many people. He also saw many toy cars. They were all ready to race. Tim held his red toy car and said, "You can do it, car! You can win the race!"
The race began, and all the toy cars went fast. Tim let his car go, or "release" it, and it raced with the other cars. The red car was very fast, and it went in front of the other cars. Tim jumped up and down and said, "Go, car, go!"
In the end, Tim's red car won the race. Tim was so happy, and he hugged his car. The people in the stadium clapped for Tim and his original red toy car. Tim smiled and said, "We did it, car! We won the race!"
