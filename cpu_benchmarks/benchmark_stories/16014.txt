Sam and his mommy were snuggling on the couch. Sam wanted to be wrapped in something cozy so his mommy reached for a navy blanket that she said was dependable. 
"This blanket will keep you warm and cozy," his mommy said. 
Sam smiled and asked, "Can you wrap it around me?"
She smiled back, "Of course!" His mommy wrapped the navy blanket snugly around Sam and tucked him in while giving him a kiss.
Sam said, "Thank you mommy, now I'm nice and cozy." 
His mommy said, "I'm always dependable when you need something cozy!"
