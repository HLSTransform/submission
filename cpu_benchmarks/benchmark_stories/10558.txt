Alice was playing hide and seek with her friends. She hid behind the brick wall in the garden. She was so excited and impatient to be found! 
But soon, Alice could feel the ground shaking and trembling. She was scared and couldn't understand what was happening. She slowly looked around the corner of the brick wall. 
Suddenly, she saw a big, green and yellow monster! It was so tall, it almost touched the sky. Alice trembled with fear.
Seeing the scared little girl, the monster smiled and said in a gentle voice, "It's alright! I'm here to join your game. Come out and let's play together."
Alice was relieved. She and her friends started playing and the monster joined in too. They both had lots of fun!
