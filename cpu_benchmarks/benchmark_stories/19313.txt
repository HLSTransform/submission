One day, Jack was feeling very brave. He decided he wanted to explore the woods and find a dinosaur. So he put on his favourite hat, grabbed his toy car, and off he went!
It wasn't long before Jack spotted something strange in the bushes. He stepped closer and there he saw it - a terrible dinosaur! Jack was scared, but he knew he had to be brave. So he slowly stepped closer, and wiped the dirt off the dinosaur.
Jack was so surprised when he saw the colours on its body. It was a shiny blue dinosaur covered in stars and moon. Jack was so excited, he wanted to take the dinosaur home with him. So he grabbed the dinosaur carefully and put it in his toy car.
Jack drove his car all the way home and showed his mum the dinosaur. His mum was amazed! She said the dinosaur was beautiful and what a brave boy Jack was to find it.
Jack was very proud and he knew he would never forget this special day. He kept the dinosaur in his room, where it would always remind him of the wonderful adventure he had in the woods.
