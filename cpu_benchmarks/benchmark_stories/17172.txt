Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a big nose that he loved to wiggle and smell things with. One day, Timmy went on a walk in the park and discovered a shiny rock. He was so happy to find it and put it in his pocket. 
But as he continued his walk, Timmy saw a sad puppy sitting all alone. The puppy had lost its toy and couldn't find it. Timmy felt sad too and wanted to help. Suddenly, he remembered the shiny rock in his pocket. He took it out and gave it to the puppy. The puppy was so happy and started to play with it. 
Timmy felt happy too, knowing he had helped the puppy. He wiggled his nose and smiled, feeling proud of himself. From that day on, Timmy always kept an eye out for sad animals in the park and tried to help them feel better.
