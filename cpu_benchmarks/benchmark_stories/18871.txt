Lily and Ben were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big band. The band had drums and horns and flags. They made loud music. Lily and Ben wanted to join the band.
They ran to the band and tried to march with them. They kicked their legs and waved their arms. They made noise with their mouths. They thought they were very good. But the band did not like them. The band leader was angry. He told them to go away. He said they were not in the band. He said they were rude and silly.
Lily and Ben felt ashamed. They did not want to make the band angry. They did not want to be rude and silly. They ran away from the band. They went to a bench and sat down. They were sad and quiet.
Then, Lily's mom came. She had a basket. She said it was time for lunch. She opened the basket and took out sandwiches and apples and cookies. She gave some to Lily and some to Ben. She said they were good friends. She said she was proud of them.
Lily and Ben smiled. They ate their lunch. They felt better. They thanked Lily's mom. They said they were sorry for the band. They said they would not do it again. They said they would play nicely. They hugged Lily's mom. Then, they went to play in the park. They were happy.
