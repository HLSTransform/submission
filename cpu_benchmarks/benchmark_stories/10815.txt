Once upon a time, there was a big gorilla. The gorilla was very patient and waited for his food to come. One day, a boy came to see the gorilla. The boy wanted to give the gorilla some food, but he didn't have any money to pay. The gorilla was very hungry, so he took the food anyway. The boy was happy that the gorilla liked the food. He promised to come back and pay for the food next time. The gorilla was happy too and waited patiently for the boy to come back.
