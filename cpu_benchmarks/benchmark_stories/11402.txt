Once upon a time, there lived two friends, Tom and Sam. Tom had a very fierce toy, a lion. Sam asked Tom, if he could lend him his fierce toy. Tom happily agreed and said “Yes!” Sam was so happy that he hugged Tom and thanked him.
Tom lent Sam the fierce toy and asked him to take care of it. Sam was so excited to have the fierce toy that he proudly told everyone about it. Everyone was so surprised that the fierce toy belonged to Sam and not to Tom.
But one day, something unexpected happened. Sam lost the fierce toy and he was so worried that he cried. He asked everyone if they have seen the fierce toy. But unfortunately, no one knew where it was. 
Tom, seeing his friend was so sad, offered to help. He looked for the fierce toy in every corner and luckily found it. Sam was so happy and he thanked Tom for lending him the toy and for his help. From then on, Tom and Sam were the best of friends.
