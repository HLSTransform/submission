Once upon a time there was a hunter. He loved yummy food, so he went to the forest to try to find some. While he was looking around, a rabbit came up to him. The rabbit said, "I know of a place where there's lots of yummy food! Would you like me to show you the way?"
The hunter wasn't sure if he should trust the rabbit. He thought about it for a few moments and finally said, " Yes, please show me the way ".
So the rabbit led the hunter to a secret tree. When the hunter got there, he saw that there were lots of yummy fruits hanging from the branches! The hunter was so full and happy, he thanked the rabbit and they became friends.
From then on, the hunter would always trust the rabbit whenever he wanted to find yummy food.
