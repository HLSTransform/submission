Tom and Lily were playing in the garden when they saw a big cloud in the sky. It was dark and angry and made a loud noise. Tom and Lily ran to the house and told their mom.
"Mom, there is a big cloud and it is going to rain a lot!" Tom said.
"Let's go inside and wait for the rain to stop," mom said. "We don't want to get wet and cold."
But Tom and Lily liked the rain. They wanted to splash in the puddles and make boats with leaves. They did not want to go inside and play with their toys.
"Please, mom, can we stay outside for a little bit?" Lily asked.
"No, sweetie, it is not safe. The rain can make a flood and carry you away. You have to listen to me and come inside," mom said.
Tom and Lily did not like mom's answer. They tried to resist and stay outside. They cried and stomped their feet and said no. But mom was firm and took them by the hand and led them inside.
They looked out the window and saw the rain falling harder and harder. The garden was full of water and mud. The flowers and the grass were drowning. The cloud was still in the sky and it was not going away.
Tom and Lily felt sad and scared. They wished they had listened to mom and gone inside sooner. They hugged mom and said they were sorry.
"It's okay, my loves, I forgive you. You are safe and dry now. The rain will stop soon and the sun will come out. Then we can go outside and clean the garden and plant new flowers and grass. But for now, let's play with your toys and read a story. How about that?" mom said.
Tom and Lily nodded and smiled. They followed mom to the living room and picked their favorite toys and books. They forgot about the rain and the flood and the cloud. They only saw mom's love and warmth. They were happy and grateful. They learned a lesson. They would not resist mom again. She knew what was best for them.
