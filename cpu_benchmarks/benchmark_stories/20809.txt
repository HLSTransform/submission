Once upon a time, there were two friends who liked to share. One day, the friends decided to share some yogurt. They opened the cup and found that the yogurt was yellow. The friends smiled and started to eat together. They each took a big spoon and shared the yogurt. It was yummy! The friends split the yellow yogurt until it was all gone. After, they hugged and said goodbye. The two were happy to have shared the yellow yogurt together.
