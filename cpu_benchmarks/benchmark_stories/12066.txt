Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a pretty apron to wear while they baked cookies together. Lily felt so happy and proud to wear her new apron.
As they mixed the cookie dough, Lily's mommy said, "I think we should change the recipe today and add some chocolate chips." Lily thought that was a great idea and said, "Yes, let's change it!"
After they finished making the cookies, Lily's mommy brought them to a party. All of the kids loved the cookies and asked Lily's mommy for the recipe. Soon, the chocolate chip cookies became very popular and everyone wanted to make them.
Lily felt so happy that she helped make something that was so popular. She said to her mommy, "I love baking with you and wearing my pretty apron!"
