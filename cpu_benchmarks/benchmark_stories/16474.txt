Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books. But they do not have much furniture. They only have a bed, a table and a chair.
One day, their mom says, "I have a surprise for you. Come with me." She takes them to the living room. There, they see a big box. It has a picture of a sofa on it.
"What is this, mom?" Lily asks.
"It is a sofa, my dear. It is a new piece of furniture for your room. You can sit on it, read on it, or nap on it. Do you like it?" mom says.
"Yes, we like it! Thank you, mom!" Ben says.
Mom helps them open the box and take out the sofa. It is soft and colorful. It has pillows and a blanket. Mom says, "This sofa is easy to assemble. You just have to snap the legs on. Do you want to help me?"
"Yes, we want to help!" Lily and Ben say. They take the legs and snap them on the sofa. They hear a click sound. They are happy. They have gained a new sofa.
They hug mom and say, "Thank you, mom! You are the best!"
Mom smiles and says, "You are welcome, my loves. Now, you can enjoy your new furniture. But remember to share and be careful. And don't forget to clean up your toys and books when you are done playing."
Lily and Ben nod and say, "OK, mom. We will."
They run to their room with their new sofa. They put it next to their bed. They sit on it, read on it, and nap on it. They are very happy. They have gained a new sofa and a new place to play.
