Once there was a little girl named Lily who was very brave. Every day, she dreamed of performing in front of a large crowd. She often practiced singing and dancing in her bedroom. 
But one day, Lily's mom and dad told her something exciting. They said they were taking her on a special vacation to an igloo! Lily was so happy and could hardly sleep that night in anticipation of her trip. 
When they arrived at the igloo, Lily was impressed. It was huge, and beautifully decorated. The walls were made of shining ice blocks, and the bed was the softest wool. Everything was so attractive! 
Lily's parents said she was going to perform in front of the igloo visitors the next day. They said it would be a great opportunity for her to show off her skills. 
That evening, Lily practiced her singing and dancing. She was so excited to finally show off her talent. She knew it was going to be an amazing performance.
