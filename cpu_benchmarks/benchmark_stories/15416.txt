Once upon a time there was a lucky shoe. It belonged to a little girl called Jenny. She was very happy to have such a lovely shoe. 
One day Jenny decided to take her lucky shoe out for a walk. She followed the shoe down a winding path until she came to a park. The shoe seemed to be interested in the flowers and the trees. Jenny followed it. 
Eventually, they reached a pond. The shoe hopped onto a lily pad and started to skip across the pond! Jenny was so amazed that she followed the shoe, jumping from one lily pad to the next. 
Finally, the lucky shoe hopped onto the bank and both Jenny and the shoe were happy and tired. Jenny put her shoe safely on her foot and they walked home together. 
The end.
