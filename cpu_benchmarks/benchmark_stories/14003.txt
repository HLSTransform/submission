Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to play with his ball. He would kick it all day. One day, Tim saw a fire in the forest. The fire was big and hot. Tim was scared.
A careless bird had dropped a stick from the fire into the dry leaves. The fire grew bigger and bigger. Tim wanted to help put out the fire. He thought of his ball and had an idea.
Tim kicked his ball into the fire. The ball rolled over the fire and put it out. The forest was safe again. Tim was happy that he could help. Everyone thanked Tim for being brave and smart.
