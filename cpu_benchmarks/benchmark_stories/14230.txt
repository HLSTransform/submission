Once upon a time, there was a very happy little girl called Evie. She was three years old and loved music. One day, her mommy said to her: 
"Evie, would you like to learn how to play the violin?"
Evie was excited and said yes. Her mommy smiled and took her to a special school. The teacher there was called Mrs. Joyce. Mrs. Joyce was very kind, but she told Evie that she would have to practice very hard if she wanted to learn how to play the violin.
Evie worked hard and Mrs. Joyce was so happy with Evie's progress that she said:
"Evie, you have worked so hard and now you can lead the music during the school recital!"
Evie felt so proud! Everyone in the school was amazed by her talent. Even the other students who had been ignorant of Evie's skill before, now clapped and cheered for her when she led the music. 
The end.
