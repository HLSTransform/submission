Once upon a time there was a little girl called Maggie. She really liked to play games.
One day, she was playing a game with her family. She was really excited because she had a chance to win.
Maggie shouted, "I want to win!"
Maggie's mommy said, "That's great, Maggie! Just focus and do your best."
So Maggie tried and tried. And eventually, she won! She was so happy, she did a happy dance. She jumped and shouted, "I won!" 
That night when everyone went to sleep, Maggie's mommy saw something very rare and wet. It was raining outside and the street was wet. She said, "Maggie, look! You won and we have a rare wet moment outside. Let's go have fun!‚Äù  
So Maggie, her mommy and all the family put on their raincoats, went outside and danced in the rare wet rain. It was wonderful!
