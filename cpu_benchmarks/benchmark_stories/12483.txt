Tom and Lily were very excited to go on a tour of the zoo with their mom and dad. They wanted to see the lions, the monkeys, the elephants and the penguins. They held their parents' hands and followed the guide who told them about the animals.
But when they reached the bear enclosure, Tom saw a big red balloon that someone had left on a bench. He let go of his dad's hand and ran to get the balloon. He did not listen to his dad who called him to come back. He wanted to play with the balloon.
Lily saw what Tom did and felt scared. She did not want to lose her brother or get in trouble. She shouted to Tom, "Tom, come back! The bears are dangerous! You have to be obedient!"
But Tom did not hear her. He was too busy blowing the balloon and making it bigger and bigger. He did not see the bear that was watching him from behind the fence. The bear was hungry and curious. It wanted to see what the balloon was.
The bear reached out its paw and tried to grab the balloon. But the balloon was too far away. The bear growled and roared. It made a loud noise that scared Tom. He dropped the balloon and turned around. He saw the bear and screamed.
His mom and dad heard him and ran to him. They hugged him and took him away from the fence. They were angry and worried. They told him he was very naughty and he could have been hurt. They said he had to say sorry to Lily and the guide and the other people on the tour.
Tom felt bad. He realized he had made a mistake. He said sorry to everyone and promised to be obedient. He did not want to play with balloons anymore. He wanted to see the rest of the animals and be safe. He held his dad's hand and did not let go. Lily held his other hand and smiled. She was glad he was okay. They finished the tour and learned a lot. They had fun, but they also remembered to be careful.
