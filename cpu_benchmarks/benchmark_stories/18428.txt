Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat yummy food like apples and bananas. One day, her mommy made her a sandwich with peanut butter and jelly. It was so tasty!
Later that day, Lily's daddy came home and said, "Let's go for a drive!" They hopped in the car and drove to the park. When they got there, Lily saw a big, dry playground. She ran over to the slide and climbed up to the top. Wheee! She slid down and giggled.
After playing for a while, they got back in the car and drove home. Lily was tired from all the fun, but happy and full from the yummy food she had eaten earlier. She fell asleep in the car and dreamed about the next time she could go on a drive with her family. The end.
