Once upon a time, there was a brilliant girl. She was so clever that she could twist anything she touched with her little palm. One day, she was playing with her toy truck in the park when she saw a rope. She thought it would be fun to twist it in her hands and make a big knot. She used one hand to hold the rope and the other one to tightly twist it until it would not move anymore. She went back to playing with her toy truck, but when she returned to the rope it was untwisted! The brilliant girl had used her palm to twist the rope so well that it stayed together until someone else came and untwisted it. She smiled and went back to her toy truck, full of joy.
