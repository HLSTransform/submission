Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the wild forest near his house. One day, he found a cell phone on the ground. He picked it up and said, "Hello?"
"Hi there! My name is Sarah. I lost my cell phone in the forest. Can you help me find it?"
Timmy said, "Sure! I will look for it." He sat down on a log and started to search for the lost cell phone. After a few minutes, he found it under a bush.
"Yay! I found it!" Timmy shouted. He ran back to his house and gave the cell phone to Sarah.
"Thank you so much, Timmy! You are very kind," Sarah said.
Timmy smiled and sat down on his porch, feeling happy that he could help someone.
