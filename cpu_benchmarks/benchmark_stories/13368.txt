Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved music. She had a big box full of CDs and cassettes that her mom gave her. One day, her mom told her that they were going on a trip to the beach. Lily was very excited, but she knew she couldn't bring all of her music with her.
Before they left, Lily's mom told her to unpack her music box and choose only a few CDs to bring. Lily didn't want to leave any of her music behind, but she knew her mom was wise and always made good choices. So, she carefully picked out her favorite CDs and put them in her backpack.
When they arrived at the beach, Lily was happy to hear the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. She couldn't wait to play in the sand and swim in the ocean. But, as the sun began to set, Lily remembered her music. She asked her mom if they could listen to some music while they watched the sunset.
Her mom smiled and pulled out Lily's backpack. Inside was her music box, and Lily had unknowingly packed all of her CDs! Lily was so happy and grateful to her mom for being so wise and helping her bring all of her music to the beach. They listened to their favorite songs while watching the beautiful sunset, and Lily knew it was going to be a wonderful trip.
