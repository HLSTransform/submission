One day, a mum and her obedient three-year-old daughter went to a nearby park. They brought a bright, yellow rubber ball. As they were playing, the rubber ball accidentally flew over the fence. The mum looked at her daughter and asked, “Can you please rescue the ball?” The daughter said, “Yes, mum!”
The daughter bravely climbed the fence, then tiptoed through the thick, green grass. She saw the rubber ball and scooped it up. Suddenly, the ball started to squirm. The daughter gasped and opened her hands to see a baby puppy!
The daughter happily smiled and said, “Mummy, I found a puppy! Can we keep it?” The mum smiled. “Yes, of course. We will take it home and look after it.”
The obedient daughter held the puppy carefully in her arms and hugged it tight. Together with the mum, they went home and welcomed the new puppy into their family.
