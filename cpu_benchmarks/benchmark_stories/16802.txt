Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Teddy. Teddy lived in a cabin in the woods with his family. One day, Teddy's dad came home and said, "Oh no! The printer is broken! We can't print our pictures anymore!"
Teddy asked, "What's broken mean?"
"It means it doesn't work anymore," his dad explained.
Teddy thought for a moment and said, "I can help! I'll go to the store and get a new printer." So, Teddy went to the store and bought a new printer. When he got back to the cabin, his family was so happy.
"Thank you, Teddy!" they all said.
Now, they could print their pictures again and Teddy felt proud that he could help his family.
