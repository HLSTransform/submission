Once upon a time there was a shy ladybug. She wanted to go on an adventure, so she decided to march through the meadow. She hopped and skipped, and stepped over some rocks. Then she noticed a funny, black liquid on the ground. It was ink! She wanted to try it, so she dipped her toes into it. The ink was cold and slimy, and it tickled her feet. 
Suddenly a big brown turtle appeared. He was looking for a snack, and he thought the ink looked tasty. The ladybug hopped out of the way so the turtle could enjoy his snack. The turtle slurped up the ink and thanked the ladybug. 
The two were feeling brave now, so they marched through the meadow together. They looked at all the pretty flowers and waved to the butterflies as they flew by.
At the end of their march, the ladybug and turtle hugged each other goodbye. They had had such a fun time together, and the ladybug was no longer shy. She knew she would always have her friend the turtle, who was so brave and kind.
