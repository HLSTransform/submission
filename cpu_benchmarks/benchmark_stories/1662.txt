Once upon a time, there was a happy family. Mommy, Daddy, and their little girl, Lily. They loved to play and have fun together. But one day, Daddy accidentally broke Mommy's favorite vase. 
Mommy was sad because the vase was very special to her. But Daddy said he would repair it, and Mommy felt better. 
As they waited for the vase to be fixed, Mommy and Daddy talked about their marriage. They said they were excited to be together and promised to always love each other. 
Finally, the vase was repaired and Mommy was very happy. The family hugged and played together, and they knew their love would always be strong.
