Once upon a time there was a little kitten who really wanted to go out to play. She scratched and scratched at the door, trying to get out. Eventually her mommy had to lock the door so the kitten couldn't escape.
The mommy knew that the kitten needed help. She took the little kitten to see the veterinarian. 
The veterinarian was very nice to the little kitten. She gave the kitten a checkup and said that she was healthy and happy.
The veterinarian looked at the mommy and said, "I'm sorry, but you have to keep the door locked so the kitten can't get out again. Make sure you have a litter box inside so she can do her business."
The mommy said thank you to the veterinarian and promised to keep the little kitten safe. She thanked her for her help and understanding. 
The mommy got home, locked the door and soon the little kitten forgot all about wanting to go outside and just enjoyed playing inside, safe and sound.
