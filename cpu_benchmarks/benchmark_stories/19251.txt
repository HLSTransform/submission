Once upon a time, there lived a shy girl. She had big windows in her house and she loved to look out of them. However, one day, a big storm came. The winds were so strong, they almost broke her windows!
The girl was scared, so she asked her mum what she could do to prevent the windows from breaking. Her mum said she had to hang thick curtains over the windows. So the girl did.
After that, it never rained so hard that the windows could break. The big curtains prevented the windows from the strong winds. The girl was so happy that the curtains had saved her windows. And she was happy she had been smart enough to think about protecting the windows. She thanked her mum for thinking of the curtains.
The girl was very proud of herself and she was glad that she had been able to prevent her windows from breaking. From then on, she was no longer shy and she felt proud of her accomplishments.
