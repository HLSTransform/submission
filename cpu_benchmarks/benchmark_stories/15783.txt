Once upon a time there was a little boy named Tim. He really liked sandwiches. Every day he would go to the park to play and he would always bring a sandwich with him.
One day, Tim was playing on the swing and he forgot to hold onto his sandwich. The sandwich slipped out of his hands and fell to the ground.
He was so sad and didn't know what to do. He asked his friend who was playing nearby, "What can I do? My sandwich fell."
His friend told him, "That's okay, Tim. You can pick up the sandwich, brush off the dirt and eat it."
Tim was so happy that he thought of a useful idea. He said, "I know! I can put the sandwich in a lunch box, so it won't fall again!"
From then on, Tim always put his sandwiches in a lunch box and he never lost another one.
