Once there was a farmer who had a barn. He wanted to invite some friends to come and help him do some work in the barn. So he sent out invitations to the animals around the area.
Those animals all arrived at the farmer's barn on the day of the invitation. However, when they got there, they noticed something was wrong. The farmer had set up a fake barn to trick them!
The animals were very angry and they yelled at the farmer. He was sorry that he had tricked them, but he didn't know what else to do. The animals decided to forgive him and help him in the real barn.
From then on, the farmer held a real barn party every year, inviting all of the animals in the area.
