Once upon a time there was an alligator. He lived in a pond near a big city.He was strong but he was also quite fragile.
One day he decided to go explore the city. It was bright and it was noisy but he liked it. He thought he could make some friends.
He met a little girl. She was only 3 years old. She saw the alligator and smiled at him. She waved and said "hello". The alligator felt so happy.
The girl wanted to play with the alligator. She threw a ball to him. The alligator caught it and smiled.
But then some older kids came. They were teasing the alligator. They threw stones at him. The alligator was scared and ran away.
The little girl felt bad for the alligator. She wanted to help him find his way back to his pond. So she followed him. She held his tail so he didn't get lost.
Together they got back to the pond. The alligator swam in the water and felt safe. The girl felt happy that she saved him. They both had a happy ending.
