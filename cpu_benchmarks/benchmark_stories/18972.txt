Once upon a time, there was a big storm. The storm was very loud. It made a little girl named Lily wake up in her bed. Lily was scared of the storm.
Lily had a toy bear named Mr. Bear. Mr. Bear was very useful. He made Lily feel safe. Lily hugged Mr. Bear tight. She knew Mr. Bear would help her feel better.
The storm went away. The sun came out. Lily and Mr. Bear went outside to play. They were happy. The storm was gone, and Lily knew Mr. Bear would always be there to help her.
