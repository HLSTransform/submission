Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy car, but it was broken. One day, her friend Timmy came over to play. He saw the broken car and said, "Can I try to fix it?"
Lily wasn't sure if Timmy could fix it, but she dared him to try. Timmy worked on the car for a long time, and finally, he was able to fix it! Lily was so happy that she gave Timmy a big hug.
Later that day, Lily's mom told her that they had some mail. Lily didn't know what mail was, so her mom explained that it was a letter that someone sent to them. They opened the mail and found a surprise inside - it was a new toy car for Lily! She was so excited and thanked her mom for the special gift.
