Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very adventurous and loved to explore new places. One day, Lily went to visit her grandma who lived in a big house with a fan in every room. 
As Lily was playing, she noticed that one of the fans was not working. She tried to fix it, but she couldn't. Suddenly, she had an idea. She went to the kitchen and got a broom. She used the broom to reach the fan and she started to blink her eyes really fast. 
To her surprise, the fan started to work again! Her grandma was so happy and proud of her. Lily learned that sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of creativity and persistence to solve a problem. 
From that day on, Lily felt even more adventurous and confident in her abilities. She knew that she could accomplish anything if she put her mind to it. The end.
