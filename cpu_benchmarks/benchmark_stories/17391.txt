Sara and Ben like to play in the park. They like to go on the swings, the slide and the seesaw. But their favorite thing is the roundabout. The roundabout is a big circle that can spin fast or slow.
One day, they go to the park with their mom. It is a cold day, so they wear warm hats and coats. They run to the roundabout and take turns to push it. Sara pushes first, and Ben sits on the roundabout. He holds on tight and laughs as he spins. Then Ben pushes, and Sara sits on the roundabout. She holds on tight and smiles as she spins.
But then they see a big boy coming. He is older and taller than them. He has a mean face and a loud voice. He walks to the roundabout and says, "This is mine. Go away." He pushes Sara and Ben off the roundabout and sits on it. He tries to spin, but he is too big. He does not fit on the roundabout. He gets stuck and can not move.
Sara and Ben are scared and sad. They run to their mom and tell her what happened. Their mom hugs them and says, "That was not nice. He should share and be kind." She walks to the roundabout and talks to the big boy. She tells him to get off and say sorry. He does not want to, but he has no choice. He gets off and mumbles sorry. He walks away, looking angry.
Sara and Ben are happy again. They go back to the roundabout and play. They spin and spin and spin. They have fun and forget about the big boy. They are glad they have each other and their mom. They are a good team.
