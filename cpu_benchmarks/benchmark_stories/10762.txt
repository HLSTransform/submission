Once upon a time, there was a brilliant little store by the road. It was small but full of fun things for kids to play with. Every day, many kids came to the store to see what new toys were there.
One day, a boy named Tom went to the store with his mom. They walked down the road, hand in hand, excited to see what they would find. When they got to the store, Tom saw a big, red ball. He loved it so much that his mom bought it for him.
Tom and his mom left the store and walked back down the road, happy with their new toy. They played with the big, red ball all day long, laughing and having fun together. The brilliant little store by the road had made their day so special.
