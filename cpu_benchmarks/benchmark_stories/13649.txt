Sara loved to dance. She danced every day with her mom and dad. She danced in the living room, in the kitchen, and in the garden. She danced when she was happy, when she was bored, and when she was angry. Dancing made her feel good.
One day, Sara went to a dance class with other kids. She was very excited. She wanted to learn new moves and make new friends. But when she got there, she saw that the other kids were better than her. They could jump higher, spin faster, and balance longer. Sara felt sad. She felt like she could not dance.
She ran to her mom and said, "Mom, I want to quit. I can't dance. The other kids are better than me. I don't want to be here."
Her mom hugged her and said, "Sara, don't quit. You can dance. You just need to practice and have fun. The other kids are not better than you. They are different from you. Everyone has their own style and their own pace. You have your own style and your own pace. You are a beautiful dancer. I love to watch you dance."
Sara looked at her mom and smiled. She felt a little better. She said, "Mom, thank you. I love you. I will try again. I will practice and have fun. I will dance with my own style and my own pace."
She went back to the dance class and joined the other kids. She did not compare herself to them. She did not feel sad. She felt happy. She danced with her mom and dad. She danced in the living room, in the kitchen, and in the garden. She danced when she was happy, when she was bored, and when she was angry. Dancing made her feel good.
The moral of the story is: Don't quit something you love because you think you are not good enough. Practice and have fun. Be yourself and enjoy your own style and pace. You are a beautiful dancer.
