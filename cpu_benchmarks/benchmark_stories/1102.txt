One day, a stubborn little girl and her mom went to the beach. The girl wanted to buy a reef. Her mom said, "No, we can't buy a reef." But the little girl was very stubborn and didn't listen. She kept asking her mom to buy a reef. Finally, her mom agreed to help her buy a reef. They walked to the store together. The mom bought a big, beautiful reef for the girl. The girl was so happy. She thanked her mom and ran back to the beach. When she got there, she waved the reef in the air and shouted for joy. She had her new reef and couldn't be happier.
