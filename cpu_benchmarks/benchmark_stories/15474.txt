Once there was a girl. She was walking outside and it was very wet. She saw a celery on the ground. She stopped and picked it up. She took a bite out of the celery and it was so crispy. She liked it so much that she decided to take it home with her.
On the way, she heard a noise. She stopped and looked around. It was raining so she was very wet. She saw a dog barking at her. She was scared, but she rememered the celery in her hand. She slowly ate the rest of it and the dog stopped barking. 
The girl was happy and thanked the celery for saving her. She put the stalk in her pocket and carried on her way, feeling very grateful and safe.
