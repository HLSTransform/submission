Once there was a little girl who had an exam to take. She was feeling very quiet, as exams can be a bit scary. But the girl was very brave and knew that she could do it.
So, the day of the exam came. The girl took out all of her things that she might need during the exam, like her pencil and paper. She was ready to start.
The girl worked very hard on her exam. She read all the questions and tried to think of the answers. Then, she carefully wrote down her answers on the paper.
When the exam was over, the girl put away all of the things she used. She removed the pencil, paper and other things from her desk. 
Finally, the girl felt happier. She had worked hard for her exam and was sure she had done her best.
