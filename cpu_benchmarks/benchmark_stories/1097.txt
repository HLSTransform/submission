Once upon a time there was a fit elephant. Every day he went for a long walk in the forest. He looked around and saw all the animals who were wild and free. The elephant loved feeling the sunshine on his back as he ambled around the woods.
One afternoon, the elephant felt exhausted. He stopped and lay down beneath a big tree. He was so tired, he decided to have a nap. He curled up and went to sleep.
The elephant slept for a long time and dreamed of the days ahead. When he woke up, he felt refreshed and ready to continue his journey. He stood up, stretched his trunk, and said goodbye to the forest. Then, he set off on his way again.
The fit elephant happily returned home after his nap. He had had a wonderful day exploring the forest and resting under a tree. He knew he was ready for more adventures ahead.
