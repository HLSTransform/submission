Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily wanted to find her favorite toy. She looked under her bed and in her closet, but she couldn't find it. Then, she remembered that her toy was in the cabinet. 
Lily went to the cabinet and opened the door. It was very dark inside, but she could see her toy at the back. She reached in and grabbed it. She was so happy to have found her toy! 
From that day on, Lily made sure to put her toy back in its place in the cabinet so she wouldn't have to search for it again.
