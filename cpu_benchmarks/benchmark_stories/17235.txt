Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had a puppy named Max. Max was always happy and playful, but one day he woke up feeling grumpy. Lily noticed that Max wasn't his usual self and asked him what was wrong. 
"I don't know, Lily," said Max. "I just feel grumpy today." 
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "Let's pause and think about something that always makes you happy." 
Max thought for a moment and then remembered how much he loved playing fetch. So, Lily grabbed Max's favorite ball and they played fetch together for a while. 
After playing, Max's grumpiness had disappeared and he was back to his happy self. "Thanks, Lily," said Max. "Playing with you always makes me feel better." 
Lily smiled and hugged Max. "I'm glad you're feeling better, Max. You're my favorite puppy in the whole world!"
