Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to look at the stars in the sky every night. One night, she saw that one of the stars was missing. 
Lily asked her mom, "Where did the star go?" 
Her mom replied, "I don't know, maybe it fell down." 
Lily wanted to help the star, so she went to her room and got a heavy rock. She thought she could replace the missing star with the rock. 
But her mom explained, "The rock is too heavy. It can't replace the star. The star is special and can't be replaced." 
Lily understood and looked up at the sky, hoping the missing star would come back soon.
