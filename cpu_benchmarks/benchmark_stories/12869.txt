Once upon a time, there was an elephant called Jack. Jack loved to go for a stay in the park. While he was walking around the park, he saw something tasty: it was a bright green apple snap on a tree. 
Jack was very excited and tried to reach the apple snap. But the apple snap was high up, so Jack tried and tried. 
Suddenly, Jack heard a voice: "Let me help you!" He looked up and saw a monkey. "You need a helping hand, don't you Jack?" the monkey asked and laughed.
Jack said: "Yes please!" The monkey reached up and plucked the apple snap from the tree. "There you go, Jack," said the monkey.
Jack thanked the monkey, and the monkey replied: "You're very welcome. Now go and enjoy your tasty treat! Bye bye!"
Jack smiled, thanked the monkey again, and then went off to enjoy his tasty apple snap.
