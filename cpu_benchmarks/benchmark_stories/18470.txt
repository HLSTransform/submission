Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play by the river and watch the boats go by. One day, Timmy saw a big, dependable boat that he really liked. He thought to himself, "I want to ride on that boat!" 
Timmy went to his mommy and asked if they could ride on the boat. Mommy said yes and they went to the boat. Timmy was so happy to be on the boat and he thought it was the best boat ever. 
As they rode on the boat, Timmy saw lots of fish in the water and he thought they were funny. He also saw some birds flying in the sky and he thought they were pretty. Timmy was having so much fun on the boat that he didn't want to get off when they got back to the shore. 
From that day on, Timmy always thought about the dependable boat and how much fun he had riding on it. He couldn't wait to go back and ride on it again. The end.
