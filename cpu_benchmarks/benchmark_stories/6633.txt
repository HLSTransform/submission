Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a red cup she liked to drink from. One day, she was playing in the park when she saw an interesting bug. It was small and had shiny wings. She wanted to touch it, but her mom said not to. Suddenly, the bug flew towards her and bit her finger. Lily cried and her mom hugged her. They went to the doctor and he gave her some medicine. From then on, Lily knew to be careful around bugs.
