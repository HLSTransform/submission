Once, there was an ancient mole in a meadow. Every morning, the mole would shout as loud as he could. He shouted so loud, that he could be heard from far away! One morning, a young child heard the mole shouting. The child was very curious, so he decided to go and look for the mole.
The young child walked around the meadow until he finally found the ancient mole. As soon as the mole saw the child, he shouted out a greeting. The child was scared at first, but he quickly learnt that the mole was very friendly.
The ancient mole and the young child became good friends. Every morning, they would meet again in the meadow, and the mole would shout out his greeting. The child loved it every time the mole shouted his greeting - it made him feel happy and safe.
And so, every morning, the ancient mole and the young child began their special friendship. And the mole's ancient shout became a welcome sound that was heard every day in the meadow.
