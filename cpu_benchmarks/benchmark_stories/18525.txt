Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her toys. She had a phone that could make sounds and lights. She loved to pretend that she was talking to her friends and family.
One day, she was playing with her phone in her room, when she heard a loud noise. She ran to the window and saw a big truck hit a car on the street. The car was broken and the driver was hurt. Lily was scared and did not know what to do.
She remembered that her mom had taught her how to use the real phone to call for help. She ran to the kitchen and picked up the phone. She pressed the numbers that her mom had shown her and waited for someone to answer.
"Hello, this is 911. What is your emergency?" a voice said.
"Help, help, there is a big crash outside. A car is broken and a man is hurt. Please come fast!" Lily said.
"OK, calm down, little girl. What is your name and where are you?" the voice asked.
"My name is Lily and I live on Maple Street. The crash is in front of my house. Please hurry!" Lily said.
"Good job, Lily. You are very brave and smart. We are sending help right now. Stay on the line with me until they arrive, OK?" the voice said.
"OK, thank you. I hope the man is OK." Lily said.
Soon, Lily heard sirens and saw lights. She saw an ambulance, a fire truck, and a police car. They stopped near the crash and the helpers got out. They helped the man out of the car and put him on a stretcher. They also put out the fire and moved the truck. Lily watched from the window and felt relieved.
The voice on the phone told Lily that she did a great job and that she should be proud of herself. He also told her to tell her mom what happened when she came home. Lily thanked him and hung up the phone.
When her mom came home, Lily told her everything. Her mom hugged her and praised her for being so brave and helpful. She said that Lily saved the man's life by calling for help. She also said that Lily learned a very important lesson: that sometimes, even little people can do big things. Lily smiled and felt happy. She knew that she had done the right thing.
