Once upon a time, two little kids were very happy. They were riding their bicycles in the park. Suddenly, the older kid had an idea. He said to his friend, "Let's race!"
His friend was excited and said, "OK!"
The two of them started to go very fast. But then the older kid's bicycle got a flat tire. He yelled out in anger and tried to fix it.
Suddenly, the little kid's bicycle chain snapped and came off. He screamed out in fear. Then he started to cry.
The older kid tried to help, but he couldn't fix the bicycle. He was feeling very sad. The little kid was very sharp, so he used a stick to try and make the bicycle work. But he could not.
The two of them ended up having to walk home. They were not happy. The end.
