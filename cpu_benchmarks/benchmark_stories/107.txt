Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He had a big, brown dog named Max. Max loved to play outside and run around, but Timmy was bored. He didn't want to play with Max because he thought it was boring.
One day, Timmy's mom said they were going on a trip to the park. Timmy was excited because he loved going down the slide and swinging on the swings. But when they got there, he saw a sign that said "No Dogs Allowed." Timmy was sad because he wanted Max to come with them.
But then, Timmy's mom said they could go to a different part of the park where dogs were allowed. Timmy was happy again because he could play with Max and have fun. They ran around and played fetch, and Timmy realized that playing with Max wasn't boring at all. It was actually really fun!
