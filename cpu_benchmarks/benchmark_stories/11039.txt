Lisa liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Anna. Anna had a pretty dress, long hair and a smile. Lisa took Anna everywhere with her.
One day, Lisa went to the park with her mom and Anna. She saw some other kids playing with a ball. She wanted to join them, but she did not want to leave Anna alone. She asked her mom if she could put Anna on a bench near the ball.
"Okay, but be careful and don't go too far," her mom said.
Lisa ran to the ball and played with the other kids. She had fun, but she also looked at Anna from time to time. She saw a big boy walking near the bench. He had a mint in his mouth. He saw Anna and picked her up.
"Hey, that's my doll!" Lisa shouted and ran to the boy.
The boy was bossy. He did not listen to Lisa. He said, "This is my doll now. She is better than your other dolls. I like her dress and her hair."
He pulled Anna's hair and tore her dress. He also bit her face with his mint. Anna looked sad and hurt.
Lisa was angry and sad. She cried and tried to get Anna back. She said, "No, she is not your doll. She is my doll. You are mean and bad. You hurt Anna. Give her back to me!"
Her mom heard Lisa and came to help her. She saw what the boy did to Anna. She was mad at the boy. She said, "How dare you do that to Lisa's doll? That is very rude and wrong. You should apologize and give Anna back to Lisa."
The boy was scared of Lisa's mom. He dropped Anna and ran away. He did not say sorry.
Lisa hugged Anna and thanked her mom. She said, "Mom, can you fix Anna? She is broken and dirty. I love her."
Her mom said, "Don't worry, Lisa. We can restore Anna. We can wash her face, sew her dress and comb her hair. She will be as good as new. You are a good girl and you love your dolls."
Lisa smiled and said, "Thank you, mom. You are the best. I love you and Anna."
