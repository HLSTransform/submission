Once upon a time, there was a big sheep. The sheep had a lot of wool on its body. The wool was heavy and made the sheep tired. One day, a man came and put the sheep's wool in a sack. The sheep was happy because it didn't have to carry the heavy wool anymore. The man took the sack and went away. The sheep was happy and went to sleep.
