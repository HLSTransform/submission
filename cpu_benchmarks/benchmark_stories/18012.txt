Once upon a time, there was a raven named Jack. Jack was very careful when he flew in the sky. One day, Jack saw a big tree with shiny apples. Jack wanted to eat the apples, but he was afraid to fall. 
Jack asked his friend, a squirrel named Sammy, "Can you help me get the apples?" Sammy said, "Sure, I can help you." Sammy climbed up the tree and picked an apple. He threw it down to Jack. Jack caught the apple, but he was not careful. He dropped the apple and it struck Sammy on the head. 
Sammy fell down from the tree and got hurt. Jack felt very bad. He said, "I'm sorry, Sammy. I didn't mean to strike you with the apple." Sammy forgave Jack, but he had to go to the hospital. Jack learned a lesson to be more careful in the future.
