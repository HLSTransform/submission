Once there was a little boy named Tommy. Tommy loved to collect things. His favorite thing to collect were shiny rocks.
One day Tommy went to school. He entered his classroom and he was very excited. He saw that his teacher was very patient and he smiled at her.
Tommy's teacher told him she was going outside to collect leaves. Tommy was so excited! He went outside with the rest of the class and they collected leaves. They collected them in a special bucket.
Tommy was so proud of all the leaves he collected. His teacher praised him for being so patient while they collected the leaves. Tommy was so happy he ran back inside and showed the leaves to the other kids in his class. 
The end.
