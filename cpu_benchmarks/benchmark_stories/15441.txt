Billy was an obedient three year old. One day, he saw a mirror in the toy shop and wanted to buy it. His mom said he could get it for his birthday. Billy was excited but he had to wait, so he was very obedient and delayed. 
Billy's birthday came and he got the mirror. He put it on the wall in his bedroom. He was so happy he could look at himself in it every day. In the mirror, he could see himself being obedient and he was very proud.
Billy's friends also liked the mirror and eventually, Billy taught all of them to be obedient like him. They frequently checked the mirror together to make sure they were doing the right thing.
Billy is still obedient today and looks in the mirror every day to remind himself to stay this way!
