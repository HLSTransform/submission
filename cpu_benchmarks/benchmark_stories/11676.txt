Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She was 3 years old and very excited, because it was time to decorate her truck. She put a big smile on her face, while her parents grabbed the decorations. But when they started to hang up the decorations, Amy got a bit nervous.
"Don't worry," said her mom. "It will be beautiful once we are done!" 
Amy smiled, feeling a bit better.
The decorations were bright and colorful. There were stars and balloons and even a few butterflies. Amy liked it!
When they were done, Amy's truck was perfect. She jumped up and down, clapping her hands with joy.
"This is the best truck ever!" she cheered.
Her parents smiled, happy that she was so excited. They all climbed into the truck, and drove off together into the sunset.
