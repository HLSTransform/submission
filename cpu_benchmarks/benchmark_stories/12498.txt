Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the museum with his mommy. They would walk around and look at all the pretty things. One day, Timmy saw a toy he really wanted to play with. But his mommy said no, they couldn't play with it because it was behind glass. Timmy sighed and was sad.
Later, Timmy and his mommy went to a different part of the museum. Timmy saw another toy he wanted to play with, but it was also behind glass. Timmy got really upset and started crying. His mommy tried to calm him down, but he wouldn't stop crying.
Suddenly, the glass broke and the toy fell out. Timmy was so happy and started playing with the toy. But then, the museum workers came and told Timmy and his mommy they had to leave. They were in trouble for breaking the glass. Timmy was sad again and his mommy was upset. They never went back to the museum again.
