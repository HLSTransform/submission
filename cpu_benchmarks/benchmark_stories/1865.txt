One day in the forest, a three year old boy named Joey was walking through the woods. He came upon a clearing; looking around he could see a big fire in the middle. He was filled with awe! He went closer to observe it. 
Joey was drawn in by the fire's warm light. He leaned in close and noticed that the fire was made of incredible colors! He wondered how a fire could be such a pretty thing. 
Suddenly a little voice from behind Joey said, "If you throw rocks into the fire, then the colors will become even more beautiful!" Joey turned around and saw a tiny fairy. Joey smiled and asked, "Really?" 
The little fairy nodded and said, "Yes, really! Give it a try and you'll see for yourself!" 
Joey excitedly collected a few rocks, and carefully threw them into the fire one by one. As the rocks hit the fire, the colors began to dance and swirl around the flames, becoming even more incredible! 
He then thanked the tiny fairy and ran off, with a newfound appreciation for the beauty of fire.
