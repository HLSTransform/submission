Once upon a time, there was a silly girl who loved playing with yarn. Every day, she would collect a different type of yarn from her mommy and spread it all over the floor. She would laugh and giggle as she scattered the yarn like a rainbow.
But one day, she ran across an ugly, tangled piece of yarn. She held it in the palms of her hands and examined it closely. She was confused and thought it was ugly!
Still, she decided to scatter the ugly yarn along with all the other colorful pieces. She placed it right between the blues and yellows and watched it sparkle in the light.
At the end of the day, the girl was happy with the mess she had made. Even the ugly yarn had a home amongst all the rest! She watched the piece of yarn twinkle, and felt proud that it found its place.
