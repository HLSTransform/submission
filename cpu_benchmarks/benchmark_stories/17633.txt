Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to go on journeys. One day, she asked her mommy if they could go on a journey to the fair. Her mommy said yes and they packed a picnic basket with yummy snacks.
As they walked to the fair, Lily saw a big hill in the distance. She asked her mommy what was on the other side of the hill. Her mommy explained that they would have to walk over the hill to get to the fair. Lily was excited to see what was on the other side.
When they finally got to the fair, Lily saw lots of bright colors and heard lots of happy sounds. She rode on the Ferris wheel and ate cotton candy. As they were leaving, Lily looked back at the big hill and realized that the journey to the fair was worth it.
