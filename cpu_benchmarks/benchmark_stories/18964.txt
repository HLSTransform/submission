Once upon a time, there was a big red ball. The ball loved to bounce all day. One day, the ball saw a pretty stamp on the ground. The stamp had a picture of a happy sun. The ball wanted to play with the stamp.
The ball bounced over to the stamp. It bounced higher and higher, trying to pick up the stamp. But the ball could not hold the stamp. The ball felt ashamed. It wanted to show the stamp to its friends. The ball had an idea.
The ball bounced very high in the sky. It landed on the stamp with a big "boing!" The stamp stuck to the ball. The ball was happy. It bounced all the way home to show the stamp to its friends. They all loved the stamp and played together.
