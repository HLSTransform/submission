The little girl was sad. Her room was hot and the gray fan was not working. She began to tear. She wanted so badly for the fan to work. All of a sudden she had an idea. She quickly ran to the kitchen and grabbed some spoons. She climbed up on her bed and carefully placed them in the fan. She pressed the button and, to her surprise, the fan started to work! The cool air filled the room and the little girl smiled. She was so happy that the fan was working again. She ran around the room with glee, happy that she had fixed the fan all by herself.
