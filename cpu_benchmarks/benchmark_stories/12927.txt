Alice was a very restless 3-year-old. She couldn't sit still and she loved to explore every single day. Today she decided to go explore her closet. It was filled with all kinds of interesting things she hadn't seen before. She jumped in and started playing around.
Suddenly, her mom opened the closet door. "Alice, what are you doing in here?!" she said.
Alice grinned and said, "Mommy, I'm sendin' lots of fun things in here!"
Mom smiled and said, "You sure are! Let's get you out of the closet now and have lunch."
Alice happily hopped out of the closet and headed off for lunch. She felt very happy that her mom had been understanding and patient. She had a feeling that this exploration wouldn't be her last - she was so restless!
