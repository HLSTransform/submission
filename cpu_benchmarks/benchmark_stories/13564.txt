Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside in the rain. One day, she found a cat hiding under a bush. The cat was wet because it had been raining. 
Lily picked up the cat and brought it inside her house. She dried the cat with a towel and gave it some milk to drink. The cat was very happy and purred loudly. 
Later, Lily's mom came home and saw the cat. She was surprised because Lily had never had a cat before. Lily revealed that she found the cat outside in the rain. Her mom was very proud of her for being kind to the cat. From that day on, the cat became Lily's best friend.
