Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play with cars and trucks. They have many cars and trucks of different colors and sizes. Tom has a big red truck that can reverse. Sue has a small yellow car that can beep.
One day, they go to the park with their cars and trucks. They see a big tree with many birds. The birds are singing and flying. Tom and Sue want to see the birds. They drive their cars and trucks to the tree.
"Look, Sue, a blue bird!" Tom says, pointing to the sky.
"Wow, it is so pretty!" Sue says, looking up.
They park their cars and trucks under the tree. They get out and walk to the tree. They try to talk to the birds.
"Hello, birds!" Tom says.
"Hi, hi, hi!" Sue says.
But the birds do not talk back. They only sing and fly. Tom and Sue are sad.
"Maybe the birds do not like us," Tom says.
"Maybe they are too rich," Sue says.
"Why do you say that?" Tom asks.
"Because they have a big tree and many friends and they can fly," Sue says.
Tom thinks for a moment. He has an idea.
"Maybe we can make them like us," he says.
"How?" Sue asks.
"By giving them something they do not have," Tom says.
"What do they not have?" Sue asks.
Tom looks around. He sees his big red truck that can reverse. He smiles.
"Come on, Sue, I have a plan," he says.
He runs to his truck and gets in. He drives it to the tree. He reverses it under a branch. He honks the horn.
"Beep, beep, beep!" he says.
Sue sees what Tom is doing. She thinks it is funny. She runs to her car and gets in. She drives it to the tree. She beeps the horn.
"Beep, beep, beep!" she says.
The birds hear the noise. They stop singing and flying. They look down. They see the cars and trucks. They are curious. They fly down to the cars and trucks. They land on them. They peck them. They flap their wings.
Tom and Sue are happy. They laugh and clap. They talk to the birds.
"Hello, birds!" Tom says.
"Hi, hi, hi!" Sue says.
The birds talk back. They make different sounds. They sound like the cars and trucks.
"Beep, beep, beep!" a blue bird says.
"Reverse, reverse, reverse!" a red bird says.
Tom and Sue are amazed. They think the birds are smart and funny. They play with the birds. They share their cars and trucks with the birds. The birds share their tree and songs with Tom and Sue. They become friends.
The end.
