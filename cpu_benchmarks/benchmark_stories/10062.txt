Lily and Ben were at the cinema with their mom. They wanted to see a funny movie with animals. Mom bought them popcorn and juice. They found their seats and waited for the movie to start.
"Shh, be quiet," mom whispered. "The movie is starting soon."
Lily and Ben nodded. They liked popcorn. They put some in their mouths and crunched. It was salty and yummy. They drank some juice. It was sweet and cold.
The movie was very funny. Lily and Ben laughed a lot. They saw a dog, a cat, a bird, and a mouse. They did silly things and made funny noises. Lily and Ben liked the dog best. He was clumsy and cute.
But then, something bad happened. Ben spilled his juice on his lap. He gasped and felt wet and sticky. He tried to wipe it with his napkin, but it was too late. The juice dripped on the floor and made a puddle.
"Oh no, I'm sorry," Ben whispered. He looked at mom. He hoped she was not angry.
Mom smiled and hugged him. "It's okay, Ben. Accidents happen. Don't worry. We can clean it later. Just enjoy the movie."
Ben smiled back and hugged mom. He felt better. He reached for more popcorn, but he was clumsy too. He knocked over the popcorn bag and it fell on the floor. The popcorn scattered everywhere.
"Oh no, not again," Ben whispered. He looked at Lily. He hoped she was not mad.
Lily giggled and helped him pick up the popcorn. "It's okay, Ben. It's just popcorn. We still have some left. Here, have some."
Ben thanked her and took some popcorn. He felt happy. He had a nice mom and a nice sister. He liked the cinema. He liked the popcorn. He liked the movie. He laughed again and watched the dog. He was clumsy and cute, just like him.
