Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the park to play with her friends. One day, she saw a pony in the park. Lily was so excited to see the pony, and she wanted to pet it. 
Lily went to the pony and said, "Hi, pony! Can I pet you?" The pony said, "Yes, you can pet me, but be careful. My tail is bitter." Lily didn't understand what the pony meant, but she wanted to pet it anyway. 
Lily reached out to pet the pony's tail, and she pulled it. The pony jumped and said, "Ouch! I told you my tail is bitter!" Lily felt bad for hurting the pony, and she apologized. From that day on, Lily always remembered to be careful around the pony and never pulled its tail again.
