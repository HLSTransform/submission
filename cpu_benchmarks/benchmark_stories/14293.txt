Once upon a time, there were two friends who were competing in a race. They wanted to show each other who was faster. They were so excited, it was like a special game. 
On the day of the race, the two friends were ready. They lined up and when the whistle blew, they started running. Both of them ran very fast, but one of them was faster and had the victory. Even though the other friend lost the race, they were still happy.
That night, they celebrated the victory with a feast. They had lots of food but the food was so dull that they barely ate. After their dull dinner, they remembered that victory is still sweet even if it doesn't taste good.
The two friends were so proud because they had victory. They hugged each other and smiled, remembering how fun the race had been. Then both of them went to sleep, happy that they had been part of such an exciting adventure.
