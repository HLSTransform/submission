Lily has a cat named Mimi. Mimi is very small and soft. She has white fur and blue eyes. Lily loves Mimi very much. She likes to play with her and cuddle her.
One day, Lily wants to give Mimi a gift. She finds a pink collar with a bell in her drawer. She thinks Mimi will look pretty with the collar. She puts the collar around Mimi's neck and fastens it. She says, "Mimi, you look so cute!"
But Mimi does not like the collar. She feels it is too tight and noisy. She tries to scratch it off with her paws. She meows loudly and runs away. Lily is sad. She does not understand why Mimi does not like her gift.
She follows Mimi to the living room. She sees Mimi hiding under the sofa. She kneels down and reaches out her hand. She says, "Mimi, please come out. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make you happy."
Mimi peeks out from under the sofa. She sees Lily's face and hears her voice. She knows Lily is not angry. She knows Lily loves her. She comes out slowly and rubs her head against Lily's hand. Lily smiles and hugs Mimi. She says, "Mimi, I love you. You don't need a collar to look pretty. You are beautiful just the way you are."
She takes off the collar and puts it back in her drawer. She decides to give Mimi a different gift. She finds a feather toy and waves it in front of Mimi. Mimi jumps and chases the toy. She purrs and plays happily. Lily and Mimi have fun together. They are best friends.
