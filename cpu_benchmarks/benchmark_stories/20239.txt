Sara and Ben were twins who lived on a big ranch with many animals. They liked to play with the horses, the cows, the sheep and the chickens. They also liked to help their mom and dad with the chores.
One day, Sara and Ben decided to explore the barn. They opened the door and saw a lot of hay, tools, and a big tractor. They climbed on the tractor and pretended to drive it. They made loud noises and laughed.
"Beep beep! Move, cows!" Sara shouted.
"Vroom vroom! We are going to the market!" Ben said.
They did not see the cat that was sleeping on the tractor's seat. The cat was scared by the noise and jumped off. It ran to the door and pushed it with its paw. The door closed with a bang.
Sara and Ben stopped playing. They looked at the door and saw that it was locked. They tried to open it, but it was too heavy and hard. They started to cry.
"Help! Help! We are stuck!" they yelled.
Their mom and dad heard their cries and came to the barn. They saw the cat sitting outside the door. They guessed what happened and opened the door. They hugged Sara and Ben and wiped their tears.
"Are you okay, sweeties?" their mom asked.
"Yes, mom. We are sorry. We did not mean to close the door," Sara said.
"We were just playing with the tractor. We did not see the cat," Ben said.
Their dad smiled and said, "It's okay. We are not mad. But you have to be careful in the barn. There are many things that can hurt you or the animals. And you have to respect the cat's nap time."
Sara and Ben nodded and said, "We understand, dad. We love you and the cat."
They all went back to the house. The cat followed them and purred. Sara and Ben gave the cat some milk and a pat. They learned their lesson and never closed the door again. They lived happily on the calm ranch.
