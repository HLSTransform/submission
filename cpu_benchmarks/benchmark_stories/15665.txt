The three bears were walking through the forest. Mama Bear said, "I think I know where we should go!" 
Little Bear guessed, "Is it the lake? Is it the woods? Is it the meadow?"
Mama Bear smiled and said, "Guess again!" 
Big Bear said, "I think it's Grandma's house!"
Mama Bear said, "That's right! Let's go!"
They arrived at Grandma's house and she was very happy to see them. Grandma was bossy and said, "Let's go inside, I have something special for you all." They walked into the kitchen, and Grandma handed each of them a teaspoon. 
Little Bear asked, "What is this for?"
Grandma answered, "You can use it to eat your soup!"
Big Bear grinned and said, "Yay! Soup!"
Mama Bear said, "Let's eat!"
And they all sat down to enjoy Grandma's special soup.
