Once upon a time, there was a girl with long hair who was playing with her friends. She was having a great time, until a rude man walked up to them. He pointed at her purse and said "Give me that." She got scared and her friends ran away. The girl kept her purse safe and ran away too. When the man realised the girl had run away, he got really mad and started to shout.
The girl ran all the way to her house and when she got there she called her mum. Her mum answered and she said, "Mum, a rude man wanted to take my purse but I said 'no' and ran away!" Her mum was so proud of her for standing up to the man and told her to stay safe inside the house. 
From then on, the girl always held on tight to her purse whenever she went out to play. She had learned a very important lesson that day - never talk to strangers!
