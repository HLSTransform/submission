Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He loved to play with his toys in his room. One day, his mom gave him a ball that was tight and bouncy. Tim was so happy and he wanted to play with it right away.
But mom said, "Tim, you cannot play with the ball in the house. I will not permit it." Tim was sad, but he knew he had to listen to his mom. So, he put the ball away and played with his other toys.
The next day, the sun was shining and it was warm outside. Mom said, "Tim, you can take your tight ball outside to play now." Tim was so excited and ran outside. He played with his tight ball and had so much fun. And he knew that waiting for the right time was worth it.
