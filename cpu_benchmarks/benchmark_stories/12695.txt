Once upon a time there was a jolly little girl. She liked to pretend. She had a special stick and she pretended it was magic.
One day the magic stick flew her away and took her on an amazing adventure. She went to a far away valley filled with giant plants and beautiful birds.
While she was there she pretended to be a brave explorer. She climbed trees, crossed rivers, and sang magical songs. Then she found a special cave, it was filled with sparkles and candy. 
She collected the candy and sparkles and held them tight in her hands. Then she flew back home with her magic stick and shared her candy and sparkles with her family.
The jolly little girl was so happy that she had gone on an amazing adventure. She had so much fun pretending with her magic stick.
