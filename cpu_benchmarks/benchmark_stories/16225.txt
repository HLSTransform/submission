Sara was very upset. She had just received her first lecture from her teacher. She didn't understand why she was scolded for talking in class.
Sara's mom came to pick her up from school. "What happened today, hon?" she asked.
Sara said, "I talked in class, and my teacher said I have to pay."
Mom replied, "I'm sorry you got a lecture. But, if your teacher said you need to pay, it's important that you do it."
Sara nodded. She knew Mom was right. "Ok, Mom," she answered.
"Good," Mom said as she hugged Sara. "Let's go home and talk more about it."
Together they went home and discussed why it's important to follow the rules at school. In the end, Sara was no longer upset. She had learned her lesson and knew what to do next time.
