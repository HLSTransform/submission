Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was very stubborn and always wanted his way. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the park to play on the swings. Timmy wanted to swing very high, but his mom told him to be careful and not go too high.
Timmy didn't listen to his mom and kept swinging higher and higher. Suddenly, he fell off the swing and hit his head on the ground. His mom rushed him to the hospital, but the doctors couldn't save him.
Timmy's mom was very sad and wished she had recorded their last conversation at the park. She also wished she had made him sit in a safer seat on the swing. From that day on, Timmy's mom always made sure to record their conversations and made sure Timmy sat safely on all his swings.
