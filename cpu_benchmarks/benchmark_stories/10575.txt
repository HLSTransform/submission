Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sophie. She was very organized and loved order! She was playing in her room one day, when she heard a noise from the living room. When Sophie came down to investigate, she saw that her mommy was there and she had a scarf. 
Sophie's mommy said, "Sophie, I need your help. There's a naughty bear outside and he's trying to destroy everything!" 
Sophie was brave and said, "Let's chase him away! I can help!" 
Sophie's mommy gave her the scarf, and said, "Run outside and wave this scarf in the air as high as you can! The bear will be scared and run away when he sees it." 
So Sophie ran outside and waved the scarf around and around. Sure enough, the bear saw it, and he was scared. He ran away and didn't come back. Sophie was so proud of herself and her mommy was so proud of her too. 
This brave act made Sophie feel very organized and strong.
