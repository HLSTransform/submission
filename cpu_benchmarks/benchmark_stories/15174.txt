Once upon a time, there was a little monkey named Max. Max was always eager to explore and admired the world around him. 
One day, Max was walking by a large tree. He saw a glistening banana and wanted to try it. He was very determined and climbed up the tree, but it was a long way and climbing was hard.
After a while, Max finally made it to the top. He reached up and picked the banana, but as soon as he held it in his hand, he heard a loud voice.
"Hey! That's my banana!", shouted the angry voice. Max quickly looked down, and saw an angry man standing at the bottom of the tree.
Max was so scared that he dropped the banana and hurried back down the tree. When he reached the bottom the man grabbed him and scolded him for being so naughty. Poor Max was so frightened.
Max never dared to admire the world around him ever again.
