Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she was walking in the park when she saw a sad boy sitting on a bench. 
"Hi there, what's wrong?" asked Lily.
"I lost my favorite pole," replied the boy. "I can't fish without it."
Lily cared about the boy's feelings and wanted to help him. She looked around and found a cheerful yellow stick. "Here, you can use this one!" she said, handing it to him.
The boy smiled and thanked her. "This is perfect! Thank you so much!" he exclaimed. 
Lily was happy to have made a new friend and the boy was grateful for her kindness. From that day on, they would often play together in the park and go fishing with the cheerful yellow pole.
