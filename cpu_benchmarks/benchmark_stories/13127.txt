Mom had a thoughtful idea. She said to her 3 year old, "Let's send you to the bathroom!" The 3 year old smiled and jumped off her bed. She was excited. She walked down the hallway and made her way to the bathroom. She opened the door and saw a sink, a mirror, and lots of towels on the wall. She was so amazed that she couldn't help but smile. She washed her hands and face, brushed her teeth, and combed her hair. She felt so refreshed afterwards. Finally, mom sent her back to her room and she went to bed with a happy smile.
