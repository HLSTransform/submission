Anna was lonely. She lived in a big house with no friends. She only had her doll, Lily, to play with. She wished she had a real friend to hug and talk to.
One day, she saw a sign in the shop window. It said: "Buy a puppy today! They are cute and friendly and need a home." Anna ran inside and asked the shop lady, "Can I buy a puppy, please?"
The shop lady smiled and said, "Of course, dear. They are in the back. You can choose one you like." She led Anna to a room full of puppies. They were all different colors and sizes. They barked and wagged their tails.
Anna looked at them and felt her heart melt. She wanted to take them all home. But she knew she could only buy one. She saw a small brown puppy in the corner. It looked sad and scared. It did not bark or wag its tail. Anna felt sorry for it. She walked over and picked it up. It licked her face and snuggled in her arms.
"I want this one," Anna said. "He needs a friend, like me."
The shop lady nodded and said, "He is a good choice. He is very sweet and gentle. He just needs some love and care. What will you name him?"
Anna thought for a moment and said, "I will name him Lucky. Because he is lucky to have me, and I am lucky to have him."
The shop lady helped Anna pay for Lucky and gave her a leash and a collar. Anna thanked her and left the shop with her new friend. She felt happy and excited. She could not wait to show Lucky her home and her doll.
She ran all the way to her house and opened the door. She called out, "Mom, Dad, I have a surprise for you!"
She heard her parents' voices from the living room. They were sitting by the fireplace, reading and drinking tea. They looked up and saw Anna and Lucky.
"Anna, what is that?" her mom asked, surprised.
"It's a puppy, Mom. His name is Lucky. I bought him with my allowance. He is my friend. Can I keep him, please?" Anna said, pleading.
Her parents looked at each other and smiled. They saw how happy Anna was and how cute Lucky was. They knew Anna was lonely and needed a companion.
"Of course, you can keep him, Anna," her dad said. "He is adorable. And he is lucky to have you, too."
Anna hugged her parents and thanked them. She introduced Lucky to Lily and put them on the couch. She joined her parents by the fireplace and cuddled with Lucky. She felt warm and cozy. She was not lonely anymore. She had a family and a friend. She was happy.
