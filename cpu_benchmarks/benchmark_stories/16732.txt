Lily and Tom were playing in the kitchen. They saw a big bowl of dough on the table. It looked soft and fun to play with.
"Let's make some shapes with the dough!" Lily said.
"OK!" Tom agreed.
They took some dough and started to roll it and squeeze it. They made balls, snakes, stars and hearts. They put them on a tray.
"Look, we made cookies!" Tom said.
But then they heard a loud noise. It was Mom coming back from the store.
"Oh no, Mom will be angry!" Lily said.
They quickly hid the tray under the table and ran to their room.
Mom came into the kitchen and saw the bowl of dough. She was surprised and confused.
"Who played with the dough?" she asked.
She looked around and saw the tray under the table. She pulled it out and saw the shapes.
"These are not cookies, these are dangerous!" she said.
She saw that some of the dough had bits of dirt, hair and crayons in it.
"Who did this?" she asked again.
Lily and Tom heard Mom and felt guilty. They came out of their room and said sorry.
"We played with the dough, Mom. We wanted to make cookies. We didn't know it was dangerous." they said.
Mom was not happy, but she was also glad they told the truth.
"You should not play with the dough, it is for making bread. It is not safe to eat or touch. You could get sick or hurt." she said.
She threw away the dough and washed the tray.
"Next time, ask me before you touch anything in the kitchen. And if you want to make cookies, I can help you with the right ingredients." she said.
She hugged them and gave them a kiss.
Lily and Tom learned their lesson. They never played with the dough again. They only played with their toys or with Mom. They also learned to tell the truth and say sorry when they did something wrong.
