Once upon a time, there was a nice boy who was very polite. His name was Tom. Tom loved celery! He loved celery so much that he ate it every day.
One day, Tom went to the store to buy some more celery. He met a friendly old man who was also buying celery. "Good morning," said Tom politely. 
The old man looked surprised. "Good morning," he said. "You seem like a very polite boy."
Tom smiled. "I love celery," he said.
The old man smiled too. "I do too," he said.
Tom and the old man both got their celery and said goodbye. Tom waved as he walked away. 
The day ended happily, with Tom enjoying his celery.
