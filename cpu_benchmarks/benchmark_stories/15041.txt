Once upon a time, there was a barber named Roger. Roger was a very clean barber who was always busy giving haircuts to all the people in the town. One day, he decided to teach a special 3 year old child how to cut hair, so they could help him with all the people who came to his shop. 
Roger said, “I will teach you how to cut hair. It’s very important that you keep everything clean and tidy. Do you understand?” The 3 year old smiled and said,”yes! I can do it!"
So, Roger showed the 3 year old how to cut hair properly, but it was very difficult for him. Whenever he tried to do it, his hands would shake and he would make a lot of mistakes. Roger tried to be patient, but eventually he got angry. 
He yelled at the 3 year old, “You are doing it all wrong! You cannot cut hair like this!” The 3 year old was very upset and he cried. This made Roger even angrier, so he decided to stop teaching him and he never let him come back to the barber shop. 
The 3 year old was sad, because he wanted to learn how to cut hair, but he never got the chance. 
The end.
