Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in the living room. One day, they find a big box in the corner. It has a picture of a cart on it. Sara and Ben are curious. They want to see what is inside the box.
They open the box and see a shiny red cart. It has four wheels and a handle. Sara and Ben are happy. They decide to take the cart outside and fill it with flowers and rocks. They think it will be fun.
They put on their shoes and jackets and go to the backyard. They find many flowers and rocks. They put them in the cart. The cart is heavy, but they can pull it. They are proud of their cart.
They see their mom coming out of the house. She has a smile on her face. She says, "What a beautiful cart you have! Where did you get it?"
Sara and Ben say, "We found it in the box. It is ours. We filled it with flowers and rocks. Do you like it?"
Mom says, "I do like it, but I have to tell you something. The cart is not yours. It is a gift for your cousin Lily. She is coming to visit tomorrow. The cart is fragile. It can break easily. You have to be careful with it."
Sara and Ben are surprised. They did not know the cart was for Lily. They feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, mom. We did not know. We thought it was ours. We like the cart. Can we keep it?"
Mom says, "I know you like the cart, but it is not fair to keep it. Lily will be very happy to have it. She does not have many toys. You have many toys. You can share the cart with her when she comes. How about that?"
Sara and Ben think for a moment. They decide to share the cart with Lily. They say, "Okay, mom. We will share the cart with Lily. We will be nice to her. We will be careful with the cart. We will put it back in the box."
Mom says, "That's very kind of you. I'm proud of you. You are good twins. Come on, let's go inside and have some cookies."
Sara and Ben smile. They hug their mom. They take the cart inside and put it back in the box. They are looking forward to meeting Lily. They hope she will like the cart. They hope they will have fun together.
