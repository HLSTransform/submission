Tom and Lily were playing near the river. They liked to throw stones and watch the water splash. They saw some fish and frogs and birds. They were having fun.
But then they heard a loud roar. They looked and saw a big alligator. It had sharp teeth and a long tail. It was hungry and angry. It wanted to eat them.
"Run!" Tom shouted. "Hurry, hurry, hurry!"
Tom and Lily ran as fast as they could. They left their stones and toys behind. They did not look back. They ran to their mom and dad, who were having a picnic.
"Mom, Dad, help!" Lily cried. "There is an alligator!"
Mom and Dad were surprised and scared. They grabbed Tom and Lily and got in the car. They drove away from the river.
"Are you OK?" Mom asked. "Did it hurt you?"
"No, we are OK," Tom said. "But it was very big and scary."
"I'm sorry, kids," Dad said. "We did not know there was an alligator here. This is not normal. We will not come back here again."
Tom and Lily hugged Mom and Dad. They were glad they were safe. They did not want to play near the river anymore. They wanted to play somewhere else. Somewhere with no alligators.
