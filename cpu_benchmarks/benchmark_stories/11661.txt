Once upon a time there was a little girl called Amy. She loved playing with her magnets. She'd insist to her mom that she take them everywhere. Her mom thought it was silly, but every day she'd find a way to take Amy's magnets with her. 
One day Amy wanted to go to the park. Her mom said she was too busy, but Amy insisted. With a smile, her mom said that if Amy was ready quick then they could go to the park. 
So, Amy rushed to get ready and finally they were off to the park. When they got there, Amy ran straight to the playground. She called to her mom to join her and was surprised when her mom said she had a surprise for her! 
In her hands were two brand new magnets. Amy was so excited! She insisted that the two new magnets must join her others and off to the playground they all went. 
Amy spent the rest of the day finding new and amazing things to do with her magnets. With each new idea, she'd insist that it was the best one yet. 
In the end, Amy and her mom left the park with a smile on their faces, both feeling so happy that Amy had insisted that they go.
