Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sit in her cozy armchair and read books. One day, Lily's brother came and sat in her chair. Lily got upset and asked him to move, but he refused.
Lily didn't know what to do, so she sat on the floor and started to shiver. Her brother noticed and asked why she was shivering. Lily was confused and didn't know how to explain. 
Finally, Lily's mom came in and saw what was happening. She told Lily's brother to move and gave Lily a warm blanket to wrap around herself. Lily felt much better and was happy to have her armchair back. From that day on, Lily learned that it's important to speak up when something is bothering her.
