Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy. She lived with her mum and dad and they all loved her very much. One day, her mum and dad said that it was time for her to do a special exam.
Lucy was a bit scared but she did it anyway. She was so excited when the day of the exam arrived. She was nervous but her mum and dad said it was going to be an amazing experience.
On the day of the exam, Lucy was so excited. She had lots of interesting things to do and learn. She didn't realise it was an exam at all!
After the exam finished, Lucy felt amazing. She had done it and she couldn't believe it. She couldn't wait to tell her mum and dad all about it when she got home.
When Lucy told her mum and dad, they were so proud of her. Her mum said, "Lucy, you were amazing! You did it all by yourself and that's a big deal!" 
Lucy smiled proudly. She had proven that she could do it, no matter what happened.
