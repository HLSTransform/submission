Once upon a time, there was a prince who was very smart. He wanted to find a magic crown. The prince searched high and low but he couldn't find it.
One day, when the prince arrived at the beach, he finally found what he was looking for. In the sand was a beautiful, golden crown! The prince was so happy that he quickly picked up the crown.
He couldn't believe his luck and hurried home to show his parents. When he arrived, his mom and dad were so proud of him. They hugged him and said he was so smart to have found the crown!
So the prince was crowned king. He moved into the palace and was so happy. From then on, the people of the kingdom loved their new king. They knew he was the right man for the job.
