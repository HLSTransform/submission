Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Molly. Every day Molly used to go outside and play in the garden. She loved to feel the nice warm sun on her skin and feel the grass tickling her toes. But one day it started to rain. Molly didn't like it, it was cold and wet. She missed feeling the warm sun on her skin. She looked up to the sky and said, "Please stop raining!" But the rain didn't stop. So Molly put on her boots and a warm coat, and went for a walk in the rain. The cold raindrops felt nice on her skin, and soon she was smiling and jumping in the puddles. Molly had so much fun that she forgot to miss the warm sunshine.
