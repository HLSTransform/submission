Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to jump on her bed and feel the soft mattress. One day, she found a shiny copper penny on the floor. It was so light that she could hold it with her little fingers. 
Lily was so happy to have found the penny that she decided to jump even higher on her bed. She jumped and jumped until she was tired. Then she took the copper penny and put it in her piggy bank. 
From that day on, Lily would jump on her bed every night before going to sleep. She would hold her piggy bank close and dream of all the fun things she could do with her pennies. And every time she saw something shiny and light, she would remember the day she found her copper penny.
