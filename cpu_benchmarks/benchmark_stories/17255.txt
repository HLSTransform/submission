Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat candy, but his mommy told him not to eat too much or he would get a tummy ache. Timmy didn't listen and kept eating candy every day.
One day, Timmy woke up with a mighty stomach ache. He felt like he had eaten a whole cake! His mommy took him to the doctor, and the doctor said that Timmy had eaten too much candy and it was making his tummy hurt.
From that day on, Timmy learned to only eat a little bit of candy at a time. He didn't want to feel the mighty pain in his stomach again. And that was the day when Timmy learned an important lesson about taking care of his body.
