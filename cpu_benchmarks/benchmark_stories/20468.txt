Once there was a little boy named Tim. He really loved chewing his snack. He loved it so much that he would chew it all day and even while he was playing!
One day, while he was playing in the garden, Tim found a hammer. He was so curious that he wanted to chew it too. So he grabbed the hammer, put it in his mouth, and started to chew on it. 
Just then, his mom came out and saw what he was doing. She looked at him with such a compassionate face and softly said "No, Tim, don't chew the hammer. You'll hurt your teeth! Let's find something else for you to chew on." 
Tim was so glad he was able to use his chewing skills in a different way. From then on, he was careful when he chewed and made sure he only chewed things he was supposed to.
