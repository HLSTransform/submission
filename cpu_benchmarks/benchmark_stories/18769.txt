Tommy liked to be independent. He did not want to listen to his mom or dad. He wanted to do what he wanted. One day, he saw a jar of peanuts on the kitchen table. He liked peanuts. He wanted to eat them.
He climbed on a chair and reached for the jar. He did not remember that he was allergic to peanuts. He did not remember that his mom had told him many times not to eat them. He did not remember that he had a special medicine in his backpack. He opened the jar and took a handful of peanuts.
He put them in his mouth and chewed. They were crunchy and salty. He liked them. He did not notice that his mouth started to itch. He did not notice that his throat started to swell. He did not notice that he had trouble breathing. He took another handful of peanuts.
"Tommy, what are you doing?" his mom shouted. She had come back from the store and saw him on the chair with the jar. She ran to him and saw his face. It was red and puffy. He was gasping for air. He dropped the peanuts and tried to say something. He could not.
"Tommy, no!" his mom cried. She grabbed his backpack and looked for his medicine. She could not find it. She had forgotten to put it back after his last check-up. She had forgotten to tell his dad. She had forgotten to tell Tommy. She had forgotten.
She picked up Tommy and ran to the phone. She called 911 and begged for help. She held Tommy in her arms and prayed. He was still and silent. He did not move. He did not breathe. He did not live.
