Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to travel with her family. One day, they went to the airport to go on a trip. Lily's mom had a thick luggage with her.
Lily saw a big screen that displays the flights. She pointed to it and asked her mom, "Mommy, what is that?" Her mom replied, "That's a display, it shows the flights and their times."
As they were waiting for their flight, Lily saw a little boy crying. She went up to him and asked, "Why are you crying?" The little boy replied, "I lost my teddy bear." Lily felt sad for the little boy and decided to help him. She took out a stuffed animal from her mom's luggage and gave it to the little boy. The little boy was so happy and thanked Lily.
The moral of the story is to always be kind and helpful to others, even if it means giving away something of your own.
