Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a unique doll that she loved to play with every day. One day, Lily's mom saw that the doll was broken. 
"Oh no, Lily! Your doll is broken! We need to act fast and fix it," said Lily's mom.
Lily started to cry because she didn't want her favorite doll to be broken. "Don't worry, sweetie. We'll fix it together," said her mom.
So, Lily and her mom worked together to fix the doll. They sawed off the broken parts and glued them back together. After a few minutes, the doll was fixed and as good as new!
"Yay, we did it! Thank you, mommy," said Lily. 
"You're welcome, sweetie. Now let's go play with your unique doll," said her mom with a smile.
