Once upon a time two friends, Aiyana and Aliya, were playing in the park. Aiyana had a great idea. She said to Aliya,  "Let's take turns doing cartwheels!"
Aliya thought it was a nice idea and said yes. So, the two friends decided to take turns. First, Aiyana did a cartwheel, and then, Aliya did a cartwheel. 
After they were done, they both looked at each other and said, "That was fun! Let's decide who did the best cartwheel." 
Aiyana said, "I think you did the best one. Your cartwheel was really nice."
Aliya smiled, and said, "I think you did the best one. I saw your cartwheel and it looked really, really nice!" 
So, they decided to wait and see what the result would be. After a few moments, they both agreed that they had both done a great job.
The friends smiled at each other and said, "That was a nice result!"
