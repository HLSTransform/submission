Once upon a time there was a unique deer. He liked to rock back and forth all day long. He lived in a big green meadow surrounded by tall trees. One day, the deer heard something he hadn't before. It was a small voice coming from the trees. 
The deer stepped closer to see what was making the noise. He noticed a tiny little squirrel, shaking a branch and shouting, "Wake up! Wake up!"
The deer tilted his head and asked, "What are you doing, little squirrel?"
The squirrel stopped shaking the branch and looked up at the deer. He said, "I'm trying to wake up my friend the rock."
The deer was surprised. He asked, "Your friend is a rock?"
The squirrel nodded and pointed at the big rock lying on the ground. He said, "Yes! He's been sleeping for a long time. Can you help me wake him up?" 
The deer smiled and said, "Sure, let's give it a try!"
The deer and the squirrel worked together to rock the rock back and forth. Finally, after a few minutes, the rock awoke and laughed with joy! 
The deer and the squirrel cheered and gave the rock a big hug. From then on, the deer, the squirrel, and the rock were the best of friends!
