Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy lived in a small village with his mom and dad. His dad worked in the forest and would bring home wood to keep their house warm. 
One day, Timmy's dad hurt his leg and couldn't go to work. Timmy's mom was anxious because they needed the wood to stay warm. Timmy wanted to help, so he asked his mom what he could do. 
His mom told him that they needed someone to deliver the wood from the forest to their house. Timmy was excited to help and asked his mom how he could deliver the wood. 
His mom gave him a small cart and told him to go to the forest and bring back as much wood as he could. Timmy went to the forest and filled his cart with wood. He was proud of himself for delivering the wood to his house and helping his family stay warm.
