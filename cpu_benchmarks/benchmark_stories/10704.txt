Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved animals. He dreamed of going on a safari one day to see all the wild animals in their natural habitat. One day, his parents surprised him with a trip to a nearby zoo. Timmy was so excited he could hardly contain himself.
As they walked around the zoo, Timmy saw all kinds of animals - lions, tigers, elephants, and giraffes. He even got to feed the monkeys! At the end of the day, they stopped by the gift shop to buy a souvenir. Timmy picked out a stuffed lion to remember his amazing day.
On the way home, Timmy fell asleep in the car. When they arrived home, his parents carried him to bed. But when Timmy woke up the next morning, he didn't feel very well. He was hot and had a bad cough. His parents took him to the doctor, who said Timmy had caught a cold from being out in the rain at the zoo. Timmy was so tired and sad that he couldn't go on his dream safari. He just wanted to print out pictures of the animals he had seen and go back to bed.
