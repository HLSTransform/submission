Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to play with her blocks. She had red blocks, blue blocks, and yellow blocks. She liked to build big towers with her blocks. Mia thought it was easy and fun to play with them.
One day, Mia's friend Max came to play with her. Max saw Mia's blocks and wanted to play too. They decided to build a big tower together. Mia and Max took care to place each block on top of the other. They were very careful so the tower would not fall down.
As they played, Mia and Max found that they could build an even bigger tower by working together. They were very happy and proud of their big tower. Mia and Max learned that it is easy to have fun and care for each other when they play together. And from that day on, they always played with the blocks and cared for each other.
