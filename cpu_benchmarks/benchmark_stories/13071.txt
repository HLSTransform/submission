Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was named Lucy and she was three years old. 
One day her mum said, "Let's go and get something special." So they went to the store and Lucy saw a yummy-looking zigzag. It looked delicious. She asked her mum to get it for her and her mum said, "Yes, ok let's get it."
When they got home Lucy was so excited! She took the zigzag out of its box and started to eat it. It was so delicious! 
In the end her mum said, "It's time to go to bed. Now no more spoiling yourself!" Lucy smiled and said, "Ok," and put the rest of the zigzag away for tomorrow. 
The End
