Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy box with many toys. One day, Timmy's friend came over to play. Timmy's friend wanted to play with Timmy's favorite toy, but Timmy didn't want to share. Timmy's friend got angry and took the toy anyway.
Timmy was worried and sad. He didn't want his friend to take his toy. He went to his mom and said, "Mommy, my friend took my toy. I don't want to share it." His mom said, "It's okay, Timmy. You can separate from your friend and play with your toy by yourself."
Timmy went back to his room and looked for the key to his toy box. He found the key and opened the box. But when he looked inside, his favorite toy was broken. Timmy started crying and wished he had shared his toy with his friend.
