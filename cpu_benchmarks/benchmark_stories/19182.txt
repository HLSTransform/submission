Once upon a time, there was a nosy little dog named Max. He liked to sniff and taste everything he could find. One day, he found a big, red ball in the park. He wanted to play with it, so he picked it up in his mouth and ran around.
Max saw his friend, a police officer named Joe. Joe was a kind man who loved to help people. He saw Max with the red ball and laughed. "Max, you are so funny!" Joe said. "Do you like the taste of that ball?" Max wagged his tail and barked, happy to see his friend.
Just then, a little girl came running up to them. She was sad because she lost her ball. Joe said, "Don't worry, little girl. Max found your ball!" He took the ball from Max and gave it back to the girl. She was very happy and thanked them both. Max felt proud that he could help his friend Joe and the little girl. From that day on, Max and Joe became an even better team, helping people and having fun together.
