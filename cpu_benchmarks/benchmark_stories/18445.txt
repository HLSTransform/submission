Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his toys, especially his toy swords. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy brought a toy gun with him. Timmy had never seen a toy gun before and asked Billy what it was. Billy said it was a weapon, which made Timmy feel a little scared.
Timmy's mom noticed that Timmy looked pale and asked him what was wrong. Timmy told his mom about the toy gun and how he didn't like it. His mom sat down with both boys to discuss why weapons can be dangerous and why it's important to always use toys safely. Timmy and Billy listened carefully and promised to be safe with their toys from then on.
From that day on, Timmy and Billy had fun playing with their toys together, but they always remembered to be safe and not use them in a way that could hurt anyone.
