Once upon a time, there was a gentle goat named Billy. He liked to eat grass and play with his friends. One day, Billy met a little girl who wanted to play with him. She asked, "Can you whistle, Billy?"
"I don't know how to whistle," Billy said.
The little girl said, "That's okay. I can teach you how to whistle."
So, the little girl taught Billy how to whistle. He was so happy that he could whistle now. But then, a big, scary wolf came and ate Billy. The little girl cried and cried because her new friend was gone forever.
