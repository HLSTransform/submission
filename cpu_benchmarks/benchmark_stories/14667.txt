Once upon a time there was a small girl and she wanted to travel. She went to the jungle to have an adventure. She saw so many new things, like trees, animals and birds. Everything was so exciting for her!
The small girl walked through the jungle and she felt the mild breeze on her skin. She kept walking until she found a big tree. She climbed up the tree and looked around. She saw animals playing and birds flying. She could hear them singing and laughing.
The small girl stayed for a while in the tree, looking at all the wonderful things around her. Then she carefully climbed down the tree and kept traveling through the jungle. She was so happy to be in such a beautiful place. 
After a fun day of exploring the jungle, the little girl went home, feeling so excited! She would never forget her journey through the mild jungle.
