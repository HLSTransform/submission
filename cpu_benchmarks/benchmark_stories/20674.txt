Once upon a time there was a little girl named Amy. Every day, she was excited to go to the park to play. On this particular day, she found a lollipop lying on the ground. She was thrilled and quickly grabbed it with her tiny little hands. As she was about to eat it, she noticed a little boy walking towards her with his hands outreached. 
The boy said, "I want the lollipop. Please give it to me. Give me the lollipop!" But instead of giving it to him, Amy ignored him. She didn't say anything and just kept walking away with the lollipop. 
The boy became so frustrated and started to cry. He really wanted the lollipop and couldn't understand why Amy wouldn't share it with him. But Amy didn't care and continued to ignore him until she was out of sight. 
And that was the end of the lollipop drama. Amy went home happy with her lollipop, while the little boy went home sad and frustrated.
