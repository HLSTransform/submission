Once upon a time, there was a sleepy bear named Joe. Joe was very overweight and he had trouble getting around. One day, Joe thought he could get where he wanted to go by taking the elevator.
So Joe hopped inside the elevator and pressed the button. When he arrived at the top, Joe was so excited! But when he stepped off the elevator, he heard a funny noise. Joe was worried, so he pressed the button again.
The elevator doors opened and Joe saw something strange. He couldn't believe his eyes! The elevator was full of sleeping people. 
"What's going on?" Joe asked.
One of the people inside the elevator opened his eyes and said, "We can't move! We're stuck! We're too heavy for the elevator!"
Joe's heart sank. He wanted to help, but he was too sleepy to do anything. Unfortunately, Joe and the other people inside the elevator were stuck there forever.
