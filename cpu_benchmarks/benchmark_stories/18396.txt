Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his scooter. He would ride it up and down the street, feeling the wind in his hair. One day, Timmy wanted to make his scooter even cooler. So, he put stickers all over it. The stickers had fierce animals on them, like lions and tigers. Now, Timmy's scooter was the coolest scooter in the whole neighborhood!
