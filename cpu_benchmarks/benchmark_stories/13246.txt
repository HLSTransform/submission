Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. Lucy was always very helpful and kind. One day she was at the store looking for something special. She saw a lovely belt and she wanted it very much.
But it was too big for her. She wanted to make it fit around her waist. She asked her mom for help and her mom was so helpful. She told Lucy to fetch some rope. Lucy ran and got a rope. 
Then Mom showed her how to tie a knot. Once they had threaded the rope through the belt and tied it up, Mom said the belt was now closed. Lucy was so happy and put on her new belt. It looked so beautiful and she was very proud. 
From then on, whenever Lucy saw someone else needing help, she always offered to help them close their belts.
