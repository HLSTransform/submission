Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and collect pebbles. One day, she found a very pretty pebble and showed it to her friend, Emma.
Emma said, "That's not pretty. It's just a boring rock."
Lily felt sad and didn't know what to do. She asked her mom for advice.
Her mom said, "Sometimes people say mean things. But it's important to ignore them and remember what makes you happy."
Lily realized that Emma was just trying to make her feel bad. She decided to be quiet and not let Emma's words bother her. She kept collecting pebbles and was happy again.
The moral of the story is to not let others bring you down and to always focus on what makes you happy.
