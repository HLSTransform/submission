Once upon a time there was a grumpy cloud. He liked to stay alone in the sky and had never been very friendly. Every day he would look down at the world with a grumpy face; nothing seemed to excite him.
One day the grumpy cloud noticed something happening in the meadow below. There was a family of rabbits playing and having fun. It made the grumpy cloud excited. He had never seen anything like it before.
The grumpy cloud watched the family of rabbits playing in the meadow. He was so excited that he started to smile. He was still grumpy but now he was happy too!
The grumpy cloud was so excited that he decided to join the family of rabbits and show them his smile. Everyone was so surprised but so very happy! From then on, the grumpy cloud was never grumpy again.
