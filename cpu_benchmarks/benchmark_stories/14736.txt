Once upon a time there was a little girl called Jane. She was three years old and loved to explore. One day she decided to explore a room in her house that she hadn't been allowed in before. It was a big, dusty room.
Suddenly, Jane heard a loud noise in the room. It was very strange. Suddenly, she saw a big yellow bird flapping its wings. It looked helpless, like it needed help. Jane felt an urge to help the bird.
She slowly stepped closer to the bird, and said "Don't be scared. I'll help you." The bird stopped flying and stayed still. Jane carefully opened the window and the bird flew out.
Jane watched as the bird flew away into the clear blue sky. She felt proud that she had been able to help the helpless bird.
