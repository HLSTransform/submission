Once upon a time, there was a baby named Tommy. Tommy was a happy baby who loved to play with his toys. One day, Tommy's mommy took him to the park to play. While they were there, Tommy saw a mysterious box on the ground.
Tommy pointed to the box and said, "Mommy, what is that?"
"I don't know, Tommy. It looks mysterious," replied his mommy.
Tommy crawled over to the box and tried to open it. But he couldn't do it alone. So, he asked his mommy to help him.
"Mommy, can you join me and help me open this box?" asked Tommy.
Together, they opened the box and found a new toy inside. Tommy was so happy and thanked his mommy for helping him. They played together for the rest of the day and had lots of fun.
