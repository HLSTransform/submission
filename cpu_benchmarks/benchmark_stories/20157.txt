Ben and Lily wanted to pick berries in the forest. They asked their mom if they could go. Mom said yes, but they had to stay close and be careful. She gave them a basket and a hat each.
Ben and Lily ran to the forest. They saw many red and blue berries on the bushes. They filled their basket with the juicy fruits. They tasted some and they were sweet and yummy.
"Look, Lily, I found a big berry!" Ben said. He showed her a purple berry that was bigger than his thumb.
"Wow, Ben, that's a nice berry!" Lily said. "Can I have a bite?"
"No, it's mine!" Ben said. He was spoiled and did not like to share. He put the berry in his pocket and turned away.
Lily was sad and angry. She wanted to try the big berry too. She saw a squirrel on a tree. The squirrel had a nut in its mouth. It looked at Lily and winked.
"Hello, little girl," the squirrel said. "Do you want a nut?"
"Yes, please," Lily said. She liked nuts. She reached out her hand.
The squirrel threw the nut to Lily. She caught it and thanked the squirrel. She cracked the nut and ate it. It was crunchy and tasty.
"Can I have a nut too?" Ben said. He saw Lily and the squirrel. He wanted a nut as well.
"Sorry, no more nuts," the squirrel said. "You have a big berry. You should share it with your sister."
Ben felt ashamed. He knew the squirrel was right. He took out the big berry from his pocket and gave it to Lily.
"Here, Lily, you can have the big berry," he said. "I'm sorry I was spoiled."
Lily smiled and hugged Ben. She broke the big berry in half and gave one half to Ben.
"Thank you, Ben," she said. "You are a good brother."
They ate the big berry together. It was sour and bitter.
"Yuck, this berry is bad!" they said. They spit out the berry and made a face.
The squirrel laughed and ran away. It had tricked them. The big berry was not a berry at all. It was a rotten plum.
Ben and Lily learned their lesson. They decided to share their good berries and be nice to each other. They went back to their mom and told her what happened. Mom hugged them and gave them some cookies. They were happy and forgot about the bad berry.
