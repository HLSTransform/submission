Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a favorite tie that he loved to wear. One day, he decided to go on an adventure in the forest.
In the forest, Tim found a big, dangerous snake. The snake wanted to bite him, but Tim had an idea. He took off his tie and threw it on the ground. The snake looked at the tie and forgot about Tim. Then, Tim ran away as fast as he could.
When Tim got home, he told his mom about the snake and how his tie saved him. His mom hugged him and was happy he was safe. She told Tim that sometimes, we need to reveal what we love to keep us safe. Tim learned that it's important to let go of things when they can protect us from danger. And from that day on, Tim was always careful in the forest.
