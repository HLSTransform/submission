Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very hungry and needed some food to eat. So, her mommy took her to the grocery store. 
The grocery store was big and had lots of food. Lily saw many fruits and vegetables, but she wanted something else. She needed some cookies! 
Lily's mommy bought her some cookies and also got some smelly cheese for herself. They went back home and ate their snacks. Lily was happy and her tummy was full. The end.
