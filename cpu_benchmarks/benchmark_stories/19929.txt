Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. One day, she saw a brown dog walking down the street. She went up to the dog and said, "Hi doggy, do you want to play with me?"
The dog wagged its tail and barked happily. Lily played with the dog for a while, and then she said, "Doggy, do you want some honey?" She had a jar of honey with her.
The dog licked the honey from Lily's hand and then gave her a big kiss on the cheek. Lily giggled and said, "Thank you, doggy. You are my friend." And the dog wagged its tail again and barked happily.
