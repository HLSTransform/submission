Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved music and wanted to play a trumpet. Timmy's mom bought him a trumpet, but he didn't know how to play it. He blew into the trumpet, but it just made a loud noise. Timmy was confused and sad.
One day, Timmy went to the park and met a man playing the trumpet. The man played so well that everyone in the park stopped to listen. Timmy went up to the man and said, "I want to play the trumpet like you, but I don't know how." The man smiled and said, "It takes practice and patience. You have to resist giving up."
That night, Timmy practiced playing the trumpet. He tried and tried, but it still sounded bad. He was about to give up, but he remembered what the man had said. He resisted giving up and kept practicing. After a few weeks, Timmy's trumpet playing got better and he was able to play a song. He felt so proud and happy that he could play the trumpet like the man in the park.
