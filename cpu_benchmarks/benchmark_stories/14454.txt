Once upon a time there was an old man. He lived in a small house by the sea, and every day he would take a long walk along the beach. He would take his time on his stroll, always making sure to take some time to look at the sea birds.
One day as he was walking along the beach, he heard a small voice. He stopped and looked around, but he couldn't see anyone. He then heard the voice again. It said, "Can you lend me a hand? I'm stuck in the tree." The man looked up and saw a small bird had caught its feet in the branches of the tree.
Gently the old man reached up and helped the bird free its feet. The bird flew off and the old man smiled. Suddenly, the bird flew back, this time carrying a small box in its beak. The bird flew down and put the box in the old man's hands.
Inside the box was a beautiful little bird that could speak. It thanked the old man for helping it and said it wanted to give him a gift. It then flew away.
The old man was delighted with his new friend. It had a bright voice, and he would often lend it out to make others in the village laugh. The old man would tell stories and the bird would chirp along in the background. The old man's days were much brighter with his new friend by his side.
