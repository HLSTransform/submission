Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color with her blue pencil. One day, Lily was drawing a picture when her friend Timmy came over to play.
"Can I use your blue pencil, Lily?" Timmy asked.
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "I want to share my pencil with you, but please be careful with it."
Timmy was very happy and started to draw with the blue pencil. But then, he accidentally broke it. Lily was sad because it was her favorite pencil.
Timmy said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to break your pencil."
Lily forgave Timmy and said, "It's okay. We can share my other pencils. But we need to be careful with them, okay?"
The moral of the story is that sharing is good, but we also need to take care of our things and be responsible.
