Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved her doll. Her doll was her best friend. They played together every day. The doll was very loyal and never left the girl's side.
One day, the girl decided she wanted to change her doll's clothes. She found a pretty dress and put it on the doll. The doll looked so different! The girl was happy because her doll looked even more beautiful.
The girl and her doll continued to play together, and the doll was still loyal. The girl knew that no matter what changes happened, her doll would always be her best friend.
