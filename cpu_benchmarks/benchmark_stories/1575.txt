Once upon a time, there was a lazy cat named Tom. Tom liked to sleep in the sun all day long. One day, Tom met a dog named Max. Max asked Tom, "Why are you so lazy?" Tom replied, "I don't like to move around too much."
Max said, "Let's play a game of bow and arrow." Tom was not sure what that was, but he agreed to play. Max showed Tom how to hold the bow and arrow. Tom tried to shoot the arrow, but it fell into a pit. Max said, "Don't worry, we can get it out."
Max and Tom worked together to get the arrow out of the pit. Tom realized he had fun playing with Max and was happy he made a new friend. From then on, Tom was not so lazy anymore and played games with Max every day. The end.
