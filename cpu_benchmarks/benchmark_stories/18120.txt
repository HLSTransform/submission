Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cute puppy named Max. Max was so adorable that everyone loved him. One day, when Lily went out to play, she forgot to lock the door. Max saw this and ran out to explore the world outside. 
Lily was very sad when she came back and saw that Max was gone. She looked for him everywhere but couldn't find him. She felt very guilty for forgetting to lock the door. 
Days passed, and Lily started to grow up. She learned that it's important to be responsible and always lock the door. Finally, one day, Max came back. He was all grown up and had learned many things on his adventure. Lily was so happy to see him, and she promised to always take good care of him and never forget to lock the door again.
