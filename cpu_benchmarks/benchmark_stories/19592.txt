Once upon a time there was a loyal kangaroo. She lived in the bush and was very happy. Every day the kangaroo would jump around and make friends with everyone she met.
One night the kangaroo was very tired and she needed to get some rest. She hopped over to a big tree and found a nice spot to sleep. She closed her eyes and fell asleep.
The next morning, the kangaroo heard loud noises coming from the bush. She opened her eyes and saw a group of new animals. They were all different sizes and shapes and they were bouncing around the bush. The kangaroo realized that these animals were kangaroos just like her!
The loyal kangaroo got up and went to meet her new friends. They welcomed her with open paws and started to play together. The kangaroo closed her eyes and smiled. She was so happy to have found loyal friends.
