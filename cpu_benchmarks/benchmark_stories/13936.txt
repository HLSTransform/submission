Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Ann. She had a new scarf. It was red and soft. She loved her scarf very much.
One day, Ann saw a boy who was cold. He did not have a scarf. Ann felt sad for the boy. She thought about her new scarf. She wanted to help the boy.
Ann gave her new scarf to the boy. The boy smiled and said thank you. He felt warm and happy. Ann felt happy too. That night, Ann's heart seemed to glow with joy.
The moral of the story is: Sharing with others can make you feel happy and warm inside.
