Once upon a time, there was a little cute bunny. She liked to go for a hop in the grassy field. Every day, she would spring up into the air and have lots of fun.
One day, she found a really adorable house. It was so nice! She hopped up onto its roof and lay down. It was so comfy and warm. She felt so cozy and happy up there.
The bunny stayed on the roof for a whole day and a night. In the morning, she started to feel a bit hungry. So she hopped out of the house and started to look for some food.
The end.
