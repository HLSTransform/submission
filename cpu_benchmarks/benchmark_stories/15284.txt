Once there was a little girl named Jane. She was 3 years old and loved to explore the world.
One day, Jane's mommy said, "It's time for a bath, Jane!" Jane smiled and said, "OK!"
She went to the bathroom and shut the door. Then she put on her cozy bathrobe.
Jane splashed in the water and had lots of fun. When she was finished, the water was clear.
Mommy came in and said, "Time to come out, Jane!" Jane smiled and stepped out. She shut the door, took off her bathrobe and ran off to play.
The end.
