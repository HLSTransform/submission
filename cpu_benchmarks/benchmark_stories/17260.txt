Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her toys and her cat, Fluffy. One day, her mommy gave her a task to clean up her room. Lily didn't want to do it, but she knew it was her job.
After she finished, her mommy gave her a cookie and said she did a good job. Lily was happy and proud of herself. Then, her mommy asked her to help test a new toy. Lily was excited to try it out.
Her mommy explained how to use the toy, but Lily didn't understand at first. She felt ignorant, but her mommy showed her again and she finally got it. They played with the toy for a long time and had lots of fun. The end.
