Once upon a time there was a generous boy named Andy. He had a special costume that made him very happy. Every day he promised himself he would play with it for hours. One day, his mom saw the costume and how much fun he was having with it. She was so happy that she promised Andy to take him to the theme park.
Andy was so excited and yelled "Yay!", jumping up and down. His mom explained that she would be generous and buy Andy a new costume at the theme park. Andy was so excited and promised to choose the best costume ever.
When they arrived at the theme park, there were so many costumes to choose from. Andy couldn't decide. His mom told him to pick one he liked the best. Andy's eyes sparkled when he saw the pirate costume. He rushed to pick it up and promised that he would always keep it clean.
His mom smiled and gave him a big hug. She was so happy that Andy was so generous with his new costume. She promised that they would come back next year and find a new one. Andy jumped up and down with joy. He was so excited to wear his new costume and play.
