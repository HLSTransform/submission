One day, Jack was walking outside. He felt warm and happy. Then he saw a bug. It was big and had many legs. Jack didn't like bugs. He hated them. He ran away from the bug as quickly as he could. He didn't want to see the bug anymore. 
Jack kept walking and when he looked down he saw many bugs on the ground. There were so many! Jack was scared and he began to cry. He ran away from the bugs as fast as he could. 
Jack did not like bugs. He was so scared of them. But then, he saw a butterfly. It was so colorful and beautiful. Jack wasn't scared of butterflies. He smiled and felt warm and happy again.
