Once upon a time, there was a clever little girl. She had a special friend called Mandy. Mandy always brought her a yummy lunch every day.
One day, Mandy said to the little girl: "I can't deliver your lunch today. Can you go and get it?"
The clever little girl thought of a plan. She walked to Mandy's house and knocked on the door. When Mandy opened it, the little girl said: "Can you please deliver my lunch to me now?".
Mandy smiled and said: "Yes, I can deliver it". She gave the little girl her lunch and waved goodbye. The clever little girl was very happy to receive her lunch. She ate it with a smile on her face.
The end!
