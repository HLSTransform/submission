Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his friends at the park. One day, they found an arrow on the ground. Timmy's friends wanted to play with it, but Timmy disagreed. He knew it was dangerous and could hurt someone.
His friends didn't listen and started playing with the arrow anyway. Suddenly, one of them got hurt. Timmy knew he was right and felt sad for his friend. He helped his friend and told him that they should always listen to each other and be careful with dangerous things.
From that day on, Timmy's friends learned to listen to him and they all played safely together. Timmy was happy that he stood up for what he believed in and helped his friends stay safe.
