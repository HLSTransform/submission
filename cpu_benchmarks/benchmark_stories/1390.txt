Once upon a time, there was a brave little bunny. His name was Jack. One day, Jack hopped over to the desert to explore. Suddenly, he saw a big, sharp cactus! Jack was confused and he hopped around, wondering what to do. He wanted to explore the cactus, but he was scared. He hopped around for a few minutes and then he finally mustered up enough courage to touch the cactus. He was very careful, because he didn't want to get hurt by the sharp thorns. He poked it once and then he hopped back a few steps. He was surprised when nothing happened! After a few minutes, Jack determined that the cactus was safe and he hopped around it, examining it more closely. He was so brave! Before he knew it, the sun was setting and Jack hopped home, feeling accomplished and excited!
