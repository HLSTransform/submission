Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She was three years old and very excited about getting a special treat. Her parents had promised her a special surprise if she succeeded in a special task.
So, Amy set off and worked very hard. She was a little bit nervous, but she kept going. After what felt like a long time, Amy achieved her goal and she was so happy when she realised she had succeeded. 
Amy ran inside to tell her parents the good news. To her surprise they had made a big bowl of popcorn for her to enjoy as her treat. Amy hugged her parents and ate her yummy popcorn. 
She felt so proud of herself for succeeding the task and getting the reward. From that day onward, Amy was determined to keep trying her best and succeeding in everything she did.
