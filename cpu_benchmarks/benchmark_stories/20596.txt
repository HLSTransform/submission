Pat was a 3 year old who loved his marbles. He had many different coloured marbles to play with. One day, he was playing with his marbles and putting them in a line. Suddenly, his big brother Brad ran into the room and grabbed one of his marbles. Pat was very jealous and started to panic. He asked his brother why he had taken the marble but his brother just laughed and ran away.
Pat was feeling very sad. He knew his special marble was gone and he would never see it again. He was so angry and started to shuffle his feet. He had to do something but he wasn't sure what. He knew he wouldn't get his marble back but he wanted to try anyway.
Pat decided to search for his marble. He went around the house looking for it and even called for his brother but there was no sign of it. He searched in the garden and all around the neighbourhood but still no marble was found.
He had to accept that his marble was gone but Pat was still very jealous of his brother. He would never forget the panic he felt that day.
