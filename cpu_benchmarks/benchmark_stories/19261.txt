Once there was a girl who loved to talk. Whenever she talked, everyone around her listened with great attention. One day, she was feeling brave and decided to go on an adventure. Her parents agreed and she went to the beach. She talked to a lobster and asked it about the beach. The lobster was very friendly and started to talk about a strange looking shrimp. He said it was very unusual, not like the normal shrimp.
The girl was intrigued so she looked for the strange shrimp. After looking for a while, she finally found one. It was tall and green, nothing like the other shrimp. The girl was fascinated and asked the shrimp where it had come from. The shrimp told her it came from a magical place on the other end of the beach.
The girl was very excited. She thanked the shrimp and ran off in search of this magical place she had heard about. She ran and she ran until she found the entrance to a secret beach filled with magical creatures. From that day forward, the girl and the shrimp were the best of friends and she often visited the secret beach with her shrimp.
