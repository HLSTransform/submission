Tom and Lily are twins. They like to play in the park. The park has a big slide, a swing, and a spring. The spring is a metal thing that you can sit on and bounce up and down.
One day, Tom and Lily go to the park with their mom. They run to the spring and both want to sit on it. "I want to go first!" Tom says. "No, I want to go first!" Lily says. They push and pull and shout.
"Stop, stop!" their mom says. "You have to share. Tom, you can go first for five bounces, then Lily can go for five bounces. OK?"
Tom nods and sits on the spring. He bounces up and down and counts. "One, two, three, four, five!" He jumps off and says, "Your turn, Lily!"
Lily smiles and sits on the spring. She bounces up and down and counts. "One, two, three, four, five!" She jumps off and says, "That was fun!"
Tom and Lily hug and say, "Sorry, we love you!" They go to the swing and take turns. The park is quiet and happy.
