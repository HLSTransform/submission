One day, a little dog named Max went for a walk. He saw a big red boot on the ground. Max thought it would be fun to play with the boot. So, he picked it up with his mouth and carried it to the park.
At the park, Max met his friend, a cat named Lily. "Look what I found!" Max said to Lily. "It's a big red boot!" Lily looked at the boot and said, "That's not a toy, Max. It's a dead boot. It's old and no one wants it." Max didn't care. He still wanted to play with the boot.
Max and Lily played with the boot all day. They threw it in the air and chased after it. Suddenly, the boot vanished! Max and Lily looked everywhere, but they couldn't find it. They were sad that their fun day had ended. Max said, "I guess the dead boot is gone." Lily agreed, but she was happy they had a fun day together.
