Once upon a time, there was a hippo who lived in the jungle. He was always happy and loved to play. One day, the hippo was playing with his friends when he noticed that two of the animals were arguing. The hippo got very upset and he shouted at them, telling them to stop quarreling. All the animals stopped and looked at the hippo. He was quite embarrassed, but the animals all thought he was brave. 
The hippo apologised to his friends and suggested they play a game. Everyone agreed, and they played and laughed until the sun went down. The quarrel had ended and the animals were happy to all be friends again. The hippo was glad his strong words had helped and he was no longer ashamed.
