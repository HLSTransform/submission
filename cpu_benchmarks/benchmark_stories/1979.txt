Once upon a time there was a kitty named Max. Max was a very spoiled kitty, because he got lots of love and food. One day, Max's owner took him to the veterinarian for his weigh in. Max didn't like going to the vet, so he meowed and meowed. The veterinarian weighed Max and said "Wow, Max is a big kitty. He weighs a lot!" After the weigh in, Max's owner gave him a special treat as a reward. Max purred as he ate it. Finally, Max got to go home and take a nice nap!
