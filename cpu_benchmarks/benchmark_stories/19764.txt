Once upon a time, there were two friends, Jack and Jill. They liked to talk about fun things. One day, they started to discuss an island - it seemed far away, and it was very long. 
Jack and Jill were excited. They talked about what it might look like, who might live there and what fun things they could do. They made up silly stories about the people who lived on the island and what kinds of animals they might find. 
After a while, Jack and Jill got tired of discussing the island - but they knew they would come back to it. Maybe they would visit the island someday, they thought. That would be so much fun, they smiled. 
The end.
