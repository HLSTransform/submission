Once upon a time there was a girl named Ella. Every day, she liked to eat a yummy sausage for lunch. But one day, when she went to get her sausage, it was gone! Ella was worried.
She looked all around the kitchen, but the sausage wasn't there. Then Ella saw something flying out the window. She went over and saw that it was her sausage! Someone had sent it away!
Ella was very worried and started to cry. She didn't know who had sent her sausage away. Just then, Ella's mom came in the room. She hugged Ella and said, "Don't worry, my sweet girl. Grandpa sent your sausage away because he thought you needed it!" 
Ella was surprised. She hadn't thought of that before. She smiled, and hugged her mom. They both laughed. Grandpa had sent her sausage away because he loved her so much.
