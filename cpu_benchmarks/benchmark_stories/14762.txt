Lily is a girl who likes to think. She thinks about many things, like what she will play, what she will eat, and what she will dream. She has long hair that she likes to brush and braid. Sometimes she thinks her hair is too long and gets in the way.
One day, she goes to the park with her mom and sees a boy with short hair. He is playing with a ball and looks happy. Lily thinks he has nice hair that does not bother him. She walks up to him and says, "Hi, I am Lily. Can I play with you?"
The boy looks at her and says, "Sure, I am Tom. Do you like my ball?" He throws the ball to her and she catches it. She thinks the ball is fun and soft. She throws it back to him and they start to play.
They play for a long time, until their moms call them to go home. Lily and Tom say goodbye and hug. Lily thinks Tom is a good friend and she wants to see him again. She also thinks maybe she will cut her hair short like him. She asks her mom, "Mom, can I have short hair like Tom?"
Her mom smiles and says, "You can have any hair you like, Lily. But I think your long hair is beautiful and suits you. Why do you want to have short hair?"
Lily thinks for a moment and says, "I like Tom's hair. It looks easy and cool. But I also like my hair. It is long and pretty. Maybe I can have both. Can I have long hair some days and short hair other days?"
Her mom laughs and says, "That would be hard to do, Lily. But you can always try different styles with your long hair. You can make a ponytail, a bun, a braid, or a hat. You can be creative and have fun with your hair. What do you think?"
Lily thinks and says, "I think that sounds good, Mom. I think I will keep my long hair and try new things. Thank you, Mom. I love you."
Her mom hugs her and says, "I love you too, Lily. You are a smart and sweet girl who likes to think. And I think that is wonderful."
