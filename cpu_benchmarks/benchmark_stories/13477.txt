Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie flew high in the sky, flapping its wings. Suddenly, the birdie saw a worm on the ground. It swooped down and grabbed the worm with its beak. But the worm was too tight in the birdie's beak, so the birdie had to release it. 
The birdie continued to fly until it saw a big tree. It landed on a branch and looked around. It saw other birdies flying and chirping. The birdie felt happy to be on land. 
As the sun started to set, the birdie flew back to its nest. It was tired from all the flying and needed to rest. The birdie snuggled up in its cozy nest and fell asleep, dreaming of the worm it had to release and the land it had landed on.
