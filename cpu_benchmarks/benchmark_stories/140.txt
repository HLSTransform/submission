Once upon a time, there was a big elephant named Ellie. Ellie was very tidy and always kept her room clean. One day, her friend monkey came to visit her. Monkey said, "Ellie, your room is so tidy! Can you teach me how to tidy my room too?" Ellie replied, "Sure, I can serve as your teacher and show you how to tidy up."
Ellie started teaching Monkey how to tidy up his room. She said, "First, we need to pick up all the toys and put them in their proper place. Then, we need to make the bed and fold the blankets. Finally, we need to sweep the floor and make sure everything is in its right weight." Monkey was happy to learn and said, "Thank you, Ellie! You are such a great teacher." 
Ellie smiled and said, "It was my pleasure to serve as your teacher. Now, let's have some fun and play with our toys!" The two friends played and had a great time in Ellie's tidy room. From that day on, Monkey always kept his room tidy just like Ellie's.
