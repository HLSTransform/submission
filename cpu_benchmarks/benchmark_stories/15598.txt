Lily and Max were playing in the yard with their toy automobiles. Lily had a red one and Max had a blue one. They liked to race them on the grass and make vroom-vroom noises.
One day, a big yellow automobile parked in front of their house. It was shiny and new and had a big bow on it. Lily and Max ran to the window to see it.
"Wow, look at that!" Lily said. "It is so pretty and bright. I want one like that."
Max nodded. He was envious of the yellow automobile too. He wished he had one that was big and shiny.
They watched as a man got out of the yellow automobile and rang the doorbell. Their mom opened the door and hugged the man. He was their uncle Tom, who lived far away and came to visit sometimes.
"Hi, kids!" Uncle Tom said, waving at them. "I have a surprise for you. Do you want to see it?"
Lily and Max ran to the door, excited. They hoped the surprise was the yellow automobile.
"Follow me," Uncle Tom said, leading them to the yard. He pointed at the yellow automobile. "This is my new automobile. Do you like it?"
Lily and Max nodded, but they felt sad. They thought the surprise was for them, not for Uncle Tom.
"But that's not the surprise," Uncle Tom said, smiling. He opened the trunk of the yellow automobile and took out two smaller automobiles. One was pink and one was green. They looked just like the yellow one, but smaller.
"These are for you," Uncle Tom said, handing them to Lily and Max. "They are toy automobiles, but they can move by themselves. You can control them with these buttons. Do you want to try them?"
Lily and Max gasped. They couldn't believe it. They had their own automobiles, just like Uncle Tom's. They hugged him and thanked him.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you!" they said.
They took their new automobiles to the grass and started to play with them. They raced them, chased them, and made vroom-vroom noises. They were so happy.
Uncle Tom watched them and smiled. He was glad he made them happy. He took a hose and started to wash his yellow automobile. He made it shiny and clean.
Lily and Max saw him and wanted to help. They ran to him and asked if they could wash their automobiles too.
"Of course, you can," Uncle Tom said. "Washing automobiles is fun. Here, you can use this sponge and this soap. Be careful not to get wet."
Lily and Max took the sponge and the soap and started to wash their automobiles. They rubbed them gently and made them shiny and clean. They had fun washing their automobiles with Uncle Tom.
They didn't feel envious of the yellow automobile anymore. They loved their own automobiles, and they loved Uncle Tom. They were happy.
