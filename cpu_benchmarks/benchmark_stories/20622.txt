Once there was a girl who wanted a key. She asked her mom for a key, but her mom said she had to ask her dad. So the girl asked her dad and he said he would get her one.
The dad went to a store and bought a shiny key. It was so clear and the girl loved it. He gave it to her and said it was very special. He said she should always take care of it and never lose it.
The girl kept the key safe and used it to open doors and drawers. Everywhere she went, she took the key with her. Everyone who saw the key said it was very special and recommended it to their friends. 
The girl was so happy to have such a nice key and she never forgot to recommend it to others. She always told her friends about the special key with pride. The girl smiled whenever she held the key, because it was so clear and done her very proud.
