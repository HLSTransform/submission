Once upon a time there was a little girl named Emma. She had a very reliable friend. His name was Mark. Mark and Emma wanted to play together all the time.
Every day they would do all sorts of fun things. But their favourite thing to do was to play sock game. They both loved this game very much.
Mark and Emma would take turns in hiding the sock. When it was Emma’s turn, she would always find the most creative places to hide it. Then it was Mark’s turn. He had to use his problem solving skills to try to find it.
No matter how hard it was, Mark always found the sock. He was so reliable and Emma loved that about him. They would smile and hug each other when he found it.
Mark and Emma continued to play the sock game every day. And they will continue to love and play together forever.
