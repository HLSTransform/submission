Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a colorful jar of jam. It was red, blue, and yellow. The jam was very happy in its jar.
One day, the jam went for a walk. It rolled and rolled down the street. Then, it met a big cat. The cat said, "Hello, jam! You are very colorful." The jam was happy to meet the cat.
The cat and the jam played all day. They laughed and had fun. The sun went down and it was time to go home. The cat and the jam said goodbye. The jam rolled back to its house, happy to have a new friend.
