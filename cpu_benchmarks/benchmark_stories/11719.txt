Once upon a time, a charming little girl went for a walk in the forest. Suddenly, she saw a snake. She said, “Oh no!” and started to frown.
But then the snake said, “Don’t be scared. I’m a friendly snake!” The girl was surprised, but she kept on frowning. The snake said, “You can trust me. I promise not to hurt you.” 
The girl hesitated, then the snake said, “If you want, I can show you around the forest. It’s very beautiful.” The girl smiled and said, “Okay!”
The girl and the snake went for a walk and had a wonderful time. The snake showed her all the charming things in the forest and the girl was no longer afraid.
At the end of the walk, the girl said, “Thank you for showing me around and making me feel less scared.” The snake replied, “It was my pleasure. Come back and visit me anytime.” The girl smiled and went happily on her way.
