Once upon a time, there was a little piggy who lived on a farm. The farm was big and had lots of animals like cows, chickens, and horses. The little piggy loved to play in the mud and roll around in it. The mud was rough and bumpy, but it felt good on the little piggy's skin.
One day, the little piggy's mom made some yummy food. The little piggy was so excited to taste it! The food smelled so good and made the little piggy's tummy rumble. When the little piggy took a bite, it tasted so delicious! The little piggy ate and ate until there was no more food left.
After eating, the little piggy went back to playing in the mud. The little piggy was happy and content on the farm with all of the other animals. The end.
