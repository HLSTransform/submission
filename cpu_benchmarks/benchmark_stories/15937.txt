Once upon a time there was a girl called Sarah. She was always very obedient and tried her best to do things right. One day Sarah heard that a big snowstorm was coming. She was so excited, she couldn't wait for it to come!
When it finally arrived, Sarah put on her hat and coat and went outside to play in the snow. But it was so cold outside that she soon shivered and wished she had stayed inside. 
Sarah stared sadly at the snow. Unbeknownst to her, her grandmother had been watching her the whole time. She was worried about Sarah being cold, so she went outside and said, "Why don't we make a snowman together? That way we can both stay warm!"
Sarah smiled and said, "Yes Grandma!" Then they set to work. With a lot of patience and effort, they finally made a snowman. Sarah was so happy that she hugged it and said, "I hope this snowman will stay with us forever."
Grandma smiled and said, "I hope so too, my dear. Let's go inside now and get warm". 
And when they left, the snowman stayed standing in the cold. Obedient as always.
