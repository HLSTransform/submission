One day, Mama poured the sky. She was very enthusiastic and happy. All of the colors of the sky came pouring out. First orange, then purple, and even a sprinkle of pink. Mama spread it all over the sky. It looked like a beautiful painting. The sun was now shining brightly with the sky’s new colors. Mama laughed and clapped with joy.
Then little Johnny wanted to pour too. He grabbed a big bucket and ran outside. He was so enthusiastic to pour the sky. He poured blue and green and yellow. Everyone was happy with the colorful sky. They all cheered for Johnny! 
The next day, little Johnny was already asking if he could pour the sky again. Mama smiled and said, “Yes, of course you can!” 
Little Johnny was so excited. He couldn’t wait to pour the sky and make it colorful again.
