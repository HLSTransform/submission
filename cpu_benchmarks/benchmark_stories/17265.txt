Once upon a time, there was a kind and nice boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toys and run around in the park. One day, he saw a little bird who was hurt and couldn't fly. Timmy felt very sad for the bird and promised to take care of it. He brought the bird home and gave it some food and water.
Timmy was very compassionate and took care of the bird every day. He even made a little nest for it to sleep in. He loved the bird very much and the bird loved him too. One day, Timmy's mom said they had to take the bird to the vet for a test. Timmy was worried, but he promised the bird that everything would be okay.
Sadly, the test showed that the bird was very sick and there was nothing the vet could do to help. Timmy was heartbroken and cried a lot. He held the bird in his arms and promised to always remember it. Timmy buried the bird in the park and said a little prayer for it every day. Even though the ending was bad, Timmy knew he had done the right thing by being kind and compassionate to the little bird.
