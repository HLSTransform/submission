Sara and Ben were playing in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They also made snowballs and threw them at each other. They laughed and had fun.
"Look, a jet!" Ben said, pointing at the sky. He saw a white line behind a fast plane. "It makes a sound like this: vroom!"
Sara looked up and saw the jet too. She liked how it flew high and fast. She wondered where it was going. "Maybe it is going to a warm place, where there is no snow," she said.
"Maybe," Ben said. "But I like the snow. It is icy and soft and fun. Do you want to make a snow angel?"
Sara nodded. She lay down on the snow and moved her arms and legs. She made a shape like an angel. Ben did the same. They looked at their snow angels and smiled.
But then they heard a loud horn. It was a big truck coming down the road. It was carrying a lot of logs. The truck driver saw the children and the snowman. He did not want to hit them. He pressed the brake and the horn. He yelled, "Yield, yield, yield!"
Sara and Ben heard the horn and the yell. They were scared. They jumped up and ran to the sidewalk. They held each other and watched the truck. The truck stopped just before the snowman. The snowman was safe.
The truck driver got out of the truck. He was angry and worried. He walked to the children and said, "Are you okay? You should not play on the road. It is dangerous. You have to yield to the trucks. Do you know what yield means?"
Sara and Ben nodded. They felt sorry and ashamed. They said, "Yes, we know. Yield means to let the trucks go first. We are sorry. We did not see the truck. We were looking at the jet."
The truck driver sighed. He was glad that the children were not hurt. He said, "It's okay. I'm glad you are okay. But please be careful next time. And don't play on the road. Play in the park or in your yard. And enjoy the snow. It is icy and soft and fun."
Sara and Ben said, "Thank you. We will. And we are sorry again."
The truck driver smiled. He said, "You're welcome. And don't be sorry. Just be safe. And have fun." He got back in his truck and drove away.
Sara and Ben waved at him. They looked at their snowman and their snow angels. They were happy. They decided to play in the park. They took their snowballs and ran to the park. They laughed and had fun.
