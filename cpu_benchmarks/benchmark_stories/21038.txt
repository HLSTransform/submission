Once upon a time there was a little girl named Kate. She wanted to go for a drive in her car, but it wouldn't work. She called for a mechanic to help.
The mechanic arrived and he was wearing blue overalls. He opened the hood of the car and rubbed his chin thoughtfully. He began to tinker with the engine and after a while the car roared into life.
Kate was so happy! She took the mechanic to the bakery and bought him a yummy cake to say thank you. He smiled and said it was the best reward he ever had.
Kate and the mechanic waved goodbye and Kate drove off happily in her car. She waved to the mechanic whenever she passed him and soon they were friends.
