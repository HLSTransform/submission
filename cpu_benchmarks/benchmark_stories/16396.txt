Anna loved to spin in her dress. She felt like a fairy when she spun. She spun and spun until she was dizzy. Then she fell on the grass and laughed.
"Anna, time for bed!" her mom called.
Anna did not want to go to bed. She wanted to spin more. She pouted and said, "No, mom, I want to spin!"
"Come on, sweetie, you need to sleep. You can spin again tomorrow," her mom said. She picked up Anna and carried her to her room.
Anna did not like her room. It was dark and scary. She saw shadows and shapes that looked like monsters. She heard noises that sounded like growls and hisses. She was afraid of the unknown things that hid in the dark.
She hugged her teddy bear and closed her eyes. She tried to think of happy things, like spinning and fairies. But she could not. She had a nightmare. She dreamed that she was spinning and spinning, but she could not stop. She spun faster and faster, until she felt sick. She spun out of control, until she flew off the ground. She spun into the dark, where the unknown things waited for her. They reached out with claws and teeth, and tried to catch her.
She screamed and woke up. She was sweating and shaking. She cried and called for her mom.
"Mom, mom, help me! I had a nightmare!"
Her mom heard her and ran to her room. She turned on the light and hugged her.
"Shh, shh, it's okay, Anna. It was just a bad dream. You're safe, you're with me," her mom said.
She rocked her and sang to her, until she calmed down. She kissed her and said, "I love you, Anna. You're my brave girl. Don't be afraid of the dark. There's nothing there that can hurt you. And if you ever have a nightmare again, I'll be here for you."
Anna felt better. She smiled and said, "I love you, mom. You're my best mom. Can I spin with you tomorrow?"
"Of course, Anna. We can spin together as much as you want," her mom said.
They cuddled and fell asleep. Anna did not have any more nightmares. She dreamed of spinning and fairies, and of her mom.
