Once upon a time, a little child named Timmy went to play in the park. Timmy loved playing on the swings and the slide, but he didn't like it when bigger kids pushed him around. One day, some big kids came and started to push Timmy. Timmy didn't like it and he cried.
Suddenly, a kind lady came and asked Timmy what was wrong. Timmy told her that the big kids were being mean to him. The lady told Timmy to be independent and stand up for himself. Timmy tried to do that, but the big kids were still pushing him around.
The kind lady saw that Timmy needed help, so she went and talked to the big kids. She told them to stop pushing Timmy around and to be nice. The big kids listened to her and stopped being mean. Timmy was happy and thanked the kind lady for saving him. From that day on, Timmy felt more independent and he stood up for himself.
