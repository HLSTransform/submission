Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Kitty. Kitty was very careless. She would play all day and not clean up her toys. One day, Kitty was playing with her ball. She threw it very high and it hit the ceiling. The ball fell down and rolled under the big chair.
Kitty looked for her ball but could not find it. She was sad and did not know what to do. She decided to lie down and think. As she lay on the floor, she saw her ball under the chair. Kitty was so happy!
From that day on, Kitty learned to be more careful when she played. She did not want to lose her toys again. And every night, before going to bed, Kitty would look at the ceiling and remember the day she found her ball.
