Once upon a time, there was a monster in the valley. It was big and mean and it was always very impatient.
One day, a little boy and girl walked into the valley. The monster was surprised to see them and was ready to destroy them.
But the little boy and girl were brave. The little boy said to the monster, "Please don't destroy us! We just want to explore the valley. We won't make any trouble."
The monster thought about it for a moment and then said, "OK. I will let you explore the valley. But be careful and come right back when you're done."
The little boy and girl were so happy and they thanked the monster. They ran off to explore the valley and the monster watched them go with a smile.
