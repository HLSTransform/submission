Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Max. Max lived in a cozy hole in the wall of a big house. One day, Max went to the store to get some cheese. He loved cheese so much! But when he got to the store, he saw a big grumpy cat. The cat looked hungry and mean. Max was scared, so he ran back to his hole.
Later that day, Max heard a noise outside his hole. It was the cat! The cat had found Max's hole and was trying to get in. Max was so scared, he didn't know what to do. He peeked out of his hole and saw the cat's big paws. Max knew he had to do something.
Max called out, "Hey cat! Why are you so grumpy? Do you want some cheese?" The cat stopped and looked at Max. "Cheese? I love cheese!" the cat said. Max quickly ran to the store and got some cheese. He brought it back to the cat and they shared it together. From that day on, the cat and Max were friends and Max never went to the store alone again.
