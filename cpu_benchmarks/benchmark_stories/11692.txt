Sarah and her mom went on a walk in nature one day. Everything was amazing. Following a long path they came across a beautiful tree with lush green leaves. Sarah heard a loud scream coming from the tree.
Fascinated and scared, Sarah asked her mom, “What’s that noise?”
Her mom replied, “Oh, that's just a bird. Don't worry, it's just singing.”
Sarah smiled, relieved and excited. She clapped her hands and said, “Let’s go see it!”
As they approached the tree, a huge flock of birds flew out of it and filled the air. It was an amazing sight. The birds' colors sparkled in the sunlight and their screams filled the nature around them.
Sarah was delighted, and clapped her hands with delight. She had never seen anything so amazing before.
