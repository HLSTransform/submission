Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and make them pretty clothes. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a spool of thread to use for her doll dresses.
Lily was so happy and started making a new dress right away. She worked very hard, but then she accidentally dropped the spool of thread and it rolled under the table. She couldn't reach it and didn't want to bother her mommy, so she left it there.
Later that day, Lily's mommy found the spool of thread under the table and asked Lily if she knew anything about it. Lily felt guilty and told her mommy what happened. Her mommy hugged her and said it was okay, but she needed to tell her if something like that happened again.
From then on, Lily always made sure to put her things away and tell her mommy if she needed help. And she continued to make beautiful clothes for her dolls with the spool of thread her mommy gave her.
