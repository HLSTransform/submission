Once upon a time, there were two friends, Cindy and Bill. They decided to introduce each other to something new. Cindy introduced Bill to some blue food. Bill was excited to try it. He had never seen blue food before! He took a bit, and found out that it was delicious. Cindy and Bill happily shared the food and talked about how much they liked it. Together, they laughed and smiled at their new experience. They had never seen blue food before and they were glad they got to try it. After that, they introduced each other to lots of other new things!
