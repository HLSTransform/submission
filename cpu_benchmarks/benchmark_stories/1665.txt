Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One night, she had a nightmare about a crazy monster. She woke up scared and sweaty. Her mom came to her room and gave her a warm bath to help her relax. Lily liked to soak in the tub and play with her rubber duckies. 
After her bath, Lily felt much better and went back to bed. She snuggled with her favorite stuffed animal and fell asleep quickly. When she woke up in the morning, she couldn't even remember her nightmare. She was happy and ready to play with her friends.
