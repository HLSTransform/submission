Once there was a little girl named Sally. She was only three years old. She had a mommy and daddy who loved her very much. They were very compassionate.
One day Sally was playing in her backyard. Suddenly she heard a noise coming from near her neck. It sounded like someone was calling her name. She looked around but she couldn't see who was calling her.
Sally became scared and started to cry. Her mommy heard her cries and ran outside. She quickly saw what was happening. On Sally's neck there was a little bird. The bird was calling to Sally.
Sally's mommy smiled at Sally and picked up the little bird. She told Sally that the bird was calling for help. She was so happy that Sally had been so compassionate to help the bird.
Sally's mommy told her that caring for others was such an important lesson. She hugged Sally and said that she was very proud of her. From that day Sally and the bird became the best of friends.
