Once upon a time there was a little bunny named Bink. Bink loved to explore the forest near his burrow. But one day, he came across a big mean bear! The bear demanded that Bink give him some of his carrots. Bink was frightened and shook his head, unwilling to share his food. The bear demanded again, but Bink still shook his head.
Just then, Bink's friend Dog came running up. Dog was bigger than the bear and he barked loudly; the bear was so scared he ran away. Bink was thankful that Dog had saved him.
The moral of this story is that it pays to be kind and have good friends. Even when we are scared, it is better to be brave and good than it is to be mean.
