Anna and Ben were twins who liked to play outside. They had a big yard with a swing, a slide and a sandbox. They also had a dog named Spot who liked to run and bark.
One day, they decided to play until the sun went down. They swung high and low, slid fast and slow, and made castles and roads in the sand. Spot chased them and wagged his tail. They had a lot of fun.
But as the sun got lower and lower, it also got bigger and bigger. It turned red and orange and yellow and purple. It looked like a big ball of fire in the sky.
"Wow, look at the sunset!" Anna said. "It's so pretty!"
"Yes, it is!" Ben agreed. "But it's also getting dark. We should go inside soon."
They watched the sunset for a few more minutes, then they heard their mom call them.
"Anna! Ben! Spot! Time to come in!" she said.
They ran to the door, but Spot stayed behind. He was still looking at the sunset.
"Spot, come on!" Anna said. "Don't you want to eat and sleep?"
Spot did not answer. He did not move. He just stared at the sun.
"Spot, what are you doing?" Ben asked. "Are you okay?"
Spot did not answer. He did not move. He just stared at the sun.
Then, suddenly, he opened his mouth and said:
"Wow!"
Anna and Ben gasped. They could not believe it. Spot could speak!
They ran to him and hugged him. They asked him how he learned to speak. They asked him what he wanted to say. They asked him if he liked the sunset.
Spot smiled and said:
"Wow!"
