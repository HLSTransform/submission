Once upon a time, there were two shapes that were different. One was yellow and the other was blue. The two shapes wanted to understand each other, but they couldn't. They soon became friends and smiled at each other. The blue shape thought the yellow shape was pretty and the yellow shape thought the blue shape was funny. They decided that they should try and understand each other better. So, they played together and made games out of their different shapes! They laughed and had lots of fun. In the end, the two shapes understood each other better.
