Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play with trucks and cars. They have many trucks and cars in their toy box. One day, they want to play outside. They take their trucks and cars and go to the yard.
They see their neighbor, Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee is old and kind. He has a big truck. He is loading boxes into his truck. He sees Lily and Tom and smiles.
"Hello, Lily and Tom. Do you like my truck?" he asks.
"Yes, we do. We have trucks and cars, too. Can we help you load your boxes?" Lily and Tom say. They are eager to help.
"Sure, you can help me. But be careful. The boxes are heavy. You can load the small ones. I will load the big ones." Mr. Lee says. He gives them some small boxes.
Lily and Tom are happy. They take the small boxes and put them in the truck. They work hard and fast. They make a game of it. They count the boxes and say their colors.
"One red box, two blue boxes, three green boxes..." they say.
Mr. Lee is grateful. He thanks them for their help. He gives them some cookies and juice. He tells them he is moving to a new house. He says he will miss them.
"We will miss you, too. You are a good neighbor. We hope you like your new house." Lily and Tom say. They hug him and wave goodbye.
They go back to their yard. They eat their cookies and drink their juice. They play with their trucks and cars. They pretend they are moving, too. They load and unload their toys. They have fun. They are good friends.
