Once upon a time, there was a lazy cat named Tom. Tom never wanted to do any work. He just liked to sleep and play all day. Tom had a friend, a dog named Sam. Sam was very good at helping others.
One day, Tom and Sam went to a big game. They watched as many animals tried to get a high score. Tom wanted to win too, but he was too lazy to try hard. Sam told Tom, "If you help me, I will provide you with tips to get a high score."
Tom thought about it and decided to help Sam. They worked together, and soon, Tom got better and better at the game. In the end, Tom got a high score, and everyone was happy.
The moral of the story is that when we help others and work hard, we can achieve great things. Being lazy will not provide us with success, but helping others and trying our best will make us winners.
