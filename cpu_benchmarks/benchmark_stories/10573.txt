Once upon a time, there was a friend. His name was Tom and he was always very tired. He took many naps during the day, so he never had enough time to play.
One day, Tom had an idea. He wanted to find an ugly place to take a nap. He searched and searched, but he could not find anything. He was very disappointed. Until, he looked in his closet and found an old blanket that looked very ugly. It was perfect!
Tom took his ugly blanket and went outside. He found a nice shady spot under a tree and spread his blanket out. He was so happy to find a place to take a nap.
As he lay there, Tom heard a voice in the distance. He looked up and saw an old friend of his. He was surprised to see him, but even more surprised to hear his friend call out, "Tom! I've been looking for you. I needed an ugly place to take a nap. Are you up for it?"
Tom smiled and said, "Yes, of course! You can lie down here and take a nap with me."
And so, Tom and his friend enjoyed a long, peaceful nap in their ugly blanket nest. It was a perfect setting, proving that naps can be beautiful no matter where you take them.
