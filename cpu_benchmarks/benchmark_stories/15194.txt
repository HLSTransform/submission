Once upon a time, there was a dependable dog named Spot. Spot was a good dog who always helped his family. He liked to provide help to his mom and dad. Spot loved to play outside in the evening when the sun was going down.
One day, Spot was playing with his ball when he saw a cat named Whiskers. Whiskers wanted to take Spot's ball away. Spot said, "No, Whiskers, this is my ball. We can play together, but you can't take it away."
Whiskers didn't listen and tried to take the ball again. Spot was sad, but he had an idea. He told Whiskers, "If we share the ball, we can both have fun." Whiskers thought about it and agreed. They played together in the evening and became good friends. From that day on, Spot and Whiskers always shared their toys and played together.
