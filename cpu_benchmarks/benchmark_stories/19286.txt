Once upon a time, there was a dog and a cat. They lived next door to each other. One night, the cat decided to take a walk. He picked up a rope and began to wander. As he walked, the dog watched and gazed.
The cat saw a bird and grew curious. He started to walk towards it and began to run. Suddenly, the rope got tangled around the cat's body and he was stuck! The cat was so surprised and called for help. The dog quickly ran over.
The dog tried and tried but he couldn't manage to uncut the rope. He growled and whined in frustration. After a few moments, the dog had a good idea. He grabbed a pair of scissors and cut the rope. The cat was free!
The cat was so relieved and thanked the dog for being so smart. The dog laughed and said,"It was nothing, I'm not stupid like you!" The cat smiled and said,"Maybe not, but at least I'm not stuck anymore!" They both laughed and went home.
