Lily liked to play the violin. She had a small violin that was just right for her. She learned how to hold it and make sounds with the bow. She wanted to be a good violin player like her mom.
But sometimes Lily did not behave. She would play the violin when she was supposed to be quiet. She would play the violin when her baby brother was sleeping. She would play the violin when her dad was working. She would make loud and funny noises with the violin. She thought it was fun, but it made everyone else unhappy.
One day, Lily's mom took her to a big place where many people played the violin. It was a concert. Lily saw a wide stage with many chairs and stands. She saw a lot of violins and other instruments. She heard beautiful music that made her feel happy and calm.
Lily's mom said, "This is how you play the violin with other people. You have to listen and follow and be gentle. You have to behave and respect the music and the audience. Do you understand?"
Lily nodded. She understood. She wanted to play the violin like that. She wanted to make beautiful music with other people. She wanted to make her mom proud.
She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I will behave. I will play the violin better. Can we go home and practice?"
Lily's mom smiled and hugged her. She said, "Yes, we can. I love you, Lily. And I love your violin."
