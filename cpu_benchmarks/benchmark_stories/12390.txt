Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was very creative and liked to make things. One day Lucy decided she needed to create something even more special. She went to her mom and said: 
"Mom can I make a cake?"
Mom smiled and said "Sure, why don't you try?"
Lucy was so excited! She ran to the kitchen and found the ingredients for a delicious cake. She put them all in a bowl and mixed them together. Then she put the mix in an oven, waiting for it to cook.
When the cake was ready, everyone was amazed! It was incredible! Lucy had made a delicious cake! Everyone was so proud of her!
Lucy could not believe she had made something so incredible. She was so happy that she had created such a wonderful treat!
