Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved playing outside in the sun. She always wore a hat to keep the sun out of her eyes. One day, she found a pretty palm tree with big leaves. She thought it was very attractive and wanted to climb it. But when she got closer, she saw a spider on the tree. Lily hates spiders! She decided to go play somewhere else instead.
