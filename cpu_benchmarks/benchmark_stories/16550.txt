Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big peach tree with many ripe peaches. They wanted to pick some peaches to eat, but they were too high for them to reach.
"Let's use a ladder," Ben said. He found a wooden ladder in the shed and carried it to the tree. He put it against the trunk and climbed up. "Wow, these peaches look so good!" he said.
"Can I have one?" Lily asked. She followed Ben up the ladder, but she was scared of falling. She held on to the ladder tightly and moved slowly.
"Here, take this one," Ben said. He picked a juicy peach and handed it to Lily. "Don't worry, I'll support you. You won't fall."
"Thank you, Ben," Lily said. She took the peach and bit into it. It was sweet and soft. She smiled and said, "This is the best peach ever!"
They ate their peaches and enjoyed the view from the tree. They saw birds, flowers, and butterflies. They felt happy and proud. They had done something interesting and fun together. They were good twins who supported each other.
