One sunny morning, a farmer and his mule were walking through the field. Suddenly, the farmer noticed something dead in the grass. The farmer thought: "Someone must have stolen my mule!"
The farmer looked at the mule. He said: "Did someone steal you?" The mule made a little noise and shook its head 'no'. 
So, the farmer looked around and he saw someone running away in the distance. He said: "That must be the thief!" 
The farmer followed the thief. He ran through the fields until he caught the thief. He said: "You must give me back my mule!" 
The thief said: "Please, don't hurt me! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to steal your mule!"
The farmer was angry, but he knew that the thief was sorry. So, he let the thief go and brought his mule back to the farm. 
The farmer was relieved that his mule was safe and that he was able to catch the thief before it was too late. He knew that the thief learned a valuable lesson and would never steal again!
