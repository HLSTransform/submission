Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a regular kitten named Mittens. Mittens was her best friend and she loved to carry him around everywhere she went.
One day, Lily and Mittens went on a walk in the park. They met a big dog who barked loudly at them. Lily picked up Mittens to carry him away. But then, the dog jumped and scared Lily. She dropped Mittens and he ran away.
Lily cried and looked for Mittens everywhere, but she couldn't find him. She asked the dog if he had seen him, but the dog just barked. Lily was very sad and missed her regular kitten.
