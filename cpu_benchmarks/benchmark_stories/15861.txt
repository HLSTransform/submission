One day, Mommy and Jimmy went to the store. Mommy was looking for a new model for the house. Jimmy was looking for something colorful. Everywhere Jimmy looked, he saw something different. He started to get frustrated that he couldn't find anything. 
Mommy asked, "What's wrong Jimmy?"
Jimmy replied, "I can't find anything I want!"
Mommy said, "Don't worry, I'm sure something will turn up soon."
Jimmy kept looking, but nothing caught his eye. Then, he saw a colorful model sitting on a shelf. It was perfect!
Mommy said, "Excellent choice Jimmy!"
Jimmy was so excited that they took the model home with them. But when they got home, Mommy started ignoring Jimmy and the model. Jimmy was very sad, but he was determined to make Mommy see what a great model he chose.
Jimmy set up the model and waited. Finally, Mommy saw it. She couldn't ignore it any longer! Mommy said, "Jimmy, this model is so colorful and beautiful!"
Jimmy smiled, proud that his choice had been recognized. He knew if he looked hard enough he would find something special!
