Ben and Mia are playing with their toys in the living room. Ben has a red car and Mia has a yellow doll. They are having fun making noises and pretending to drive and talk.
"Vroom, vroom, I'm going to the park!" Ben says.
"Hello, I'm going to the shop!" Mia says.
But then, Ben sees something shiny on the shelf. It is a blue train with wheels and a whistle. He wants to play with it.
"Look, Mia, a train!" Ben says. He gets up and runs to the shelf. He grabs the train and pulls it down.
"Ben, no!" Mia says. "That is Dad's train! He told us not to touch it!"
But Ben does not listen. He holds the train and pushes the button. The train makes a loud noise and starts to move. Ben is happy. He puts the train on the floor and follows it.
"Choo, choo, I'm the train driver!" Ben says.
But then, the train hits the table leg and falls over. The wheels come off and the whistle breaks. The train is broken. Ben is sad. He picks up the train and tries to fix it. He cannot.
"Oh no, oh no, what have I done?" Ben says.
Mia comes over and sees the broken train. She is scared. She knows Dad will be angry.
"Ben, you broke Dad's train!" Mia says. "He will be very mad at you!"
Ben starts to cry. He does not know what to do. He wishes he did not take the train. He wishes he listened to Mia.
"I'm sorry, Mia, I'm sorry!" Ben says.
Mia feels sorry for Ben. She thinks of a way to help him.
"Maybe we can find the wheels and the whistle and put them back on," Mia says. "Come on, let's search for them."
Ben and Mia search for the wheels and the whistle. They look under the table, behind the sofa, in the bin. They find one wheel and the whistle, but not the other wheel.
"Where is the other wheel?" Ben says.
"I don't know, maybe it rolled away," Mia says.
They hear the door open. Dad is home. They are afraid. They hide the broken train and the parts under a pillow.
"Hello, kids, I'm home!" Dad says. He comes into the living room. He sees Ben and Mia sitting on the floor. He smiles.
"Did you have a good day?" Dad says.
Ben and Mia nod. They do not say anything. They hope Dad does not see the train.
Dad walks to the shelf. He sees something is missing. He frowns.
"Where is my train?" Dad says. He looks around. He sees a pillow on the floor. He lifts it up. He sees the broken train and the parts. He gasps.
"Who did this?" Dad says. He looks at Ben and Mia. They look down. They are sorry.
Ben and Mia learn a lesson. They should not touch things that are not theirs. They should listen to their sister or brother. They should tell the truth and say sorry. They hope Dad will forgive them.
