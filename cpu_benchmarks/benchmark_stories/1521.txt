Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very compassionate. She loved to help people and was always kind to everyone she met. One day she decided to bake a cake for some friends. She put all the ingredients together and carefully mixed them with a spoon until they were combined into a delicious cake.
The little girl was so excited to share her cake with her friends, but when she tried to separate the cake into equal pieces so that everyone could have their own, she realized it was too difficult. 
The little girl began to cry and her friends noticed. They all came together and offered to each take a small piece so that the cake could be separated. With the help of her friends, the little girl was able to separate the cake into eight individual portions, enough for everyone.
The little girl was so grateful for her compassionate friends and thanked them for their help. Then everyone sat down to enjoy the delicious cake that she had made.
