Anna and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to look at the sky and see the clouds. They saw many shapes in the clouds. They saw a bunny, a car, a flower and a star.
"Look, Ben, that cloud looks like a bunny!" Anna said, pointing at the sky.
"I see it, Anna, it has long ears and a fluffy tail!" Ben said, smiling.
They looked for more clouds that looked like things they knew. They recognized a car, a flower and a star. They were having fun.
Then they saw a big cloud that looked like nothing. It was just a big, white, fluffy cloud. It covered the sun and made the sky darker.
"What is that cloud, Anna?" Ben asked, feeling scared.
"I don't know, Ben, it is a strange cloud. Maybe it is a monster cloud!" Anna said, feeling scared too.
They hugged each other and wished the cloud would go away. They did not like the strange cloud.
But then the wind blew and the cloud moved. The sun came out again and made the sky bright and blue. The strange cloud was gone.
"Look, Ben, the sky is beautiful again!" Anna said, feeling happy.
"Yes, Anna, it is. And look, there is a rainbow!" Ben said, feeling happy too.
They saw the rainbow with many colors. They recognized red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple. They liked the rainbow. It was a beautiful cloud. They smiled and clapped their hands. They were not scared anymore. They were happy.
