Once upon a time, there was a shy little girl named Lily who loved to play on the beach. One day, she saw a big barrel in the water and decided to go and wave at it. "Hello, barrel!" she said. But the barrel didn't wave back.
Suddenly, a big wave came and knocked Lily over. She tried to get up, but the barrel was in her way. "Move, barrel, move!" she said. But the barrel didn't move.
Lily started to cry because she was scared and stuck. "Help, help!" she shouted. But nobody came. The tide came in and Lily was swept away with the barrel. The end.
