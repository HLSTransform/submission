Once upon a time there was a fly who wanted to have a nap. So he found a nice spot near a well and he lay down. He closed his eyes and sighed contentedly.
But then there came a strong wind and it blew and blew. The wind made the well shake and shiver. But still the fly lay there, getting rocked back and forth in the wind like a baby in a cradle.
But soon the wind died down and the well was still again. The fly opened his eyes and realized he had had a very fine nap. He flapped his wings and buzzed away, feeling rested and happy.
