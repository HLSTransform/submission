Once upon a time, there was a firefighter named Tim. He wore a red uniform and had a big fire truck. One day, Tim was driving his fire truck when he saw a crazy monkey on the road. The monkey was jumping around and making silly noises. 
Tim stopped his fire truck and said, "Hello, Mr. Monkey. What are you doing?" The monkey didn't reply but kept jumping around. Tim thought the monkey might need help, so he got out of his truck and walked towards the monkey. 
Suddenly, the monkey jumped on Tim's head and started pulling his hair! Tim laughed and said, "You're a silly monkey!" The monkey replied with a loud screech. Tim gently took the monkey off his head and put him in a tree. Then he continued driving his fire truck to help people in need. The end.
