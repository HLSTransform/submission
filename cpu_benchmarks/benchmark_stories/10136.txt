Lila and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys. They have many toys, but their favorite is a big red car. The car can make noises and lights. It is very noisy and shiny.
One day, Lila and Ben want to polish their car. They find a cloth and some water. They rub the cloth on the car. They make it more shiny. They are happy.
"Look, Ben, our car is so shiny!" Lila says.
"Yes, Lila, it is very shiny. Can we play with it now?" Ben says.
They turn on the car and make it move. It makes noises and lights. They laugh and have fun.
But then, they smell something bad. They look at the cloth. It is dirty and stinky. They wonder why.
They remember that they used the cloth from the kitchen. The cloth was for wiping the dishes. The dishes had food on them. The food made the cloth dirty and stinky.
"Yuck, Lila, the cloth is dirty and stinky!" Ben says.
"Yes, Ben, it is dirty and stinky. We used the wrong cloth. We should have used a clean cloth." Lila says.
They throw away the cloth. They wash their hands. They wash their car. They make it shiny again.
They learn a lesson. They should not use a dirty cloth to polish their car. They should use a clean cloth. They should also not taste the cloth. It might taste bad. They should only taste food. Food tastes good.
