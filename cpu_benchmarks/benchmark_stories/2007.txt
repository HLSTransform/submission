Once there was a girl who really wanted to go on an adventure. She wanted to explore a stream she had never seen. So, she went with her mom to find it. It was a very quiet stream, with no people around. The girl and her mom sat down by the water and the girl started throwing stones in. She wanted to make little patterns in the water. Suddenly she saw a fish swim up to the surface. The fish wanted to play, too. So the girl and the fish had lots of fun together. Then, after playing for a while, she and her mom went home. She was very happy that she had found a new friend in the quiet stream.
