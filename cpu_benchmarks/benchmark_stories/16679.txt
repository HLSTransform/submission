Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy wanted a present for his birthday. He asked his mom and dad for a present every day for a month. Timmy was persistent.
On his birthday, Timmy got a big present. He was so happy! But then he saw his dog, Max, burying something in the backyard. Timmy went outside to see what Max was burying. Max had buried a bone! Timmy laughed and played with Max.
Later that day, Timmy's mom made him a cake. Timmy blew out the candles and made a wish. He wished that Max would never stop burying bones. Timmy loved his birthday present, but he loved Max more.
