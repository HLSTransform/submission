Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was very hungry. He wanted to eat a big cake. So, he asked his mom, "Mom, can I have a cake?"
Mom said, "Yes, Tom. But first, you must pass a test." Tom was excited to take the test. The test was to send a letter to Grandma. Tom took a piece of paper and wrote, "I love you, Grandma." He put the letter in an envelope and went to the mailbox.
Tom put the letter in the mailbox and said, "I did it! I passed the test!" Mom was very proud of Tom. She gave him a big cake to eat. Tom was so happy, and he shared the cake with his mom. They both enjoyed the cake, and Tom was not hungry anymore.
