Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and eat yummy food. But sometimes they fight over things. One day, Mom made sausages for lunch. She gave Lily and Ben one sausage each on a plate.
"Wow, sausages!" Lily said. "I love sausages!"
"Me too!" Ben said. "They smell good!"
They both took a big bite of their sausages. They were hot and juicy. But then Lily saw something on Ben's plate. It was a piece of cheese. Lily liked cheese too. She wanted some.
"Ben, can I have some cheese?" Lily asked.
"No, it's mine!" Ben said. "You have a sausage!"
"But I want cheese too!" Lily said. "Please, Ben, share with me!"
Ben shook his head. He did not want to share his cheese. He liked it too much. He put it in his mouth and chewed. Lily felt sad and angry. She did not think it was fair.
"Mom, Ben won't share his cheese with me!" Lily cried.
Mom heard Lily and came to the table. She saw Lily's tears and Ben's cheese. She knew it was difficult for them to share sometimes. But she wanted them to be kind to each other.
"Lily, Ben, sharing is a good thing to do," Mom said. "It makes you and others happy. How would you feel if Ben wanted some of your sausage and you said no?"
Lily thought for a moment. She knew she would not like it if Ben took her sausage. She would feel sad and angry too. She looked at Ben and saw that he had finished his cheese. He looked happy.
"Maybe I can share my sausage with Ben," Lily said. "Then we can both have some sausage and cheese."
Ben heard Lily and smiled. He liked the idea of having some sausage too. He felt sorry for making Lily cry. He wanted to be nice to her.
"Thank you, Lily," Ben said. "That's very kind of you. I'm sorry I didn't share my cheese with you. Next time I will."
Lily and Ben hugged each other. They cut their sausages in half and swapped. They ate their lunch happily. Mom was proud of them. She gave them a kiss and a hug.
"Good job, Lily and Ben," Mom said. "You learned how to share. Sharing is caring. I love you both very much."
