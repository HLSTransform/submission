One day, little Sam was walking through the village. He was very excited to explore all the new places. Everywhere he looked he saw beautiful orange flowers, little blue houses and all sorts of animals. But then, as he got closer to the center of the village, he heard something. It sounded like someone was trembling.
Little Sam looked around and saw a frightened little kitten trembling under a bush. He was sad for the kitty and wanted to help. He kneeled down and softly said: "Why are you trembling little kitty?"
The scared kitty answered: "I am afraid of humans. If I get closer, they will hurt me". Little Sam was so sad to hear this. He gently picked the kitty up and said: "I won't hurt you, I just want to be your friend". 
The kitty was still trembling, but slowly she started to trust Sam. The two of them became the best of friends. 
This story teaches us that it's important to be kind and understanding to all living creatures, even if they are scared of us at first. With time and patience, we can make even the most trembling creatures our friends.
