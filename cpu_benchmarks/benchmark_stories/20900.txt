Once upon a time there was a boy called Sam. Sam was three years old and he loved to read books. One day Sam was walking in the park when he saw another boy who was playing with a toy car. 
But, even thought the other boy was having fun, he was being very rude. He refused to share the toy car with his friends and yelled at them if they even tried to get close. Sam didn't like that at all.
Sam went over to the other boy and said "Please don't be so rude. It's not nice to talk to your friends like that." The other boy didn't like to be told off and he ran away, leaving the toy car behind.
Sam then picked up the car and said "If you want your car back, come over to my house. We can read stories and I can teach you how to be kind to others."
The next day, the other boy came to Sam's house. They read stories and played together. Sam taught the other boy how to share and be kind. Finally, the other boy was no longer rude and was happy to share with his friends.
Sam's lesson was very important: no matter how young, everyone should always be kind to others.
