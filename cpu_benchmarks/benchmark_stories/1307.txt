One day, Max was walking down the street. He saw something strange! There was a man painting on the street! Max thought it was weird.
Max went to the man and asked what he was doing. The man said he was painting a picture of a big bear. Max thought it was cool!
Max wanted to paint too, so they painted a rainbow together. They used lots of colors to make it look beautiful.
When they were done, Max was really happy! He had never seen a picture as pretty as the one they made. The street looked weird but fun with all the colors.
Max smiled and waved goodbye to the man. He was really happy with the painting they made together.
