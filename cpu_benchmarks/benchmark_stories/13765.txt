Lily is a daughter who likes to play in the mud. She makes mud pies and mud castles and mud animals. She gets very dirty and her clothes get very dirty too.
But Lily does not like to bathe. She thinks bathing is boring and cold and wet. She runs away when her mom calls her to the bathroom. She hides under the bed or behind the sofa or in the closet.
Her mom is patient. She does not get angry or yell at Lily. She waits and waits and waits. She says, "Lily, it is time to bathe. Bathing is good for you. It makes you clean and fresh and happy. You can play with your toys in the water. You can make bubbles and splash and sing. Please come to the bathroom, Lily."
Lily hears her mom and feels a little sorry. She knows her mom loves her and wants her to be healthy and comfortable. She also knows her mom will not give up. She decides to give bathing a try. She comes out of her hiding place and goes to the bathroom.
Her mom is happy to see her. She helps her take off her dirty clothes and puts them in the hamper. She fills the tub with warm water and adds some soap and shampoo. She gives Lily a rubber duck and a boat and a sponge. She says, "Lily, you can bathe now. Have fun and be careful. I will be right here if you need me."
Lily gets into the tub and feels the water on her skin. She likes how it feels. She plays with her toys and makes bubbles and splash and sing. She lets her mom wash her hair and body with the sponge. She rinses off the soap and shampoo with the shower head. She feels clean and fresh and happy.
She says, "Mom, thank you for bathing me. I like bathing now. It is not boring or cold or wet. It is fun and warm and nice. Can I bathe again tomorrow?"
Her mom smiles and hugs her. She says, "Lily, you are welcome. I am proud of you for trying something new. You can bathe again tomorrow, but only after you play in the mud."
