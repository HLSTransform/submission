Once upon a time, there was a little angel named Lily. She lived in a big, blue sky with her family. Lily had a dream. She wanted to learn how to swim in the clouds.
One day, Lily met a tough bird named Max. Max was very good at swimming in the clouds. Lily asked Max, "Can you teach me how to swim in the clouds?" Max said, "Yes, I can help you, but you have to be brave."
Lily and Max practiced swimming in the clouds every day. At first, it was hard for Lily, but she did not give up. She was a tough little angel. After some time, Lily became very good at swimming in the clouds. She was so happy, and she thanked Max for helping her. Now, Lily swims in the clouds every day, and she and Max are the best of friends.
