Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her favorite cup. One day, while she was playing, she accidentally dropped the cup and it broke into many pieces.
Lily's mom saw what happened and said, "Oh no! Your cup is broken. Let's put it in the cupboard and maybe we can fix it later."
Lily felt sad and said, "I'm sorry, Mommy. I didn't mean to break it."
Mommy hugged Lily and said, "It's okay, sweetie. I forgive you. Accidents happen."
Lily felt better and smiled. She learned that it's okay to make mistakes and that forgiveness can make everything better.
