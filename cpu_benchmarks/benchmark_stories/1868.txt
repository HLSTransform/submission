Once upon a time there were two best friends, Jack and Sarah. They were always doing something fun together. Today, they had a new plan - they wanted to go to the park!
But to get there, they would have to push the tire. It was very heavy and they had to use their teamwork to move it. 
Jack said, "It's hard work pushing this tire, Sarah. Let's take turns to share the load." And Sarah agreed.
They both worked hard to push the tire and soon reached the park. It was so much fun! They played all sorts of games and behaved beautifully. All the while, Jack and Sarah were very creative. They found ways to use the tire in their games - rolling it along and pushing each other around on it.
When it was time to go, Jack and Sarah said goodbye to the tire. They knew the tire had been very helpful in making their day extra special.
