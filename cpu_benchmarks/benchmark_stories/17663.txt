Once upon a time there was a girl named Emma. She was three years old. Emma didn't like playing in her room. She wanted to improve her game by performing on stage for everyone to see.
So Emma asked her mom for help. Her mom was enthusiastic and said she could enter in a singing competition. Emma was very excited and couldn't wait.
They started practicing every day. Emma worked very hard and kept trying to improve her singing.
Soon it was time for the competition. Emma was nervous but also excited. She went up on stage and sang her song. Everyone was amazed!
After the competition, Emma was overjoyed by how well she did. She knew she wanted to keep improving. And she knew she could do it!
