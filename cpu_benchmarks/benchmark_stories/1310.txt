Once there was a little boy named Jack. Jack was a brave boy but he had one fear. He was scared of the dark!
One night, Jack was getting ready to go to bed. He was feeling very fearful when he heard a noise outside. He decided to go and see what had happen.
Jack opened the door and saw a little puppy! It was a very small puppy and it was shivering. Jack knew that he had to help it.
He took the puppy inside and gave it some food and water. He put the puppy to stay in his bed and he covered it with a blanket and hugged it until the puppy fell asleep.
Jack was so brave and kind - he made sure the puppy was safe and stayed with it until morning came. He was not fearful anymore. Jack and the puppy became best friends and they were never afraid of the dark again!
