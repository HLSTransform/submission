Once upon a time, there was an old man who loved to eat mint. He had a big garden where he grew lots of mint. Every day, he would pick some mint leaves and put them in his tea. 
One day, a little girl came to the old man's garden. She saw the mint and wanted to try it. The old man shared some mint with her and they became friends. 
Days passed and the little girl would come to the garden every day to see her friend. But one day, the old man became very sick and had to go to the hospital. The little girl went to visit him, but he remained very sick. 
Sadly, the old man passed away and the little girl was very sad. She remembered their friendship and the mint they shared. She decided to plant some mint in her own garden in memory of her friend.
