Once upon a time there was a cat and a mouse. The cat was very competitive and always wanted to be the best. 
The mouse was very curious and liked to explore. One day, the mouse wanted to climb something really high, but he was too small. 
The cat saw this and said "I will help you. I am competitive and strong, so I can let you on my paw and you can climb up!" The mouse thought about it and said "Okay!"
The cat put his paw on the ground and the mouse scrambled up. The mouse went really high and the cat felt proud. He had helped his friend reach the top. 
The mouse had a great time looking around and the cat was happy to have been of help. The two friends had a lot of fun that day and they both felt proud of their accomplishment.
