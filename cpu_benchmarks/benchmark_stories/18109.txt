Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his friends at the park every Wednesday. They would run and jump and laugh together. But one day, Timmy got sick and had to stay home. He was sad because he didn't want to miss playing with his friends.
Timmy's mom knew how much he loved going to the park on Wednesdays, so she tried to prevent him from feeling too sad. She made him his favorite soup and read him his favorite book. She even let him watch his favorite show on TV. Timmy felt a little better, but he still missed his friends.
The next Wednesday, Timmy's friends came to visit him. They brought him a get-well card and some toys to play with. Timmy was so happy to see them and play with them at his house. He realized that even though he couldn't go to the park, he still had his friends. They were still popular in his heart.
