Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a unique teddy bear that she loved very much. One day, Lily's little brother took her teddy bear and wouldn't give it back. Lily was very upset and cried.
Lily's mom saw her crying and asked what was wrong. Lily told her that her brother took her teddy bear and wouldn't give it back. Her mom asked her brother to give back the teddy bear, but he refused. He said he wanted to play with it.
Lily's mom had an idea. She went to the bathroom and got a razor. She showed it to Lily's brother and said, "If you don't give back the teddy bear, I will settle this with the razor." Her brother got scared and gave back the teddy bear. Lily was happy to have her teddy bear back and hugged it tightly.
