Ben and Lily were playing with their crayons and paper. They liked to draw and write letters. Ben knew how to write his name and Lily knew how to write hers. They were very proud of their letters.
But then, Ben saw that Lily had an enormous letter L on her paper. He wanted to have an enormous letter too. He took his red crayon and tried to mark a big B on his paper. But he made a mistake and marked over Lily's L.
"Hey, that's my L!" Lily shouted. "You marked over it! That's not nice!"
"I'm sorry, Lily," Ben said. "I wanted to have a big letter too. But I messed up. Can I fix it?"
Lily was angry and sad. She liked her L and she did not want Ben to mark over it. She did not want to share her paper with him. She said, "No, you can't fix it. You ruined it. Go away!"
Ben felt bad. He did not mean to hurt Lily's feelings. He liked Lily and he wanted to play with her. He said, "Please, Lily, don't be mad. I'll give you a new paper and a new crayon. And I'll help you write a new L. Can we be friends again?"
Lily looked at Ben. She saw that he was sorry and that he wanted to make up. She thought for a moment. Then she said, "Okay, Ben. I forgive you. You can give me a new paper and a new crayon. And we can write big letters together. But don't mark over my L again, okay?"
Ben smiled and nodded. He said, "Okay, Lily. I won't mark over your L again. I promise. Thank you for being my friend."
They hugged and then they went back to their crayons and paper. They wrote big letters and drew pictures. They had fun and they were happy.
