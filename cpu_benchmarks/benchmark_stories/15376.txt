The little girl played with her friends in the park. They were having lots of fun. Suddenly they heard a noise coming from the lake. It was a dog. The dog was stuck in the lake and crying for help. The little girl was very brave and creative. She had an idea. She ran to the nearby playground and grabbed a club. She ran back to the lake and used the club to rescue the dog.
The little girl and her friends were very happy that the dog was safe. They hugged it and the dog licked their faces as a sign of gratefulness. The girls were so proud of the little girl for being so brave and creative. The rescue of the dog became a wonderful memory they would always remember.
