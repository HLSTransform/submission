Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play hide and seek with her friends. One day, they decided to play near a big bridge. Lily found a hidden spot behind a tree and squeezed herself in. 
Her friend, Tommy, shouted, "Where is Lily? I can't find her!" 
Lily giggled and replied, "I'm hiding behind the tree, silly!" 
Tommy ran towards her and tried to squeeze in the small space with her, but they both fell down and laughed. They continued to play until the sun went down and it was time to go home. 
From that day on, Lily and Tommy always remembered their fun adventure at the bridge and how they squeezed themselves into a hidden spot.
