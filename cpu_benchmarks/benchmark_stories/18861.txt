Sara liked to fold paper. She made many shapes with paper. She made hats, boats, planes, and animals. She was cheerful when she folded paper. She showed her paper shapes to her mom and dad. They smiled and hugged her.
One day, Sara found a big paper in the closet. It was white and smooth. She wanted to fold it. She took it to her room. She folded it into a big plane. She was very happy. She wanted to fly her plane.
She ran to the window. She opened it. She threw her plane out. She watched it fly in the air. She clapped her hands. She leaned out to see it better. But she leaned too much. She lost her balance. She fell out of the window.
She screamed. Her mom and dad heard her. They ran to the window. They saw her on the ground. She was not moving. They cried. They called for help. But it was too late. Sara was gone. Her life was over. Her paper plane flew away.
