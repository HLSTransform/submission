Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a soft, cuddly teddy bear that he loved very much. One day, Timmy went to the park to play with his teddy bear. While he was playing, he accidentally dropped his teddy bear into a hole in the ground. Timmy was very sad because he couldn't reach his teddy bear and he didn't know how to get it out of the hole.
Suddenly, Timmy had an idea. He took his pocket and filled it with dirt. Then, he used his hands to bury the dirt into the hole until it was full. After a few minutes, Timmy dug out the dirt with his hands and his teddy bear was back in his arms! Timmy was very happy and hugged his teddy bear tightly.
From that day on, Timmy was more careful with his teddy bear and never let it out of his sight. He also learned that when things get buried, they can still be found if you try hard enough.
