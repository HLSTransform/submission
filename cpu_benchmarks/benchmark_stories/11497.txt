Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a well. The well was very important to the people who lived there. They used the water from the well to drink, cook, and clean. Everyone loved the well.
One day, a little boy named Tim felt guilty. He had accidentally thrown his ball into the well. He didn't know what to do. So, he went to his big sister, Sue, and said, "Sue, I threw my ball in the well. Can you help me get it back?" Sue smiled and said, "Don't worry, Tim. I will protect you and help you get your ball back."
Sue and Tim went to the well. Sue used a long stick to reach into the well and get the ball. She gave the ball back to Tim, and they both felt happy. From that day on, Tim promised to be more careful and protect the well. The well continued to give water to the village, and everyone lived happily ever after.
