Max saw a rhythm in the tree. He was excited and wanted to join in. He asked the tree to let him take part in the rhythm. But the tree didn’t move or talk. Max was very sad and angry.
His mum saw him and tried to explain. She said that the tree was ignorant and couldn’t join Max in the rhythm. This made Max even more sad. He thought that the tree was being mean and not letting him join in.
His mum hugged him and said that he could create his own rhythm. Suddenly he felt better and the sadness went away. He clapped his hands and sang a song with a rhythm that only he could see. He smiled and enjoyed playing with his new rhythm.
