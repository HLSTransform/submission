Tom and Lily liked to play with their dad's phone. They could record funny sounds and watch them later. One day, they found a new button on the phone. It said "zoom". They wondered what it did.
"Let's try it," Tom said. He pressed the button and pointed the phone at Lily. The phone made a beep and showed Lily's face very big on the screen. Lily laughed and made a silly face.
"Wow, that's cool!" Tom said. He pressed the button again and zoomed out. Then he zoomed in on his own face. He made a funny noise and recorded it.
"Let me try, let me try!" Lily said. She reached for the phone, but Tom pulled it away.
"No, it's my turn!" Tom said. He was selfish. He did not want to share the phone with Lily. He zoomed in and out on different things and recorded them.
"Please, Tom, give me the phone!" Lily said. She was sad and angry. She wanted to play with the zoom too. She tried to grab the phone, but Tom pushed her away.
"Stop it, Lily, you're annoying!" Tom said. He did not care about Lily's feelings. He only cared about the phone.
Suddenly, they heard their dad's voice. He came into the room and saw them fighting over the phone.
"What are you doing, kids?" he asked. He looked at the phone and saw the zoom button. He realized what they were playing with.
"Did you record anything with the zoom?" he asked.
"Yes, dad, look!" Tom said. He was proud of his recordings. He showed his dad the phone and played the sounds.
Dad listened to the sounds and looked at the screen. He saw Tom's face, Lily's face, a toy, a book, a lamp, and a flower. He also saw Tom pushing Lily and Lily crying.
Dad was not happy. He was disappointed and angry. He took the phone from Tom and turned it off.
"Tom, you were very selfish and mean to Lily," he said. "You did not share the phone and you hurt her. That's not nice. You need to say sorry to Lily and give her a hug."
Tom felt ashamed. He knew he was wrong. He looked at Lily and saw her tears. He felt sorry for her.
"I'm sorry, Lily," he said. "I was selfish and mean. I should have shared the phone with you. Will you forgive me?"
Lily looked at Tom and saw his sorry face. She felt better. She forgave him.
"It's okay, Tom," she said. "I forgive you. Let's be friends again."
She hugged him and he hugged her back.
Dad smiled. He was glad they made up. He gave them both a kiss.
"Good kids," he said. "Now, how about we watch the recordings together and have some fun?"
