Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's mom decided to grill some hot dogs for lunch. Timmy loved hot dogs and couldn't wait to eat them.
As his mom was grilling the hot dogs, Timmy's friends came over to play. They were all very excited to eat the hot dogs. But Timmy's mom warned them, "Be careful, the grill is very hot. You don't want to get burned."
Timmy and his friends were very hungry and couldn't wait to eat the hot dogs. But Timmy remembered what his mom said and prevented his friends from getting too close to the grill. "Let's wait until the hot dogs are ready and cooled down," Timmy said.
Finally, the hot dogs were ready and everyone sat down to eat. They all enjoyed the delicious hot dogs and were grateful that Timmy prevented them from getting hurt. From that day on, they always listened to Timmy's wise advice.
