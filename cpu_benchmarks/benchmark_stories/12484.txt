Lily and Tom are playing in the park. They see a big red ball on the grass. They run to the ball and both want to play with it.
"Give me the ball!" Lily says.
"No, it is mine!" Tom says.
They both pull the ball hard. But the ball is not strong. It pops with a loud noise. Lily and Tom fall on the ground. The ball is empty and flat.
"Oh no, we broke the ball!" Lily says.
"I am sorry, Lily. I did not want to break it." Tom says.
They look at the empty ball and feel sad. They do not want to play anymore.
Then they see a man walking to them. He has a big smile and a bag. He is the owner of the ball.
"Hello, kids. I saw what happened. It is okay, the ball was old and had a hole. I have a new ball for you. Do you want to try it?" he says.
He takes out a shiny blue ball from his bag. It is big and round and full of air. He throws it to Lily and Tom.
"Wow, thank you, mister!" Lily says.
"Yes, thank you, mister!" Tom says.
They catch the ball and start to play with it. They are happy again. They share the ball and do not pull it. They bounce it and roll it and throw it in the air. They have fun in the land with the new ball.
