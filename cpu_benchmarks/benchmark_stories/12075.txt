Once upon a time, there was a little seed. The seed was very humble and small. It wanted to grow big and strong like the other plants. So, it decided to raise up towards the sun. It used its roots to hold onto the ground and grow bigger. The sun shone brightly and gave the seed lots of energy. Finally, the seed grew into a big, beautiful flower.
