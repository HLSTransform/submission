Once upon a time, there was a little birdy. The birdy loved to sing and fly in the sky. One day, the birdy found an old apple. The apple was very dry and didn't taste good. The birdy didn't like it.
The birdy heard some news that there was a big juicy apple in the garden. The birdy was very excited and flew to the garden. When the birdy got there, it saw that the big juicy apple was rotten. The birdy didn't like it.
The birdy was very sad and flew back to its nest. The birdy didn't have anything to eat and felt very hungry. The birdy didn't know what to do. The birdy got sick and didn't feel good. The birdy never sang again. The end.
