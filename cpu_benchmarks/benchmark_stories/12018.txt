Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a unique teddy bear named Mr. Snuggles. Lily loved Mr. Snuggles very much and would always squeeze him tight when she went to bed.
One day, Lily and Mr. Snuggles went on a walk in the park. They saw a mystery box on the ground. Lily asked, "Mr. Snuggles, what's inside the box?" Mr. Snuggles didn't know, so they decided to open it together.
When they opened the box, they found a little puppy inside! Lily was so happy and squeezed the puppy with excitement. The puppy licked Lily's face and Mr. Snuggles' nose. They all became friends and went on many adventures together.
