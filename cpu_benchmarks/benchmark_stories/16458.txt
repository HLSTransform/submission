Lily loved her pony, Brownie. She liked to brush his hair and feed him carrots. Sometimes, she rode on his back and he took her around the farm.
One day, Lily wanted to show Brownie to her friend, Anna. She put a rope around his neck and said, "Come on, Brownie. Let's go and see Anna. She lives next door."
But Brownie did not want to go. He liked his stable and his hay. He did not like the rope. He stopped and shook his head. Lily tried to pull him, but he was too strong. He pulled back and the rope broke. Lily fell on the ground and Brownie ran away.
Lily started to cry. She was hurt and scared. She was ashamed that she could not control her pony. She wanted Anna to like her and Brownie.
Anna heard Lily's cry and came running. She saw Lily on the ground and Brownie in the distance. She said, "Don't cry, Lily. I'm here to help you. Are you okay?"
Lily nodded and wiped her tears. She said, "I'm sorry, Anna. I wanted to show you my pony, but he ran away. He did not like the rope. He was naughty."
Anna smiled and hugged Lily. She said, "It's okay, Lily. I understand. Ponies are not toys. They have feelings too. Maybe Brownie was scared or bored. Maybe he wanted to play or rest. You have to be gentle and patient with him. He is your friend, not your slave."
Lily felt better. She said, "You are right, Anna. I was not nice to Brownie. I should have asked him if he wanted to go. I should have given him a treat or a pat. I love him and I don't want to hurt him."
Anna said, "Let's go and find him. Maybe he is hiding in the barn or the field. Maybe he is sorry too. Maybe he misses you and wants to come back."
Lily and Anna got up and walked hand in hand. They looked for Brownie and called his name. They hoped he would hear them and forgive them. They wanted to be friends with him again.
