Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park and swing on the swings. One day, she found a note on the ground. It said "Try the ice cream truck, it's incredible!" 
Lily didn't know what "incredible" meant, but she knew she wanted to try the ice cream. She asked her mom if they could go to the ice cream truck. Her mom recommended they wait until after lunch, so they wouldn't spoil their appetite. 
After lunch, they walked to the park and found the ice cream truck. Lily tried the ice cream and it was incredible! She was so happy she found the note and listened to her mom's recommendation. From then on, every time they went to the park, they would get ice cream from the incredible ice cream truck.
