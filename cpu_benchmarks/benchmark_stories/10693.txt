Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside, especially in the rain. One day, Timmy slipped on a wet leaf and fell down. He cried and cried, but his mommy came to help him up.
Later that day, Timmy's mommy told him that if he cleaned up his toys, he would get a reward. Timmy was so excited, he quickly cleaned up his toys. His mommy gave him a powerful hug and a yummy cookie as a reward.
But then, Timmy's big sister came and took his cookie away. Timmy was sad and didn't know what to do. But then, he remembered his mommy's powerful hug and knew that he could ask for her help. His mommy talked to his sister and helped Timmy get his reward back. From that day on, Timmy knew that he had the power to ask for help when he needed it.
