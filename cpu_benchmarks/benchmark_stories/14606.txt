Once there was a cool girl. She liked to be outside. She liked to play in the garden, and explore the world. 
One day, she found a door. She went up to it and tried to open it, but it wouldn't budge. She wanted to see what was inside and kept trying to open it. 
Finally, she found a shiny red button. She pushed it and the door opened. She was so excited! She could go inside and find out what was in there. 
She stepped through the door and saw a big surprise. There were lots of toys and books to explore. She was having so much fun that she forgot to close the door. 
But soon enough she realised, and quickly ran back to close the door. She was so happy she had found something so cool to explore.
