Once upon a time there was a little boy who wanted to climb up a ladder. But every time he tried, the ladder was just too tall. He sighed and kept trying, but he just couldn't reach the top. 
Then one day, his big sister saw him struggling and she said, "Don't worry, I will help you!" She took his hand and put him on her shoulders, and together they climbed the ladder. The little boy was so excited and grateful. He chewed on the end of his shirt in joy. 
When the two of them got to the top, the little boy looked around in amazement. He felt so proud of himself! 
His other sister saw them on the top of the ladder and she got jealous. She shouted, "It's not fair! Why did you get to go first?!" 
The little boy shrugged and said, "I didn't know the ladder was so tall." His sisters smiled and the three of them hugged. 
The End
