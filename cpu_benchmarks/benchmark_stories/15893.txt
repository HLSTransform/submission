Once there was a little boy who loved to clap. Every day he went out in the yard and would clap and laugh. One day, the little boy wanted to bring a drink with him, so he grabbed a bottle of juice.
The little boy dribbled the juice on the ground as he walked, but he was so obedient that he cleaned it up with a cloth. He made sure to put the cloth back where he found it.
At the end of his walk, the little boy sat in the grass and decided to clap again. “Let’s clap,” he said. So he clapped his hands together and laughed with joy.
Just then, his older brother saw him and said, “That looks like fun! Can I join?” So the two of them started to clap together. Soon, the little brother and his big brother were clapping, singing, and laughing together.
They were having so much fun that they didn’t even notice the juice bottle that lay forgotten on the ground.
