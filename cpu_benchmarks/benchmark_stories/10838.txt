Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to do things with his hands. He liked to play with toys and climb trees. One day, he found a palm tree in his backyard. The palm tree had big green leaves that swayed in the wind. Timmy thought it looked harmless, so he decided to climb it. 
As he climbed higher and higher, he noticed something strange. There was a little bird's nest in the palm tree. Inside the nest were three tiny eggs. Timmy knew he had to be careful not to harm the eggs, so he climbed back down. He decided to watch the nest from afar and make sure the eggs were safe. 
Days went by and Timmy watched the little bird family grow. He saw the mother bird bring food to her babies and watched as they learned to fly. Timmy was happy he didn't harm the eggs and was proud of himself for being a good helper to the little bird family. From that day on, he always made sure to be careful around the palm tree and the animals that lived in his backyard.
