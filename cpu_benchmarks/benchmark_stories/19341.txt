Once there was a little girl called Polly. She was three years old and loved to imagine. One day Polly was in her bedroom when she looked outside and saw a big modern fire. She couldn't believe her eyes! She opened her window to get a closer look and a big puff of smoke blew into her room. Polly was really scared and started to cry.
Her mum heard the crying and came running. She asked Polly what was wrong and she told her all about the fire. Mum took Polly outside to get a better view of the fire. It was in the modern city and was so big. Polly couldn't stop thinking about it.
Mum told Polly that she was safe as long as she stayed away from the fire and didn't touch it. Then she talked to the firemen who were putting out the fire. Once it was out, Polly and her mum walked home.
Polly couldn't stop thinking about the fire. She imagined the courage of the brave firemen and the huge modern fire. Every day she was reminded of that big fire and how it was put out. What an amazing thing!
