Once there was a mommy and her little girl. Every morning, the mommy would watch the little girl get ready for school. The little girl was so excited to wear her special makeup. She spent her time putting on her glittery eye shadow and colorful lipstick. As the mommy watched, she couldn't help but smile and giggle.
One day, the mommy noticed something different. She saw a smelly jar on the counter. The little girl had found her mommy's old makeup. But the little girl didn't know the difference between mommy's makeup and hers.
The mommy said to the little girl, "What are you doing with that smelly makeup?"
The little girl replied, "I'm playing with it, it's so much fun!"
The mommy smiled, and said, "Alright, why don't you go outside and play instead? That old makeup isn't for playing with."
So, the little girl happily went outside. The mommy watched as she played and smiled to herself.
