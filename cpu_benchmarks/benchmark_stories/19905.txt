Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved watching television. He would watch it all day long. His mom would always tell him to stop watching so much TV, but Timmy didn't listen. 
One day, Timmy's mom brought him a yummy snack to eat while he watched TV. Timmy was so happy and excited to eat it. He quickly gobbled it up and went back to watching TV. 
But as Timmy watched TV, he didn't realize that he was getting very sleepy. He fell asleep with the TV still on. When he woke up, he saw that the TV was broken. Timmy was sad and didn't know what to do. He realized that he should have listened to his mom and not watched so much TV.
