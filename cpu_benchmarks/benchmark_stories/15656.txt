Once upon a time, there was a funny little duck named Jack. He liked to create cartoons with his crayons and markers.
One day he decided to create a cartoon with his special props. He was so excited to show off his work.
He took it to his mom and asked, "Look, Mama! What do you think of my cartoon?"
His mom smiled and said, "It looks very nice, Jack. But why is this character so sad and bitter?"
Jack replied, "Oh Mama! He's sad and bitter because he doesn't have any friends. I drew this to show how it feels to be all alone."
That made his mom sad, but she also felt proud of Jack. She hugged him and said, "You're so creative, Jack. I'm sure you can make him happy again!"
Jack smiled and said, "I sure will! I'll create a new cartoon where he ends up making lots of friends!"
