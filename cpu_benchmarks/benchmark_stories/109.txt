Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a desk in his room where he liked to draw pictures with his crayons. One day, Timmy's mom brought him a mild glass of milk to drink while he drew.
As Timmy was drawing, he accidentally knocked over his milk. The milk spilled all over his desk and his drawings. Timmy was sad because he thought his drawings were ruined. But then he had an idea! He could stand his drawings up to dry so they wouldn't be ruined.
Timmy stood all of his drawings up on his desk and waited for them to dry. When they were dry, Timmy was happy because they looked even better than before. From that day on, Timmy always stood his drawings up to dry when he spilled something on them.
