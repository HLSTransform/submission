Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was an ordinary dog with a brown collar. One day, Max went for a walk with his owner, Lily. They were having a good time until a big thunderstorm came.
Max was scared of the loud thunder and ran away from Lily. He ran and ran until he saw a cat. Max wanted to play with the cat, but the cat didn't want to play. The cat hissed at Max and Max got angry. He tried to strike the cat with his paw, but he missed.
Suddenly, a car came and hit Max. Lily came running and saw that Max was hurt. She took him to the vet, but it was too late. Max had passed away. Lily was very sad and wished Max had stayed with her instead of running away.
