Jamie excitedly ran outside to find a lizard. She had been wanting to see one for a long time. Jamie saw a small, green lizard scurrying along the sidewalk. She was very excited and started chasing after it. 
The lizard was pretty fast, but Jamie was determined to catch it. Despite her small size, she managed to catch up with the little lizard and reach out her hands to grab it. Unfortunately, the lizard was very stubborn and managed to escape Jamie's grasp. 
Jamie tried again and again to catch the lizard, but each time it was too fast. She eventually gave up and ran back to her house, disappointed. 
However, Jamie didn't lose hope. She smiled, knowing that one day she would find a lizard she could catch.
