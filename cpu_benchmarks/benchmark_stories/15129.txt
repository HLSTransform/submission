Once upon a time, there was a little bear who was scared of the sun. Everywhere the bear went the sun seemed to follow. The scared bear saw the bright sun and froze.
The bear's best friend, a bunny, came to the bear's side. 
Bunny said, "Why are you scared, little bear?"
The bear replied, "I don't like the sun. It scares me!" 
The bunny, smiled and said, "Don't worry, little bear. The sun is our friend, if we play together the sun won't scare you." 
The bear felt a little better and asked the bunny if he wanted to go for a walk in the park. They held hands there was sunshine all around. 
The little bear found out the sun was something he could enjoy. He was no longer scared! 
From then on, the little bear and the bunny went on many adventures together and the sun was always there to keep them company.
