Once upon a time there was a young girl called Millie. She was three years old and loved oats. She would put oat flakes in a bowl and enjoy eating them with some milk.
One day, she was playing in her garden when something tickled her nose and made her sneeze. "Ah-choo!" Millie said as she sneezed. Then she heard a voice calling from inside the house.
"Are you okay, Millie?" asked her mom.
"Yes, Mommy," said Millie. "I just sneezed!" 
"Oh, okay. You should be careful - sneezing can be dangerous," said Mom. Millie was a bit fearful, but she knew her mom was looking out for her.
The next day, Millie made herself some oatmeal for breakfast. She was careful not to sneeze as she ate it, and she enjoyed it very much!
