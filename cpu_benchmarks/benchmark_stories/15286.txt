Once there was a patient boy. He woke up one morning and felt a bit sad. He took out a big box from his bedroom. Inside were lots of colors, just for him! He grabbed some dark colors and began to print a picture. After a few minutes, he had a beautiful picture! Now the patient boy was happy. He hung his picture in his room, so everyone could see it! He was so proud to show it off!
