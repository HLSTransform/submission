Once upon a time, there was a small boy. His name was Jack and he was three years old. He loved to play outside.
One day, Jack went for a walk and he found a stick. He picked it up and looked at it. The stick was big and normal.
Jack was so excited and he let out a big cheer. He was having so much fun. He ran around with the stick in his hands. He pretended it was a sword and he fought invisible monsters. It was so much fun.
The sun slowly set and it was time for Jack to go home. He carefully put the stick down and said goodbye.
Jack held onto the happy memories and ran back home, happy and content.
