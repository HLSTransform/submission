Once upon a time, there was a fly. He had been trying to find a place to make his home. He looked high and low, but he couldn't find anywhere.
Finally, he saw a tight hole in a wall. He thought it would make a perfect home, but he knew he wouldn't fit inside. He needed help.
The fly was so lucky! A kind little girl was nearby and saw his problem. She put her hands together and puffed a big breath of air. The little fly disappeared into the tight hole!
The fly was now safe and at home in his tiny tight hole. The little girl was happy so clapped her hands and stopped to smile.
The fly had found his perfect home and lived happily ever after. The end.
