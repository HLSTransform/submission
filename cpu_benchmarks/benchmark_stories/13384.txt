Once upon a time, there was a small duck. The duck loved to spin around in circles. One day, the duck saw a bottle of shampoo and thought it would be fun to play with. The duck opened the bottle and poured it all over its feathers. 
The shampoo made the duck's feathers very slippery and the duck started to spin around faster and faster. Suddenly, the duck spun out of control and flew into a tree. The impact was too much for the small duck and it didn't survive. 
The other animals in the forest were sad to hear about the duck's accident. They learned that it's important to be careful when playing with new things, especially when they can make you spin out of control.
