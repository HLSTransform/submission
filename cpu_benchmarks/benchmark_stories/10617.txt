Teddy and Amy were best friends. Every day they managed to do something fun together.
One day Teddy and Amy went for a walk in the park. They took a big folder with them and inside the folder, Teddy had a healthy snack for them both.
"This is going to be so much fun!" Teddy said as he opened the folder.
But when Teddy looked inside the folder, he saw that the healthy snack was gone!
"Oh no!" Teddy said. "Where did the snack go?"
"Maybe it flew away," Amy said, looking sadly at the empty folder.
But then Teddy had an idea. He got down on the ground and reached under the bench and sure enough, he managed to find the healthy snack!
"I found it!" Teddy shouted, standing up with a big smile on his face.
Teddy and Amy cheered and ate the healthy snack together. They were very happy and enjoyed their fun day in the park.
