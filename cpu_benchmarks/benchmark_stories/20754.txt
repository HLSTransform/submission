Once upon a time, there was a painter who was very heavy. He could not find anything to hide under. One day, he saw a big bush and thought it was the perfect spot to hide. He crawled under the bush and it felt nice and cool.
Suddenly, he heard a noise. He squinted his eyes and saw a snake. He was scared and tried to stay as still as he could. The snake crawled closer and he held his breath. Suddenly, the snake started to paint on the ground. It quickly painted a beautiful picture.
The painter was so surprised. He had never seen such a beautiful painting. He didn't know that snakes could be such good painters! The painter crawled out from under the bush and thanked the snake. The snake smiled, and the painter realized he wasn't scared anymore. 
From then on, the painter never tried to hide again. He decided to be brave, use his talents, and paint whatever he wanted. Even though it was scary sometimes, the truth was that the painter was a very talented painter. He learned that facing his fears and pushing through his pain made his art even better!
