Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a dog named Max. Max was a big, brown dog who loved to walk. One day, Lily and Max went for a walk in the park. Max was very excited to go for a walk.
As they were walking, they saw another dog. The other dog was very small and cute. Max wanted to play with the other dog, but the other dog didn't want to play. Max was sad and didn't understand why the other dog didn't want to play with him.
Lily saw that Max was sad and said, "It's okay, Max. Not everyone wants to play. Let's keep walking and maybe we'll find someone else to play with." Max wagged his tail and felt better. They continued their walk and eventually found another dog who wanted to play. Max was very happy again and Lily was happy too. They all played together and had a great time. The end.
