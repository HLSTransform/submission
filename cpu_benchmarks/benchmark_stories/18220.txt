Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He liked to play near the old creek. It was fun to throw rocks and watch the water splash.
One day, Tim saw a big, sharp stick near the creek. He wanted to play with it. But his mom said, "No, Tim! That stick is too sharp. It can hurt you."
Tim was sad, but he knew his mom was right. He left the sharp stick and went back to throwing rocks in the creek. And he had lots of fun playing safely by the water.
