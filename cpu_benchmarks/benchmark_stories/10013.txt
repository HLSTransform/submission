Once upon a time, there was a big dragon. He lived in a cave in the mountains. He was very scary and had big sharp teeth. 
One day, a little girl named Lily went to the dragon's cave. She was not afraid of the dragon. She wanted to serve him some food. 
The dragon was very hungry, so he was happy to see Lily. She gave him some apples and bananas. The dragon was pleased with the food and he was not as harsh as he used to be. From that day on, Lily would serve him food every week. 
The dragon became friends with Lily and he was no longer scary. They would play together and have fun. Lily was happy to have a new friend.
