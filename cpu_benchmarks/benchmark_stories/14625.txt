One day, a little girl found a mirror on the ground in the park. It was cold to the touch, so she picked it up and held it close to her heart.
When she looked in the mirror, she saw something very special. Instead of seeing herself, there was a bright, purple ball bouncing in the reflection. It was so mesmerizing and beautiful!
The little girl wanted to reach into the mirror and touch the ball, so she jumped up and down, trying to reach it. With every jump, the ball seemed to bounce a little bit higher. Up, up, and away it went!
The little girl had so much fun trying to catch the ball in the mirror. She felt so happy, even when the ball was too high for her to touch. 
At the end of the day, she said goodbye to her friend the bouncing ball in the cold mirror. She knew that she would see it again soon!
