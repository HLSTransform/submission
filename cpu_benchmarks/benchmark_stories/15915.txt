Once, there was a little boy named Jack. He loved to play outside, but today he was stuck inside, and he was sad. But then his eyes lit up - he found his escape! In the corner of the room lay a big red bag. Jack opened it and it was full of surprises, like a rope and a mask.
Jack smiled and ran to the door. He said, "See ya later!" His mom called back, "Be safe, ok?" Jack said, "Ok!"
Jack ran outside and started to tie the rope to the big tree in the garden. He slipped the mask over his face and said, "Let's go!" With a swing and a jump, he was free!
Up in the branches Jack laughed and smiled, he was safe. He felt like he was soaring away in the wind. Down below, his mom smiled - she knew Jack was safe.
