Once upon a time, there was a little car who wanted to go on an adventure. She asked her mom if she could drive and her mom said yes! So she drove to the stage.
It was so beautiful! She saw different colours and lots of lights. She watched people walking around and everyone was smiling and having fun. 
Suddenly she heard her favorite singer! She saw him playing music on the stage and it was amazing. He was singing and he looked so happy! She wanted to be part of the fun, so she drove her car onto the stage and cheered with everyone else.
The little car drove back home that night with a smile on her face and lots of new adventures in her heart!
