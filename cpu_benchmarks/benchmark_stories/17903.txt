Once upon a time, there was a boy called Joe. He was three years old and he was very excited. He had a look of joy on his face.
One day, Joe saw something very exciting. It was a big red balloon attached to a string! He wanted to touch it, but he knew he couldn't. Then Joe's mum had an idea. She took out a sticky patch and she attached it to the balloon.
Joe was very happy. He held the string and looked up at the balloon as it floated up in the sky. Away and away it went until Joe could no longer see it. 
Joe was sad he couldn't keep the expensive balloon, but he smiled when he remembered how fun it had been to watch it float away.
