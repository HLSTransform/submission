Once upon a time, a little dog named Spot lived in a small house. Spot was always alert and loved to play. One day, Spot saw some smoke coming from the kitchen. He knew something was wrong.
Spot ran to the kitchen and saw a small fire. He barked and barked to let everyone know there was a problem. His family heard him and came running. They saw the smoke and the fire too.
The family struggled to put out the fire. They used water and a big blanket to make it stop. Finally, the fire was gone, and the smoke went away. Spot's family was so happy that he was alert and helped them. They all hugged Spot and thanked him for being a good dog.
