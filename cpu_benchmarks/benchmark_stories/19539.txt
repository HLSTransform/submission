Once upon a time, there was a very popular girl. Everywhere she went, people knew her name.
One day, she went to the closet. She opened the door and saw a lot of cool things inside. She wanted to take something out but then the door closed. She couldn't get back in!
She tried to open it again and again, but it wouldn't budge. She was so sad that she couldn't get in the closet. So she asked her friends for help.
One of them was very clever and finally figured out how to open the closet. She quickly opened the door and the girl was happy again. She thanked her friend for her help and promised never to close the closet door again.
