Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very fast. He loved to run and play with his friends. One day, Tim met a new friend named Max. Max was good at math. They liked to play together and have fun.
One day, Tim said to Max, "I need help with math. Can you help me?" Max said, "Yes, I can help you. Let's do math together!" They sat down and Max showed Tim how to do math. They counted and added numbers. Tim was happy because he learned something new.
After they finished with math, Tim said, "Now, let's play a game. I will run fast and you try to catch me!" Max agreed and they played the game. They both had lots of fun. Tim was happy that he had a friend who could help him with math and play with him.
