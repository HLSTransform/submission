Once upon a time, there was a mommy and her daughter. They went for a walk in the park. The daughter saw a cool flower and wanted to pick it. The mommy said, "No, we can't pick the flowers. They need to stay in the ground so they can grow." 
Suddenly, the mommy's phone started to ring. She answered it and said, "Hello?" It was the daughter's grandma on the phone. The daughter wanted to talk to her grandma too, so the mommy gave her the phone. 
The daughter said, "Hi grandma, I saw a cool flower in the park. But mommy said we can't pick it. Do you like flowers?" The grandma said, "Yes, I love flowers. Maybe we can plant some together next time you visit me." The daughter was happy and said, "That sounds fun! Bye grandma!" 
The mommy and daughter continued their walk in the park, enjoying the sunshine and the sound of birds singing. They were happy to have talked to grandma on the phone and to have seen the cool flower.
