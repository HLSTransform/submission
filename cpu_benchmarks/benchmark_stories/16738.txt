Lily was excited to wash her new doll. She got a pink bucket and filled it with water and soap. She took her doll to the garden and put her in the bucket. She rubbed her hair and face and clothes with her hands.
"Look, Mommy, I'm washing my doll!" she shouted.
Mommy came to the garden and saw Lily and her doll. She was not happy. She took the doll out of the bucket and shook her head.
"Lily, you can't wash your doll like that. She is not a real baby. She has a battery inside. If you get her wet, she will stop working. You have to be careful with your toys."
Lily did not understand. She wanted to play with her doll. She reached for her, but Mommy held her back.
"Sorry, Lily, but your doll is broken. She won't talk or move or sing anymore. You have to say goodbye to her."
Lily started to cry. She was very sad. She loved her doll. She hugged her and said sorry. She wished she had not washed her doll. She wished she had listened to Mommy. She wished she had a new doll.
