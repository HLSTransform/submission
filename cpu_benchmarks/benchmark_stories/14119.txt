Once upon a time there was a bunny who was very sad. The bunny looked around, trying to find something to make it happy. Then, the bunny saw a yummy carrot. But, the carrot was in a plastic bag and the bunny could not eat it. The bunny hated that it couldn't get the yummy carrot. 
The bunny started to cry, when all of a sudden another bunny came hopping by. This bunny had a trick to help the first bunny get the yummy carrot. The second bunny said to the first, "just be nice and ask for help."
So, the first bunny asked a nice person for help and the person opened the plastic bag to get the yummy carrot for the first bunny. The first bunny was so happy and thanked the second bunny for the good advice.
The moral of this story is, be nice and ask for help if you need it. Sometimes, you can get something yummy when you're nice and remember to be kind to everyone.
