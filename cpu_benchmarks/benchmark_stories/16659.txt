Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big building with many floors. To go up and down, she used an elevator. It was a big box that moved up and down like a magic carpet.
One day, Lily saw a painting on the wall. It was a picture of a beautiful flower. Lily admired the flower and thought it was very pretty. She wished she could have it in her room.
But then, Lily saw a sad boy sitting on the floor. He looked like he needed a friend. So, Lily went over to him and said hello. They talked and played together. Lily realized that making someone happy was even better than having a pretty flower.
