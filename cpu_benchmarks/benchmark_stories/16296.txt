Once upon a time, there was a big bear. The bear was very strong and had lots of power. He liked to walk in the forest and eat berries. One day, he saw a small rabbit. The rabbit was very scared of the big bear. The bear wanted to be friends with the rabbit, but the rabbit was too scared to talk to him. 
The next day, the bear saw the rabbit again. This time, the rabbit was not scared anymore. They talked and had fun together. Suddenly, a big wolf appeared. The wolf was very icy and wanted to fight the bear. But the bear was not scared. He used his power to fight the wolf and protect his new friend, the rabbit. 
After the fight, the bear and the rabbit were very happy. They hugged each other and promised to always be friends. From that day on, the bear and the rabbit played together every day in the forest.
