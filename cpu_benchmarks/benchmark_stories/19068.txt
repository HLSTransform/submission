Once upon a time, there was a poor little girl. She had a lamp that she loved very much. Every night, she would gaze at the lamp and it made her feel happy. One day, a big storm came and the lamp fell and broke. The little girl was very sad. But her mommy came and hugged her and said, "Don't worry, we'll get you a new lamp." And they did! Now the little girl can gaze at her new lamp and feel happy again. The end.
