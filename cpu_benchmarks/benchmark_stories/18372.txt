Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to wear red clothes. She thought red was the best color in the world. Her mommy said that Lily had a great fashion sense.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. She wore her favorite red dress and red shoes. While playing, she saw a big bush with pretty flowers. Lily wanted to see what was behind the bush, so she decided to peek.
As she peeked behind the bush, she saw a cute, little red bird. The bird was singing a happy song. Lily smiled and said hello to the bird. The bird flew away, and Lily went back to playing. She was glad she peeked behind the bush and made a new friend.
