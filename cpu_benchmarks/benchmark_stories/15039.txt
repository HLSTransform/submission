Tommy and his friends were playing in the garden. Suddenly, Tommy saw a laser! He ran towards it and he was so excited to get it that he forgot to be careful. 
Tommy’s friend Lisa said, “You should be careful, Tommy. You don’t know if it’s safe.” 
He was too anxious to listen to her. So he started running around the garden with the laser in his hand. Suddenly the laser made a loud noise and Tommy dropped it. He was so scared that he started to cry. 
Lisa came to Tommy and said, “See Tommy, I told you that you should be careful. Now it’s broken.”
Tommy learned his lesson and nodded. From that day on he always listened to his friends and was careful whenever he was playing with something new. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to always listen to your friends and be careful with things that you don't know.
