Once upon a time, there was a girl called May. She wanted to find peace and quiet for a while, so she went to a secret chamber. The chamber was peaceful and still, so May sighed happily. She spent some time in the chamber, listening to the calm silence that surrounded her. It was so quiet she could hear the pebbles outside gently rolling around. 
May enjoyed the calm atmosphere of the chamber, so she decided to stay a while longer. She lay down on her back and closed her eyes, feeling relaxed and content with the peace. Soon, May drifted into a deep sleep and stayed there for a while. 
When she awoke, the chamber was still calm and peaceful, so May sighed once more in contentment. Feeling refreshed and peaceful, she left the chamber and went back to the world outside.
