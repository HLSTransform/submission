One day, Mike wanted to fly his kite. He went outside and ran on the grass. His kite flew up above him, faster and faster, zooming in the sky. He felt so happy. The wind felt nice and the kite flew so light. 
But then, the wind died down and Mike's kite faded away. It was too light and couldn't stay in the air. Mike tried to chase after it but it was too late. His kite was gone. 
Mike was so sad. He watched the sky, hoping that his kite would come back, but it never did. He never got to fly his kite again.
