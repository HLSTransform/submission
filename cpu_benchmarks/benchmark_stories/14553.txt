Once upon a time, there was a shy monkey who loved bananas. Whenever he saw a banana, he would reach out and grab it. One day, as he was walking through the jungle, he saw a very ripe banana. He went to grab it but it wouldn't budge. He had to resist the urge to grab it. 
He looked around and saw that there was a crocodile standing guard over the banana. He was scared and tried to walk away quickly. The crocodile noticed and started to chase him! 
The monkey ran and ran, but the crocodile was getting closer. He had to think of something to get away! Suddenly, he remembered the banana. He quickly grabbed the banana in his hand and ran away from the crocodile. 
The monkey was safe and happy. He happily ate the banana and thought about how much he had resisted to get it!
