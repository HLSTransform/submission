Little Jane was a helpful princess who wanted to help everyone in the kingdom. One day she heard that her older brother, the prince, was feeling very tired. Jane quickly rushed to the prince's chamber to see if she could help.
When she arrived, she saw the prince lying down on his bed. "Are you okay?" she asked him.
The prince looked sad. "I am so tired," he said.
Jane had an idea. She said, "Why don't you take a nap? You'll feel much better afterwards."
The prince agreed and fell asleep. As he dozed off, Jane quietly watched over him.
After the prince awoke, he looked refreshed. He thanked Jane for being so helpful. From then on, he knew that Jane was a princess with a very big heart.
