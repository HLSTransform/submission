Once upon a time there was a little boy named John. He wanted something special, so he decided to enter a competition. On the day of the competition, he got dressed in his best fancy coat and went off to the fairground.
When he got there he saw lots of different game stalls mixed with the smell of sweet treats. He decided to play the jigsaw game, and asked the man if he could play.
The man told him: "Sure, if you complete the jigsaw in the fastest time you will win the prize!"
John got to work and started putting the pieces together. He was so focused that before he knew it he had finished the puzzle. The man checked the time and shook John's hand.
"You've won the prize!" he said. 
John was really happy and he couldn't wait to see what it was. The man handed him a fancy box, and when he opened it he was thrilled to find a model airplane inside. 
He lifted the airplane up in the air and ran around the fairground with it, showing everybody his prize. John was very proud of himself and couldn't stop smiling. 
The End.
