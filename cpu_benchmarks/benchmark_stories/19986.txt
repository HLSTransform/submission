Lily and Ben are playing with blocks. They want to make a big tower. They put one block on top of another block. They make the tower taller and taller.
"Look at our tower!" Lily says. "It is so high!"
"Yes, it is!" Ben says. "But we need more blocks. Let's get some from the kitchen."
They run to the kitchen. They see a plate of cookies on the table. The cookies are brown and round. They smell good.
"Wow, cookies!" Lily says. "Can we have one?"
"I don't know," Ben says. "Mom said we have to wait for lunch."
"But they look so yummy," Lily says. "Maybe we can just taste one. Mom won't notice."
Lily reaches for a cookie. She breaks a small piece and puts it in her mouth. She smiles. The cookie is sweet and crunchy.
"Mmm, this is good," she says. "You should try it, Ben."
Ben hesitates. He knows they are not supposed to eat the cookies. But he is curious. He also breaks a small piece and tastes it. He likes it too.
"Yum, you're right," he says. "These are good cookies."
They eat another piece. And another. And another. Soon, they have eaten all the cookies on the plate. They have forgotten about the tower.
They hear Mom coming. They panic. They hide the plate under the table. They run back to the living room.
"Hi, kids," Mom says. "Are you having fun with the blocks?"
"Yes, Mom," Lily and Ben say. "We made a big tower."
Mom looks at the tower. She smiles. She is proud of them.
"That's a great tower," she says. "But you know what? I have a surprise for you. I made some cookies for you. Do you want to see them?"
Lily and Ben look at each other. They feel guilty. They know they have done something bad. They don't know what to say.
Mom goes to the kitchen. She sees the empty plate under the table. She sees the crumbs on the floor. She understands what happened.
She comes back to the living room. She is not smiling anymore. She is angry.
"Lily and Ben," she says. "Did you eat all the cookies?"
Lily and Ben lower their heads. They nod.
"Yes, Mom," they say. "We're sorry."
Mom sighs. She is disappointed. She loves them, but she is also mad.
"That was not nice," she says. "You should not eat the cookies without asking. You should not lie to me. You should not spoil your lunch. You have to learn to share and to follow the rules. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben feel ashamed. They know Mom is right. They want to make her happy.
"Yes, Mom," they say. "We understand. We're sorry. We love you."
Mom hugs them. She is still angry, but she also forgives them.
"I love you too," she says. "But you have to promise me that you won't do that again. And you have to help me clean up the mess. And you have to wait for dinner. No more cookies for you today."
Lily and Ben agree. They promise to be good. They help Mom clean up the kitchen. They wait for dinner. They don't touch the cookies anymore.
They learn their lesson. They also learn that cookies are brown and sweet and crunchy. And that they taste better when they are shared.
