Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Ben. Ben loved honey. One day, he found a big jar of honey in the woods. He was so happy! Ben wanted to eat the honey, but he was confused. He didn't know how to open the jar.
Ben tried to rub the jar with his paws. He hoped that the lid would come off. But it didn't work. Ben felt sad. He wanted to eat the honey so much.
Then, Ben's friend, a little bird named Lily, saw him. Lily wanted to help Ben. She used her beak to open the jar. Ben was so happy! He and Lily shared the honey and had a great day.
