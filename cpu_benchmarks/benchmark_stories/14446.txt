Once upon a time, there was a baby bird that wanted to escape from her nest. She was tired of seeing the same sky every day and wanted to explore the world. So one night, she began flapping her wings and hopped out of the nest.
But the journey was not always easy. Everywhere she flew, she encountered danger. Sometimes she even got lost. Still, she kept on going because she wanted to find a place where she could be free and find peace.
Finally, one day she found what she had been searching for. It was a rare place in the mountains where she could be safe and happy. She settled down in the wilderness and stayed there, feeling content and peaceful.
The baby bird was so happy to have escaped and found a special spot of her own. She could barely believe it when she realized she had found the peace she had been looking for.
