Once upon a time, there were two friends, Jane and Sarah. They were very good friends and always did fun things together. 
One day, Jane and Sarah decided to plan a special trip. They wanted to go to a temple that was very modern. 
So, Jane and Sarah made plans and got ready for their adventure. The night before they left, they packed their bags and went to bed early. 
The next day, Jane and Sarah drove nearly all day. When they arrived at the temple, they were excited. It was beautiful and modern, just like they expected. 
They spent the day exploring and learning about the temple. Jane and Sarah had a wonderful time. They were happy they had planned such a fun trip.
