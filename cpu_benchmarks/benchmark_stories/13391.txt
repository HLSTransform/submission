Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she found a little leaf on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her mom.
"Look, Mommy! I found a little leaf!" Lily said.
"That's very nice, Lily. What do you want to do with it?" her mom asked.
"I want to deliver it to my friend, Emily. She loves little things like this," Lily replied.
So, Lily and her mom walked to Emily's house. When they arrived, Lily knocked on the door and said, "Emily, I have a little leaf for you!"
Emily was very happy to receive the little leaf from her friend. She said, "Thank you, Lily! You always deliver the best gifts!"
