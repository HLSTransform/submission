Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mom made her a yummy sandwich. Lily took a bite and said, "Mmm, this sandwich tastes so good!"
Lily's dad came into the room and asked, "Lily, do you want to watch a video with me?" Lily nodded her head excitedly and they sat down to watch a funny cartoon.
During the video, Lily's mom brought her a glass of milk. Lily took a sip and said, "This milk is delicious! Thank you, Mommy." 
After the video finished, Lily's dad asked her, "Did you like the cartoon?" Lily replied, "Yes, it was funny. Can we watch another one?" Her dad smiled and said, "Sure, let's watch one more before bedtime."
