Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved making films. She had a big box filled with special film and a pair of scissors to help her create her movies.
One sunny day, the little girl set up her film, camera and scissors in front of the house. She was ready to get started.
The little girl’s father came and watched her as she worked. He asked, “Is it all ok? Are you feeling calm?”
The girl smiled. “Yes, I’m feeling calm and I’m ready to cut my film.” She slowly and carefully took the scissors and started cutting away piece of the film.
She worked and worked until she was finished. When she looked at her new film, it was beautiful. She had created a masterpiece. The little girl was very proud and excited to show it to her family and friends. 
With that, the little girl put away her scissors, grabbed her film and ran inside.
