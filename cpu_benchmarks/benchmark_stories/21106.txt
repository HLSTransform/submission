Once upon a time, in a tidy little house, there lived a fish named Bubbles. Bubbles had a friend named Tiny Turtle. They liked to play together in the big blue pond. One day, Tiny Turtle saw a shiny scale on the ground. It was very pretty and sparkled in the sun.
Tiny Turtle picked up the scale and said, "Bubbles, can I borrow your shiny scale to play with? I promise to give it back." Bubbles agreed and said, "Okay, but please be careful with it. It's very special to me."
Tiny Turtle played with the shiny scale all day. He took it with him to the pond and showed it to his other friends. They all thought it was very pretty too. But as the sun began to set, Tiny Turtle realized he had lost the scale. He searched and searched, but he couldn't find it anywhere.
Tiny Turtle felt very sad and went to tell Bubbles the bad news. "Bubbles, I'm so sorry. I lost your shiny scale," he said with tears in his eyes. Bubbles was sad too, but he knew that Tiny Turtle didn't mean to lose it.
Just then, a kind duck came swimming by. She had found the shiny scale and brought it back to them. Tiny Turtle and Bubbles were so happy! They thanked the kind duck and promised to be more careful with their things. From that day on, they always took care of their special things and played happily ever after.
