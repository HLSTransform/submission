Anna liked to go to the park with her mom and dad. She liked to see the ducks and the swans in the pond. She liked to feed them bread and watch them swim.
One day, she saw a swan that was not lively. It was lying on the grass and did not move. Anna felt sad for the swan. She asked her mom and dad what was wrong with it.
Her mom and dad said the swan was hurt. It had a hook in its wing. The hook was from a fisher who was not careful. They said they would try to fix the swan and make it better.
They called a helper who worked with animals. The helper came with a big net and a box. He was gentle with the swan. He took the hook out of its wing and put some cream on it. He put the swan in the box and said he would take it to a safe place.
Anna was happy that the helper would fix the swan. She hoped the swan would be lively again soon. She said goodbye to the swan and thanked the helper. She gave the swan a kiss and a hug. She said she would come back to the park and look for the swan when it was well.
