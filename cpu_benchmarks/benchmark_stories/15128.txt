Once upon a time there was a white horn. It was so shiny and bright that everyone wanted to poke it. One day a little boy couldn't resist and he went over to the horn and poked it.
The horn made a funny sound. "Wah!" said the boy, amazed. Then a funny thing happened. A little rabbit came hopping out from inside the horn.
The rabbit said, "Hi there! Can you help me find my way home? My family must be missing me!"
The boy smiled and said, "Of course I can help you. I'm friends with all the animals around here." He poked the horn one more time before he took off with the rabbit.
They travelled for a long time before they found the rabbit's family. They were so happy to see their little one back! And from that day on, the boy and the rabbit were the best of friends.
