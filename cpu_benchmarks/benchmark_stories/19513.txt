Once upon a time, there was a special girl. Her name was Jane, and she was very curious. One day, Jane decided to try something new. She wanted to touch yoga.
So, Jane got dressed and went to the yoga studio. She was very excited to stretch and exercise. She could barely wait to try the original yoga moves.
When she got there, Jane saw lots of people in funny poses. She laughed and tried to copy them. Everyone around her smiled and clapped.
Jane was so proud that she had learnt something new. She laughed and thanked everyone for helping her with her yoga moves. Jane was so proud of herself for touching yoga in the most original way.
