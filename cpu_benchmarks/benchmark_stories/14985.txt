Once, there was an elderly leopard who lived in the jungle. He was very wise, old and knew many stories. 
One day he decided to go on a sail. He found a boat and put it in the river. He quickly hopped in and sailed away.
The leopard sailed past many animals. He waved at the monkeys, smiled at the elephants and said hello to the birds. 
He sailed and sailed until he suddenly noticed a big rock in the middle of the river! He got scared and quickly moved the boat to the side. He had just missed the rock. 
He smiled with relief and continued sailing until he reached the end of the river. He stepped out of the boat with a smile on his face. What an adventure!
