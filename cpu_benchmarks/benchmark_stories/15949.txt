Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play outside and look at the flowers. One day, she saw a bee flying around. She pointed at it and said, "Look, a bee!" The bee was slow and didn't fly away. 
Lily got closer to the bee to take a better look. But then, the bee stung her! It hurt a lot and Lily started to cry. Her mom came outside and saw what happened. She took Lily inside and put some cream on the sting. 
Lily learned that even though bees are slow, they can still hurt you. She never got too close to a bee again. The end.
