Kenny was playing in his garden when his stomach started to feel bad. He went to his mum and asked for help. She told him he needed an operation and said that the doctors would make him feel better.
Kenny was scared. He didn't understand what an operation was and he started to shake. His mum hugged him and said it would all be fair. But Kenny was still scared.
So they went to the hospital and the doctors explained that they were going to do the operation. Kenny was still scared and started to shake. He asked his mum if he would be okay and she told him that everything was going to be fair.
The operation was done but as Kenny was waking up, he starting shaking more. He felt worse than before. The doctors said the operation did not work and Kenny became very sad. He would have to have another operation soon. Even though his mum said it would be fair, Kenny was still scared. He kept shaking.
