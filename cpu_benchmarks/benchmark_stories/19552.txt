Once upon a time there was a brave girl named Maria. She was only three years old.
One day, Maria was looking around in her garden. Suddenly, she saw something sparkly. It was a blue gem! It seemed to appear from nowhere. Maria smiled as she picked it up.
She held it in her hands and looked at it. She was so excited! But then, she heard a loud noise. It sounded like thunder. She became frightened and ran inside her house.
When Maria went back the next day, the gem had disappeared. It was gone just as quickly as it had appeared.
The end.
