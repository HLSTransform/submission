Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to pick flowers in the park with his mommy. One day, Timmy saw a seal in the pond. The seal looked happy swimming around. Timmy thought the seal was cute.
Timmy's mommy warned him not to get too close to the seal. But Timmy wanted to touch the seal. He picked up a rock and threw it at the seal. The seal got scared and swam away. Timmy felt sour because he didn't get to touch the seal.
Later that day, Timmy's mommy took him to the doctor. Timmy had gotten a bad cut on his hand from the rock he threw. Timmy learned that it's not nice to hurt animals, and that sometimes bad things happen when we don't listen to our parents.
