Once upon a time there was a boy called Tim. He was three years old and very eager. He loved wearing jackets, no matter how hot it was outside. He also loved to sell things to his friends. One day he saw a very nice jacket and knew it would make a perfect present for his friend.
Tim gathered his money and went to the shop. He was so eager that he was very excited and in a hurry. The shop owner smiled at him and said: “Would you like to buy this jacket?” Tim smiled and said: “Yes, please!”
He paid the shopkeeper and held the jacket close as he ran back home. He immediately went to his friend’s house and knocked on her door. He was so happy and showed her the jacket. He said: “I bought it for you. Happy Birthday!”
His friend was very happy and hugged Tim tightly. She said: “Thank you for my special present! I will always remember what a generous and kind heart you have.” 
The moral of the story is that when we are eager and generous with our gifts, we can make somebody else very happy.
