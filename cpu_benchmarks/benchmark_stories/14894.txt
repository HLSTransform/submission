Once there was a large bear who wanted to change his bandage. The bandage was too tight and he could not take it off.
So he took a walk in the forest and found a small rabbit. The bear asked the rabbit, "Can you help me please?"
The rabbit was very brave. She said, "Yes, I can help you change your bandage."
The bear was so happy and thanked her. She told the bear to close his eyes and when he opened them, his bandage had changed from a small one to a large one.
The rabbit had been so clever and kind. The bear was very grateful. He thanked her again and said goodbye. The rabbit waved goodbye as the large bear walked away with his new bandage.
