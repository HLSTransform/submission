Sara and Ben were playing in the yard. They saw a big box with some nails and a hammer. Sara wanted to make something with the nails. Ben said no, it was bad to play with nails. They could hurt themselves.
But Sara did not listen. She took a nail and a hammer and tried to hit the nail on the box. She missed the nail and hit her finger. She cried out loud. It hurt a lot. She dropped the hammer and the nail.
Ben ran to her and hugged her. He said he was sorry. He said they should go to mom and dad. They would make her finger better.
Sara nodded. She was very sad. She regretted playing with the nail. She wished she had listened to Ben. She said she was sorry too. She said she would not play with nails again.
They held hands and walked to the house. Mom and dad saw them and asked what happened. They told them the truth. Mom and dad were not angry. They were glad they were honest. They cleaned Sara's finger and put a band-aid on it. They gave them a hug and a kiss. They said they loved them. Sara and Ben felt better. They learned a lesson. They decided to play with safer things.
