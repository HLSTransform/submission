Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy box with all his favorite toys inside. One day, Timmy's mom told him to clean up his toys before dinner. Timmy said, "Okay, Mommy!" and started to put his toys away.
But when Timmy tried to put his favorite toy in the box, he realized it was broken. Timmy's arm was sad because he loved that toy so much. Timmy's mom saw him looking sad and asked him what was wrong. Timmy said, "My toy is broken, Mommy. Can you fix it?"
Timmy's mom looked at the toy and said, "I'm sorry, Timmy. This toy is too ugly to fix. We have to throw it away." Timmy was sad, but he understood. He asked his mom, "Can we lock it up in the toy box, so it can be safe?" His mom said, "Of course, Timmy." And they locked the toy in the toy box, so it would be safe and sound.
