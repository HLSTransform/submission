One day, a little boy named Tim found a big pillow in his room. He thought it was a stupid pillow because it was too big to sleep on. Tim wanted to play with the pillow, so he picked it up and looked for his friend, Sam.
Tim saw Sam in the yard and said, "Look, I have a big, stupid pillow! Let's play!" Sam laughed and said, "Okay, let's play a game with the pillow!" They decided to play a game of catch with the big pillow.
As they played, Tim's mom watched them from the window. She felt the urge to join them, so she went outside and said, "Can I play with you?" Tim and Sam smiled and said, "Yes, come play with us and the stupid pillow!" They all played together and had a fun day.
