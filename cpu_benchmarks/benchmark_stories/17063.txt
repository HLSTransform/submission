Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go to the park and play on the swings. One day, she went to the park with her mom and saw a new swing. It was very big and had a flexible seat. Lily wanted to try it.
Lily's mom helped her get on the swing. She started to swing back and forth, higher and higher. Lily liked the new swing because it was so fun. She felt like she could touch the sky. She asked her mom to measure how high she was swinging.
Her mom counted, "One, two, three, four, five!" Lily was swinging very high. She was so happy. After playing on the swing for a long time, Lily and her mom went home. They had a great day at the park, and Lily couldn't wait to play on the flexible swing again.
