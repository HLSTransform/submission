Once upon a time, there was a big blue ball. It was very impressive. The blue ball had a long string that was used to tie it. The blue ball loved to bounce and play with all the kids.
One day, the blue ball went to the park. It saw a boy named Tim. Tim wanted to play with the blue ball, so he used the string to tie it to his hand. They had a lot of fun playing together.
But then, the wind started to blow very hard. The blue ball was lifted up into the sky. Tim tried to hold on, but the string was not tied tight enough. The blue ball flew away, and Tim was very sad. He could not play with the impressive blue ball anymore.
