Once upon a time, there was a pretty girl named Lily. She loved to play with her drum every day. One day, she was playing her drum in the park when a boy came up to her. "Can I play with your drum?" asked the boy. "Sure!" said Lily. 
The boy rubbed his hands together and started to play the drum. Lily was happy that she made a new friend. They played together for a while until the boy accidentally hit the drum too hard and it broke. "Oh no!" said Lily. "My drum is broken." 
Lily was sad because she loved her drum so much. She went home crying, and her mom asked her what happened. "My drum is broken," said Lily. Her mom tried to fix it, but it was too broken to be fixed. Lily was very sad and missed her drum very much. The end.
