Once upon a time, there was a small mouse named Timmy. Timmy lived in a small hole in the wall of a big house. One day, Timmy went outside to look for some cheese to eat. Suddenly, he saw a lot of water coming towards him. It was a flood!
Timmy quickly ran back to his hole in the wall. He was scared and wet. He said to himself, "I hope the flood finishes soon." Just then, he heard a voice outside. It was his friend, Sammy the squirrel. Sammy asked, "Timmy, are you okay?"
Timmy replied, "No, I'm scared. The flood is big!" Sammy said, "Don't worry, Timmy. The flood will finish soon. Let's stay in my tree until it's over." Timmy was happy to have a friend to help him. They went to Sammy's tree and waited until the flood finished.
