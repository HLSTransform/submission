Once upon a time, there was a girl. She was very fast, and always loved to twist around. She would twist in circles, up and down, and side to side. 
One day she decided to go for a walk and she found something very special. As she twisted around in the grass, she uncovered a bright golden ring! She was so happy that she quickly twisted it onto her finger. 
The girl had so much fun twisting and twirling with her new ring in the sun, that she didn't notice the time passing by.
Soon, it was getting dark and the girl had to return home, twirling fast with her golden ring on her finger. 
The girl was happy and excited, and she never wanted to take off the golden ring.
