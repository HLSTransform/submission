Once upon a time, there was a generous rabbit named Bobo. He lived in a small house in the woods. One day, he saw a little bird named Lulu who could not fly.
Bobo asked Lulu, "Why can't you fly?" Lulu said, "I suffer from a hurt wing. I can't find the exit from the woods."
Bobo wanted to help Lulu. He said, "Come with me. I will show you the exit." Lulu was happy and said, "Thank you, Bobo."
Bobo and Lulu walked together through the woods. They found the exit and Lulu could go home. Lulu thanked Bobo for his help. They became good friends and played together every day.
