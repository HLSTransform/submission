Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play on her rug with her toys. One day, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her toys and put them away. Lily didn't want to stop playing, but she knew she had to obey her mom. She tried to resist, but her mom was firm.
After cleaning up, Lily felt proud of herself for being a good listener. She sat on her rug and looked at her toys. She saw her favorite doll and felt ready to play with it again. She hugged her doll and smiled. Lily knew that listening to her mom was important, and now she was ready to have fun again.
