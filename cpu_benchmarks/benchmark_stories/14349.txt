Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cute teddy bear that she loved to keep with her all the time. One day, Lily's mom asked her, "Do you want to help me make some popcorn?" 
Lily was excited and said, "Yes, I want to help!" They went to the kitchen and her mom showed her how to put the corn in a pot and keep stirring it until it popped. 
When the popcorn was ready, Lily's dad came in and said, "Wow, this popcorn looks delicious!" Lily offered him some and he said, "Thank you, Lily. You are so helpful." 
Lily smiled and hugged her teddy bear, feeling happy that she could help her family.
