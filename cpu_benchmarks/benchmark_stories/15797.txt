Sam and Bob were good friends. One day, they wanted to go to the park.
Bob said, "We can go to the park now!" Sam said, "Yes, let's go."
So they set off to the park. On the way, they met a judge. He was wearing a big black robe.
The judge said, "Where are you two going in such a hurry?"
Bob said, "We are going to the park."
The judge looked restless. He said, "You must be careful. Don't forget to look both ways before you cross the road!"
Sam and Bob thanked him, and they went to the park. They had a great time playing, running, and laughing.
And now when they go to the park, they always remember to look both ways before crossing the road!
