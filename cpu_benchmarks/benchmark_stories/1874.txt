Once there was a boy named Tim. He was three years old and very happy. One day while he was playing, he saw a big van outside. He ran over and started to poke it with his fingers. He felt so excited! 
The van door opened and a man stepped out. He had a kind smile and he asked Tim what he was doing. Tim told him he was poking the van. 
The man laughed and said he was a delivery driver. He was very grateful that Tim had been poking his van instead of drawing on it. He gave Tim a big hug and a lollipop. 
Tim thanked the man and ran off excitedly with the lollipop. He was so happy and grateful for the kind man and his surprise treat!
