Once upon a time there was a nice family. They had a big freezer in the kitchen. It was very thick and it kept whatever was in it very cold.
One day the mom was making dinner and she wanted to put something special in the freezer. She sent her 3 year old daughter to the store to get ice cream. 
The little girl was so excited to be sent on this special errand! She quickly ran to the store and bought the best ice cream she could find.
When she got home, the mom put the ice cream in the big, thick freezer. They all enjoyed it after the dinner. 
The mom was so happy that her daughter was able to send her to the store and buy the ice cream! Everyone was happy!
