Lily and Ben like to play with their number blocks. They have many blocks with different numbers on them. They can make towers, trains, and shapes with their blocks.
One day, they decide to make a landscape with their blocks. A landscape is a picture of what you see outside, like trees, hills, and houses. They use green blocks for grass, blue blocks for water, and brown blocks for dirt. They also use yellow blocks for sun, white blocks for clouds, and red blocks for flowers.
They are very happy with their landscape. They show it to their mom and dad. Mom and dad say, "Wow, what a beautiful landscape! You are very clever and creative!"
But then, Max, their baby brother, comes into the room. He sees the blocks and wants to play with them. He crawls to the landscape and grabs some blocks. He throws them around and makes a mess.
Lily and Ben are very sad and angry. They say, "No, Max, no! You are bad! You ruined our landscape! Go away!"
Mom and dad hear them and come back. They see the blocks scattered everywhere. They say, "Oh no, what happened?"
They pick up Max and hug him. They say, "Max, you are not bad. You are just curious and playful. But you have to be careful and gentle with your siblings' toys. They worked hard to make them. Say sorry to Lily and Ben."
Max looks at Lily and Ben. He says, "Sowwy."
Lily and Ben look at Max. They are still sad, but they are not angry anymore. They say, "It's okay, Max. We forgive you. But next time, ask us before you touch our blocks. We can share and play together."
Mom and dad smile and say, "That's very nice of you, Lily and Ben. You are good and kind. How about we help you clean up and make a new landscape?"
Lily and Ben nod and say, "Yes, please."
They all work together to put the blocks back in their places. Then they make a new landscape, bigger and better than before. They have fun and learn new numbers and words. They are a happy family.
