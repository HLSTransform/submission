Once a little girl saw an angel in the sky. She was so surprised that she stopped walking and stared at it. The angel was so beautiful and colorful, with soft pink wings that sparkled in the sunlight. 
The little girl pointed at the angel and smiled. She asked her Mom, "What's that? Is it an angel?" 
Her Mom smiled and said yes. "Yes, sweetheart, that's an angel. Did you know that angels can watch over us and protect us?"
The little girl thought for a moment before saying, "Yes, I need an angel to look after me."
Her Mom laughed and said, "Well, I think you already have one from heaven looking after you. Let's keep watching, who knows what else we might find up there."
They both kept staring at the sky for a long time, and eventually the angel flew away. The little girl waved goodbye and said, "Goodbye, beautiful angel!"
