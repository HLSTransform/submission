Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She had a toy that she loved very much, but one day she lost it. She asked her mom, "Mommy, where is my toy?" Her mom replied, "I don't know, let's look for it together." 
They looked in every room of the house, but they couldn't find it. Sally started to feel sad and said, "I miss my toy." Her mom hugged her and said, "Don't worry, we'll find it."
Later that day, Sally went to the park with her mom. She saw a big slide and wanted to play on it. Her mom said, "Let's see if you're big enough to go on it." They went to the scale and Sally weighed herself. She was a mighty 30 pounds! Her mom said, "You're big enough to go on the slide now." Sally had so much fun on the slide, but she still missed her toy. 
That night, Sally's mom found the toy under the couch. She gave it back to Sally and she was so happy. She hugged her toy and said, "I missed you!" Her mom smiled and said, "I'm glad we found it."
