Once there was a black duck. He loved to swim in the lake in his backyard and splash around in the water. Every day he would look for something to eat. 
One day he saw food on the other side of the lake. He was so excited and urgently tried to reach it, but the lake was so wide and the food too far away. He could not get to it on his own. 
But then he heard a noise coming from outside his garden. It was a tap! He quickly swam over and saw it was connected to a pipe. The duck realized he could use the pipe to get the food! He quickly fed himself with all the food he found.
The duck felt so happy and content. He was grateful for the pipe, as it had allowed him to feed himself. He decided to visit the tap every day and enjoy his meals. From then on, the black duck and the tap became the greatest of friends.
