Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with fire and watch the flames dance around. One day, she spent all her money on a candle and lit it up in her room. The flame was so pretty and graceful, but Lily didn't know that it was dangerous.
Suddenly, the flame grew bigger and bigger until it caught on her curtains. Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. She quickly ran to her mom and said, "Mommy, the fire is too big!" Her mom called the fire department and they came to put out the fire.
After the fire was put out, Lily learned that playing with fire is not safe and can cause harm. She promised to never play with fire again and to always be careful. The moral of the story is to be safe and responsible with things that can be dangerous.
