Once there was a man who worked in a lab. He was very busy measuring things. He had lots of warm tools: a ruler, a tape measure and a thermometer. He was measuring things both big and small. One day, he was measuring something very small and he made a discovery. It was something magical! He showed it to his friends and they were all very excited. Everyone wanted to know what it was and how he found it. He said, "I found it in the lab while measuring something small". Everyone was so happy. They had never seen anything like it before. Now, they all wanted to measure things small, to see if they could discover something magical too.
