Once upon a time, there was a mighty never-ending forest. As always, deep in the forest, lived a little boy named Dan.
He was an explorer at heart and that's why he loved the forest. Every morning, he'd pack his knapsack, take a deep breath, and venture into the unknown.
One particular morning, Dan was busy exploring. Suddenly, he heard a noise. He peaked around the corner and there, he noticed a pastry lying on the ground.
He couldn't believe his eyes! He slowly stretched his arm out and picked up the pastry with both hands.
He asked himself," Whose pastry could this be?"
Just then, he heard a voice from behind. It was a sweet, melodic voice singing a lovely song.
He slowly turned around and there he saw a fairy!
The fairy said, "That's my pastry. I just baked it."
Dan asked, "Do you believe in magic?"
The fairy smiled and said, "Yes! I do believe in magic."
Dan grinned and said, "I believe in magic too."
With that, the fairy waved her wand and flew off.
The forest was suddenly filled with the sound of beautiful music.
Dan was so grateful that he found the mighty pastry, he enjoyed it all the way home.
