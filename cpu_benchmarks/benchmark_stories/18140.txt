Once upon a time, there was a fat cat named Tom. Tom was a very big cat. He loved to eat and play all day. Tom had many friends. One day, Tom and his friends played a game. They played a number game. They counted one, two, three, and more.
Tom's best friend was a little dog named Tim. Tim was not fat like Tom. Tim liked to run and jump. Tim was very fast. They played together every day. They liked to chase each other and laugh.
One day, Tom and Tim were playing near a house. They saw a small room. In the room, there was a toilet. They did not know what it was. Tom and Tim were curious. They looked at the toilet and laughed. They thought it was a funny chair. They played around the toilet and had fun. And they lived happily ever after.
