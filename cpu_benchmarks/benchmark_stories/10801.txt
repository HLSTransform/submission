Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mom. While they were playing, Lily saw a little puppy. The puppy was all alone and looked frightened. 
Lily went over to the puppy and said, "Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. You can trust me." The puppy looked at Lily and started wagging its tail. 
Just then, a man came over and said, "That's a cute puppy you have there." Lily's mom replied, "Oh no, it's not ours. We just found him here all alone." The man smiled and said, "Well, I'm glad there are still good humans in this world who can be trusted." 
Lily felt proud of herself for helping the puppy and for being a good human. She knew that the puppy trusted her and that made her happy.
