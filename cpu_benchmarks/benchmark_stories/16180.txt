One day, a little girl went to the beach. She wanted to build a sandcastle. She had a box with sand toys and batteries.
The little girl said, "Let's unpack the sand toys!" She took out the toys, a bucket and some shells. She started to dig and make towers.
Suddenly, the little girl stepped on something rough. It was a battery! The battery had broken and leaked all over the sand. The little girl started to cry.
The little girl's mom said, "It's okay, sweetheart. We have another box with batteries back at home."
The little girl was sad but they packed up their sand toys and left the beach. The sandcastle was never finished.
