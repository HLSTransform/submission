Toby was a young boy, he was very curious. One day as he was playing in the park he noticed a cricket chirping loudly. Toby wondered what the cricket was saying. He also noticed that the cricket looked quite nervous. Toby had many questions so he decided to ask.
“Hello little cricket," Toby said.
The cricket stopped chirping, looked around and said “yes, what is it?” 
“Why do you look so nervous?” Toby asked.
The cricket took a deep breath and said, “I need to go somewhere but I'm scared to leave."
Toby nodded in understanding and said, “Be brave little cricket! I'm sure you'll make it there safe.”
The cricket smiled weakly and said, “Thank you! Now I just need to find the way.” 
Toby smiled and said, “Maybe I can help you. Would you like that?” 
The cricket nodded, “Yes, I would appreciate it very much!”
So Toby and the cricket began walking together. Toby was filled with wonder and admiration for the brave little cricket. With Toby as his guide, the cricket was no longer nervous - he was feeling brave and confident. Toby was happy he could help the cricket on his journey.
