Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jake. Jake was a big boy, but he was only three years old. 
One day, Jake went to a new place. It was a big, empty land with no people or animals. He was a bit scared, but he wanted to explore.
As he walked, he felt something pinch him. He looked down and saw a green bug with sharp teeth. It was trying to pinch him! He screamed and ran away.
He looked around--there were long, spiky plants and tall rocks everywhere. He wanted to go back home, but he couldn't find the way. 
Suddenly, Jake noticed a bright light far away. He ran towards it and, when he was close, he realised it was a big, yellow sun!
The sun was so bright that Jake could see the way back home now. He smiled, waved at the sun and ran back.
He was so happy that he had made it back safely. He had had a lot of fun exploring the empty land, but it was nice to be home again.
