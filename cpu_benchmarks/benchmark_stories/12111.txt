Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved waffles. He ate them for breakfast every day. One day, Tim's mom made him waffles that were too hard. Tim didn't like them.
Tim decided to make his own waffles. He asked his mom for help. She showed him how to make waffles. Tim followed the steps and made waffles all by himself. When he tasted them, they were delicious! Tim gained a new skill and he was proud of himself.
