Jen and Ben were twins who liked to play together. But sometimes they also liked to fight. One day, they found a big ball in the park. They both wanted to play with it, but they did not want to share.
"Give me the ball!" Jen said.
"No, it's mine!" Ben said.
They pulled and pushed and shouted. Then Jen got angry and slapped Ben on the arm. Ben felt a mild pain and started to cry.
"Ow, that hurt!" Ben said. "You are mean!"
Jen felt sorry and gave Ben the ball. She hugged him and said, "I'm sorry, Ben. I love you."
They smiled and played with the ball together. They did not fight anymore.
But they did not see the big dog that was watching them. The dog liked balls too. He ran towards them and barked. He wanted to play with the ball, but he did not want to share.
The twins got scared and ran away. They left the ball behind. The dog took the ball and ran away too.
The twins learned a lesson. They learned to share and be kind. They also learned to watch out for dogs.
