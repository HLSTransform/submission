Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Daisy. Daisy was playing in her room when she decided to try and load her bucket with as much weight as she could. She pushed it around the room and started picking up her toys. She wanted to see how much weight she could fit in her bucket!
When Daisy was loading her bucket, her mom came in and saw what she was doing. "Daisy!", her mom said, "What are you doing?! That's too much for you to load alone, you need help". 
Daisy felt embarrassed and said, "Sorry mom, I just wanted to see how much weight I could fit in". Her mom smiled and said "That's ok Daisy, let me help you". Then, she and Daisy carefully loaded the bucket together and loaded it up with the toys. 
Once it was finished, Daisy felt so proud and knew she could do even more with her mom's help.
