Sally was very excited. She was going to visit her grandma today and she heard that grandmas always have special treats. As soon as she entered the house, Sally smelled the delicious smell of something cooking. Grandma had made sausages!
Grandma served the sausages on a plate. They looked so yummy and smelled so good! Grandma said these were her special "rare sausages". Sally helped Grandma put the sausages on the table. Then the two of them sat down to eat.
Sally tasted the sausages and she loved them. They were so tasty and so rare! Sally asked her grandma for the special recipe, so she never forgot how to make the rare sausages. Grandma smiled and said she would write it down for Sally. And they both enjoyed every last bite of the delicious sausages!
