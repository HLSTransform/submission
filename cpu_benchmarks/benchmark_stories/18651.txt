Once upon a time, there was a furry little bear named Ben. Ben loved to play in the forest with his friends. One day, Ben and his friends saw a big helicopter flying high in the sky. They were so excited and wanted to see it up close. 
Ben and his friends decided to follow the helicopter deep into the forest. They walked and walked until they were very far from their homes. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise and saw the helicopter crash into the ground. 
Ben knew that they had to help the people inside the helicopter. He asked his friends to help him carry the injured people out of the helicopter. They worked together and were able to save the people. 
The moral of the story is that it is important to help others when they are in need. Even if it means going out of your way or doing something difficult, it is always worth it to help someone in need.
