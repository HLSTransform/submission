Once there was a little girl called Emily. She loved to be adventurous and explore her world. One day she decided to travel to the river with her dad. 
When they arrived at the river, Emily was amazed. The water was so sparkly and moving so quickly! 
Emily couldn't believe how different the river looked from up close. She asked her dad, "Dada, how far can we travel?" 
Her dad said, "Not too far, Emily. Let's stay close to the shore, ok?" 
But Emily was too excited to stay close to the shore. She wanted to explore more! So she asked, "Can I go a bit farther?"
Her dad thought for a minute and said, "Alright, but be careful and stay close to the shore!" 
So Emily set off, exploring the river with enthusiasm. She was so excited to see what was around the next bend. The river was full of surprises, and Emily was having a wonderful time. 
After a while, Emily and her dad headed back home. Despite the short time they had spent at the river, Emily felt so adventurous and proud to have explored.
