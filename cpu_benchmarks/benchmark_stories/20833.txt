One day, a youth was eager to race. He put on his running shoes, and started to jog. As he ran, the youth noticed a lot of other people running too. He saw a girl in yellow shorts, an old man in a hat, and even a dog. 
The youth kept running faster and faster. He raced past the girl and the old man, feeling the wind in his face. Suddenly, he saw a shiny trophy up ahead. It had a big gold star on top and made him even more eager. 
The youth raced as fast as he could. He was getting closer and closer to the trophy, but it was still far away. At last, he reached out his hand and grabbed it! He was so excited, he smiled from ear to ear. He had won the race!
