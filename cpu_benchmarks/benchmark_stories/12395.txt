Once upon a time there was a mommy and a little girl. The little girl wanted to do something new, something mysterious, but mommy said no. She wanted the little girl to stay at home.
The little girl got angry and started to cry. Mommy hugged her daughter tight and promised that if the little girl ate her broccoli she could do something mysterious. The little girl agreed and gobbled up her broccoli.
So off they went to the mysterious place. As soon as they arrived the little girl saw a big surprise. It was so exciting! But when the little girl went inside the surprise, she realized too late that it was not a good surprise. The mysterious place was dangerous, and the little girl got hurt. 
Moral: Always be careful when doing something mysterious because you don't know what you'll find!
