Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was only three and she was worrying a lot.
One day her mom took her to the store. When they arrived at the store, the little girl saw the ceiling. It was disgusting. She was worried that something bad was going to happen.
Her mother wrapped her arms around her to try and make her feel better. She asked the little girl what was wrong and why she was so worried.
The little girl said that she was worried about the ceiling. It looked so gross.
Her mom told her not to worry and that everything would be alright. She said that it existed only to keep the rain out and that it wasn't anything to be scared of.
The little girl smiled and felt much better. She knew that her mom was right. She knew that everything would be alright.
