Once upon a time there were two friends called Sarah and Jane. They wanted to celebrate because it was Sarah's birthday.
Sarah and Jane wanted to have a tea party. They rushed to Sarah's house and got her special birthday tea set. Sarah's tea set had thin, pink cups and saucers.
They put the cups and saucers on the table and began to fill them with tea. Sarah made hers sweet, and Jane made hers with milk. They laughed and chatted as they enjoyed the tea.
When it was time to leave Sarah said: "Let's always celebrate my birthday together!"
Then Jane and Sarah hugged and ran off. They still have tea parties every year when Sarah's birthday comes around.
