Sammy was so excited for summer. He couldn't wait to go to the beach and have fun. He wanted to go to the pool and play in the park. He just knew it was going to be the best summer ever.
One day, Sammy went to the playground where he saw lots of other kids his age running around, acting crazy. He wanted to join in, but he was a bit scared.
Suddenly, one child offered to play tag with Sammy. He was so happy he almost couldn't believe it. So he said yes, and started running around, acting really wild! He felt so happy - this was summer at its best!
Soon enough, summer was over, but Sammy never forgot how much fun he had acting crazy with his new friends. He couldn't wait for the next summer to start so he could join them again.
