Once upon a time there was a little girl called Abi. Abi loved exploring the world around her and especially loved to go outside in the garden and gaze at the sky.
One day, Abi decided to explore her bedroom. She noticed a big, soft sheet on her bed. She gently lifted it up and looked underneath. It was full of surprises!
One of the surprises was a giant soft teddy bear. Abi instantly fell in love with it and hugged it tightly. She then looked around the room, looking at the posters and pictures on the walls and gazing out of the window.
The next day, Abi went to bed and snuggled under the soft sheet. It was so comfy and cosy that Abi soon fell asleep. She dreamt of exploring the garden and gazing at the sky.
The end!
