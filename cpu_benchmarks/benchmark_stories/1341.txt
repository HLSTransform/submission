Harry was walking through the park when he heard a loud scream. He looked around and saw a little boy crying. Harry smiled and asked the boy what was wrong.
The boy said he wanted a cookie, but his mommy said no. Harry heard that and felt bad for the boy, so he gave him one of his cookies.
The boy smiled and said thank you. He took a big bite of the cookie and felt better.
Then, he heard another scream. This time it was coming from a tree nearby. He looked and saw a bad kitty up in the tree who was scared and didn't know how to get down.
Harry laughed and helped the kitty down. He gave it some of his cookie too, which made the kitty happy. 
After they all said goodbye, Harry walked away happy that he had help the little boy and the scared kitty.
