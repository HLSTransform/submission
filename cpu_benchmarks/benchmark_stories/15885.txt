Mummy and Daddy had a surprise for me - a new mattress! It was a regular one - not too soft, not too hard. They told me it was just right. I asked them how I was allowed to use it and they replied with a smile.
"It's bedtime now," said Mum. "You can jump on it, have pillow fights and use it for your dolls."
I couldn't wait to try all the things I was allowed to do on the mattress. I jumped up and down with joy, and started pushing my dolls around on it. I played and laughed for hours, enjoying my new found freedom.
Then suddenly Daddy appeared in the doorway and said, "now that time is up, it's time for you to get into bed." I knew he was right, so I gave one last bounce and got into bed. I was allowed to keep my mattress, and I fell asleep that night with a smile on my face.
