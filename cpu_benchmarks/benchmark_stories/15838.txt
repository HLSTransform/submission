The gloomy morning had arrived and Charley woke up in bed with a chill in the air. She got out of her cozy bed and looked out the window at the grey sky. Charley shivered, as she knew it would be cold outside. She got dressed in her warm clothes, grabbed her coat and ran to the kitchen.
"Good morning, Mom!" said Charley.
"Good morning, Charley," answered her Mom. "It's a chilly day, you should put on your coat."
Charley nodded and grabbed the coat from the kitchen table. She slipped it on and shivered.
"Brrr," she said.
Mom smiled and said, "Let's go outside and get some fresh air before it gets too cold."
Charley clapped her hands and was very excited to get outside. She grabbed her scarf and boots, and followed her Mom to the front door. The morning air was fresh and chilly and Charley couldn't help but shiver again.
Mom put her arm around Charley and they went outside to explore. The world felt so big and full of new adventures. Charley was ready to explore the morning and have fun!
