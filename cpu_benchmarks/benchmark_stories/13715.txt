Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Teddy. Teddy loved to play with his friends in the forest. One day, Teddy's friend, a little rabbit named Benny, got angry at him because Teddy accidentally broke Benny's carrot.
Teddy felt sad because he didn't mean to break Benny's carrot. He thought and thought with his brain about how he could make Benny feel better. Then, Teddy had an idea! He went to the store and bought Benny a new carrot.
When Teddy gave Benny the new carrot, Benny was no longer angry. He hugged Teddy and said, "I love you, Teddy!" Teddy felt happy because he was able to make his friend happy again. From that day on, Teddy always thought with his brain about how he could help his friends when they were angry.
