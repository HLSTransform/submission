One day, a little girl named Lucy was feeling brave. She thought it would be fun to unlock the door to the big room upstairs. When she opened the door, Lucy was surprised to see a giant room filled with people. They were all dancing and laughing. Lucy was scared at first, but she went inside the room and joined them.
The people cheered as Lucy started dancing. She moved and twirled around the room. Everyone was having a great time, and soon Lucy forgot about her fear.
After a while, the people began to say goodbye. Lucy looked around and realized that it was time to go. She thanked the people and waved goodbye. As Lucy started to unlock the door, everyone cheered. She smiled and waved one last time before walking out of the room. 
Lucy had a wonderful time at the dance. She felt brave and proud of herself for unlocking the door and joining the people. From then on, she was never fearful of trying new things.
