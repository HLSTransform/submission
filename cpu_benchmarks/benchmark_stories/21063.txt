Lily loved flowers. She liked to look at them, smell them, and touch them. But she did not know how to take care of them. She thought that flowers were toys that she could play with.
One day, she saw a big, red flower in the garden. She wanted to have it for herself. She ran to the flower and pulled it hard. But the flower did not come out. She pulled harder and harder, but the flower stayed in the ground. She felt angry and frustrated. She decided to twist the flower until it broke.
She twisted the flower with all her strength. She heard a snap and a tear. She looked at her hand and saw the flower. But it was not a pretty flower anymore. It was a broken flower. The petals were torn, the stem was bent, and the leaves were wilted. She felt sad and sorry. She had hurt the flower.
She heard a voice behind her. It was her mom. She had seen what Lily had done. She was not happy. She was disappointed and upset. She said to Lily, "Lily, why did you do that? You know that flowers are living things. They are not toys. You have to be gentle and kind to them. You have to respect them and let them grow. You have to water them and give them sunlight. You have to love them and not hurt them. Do you understand?"
Lily nodded. She understood. She had made a mistake. She had been selfish and careless. She had not been gentle and kind. She had not respected and loved the flower. She felt ashamed and guilty. She said to her mom, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, flower. I didn't know. I didn't mean to. I won't do it again. I will be gentle and kind. I will respect and love the flowers. Please forgive me."
Her mom hugged her. She said, "I forgive you, Lily. But you have to learn from your mistake. You have to be more careful and responsible. You have to think before you act. You have to remember that flowers are living things. They have feelings and needs. They are not toys. They are gifts from nature. They are beautiful and precious. They make us happy and grateful. They deserve our care and respect. Can you promise me that?"
Lily hugged her mom back. She said, "I promise, mom. I promise, flower. I will learn from my mistake. I will be more careful and responsible. I will think before I act. I will remember that flowers are living things. I will care and respect them. I will thank them for their beauty and joy. I love you, mom. I love you, flower."
The end.
