Once upon a time, there was a large ranch. In the ranch, there lived two children: Tom and Susie. One day, Tom and Susie were walking in the ranch. Suddenly, Tom said to Susie, "Let's dance!" 
Susie smiled and said, "Yes! That sounds like fun!"
Tom and Susie started dancing around the large ranch. They jumped and twirled in the warm sun. All the animals grazing on the ranch stopped to watch them.
On and on they danced until they were too tired to dance anymore. After a while, Susie said, "That was so much fun! Let's do it again soon!"
Tom smiled and said, "Yes, let's do it! It was a great way to spend the day!" 
And that is how Tom and Susie spent their day: dancing in the large ranch!
