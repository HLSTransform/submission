Once upon a time there was a nice family. The mom and dad loved each other very much and wanted to get married. On the day of the wedding, everyone was so happy.
The mom was wearing a beautiful dress and the dad wore a fancy suit. They said their vows in a gentle way and kissed each other, too. Afterwards they had a big party with cake and games.
One day the dad started to resist going to the park with the mom. "Why not, sweetheart?" the mom asked with a sad voice. The dad sighed and said, "I just don't feel like it."
The mom was very hurt but she was gentle. She said, "It's okay, I understand. Maybe we can go try something else together instead." The dad smiled and agreed. They had fun exploring and talking together.
The mom and dad's marriage was special because it taught them to respect each other and to never give up.
