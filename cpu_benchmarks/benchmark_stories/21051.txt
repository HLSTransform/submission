Lily liked to number things. She numbered her toys, her books, her fingers and toes. She liked to say the numbers out loud and count them with her mouth. She thought numbers were fun and easy.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a big slide and wanted to go on it. She ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. She looked down and saw many children waiting for their turn. She decided to number them. She said, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!" She said it very loud with her mouth.
The children did not like it. They felt angry and sad. They said, "Stop it, Lily! You are rude and mean! You are not letting us play! You are taking too long!" They shouted at her with their mouths.
Lily felt scared and sorry. She did not mean to hurt their feelings. She just liked to number things. She realized that it was difficult to number people. People were not things. They had feelings and needs. She said, "I'm sorry, children. I did not know. I will not number you anymore. I will share the slide with you. Can we be friends?"
The children felt happy and glad. They said, "Thank you, Lily. We accept your sorry. We like to play with you. We can be friends." They smiled at her with their mouths.
Lily learned a lesson. She learned that numbers were fun and easy, but people were not. She learned to be kind and respectful to others. She learned to use her mouth for nice words, not rude ones. She had fun with her new friends at the park.
