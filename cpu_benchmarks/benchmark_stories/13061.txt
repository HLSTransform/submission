Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lisa. Lisa wanted to be strong, so she started to do exercise. 
First, she did some light running around the yard. Then, she did some jumping jacks. Next, she did a few push ups. 
 
By the end, Lisa was out of breath. But she felt very good, because she knew she was getting stronger. 
Then, it started to rain. So Lisa stopped her exercise and went inside. 
The next day, Lisa decided to start her exercise again. She was proud when she finished the routine. She felt strong and happy.
