Once upon a time, there was a little spider named Sammy. Sammy lived in a big house with lots of other spiders. One day, Sammy met a beautiful spider named Sally. They played together and had lots of fun. Sammy liked Sally very much.
One day, Sammy asked Sally if she would marry him. Sally said yes, and they were very happy. They built a cozy cobweb home and lived in it together. Sammy was very obedient and always did what Sally asked him to do.
One day, a big storm came and destroyed their cobweb home. Sammy and Sally were very sad. But then, Sammy remembered something. He had seen a big, strong tree that could protect them from the storm. Sammy and Sally worked together to build a new home in the tree. They were happy again, and Sammy knew that he would always take care of Sally and be obedient to her.
