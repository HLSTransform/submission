Once upon a time, there was a team of animals who wanted to build a big house. They all worked together to gather sticks and leaves. But one animal, a lazy rabbit, didn't help. He just watched the others work.
When the house was finished, the lazy rabbit wanted to live there too. But the team said no. They said he didn't understand what it meant to be part of a team. They told him that everyone had to work together to make things happen.
The lazy rabbit felt sad and messy inside. He realized that he should have helped the team. From that day on, he promised to always be a good team player. And the other animals welcomed him back into their team with open arms.
