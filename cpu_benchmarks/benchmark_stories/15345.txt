One day, Billy was walking in the park. He noticed a gray pattern on the ground. It was quite interesting. Billy stepped closer to take a better look. He quickly realized it was a big maze. He was determined to find his way through.
He started walking and soon he came to a dead end. He tried to find his way again but he became lost in the maze. He couldn't seem to recognize the pattern anymore. He was feeling overwhelmed and was starting to get scared. 
All of a sudden, he heard a voice. It was his mom calling out his name. He followed her voice until he eventually found her. He was so relieved to have found her because he was lost in the maze. His mom took him home and they hugged tightly. She told him never to get lost again.
