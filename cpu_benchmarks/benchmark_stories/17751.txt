Once there was a little girl who loved bicycles. Every day she rode her bicycle around the park and said hello to all the animals and trees. 
One day the girl saw a very special bicycle in the park. It had shiny blue wheels and a big brown seat. She wanted to follow the bike and see where it went.
So she hopped on her own bike, and started to follow the special bike around the park. She followed and followed until she was feeling very dizzy. 
But the little girl kept on following until she reached a secret place in the park. It was full of beautiful flowers and butterflies. She laughed and laughed until the special bike was gone, and the little girl was happy. 
She never saw the special bike again, but she did go back to the secret place again and again. The little girl loved to play and explore, feeling dizzy from all the fun.
