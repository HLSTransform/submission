Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to wear his blue pants every day. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Timmy, today is a special day. We are going to celebrate your successful potty training!" Timmy was so happy that he jumped up and down.
Later that day, Timmy's family came over to celebrate. Timmy's grandma said, "Timmy, you look so handsome in your blue pants!" Timmy smiled and said, "Thank you, Grandma. I love my blue pants!"
During the celebration, Timmy's dad asked him, "Timmy, what do you want to be when you grow up?" Timmy thought for a moment and said, "I want to be a superhero who wears blue pants and celebrates with his family!" Everyone laughed and Timmy felt so happy. It was the best celebration ever!
