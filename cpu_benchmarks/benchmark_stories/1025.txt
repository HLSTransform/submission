One day, Peter met a new friend. His name was George and he was very nervous.
Peter asked George why he was nervous and George said he wanted to sign up for a special club.
So, Peter and George decided to go the club. They had to do lots of laundry to join the club.
Peter and George worked hard together on the laundry and they both worked until it was finished.
When they were done they put their sweaty hands together and signed their names. Peter and George were very proud and they both joined the club.
