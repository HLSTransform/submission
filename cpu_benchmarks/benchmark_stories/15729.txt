Once there was a girl named Sarah. She was three years old and liked to play in the park. 
Sarah was sitting on a bench in the park when a large sack fell from the sky. Sarah was so excited, and she ran over to it.
Sarah asked, "What is in the sack?" 
A voice answered, "Let's open it and find out!"

So Sarah let go of the sack and opened it up. A smile spread across her face when she saw what was inside - a large teddy bear!
Sarah hugged the teddy bear tightly and said, "Thank you!"
The voice replied, "You're welcome!"
