Sara likes to bake with her mom. They make cakes and cookies and pies. Sara helps to mix and pour and stir. She also likes to lick the spoon.
One day, Sara finds a big book on the shelf. It has many words and pictures. Sara opens the book and sees a spell. The spell says how to make a magic cake. Sara wants to try it.
She takes the book and some things from the kitchen. She puts them in a bowl and says the spell. She does not know what the spell means, but she says it anyway. She puts the bowl in the oven and waits.
Soon, the oven makes a loud noise. Smoke comes out. Sara runs to see what happened. She opens the oven and sees a big cake. But the cake is not good. It is green and purple and has eyes and teeth. It growls at Sara and tries to bite her.
Sara screams and drops the book. Her mom comes and sees the cake. She is very angry and scared. She takes a broom and hits the cake. The cake falls on the floor and breaks. Sara cries and says she is sorry. She hugs her mom and says she will not bake spells again. Her mom hugs her back and says she loves her. She says they will bake a normal cake together. Sara smiles and says yes. They throw away the book and the bad cake. They make a new cake and eat it. It is yummy and sweet. Sara is happy and says baking is fun.
