Once upon a time, there was a fierce monster who lived deep in the forest. Every day, it would come out of the forest, threatening to eat everyone. All the villagers were scared and did not know how to prevent the monster from coming out. 
One day, a brave villager had an idea. He told the villagers to meet him in the middle of the forest the next day. 
The next day, they all went to the forest and the brave villager asked them to bring logs and stones. He had a plan. He told them to pile the logs and stones on the monster's head while it was sleeping. 
The villagers did as he asked, and the logs and stones prevented the monster from waking up. It couldn't move because its head was too heavy. The villagers were saved!
