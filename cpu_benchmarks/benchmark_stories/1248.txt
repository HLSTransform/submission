Once upon a time there was an old igloo. The igloo belonged to an old polar bear who loved to take a bath. Every day he would go to the beach and take a bath in the cool ocean water.
One day an elderly man came and built a new igloo right next to the old polar bear's. The old polar bear was very happy and he invited the old man to take a bath with him.
The old polar bear and the old man bathed together in the ocean each morning and each night. They laughed and splashed and had so much fun.
One day someone took a picture of the old polar bear and the old man bathing together in the ocean. Everyone in the village thought it was the cutest thing and started to take baths together too.
The old polar bears has found a new friend and taught everyone about the joy of bathing together. They were all very happy!
