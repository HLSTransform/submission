Mama and Papa went to work in the morning. They always left very early, when it was still light outside. Mama and Papa said goodbye to their little boy and went off to work.
When Mama and Papa left, the little boy went outside to play in his garden. The garden was big and full of trees, and there were lots of animals living there, too. The little boy saw a beautiful deer, with a light brown coat of fur.
The deer saw the little boy, and they started to play together, running around and chasing each other in the garden. The little boy laughed and shouted, and the deer's tail wagged with happiness.
Mama and Papa came home when it was late, and they were very tired. But when they saw the little boy and the deer playing together, they knew that their little boy had had a fun day.
