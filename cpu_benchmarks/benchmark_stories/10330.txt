Sara and Ben are twins. They like to help Mom in the kitchen. Mom is very happy when they do. She says they are clever and good.
One day, Mom asks Sara and Ben to put the dirty plates in the dishwasher. Sara and Ben say yes and run to the sink. They take turns to pick up the plates and put them in the dishwasher. They are careful not to break them.
But then, Sara sees a plate with a piece of cake on it. She loves cake. She thinks Mom will not notice if she eats it. She takes the plate and hides behind the table. She starts to eat the cake.
Ben sees what Sara is doing. He is angry. He says, "Sara, that is not fair! You have to share the cake with me. Give me some, or I will tell Mom!"
Sara does not want to share. She says, "No, Ben, this is my cake. Go away!"
Ben does not go away. He goes to Sara and tries to grab the plate. Sara holds it tight. They start to pull and push. They shout and cry.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to the kitchen. She sees Sara and Ben fighting over the plate. She sees the cake on the floor. She is not happy. She says, "Sara, Ben, what are you doing? You are not supposed to eat the cake. You are supposed to put the plates in the dishwasher. And you are not supposed to fight. You are supposed to be nice to each other. You are not clever and good. You are naughty and bad."
Sara and Ben feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were greedy and mean. We will not do it again. We will put the plates in the dishwasher. We will be nice to each other."
Mom says, "That is good. But you also have to say sorry to each other. And you have to pinch your ears as a punishment."
Sara and Ben say sorry to each other. They pinch their ears. They say, "Ouch, that hurts!"
Mom says, "Yes, it hurts. But it also teaches you a lesson. Next time, you will not eat the cake. You will share it. And you will not fight. You will help each other. Then you will be clever and good again."
Sara and Ben nod. They hug Mom. They hug each other. They finish putting the plates in the dishwasher. They smile. They are clever and good again.
