Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go on walks in the forest with her dog, Max. One day, they found a big stick on the ground. Lily picked it up and showed it to Max. "Look Max, I found a stick!" she said.
Max barked happily and wagged his tail. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a bird trying to whistle, but it couldn't because it had something stuck in its throat. Lily and Max went to help the bird. "Let's try to make it clear, so it can whistle again," said Lily.
They gently patted the bird's back and the thing came out. The bird was so happy that it whistled a beautiful song. "Thank you for helping me," said the bird. Lily and Max smiled and continued their walk in the forest, holding hands and singing along with the bird's whistle.
