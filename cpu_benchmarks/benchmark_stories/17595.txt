Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she met a little boy named Max. Max asked Lily if she wanted to go on an adventure.
"Where are we going?" asked Lily.
"We are going to explore the world," said Max.
Lily was excited and they set off on their adventure. They walked through the forest and saw many animals. They climbed up a mountain and saw the whole world from the top. Then, they took a gentle nap under a big tree.
When they woke up, they saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky. Lily and Max knew that they had the best adventure ever!
