Once upon a time, there was a peach. It was a very good peach. One day, the Peach wanted to take a bath. So, it decided to soak in a warm bath. The Peach felt so happy and comfortable while it soaked. After a while, the Peach was all soft and smelled yummy. It was a very good feeling and the Peach loved it. The end.
