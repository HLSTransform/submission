Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a toy dog that she loved very much. One day, she found a broken penny on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her toy dog. "Look, doggy! I found a penny!" she said.
Lucy wanted to find more pennies, so she took her toy dog and a long string to lead him. They went outside and walked around the town. They looked under trees and in the grass, but they couldn't find any more pennies. Lucy was sad.
Then, a nice old man saw Lucy and her toy dog. He asked, "Why are you sad, little girl?" Lucy told him about the broken penny and how she couldn't find any more. The old man smiled and gave her a shiny penny. "Here you go," he said. Lucy was so happy, and she thanked the old man. She led her toy dog back home, holding both the broken penny and the shiny penny in her hand.
