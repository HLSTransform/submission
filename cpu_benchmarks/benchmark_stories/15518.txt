Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Sophie. Sophie loved nothing more than helping her mum and dad when they needed her. 
One day her mum and dad were making dinner and Sophie saw how busy they were. She wanted to help so she asked if there was anything she could do. Her dad said she could help to fix the wine. 
Sophie went to the cupboard and found two bottles of wine. One was dull and one was bright. She was so careful not to break them as she took them over to the kitchen table to help her dad. 
Sophie helped her dad to open the bottle. He said she was doing very well and asked her to pass him the dull wine. She found the dull bottle of wine and carefully passed it to her dad. He smiled and told Sophie she was a big help. 
Sophie was very proud of herself for helping her mum and dad to fix the wine. She couldn't wait to help them with their next task.
