Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside, but it started to rain. Lily didn't have an umbrella, so she got very wet. She saw her friend Timmy with an umbrella and asked him if she could use it. Timmy said yes and Lily was very happy.
After a while, the rain stopped and Lily gave the umbrella back to Timmy. He said, "Thank you for returning my umbrella, Lily. You are a good friend." Lily felt happy that she could help Timmy and be a good friend.
Later that day, Lily's mom made her favorite snack, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Lily was so hungry that she ate it all in one bite. Her mom said, "Lily, next time you should take smaller bites so you don't get a tummy ache." Lily listened to her mom and promised to take smaller bites.
The moral of the story is that it's important to share with friends and to listen to your parents when they give you advice. And if you get too wet in the rain, you can always reverse the situation by borrowing an umbrella.
