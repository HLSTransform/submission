Anna and Ben were on a big boat with their mom and dad. They liked to look at the water and the fish and the birds. One day, the boat stopped near a small island. Mom and dad said they could go and play on the sand and look for shells.
Anna and Ben were happy and ran to the shore. They found many pretty shells and some rocks and sticks. They made a castle with the sand and decorated it with the shells. They had so much fun that they did not see the boat leave.
"Anna, look!" Ben said. "The boat is gone!"
Anna looked and saw that the boat was far away. She felt scared and sad. She did not know how to get back to mom and dad.
"Ben, what do we do?" she asked.
Ben did not know either. He felt scared and sad too. He hugged Anna and said, "Don't worry, Anna. Maybe they will come back soon. Maybe they just forgot us."
They sat on the sand and waited. They hoped that mom and dad would see them and come back. They felt hungry and thirsty and cold. They started to panic.
"Help! Help!" they shouted. "We are here! We are on the island!"
But no one heard them. The boat was too far and the water was too loud.
They cried and cried. They wished they were back on the boat, where it was warm and comfortable and safe. They wished they were with mom and dad, who loved them and took care of them. They wished they never left the boat.
