Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they went to the park to play. They ran and jumped and had so much fun.
After a while, Lily's friends got tired and wanted to go home. But Lily didn't want to leave yet. She wanted to swing on the swings some more. Her friends yelled for her to come, but she didn't listen.
Finally, Lily's mom came to the park and motioned for her to come. Lily knew it was time to go home. She said goodbye to her friends and went home with her mom. She was tired but happy from playing outside.
