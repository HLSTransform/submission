Once there was a brave bear. He was always daring and not afraid of anything. One day he decided to go to the market. He thought it would be a fun adventure. But when he arrived, he was so scared and just wanted to quit. He saw it was very big and he was not sure what to do. But he was brave and decided to stay. He looked around and noticed lots of people and things that he had never seen before. He was a little overwhelmed and was ready to quit again. But he took a deep breath, remembered that he was brave, and started exploring the market. He talked to people and looked at all of the things for sale. After a while, he felt more brave and happy that he had not quit. He even ended up buying a few things. He finished his time at the market feeling much happier and brave.
