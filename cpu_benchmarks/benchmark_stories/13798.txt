Tom is a boy who likes to play with his toys. He has a black clock that makes a loud sound when it is time to wake up. He likes to pretend that the clock is a monster that chases him and his teddy bear.
One morning, Tom wakes up and hears the clock go beep beep beep. He jumps out of bed and grabs his teddy bear. He runs around the room and says, "The clock monster is coming! The clock monster is coming! Run, teddy, run!"
His mom hears the noise and comes to his room. She sees Tom and his teddy bear hiding under the bed. She smiles and says, "Tom, it is time to get ready for school. The clock is not a monster, it is a friend. It helps you know when to wake up and when to sleep."
Tom peeks out from under the bed and says, "But mom, the clock is black and loud. It scares me and teddy. Can we have a different clock? A nice clock?"
His mom thinks for a moment and says, "Well, Tom, I have an idea. Why don't you ask the clock nicely to stop beeping? Maybe the clock will listen to you if you say please."
Tom thinks that is a good idea. He crawls out from under the bed and goes to the clock. He looks at the clock and says, "Hello, clock. You are a good clock, but you are too loud. Can you please stop beeping? Please, please, please?"
The clock hears Tom and stops beeping. It makes a soft tick tock sound instead. Tom is happy and says, "Thank you, clock. You are a nice clock. I like you."
His mom hugs him and says, "See, Tom, the clock is not a monster. It is a friend. And you are a very polite boy. Now, let's get ready for school. You can take your teddy bear with you if you want."
Tom nods and smiles. He picks up his teddy bear and follows his mom. He looks at the clock and says, "Bye, clock. See you later."
The clock tick tocks and says, "Bye, Tom. Have a good day."
