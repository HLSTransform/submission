Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Ryan. He loved to wear his boots. Everywhere he went, he wanted to wear them. 
One day, he wanted to go to the park. He grabbed his boots and ran to find his mom and dad. He called out, “Mom! Dad! Can I wear my boots to the park?”
His parents smiled and nodded. Ryan was so pleased. He shouted for joy as he put on his boots.
Once his boots were on, Ryan ran outside. He raced around and jumped over puddles in joy. Then, something sweet caught his eye. It was a candy stand!
Without hesitation, Ryan ran to the stand and demanded a lollipop. He smiled from ear to ear when he got it! As Ryan sucked on his lollipop, he danced around in his boots. He was very happy.
