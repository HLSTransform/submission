Philip was very excited. He was ready to go out and see the weather. Philip jumped up and down and smiled. He grabbed his boots and put them on. Then he grabbed his coat and put it on too. He was ready to go. 
Philip opened the door and stepped outside into the cold. The wind was chilly, but Philip was determined. He began running down the street. As he ran, he saw a tree with a lot of fruit on it. He wanted to pick the fruit, but he knew he had to yield. 
Philip felt a little sad, but he kept going. He ran to the end of the street and then turned around. All of a sudden, the wind started to blow and the sky grew dark. Philip knew a storm was coming. He started to run again, this time towards home. 
When he got back, he saw his mom and dad waiting for him. He was just in time! He was ready for the storm. He and his parents ran inside and together they prepared the house. 
Philip had yielded to the weather, but he was happy he made it home just in time!
