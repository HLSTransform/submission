The sun was high in the sky and it was very bright. But it was ok, because dad had taken a shade. The shade was big and it was light. It was like a big umbrella. Dad put it over their heads so that they could stay in the light and not get too hot.
Mum had taken a basket with snacks so that everyone could eat and drink something. They were all happy, sitting in the shade. Jennie's little brother Thomas took his little car and drove it around in the dirt. He was having lots of fun, making engine noises.
After a while, mum and dad had to take the shade down because it was starting to get dark. They packed up all the snacks, and off they went, back home. But Jennie had a great day outside in the light with mum, dad and Thomas.
