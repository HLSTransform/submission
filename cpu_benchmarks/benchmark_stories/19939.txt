Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy car that was hers, and she loved it very much. One day, Lily's friend, Timmy, came over to play. Timmy saw Lily's car and wanted to play with it, but Lily said, "No, it's mine!" Timmy got upset and started to cry.
Lily felt bad that Timmy was sad, so she tried to think of a way to make him happy. She remembered that she had another toy car that was just like hers. She went to get it and gave it to Timmy. He was so enthusiastic and happy to have his own car to play with.
But then, Lily realized that her toy car wouldn't fit in the toy garage that she had. She started to get upset because she loved her car too. Timmy saw that Lily was sad and asked her what was wrong. Lily explained the problem, and Timmy had an idea. He suggested that they build a bigger garage together so that both of their cars could fit. Lily thought it was a great idea, and they worked together to build a new garage. In the end, they were both happy and had fun playing with their cars.
