Lily and Ben went to the park with Mom. They saw a big pond with many ducks and swans. Lily liked the swans. They were white and graceful. She wanted to feed them some bread.
"Mom, can I give some bread to the swans?" Lily asked.
"Sure, but be careful. Don't go too close to the water. And don't throw the bread too hard. The swans might get scared," Mom said.
Lily nodded and took a piece of bread from Mom. She walked slowly to the edge of the pond. She saw a swan swimming near her. She smiled and tossed the bread gently to the swan. The swan caught the bread and ate it. It looked happy.
"Thank you, swan!" Lily said.
The swan nodded and swam away. Lily looked for another swan to feed. She saw one that was hidden behind some reeds. It was smaller than the other swans. It looked shy.
"Hello, swan! Do you want some bread?" Lily called.
The hidden swan peeked out from the reeds. It saw Lily and the bread. It wanted the bread, but it was afraid of Lily. It stayed behind the reeds.
"Come on, swan! Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. I just want to be your friend," Lily said.
She threw the bread closer to the hidden swan. The hidden swan saw the bread. It was hungry. It decided to try the bread. It swam out from the reeds and took the bread. It tasted good.
"Thank you, Lily!" The hidden swan said.
Lily was surprised. She didn't know that swans could talk.
"You're welcome, swan! What's your name?" Lily asked.
"My name is End. I'm the last of my family. The other swans left me because I'm different. I can talk, but they can't," End said.
"That's sad, End. But you're not alone. You have me. I'm your friend. And you're not different. You're special," Lily said.
End smiled. He felt happy. He had a friend.
"Thank you, Lily. You're special too. Can I stay with you?" End asked.
"Of course, End. You can stay with me. Come on, let's go to Mom. She'll like you too," Lily said.
She took End's wing and led him to Mom. Ben saw them and was amazed.
"Wow, Lily! You have a talking swan!" Ben said.
"Yes, Ben. This is End. He's my friend. Can he play with us?" Lily said.
"Sure, Lily. He can play with us. Hi, End. I'm Ben. Nice to meet you," Ben said.
"Hi, Ben. Nice to meet you too. You're Lily's brother, right?" End said.
"Yes, I am. You're very smart, End," Ben said.
"Thank you, Ben. You're very kind, Ben," End said.
Mom saw them and was shocked.
"Lily, Ben, what's going on? Who's this swan?" Mom asked.
"Mom, this is End. He's a talking swan. He's my friend. Can he stay with us?" Lily said.
"A talking swan? That's incredible. How did you find him?" Mom asked.
"He was hidden behind some reeds. He was lonely. I gave him some bread. He thanked me. He told me his name. He asked me to be his friend. I said yes. He's very nice, Mom. Please, can he stay with us?" Lily said.
Mom looked at End. He looked at Mom. He nodded.
"Hello, Mom. I'm End. I'm a talking swan. I'm Lily's friend. Can I stay with you?" End said.
Mom was speechless. She didn't know what to say. She looked at Lily and Ben. They looked at Mom. They smiled.
"Please, Mom. Please," they said.
Mom sighed. She smiled too.
"Okay, okay. You can stay with us, End. But only if you promise to be good and not make too much noise. And you have to share the bread with the other swans. Deal?" Mom said.
"Deal, Mom. Thank you, Mom. You're very nice, Mom," End said.
Lily, Ben, and End hugged Mom. They were happy. They had a new friend. A talking swan. His name was End. But his story was just beginning.
