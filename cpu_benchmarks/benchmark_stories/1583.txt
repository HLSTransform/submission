Once upon a time, there was an elderly lady who loved her perfume very much. She always wore it when she went outside to smell the flowers. One day, she went out for a walk and it started to rain. She tried to run home, but she slipped and fell.
A little girl saw the lady fall and ran over to help her. "Are you okay?" the little girl asked. "No, I hurt my leg," the elderly lady replied. "Can you help me get home?"
The little girl helped the lady up and they started walking. But the rain was getting heavier and heavier. Soon, they were both soaking wet. When they finally got to the lady's house, she thanked the little girl and went inside. But she was so cold and wet that she got very sick and had to go to the hospital. Sadly, she never got better and passed away. The little girl was very sad, but she knew the lady was in a better place.
