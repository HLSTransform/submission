Once upon a time there was a wild octopus. He was very happy living in the ocean. 
One day, he saw a boat and decided to try to break it. He used all of his tentacles to pull at the boat and soon it started to break.
He was very pleased with himself and celebrated by jumping out of the water. Then, he slid back into the sea and admired his work. 
The boat was totally broken but the octopus was still very excited. He swam away to tell all of his octopus friends about his wild achievement. 
From then on, the octopus was known by all of the sea creatures as the one who could break things. He was very proud of himself and happy with his new nickname.
