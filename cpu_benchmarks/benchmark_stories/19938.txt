Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a pretty bracelet that she loved to wear. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. While playing, her chubby friend Tommy fell down and hurt his knee. Lily mentioned that she had a band-aid in her bag and offered it to Tommy. Tommy was happy and thanked Lily for her kindness. They continued playing and having fun together. At the end of the day, Lily went home and admired her pretty bracelet, feeling happy that she was able to help her friend. The end.
