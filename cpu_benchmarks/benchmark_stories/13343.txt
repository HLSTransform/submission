Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the bath. One day, Lily reached out to grab the soap, but it slipped out of her hand and went down the drain. She was sad because she loved the smell of the soap. 
Suddenly, Lily's mommy came in with a funny look on her face. She had a surprise for Lily. She pulled out a new soap that smelled like strawberries and was shaped like a butterfly. Lily was so happy and giggled with joy. 
Lily had so much fun playing with her new soap. She pretended it could fly and made it dance around the bathtub. From that day on, Lily made sure to hold onto her soap tightly so it wouldn't slip away again. The end.
