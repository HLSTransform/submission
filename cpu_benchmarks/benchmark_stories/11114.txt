Once upon a time, there was a loyal dog named Buddy. Buddy loved to play with his best friend, a little boy named Tim. They played all day and all night. Buddy was always there for Tim.
One day, Buddy and Tim went to the park. They saw a big man who was a judge. The judge was watching the kids play. Buddy and Tim knew that they should be nice to the judge. They went to say "hi" to him and played near him.
Later, the judge had a race for all the kids. Buddy and Tim wanted to win. They ran very fast. But then, they saw a little girl who fell down. Buddy and Tim stopped running and helped her up. They did not win the race, but the judge saw them help the girl. The judge came up to Buddy and Tim and gave them a special prize. He said they were the best because they were kind and caring. Buddy and Tim learned that it is better to yield and help others than to win a race. And they were happy.
