Once upon a time, there was a pretty pink bunny who lived in a meadow. Every day, the bunny hopped through the tall grass, searching for something special.
One day, while hopping, the bunny heard something. It was a very yummy sound. The bunny's ears twitched and she stopped and looked around. She saw a picnic basket with a pink blanket and she recognized it. It was a meal!
The bunny hopped up to the basket and started to eat the picnic meal. She ate so much that she got really full. But that was okay because she felt happy and satisfied. 
The bunny hopped away but she remembered the picnic basket and the warm pink blanket that she had seen. Whenever she felt hungry, she always recognized the picnic meal, and it made her happy.
