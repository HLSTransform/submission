Once there was a little girl named Lola. She was three years old and liked to ask lots of questions. Every morning, Lola woke up impatient to learn more things. She wanted to know why the trees were tall, why the sky was blue and why the grass was green.
So Lola asked her mom all kinds of questions. Her mom was always happy to answer them. Then, Lola asked her mom why the sun was so bright. Her mom explained that the sun made light for us to see. Lola thought about this for a moment and thought it was so amazing.
Lola asked her dad questions, too. She asked her dad how the wind moved from one place to another. Her dad laughed, and smiled at her, before explaining that the wind was made of air.
Lola asked questions all day long and learned something new each time. Her parents were very patient in answering all her questions, and Lola was so happy and excited to find out more.
