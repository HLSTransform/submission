Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in his backyard. One day, Timmy saw a big orange ball in his neighbor's yard. Timmy wanted to play with the ball, but he didn't know if it was safe to go into his neighbor's yard.
Timmy's mom came outside and saw him looking at the ball. She encouraged Timmy to always ask for permission before going into someone else's yard. Timmy asked his neighbor if he could play with the ball, and his neighbor said yes!
Timmy had a lot of fun playing with the big orange ball. When he was finished, he thanked his neighbor for letting him play with it. Timmy learned that it's always important to ask for permission and to be safe when playing outside.
