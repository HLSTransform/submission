Once upon a time, Mum and her three year old daughter were at the airport. From the airport, the daughter could see a big aeroplane in the sky. She was really amazed and pointed to it yelling: “Wow, look at that aeroplane, mum! It's so impressive.”
Mum smiled and said: “Yes, it is impressive! It is an aeroplane and it can take people far away from here.”
The three year old daughter thought about this for a moment and then said to her mum: “I'm glad that I am here with you. You are the best.”
Mum replied: “I'm so pleased that you appreciate what you have. Always be thankful for what you have!”
The three year old daughter nodded, smiled and said: “Thank you, mum!”
The moral of the story is to always be thankful for what we have. When we're thankful, we can be happy and appreciate what we have. Appreciating what we have is an important life lesson. It teaches us to be grateful and not take anything for granted.
