Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved peanuts so much that he ate them every day. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play.
"Hi Timmy! Can we play with your toys?" asked Billy.
"Sure!" said Timmy, excited to have a friend over.
As they played, Billy saw a peanut on the ground. "Hey Timmy, look! A peanut!" Billy picked it up and showed it to Timmy.
"That's my peanut! I dropped it earlier," said Timmy.
Billy looked at the peanut and said, "This peanut is stupid. It doesn't match with anything."
Timmy felt sad that his peanut was called stupid. "But I like it," he said.
Billy realized that he hurt Timmy's feelings. "I'm sorry, Timmy. I think your peanut is cool too." And they continued to play with Timmy's toys, including the peanut that didn't match with anything.
