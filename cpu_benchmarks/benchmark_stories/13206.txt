Wise mama took the kids to the restaurant. They watched the people inside. They watched the birds outside. They watched the waiters and cooks in the kitchen. Mama said they were being wise by watching. 
When they were done, they went outside. Mama said they needed to rest after such a long day of watching. So, they lay down on the grass and watched the clouds. They watched until they got sleepy and then they closed their eyes and went to sleep. 
When they awoke, they were all refreshed. The kids were surprised how wise mama was to let them watch and rest. It was the best time ever!
