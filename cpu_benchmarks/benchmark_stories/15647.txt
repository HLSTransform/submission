Once upon a time, there was a mom and her son. They went on a visit to a big store.  
Mom said, "Let's trade our leftover candy for something more fun!" 
The little boy was so excited. He said, "Yes please!" 
They went inside the store and there were lots of different things available. There were games, toys, and treats. The little boy got very excited and started running around to look at them.
Mom asked, "What do you want?"
The little boy replied, "I want everything!"
Mom laughed and said, "Well, you can't have everything. But pick something you really like and we will do the trade."
The little boy thought carefully and finally chose a bright green toy rocket. He said, "I really like this one. Can we trade for it please?" 
Mom said, "Sure! Let's do the trade." 
The little boy was so happy and held the toy tight. He said, "Thank you mom! I love this rocket!" 
Mom hugged the little boy and said, "You're welcome. I'm happy you like it!" 
They both left the store with huge smiles on their faces. The little boy was very excited to play with his new toy rocket. 
The end.
