Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big, cool hat that she loved to wear. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends.
While playing, Lily found a small box of powder. She opened the box and saw that the powder was blue and sparkly. She thought it was very pretty. Lily put some powder on her cool hat to make it even more beautiful.
Then, a little frog hopped over to Lily. The frog looked at her cool hat with the sparkly powder and liked it too. The frog asked Lily for a kiss. Lily was surprised, but she gave the frog a little kiss. Suddenly, the frog turned into a prince! The prince thanked Lily for her kiss and they became good friends. They played in the park together and had lots of fun.
