Once upon a time, there was a hunter named Tom. He liked to count his toys. One day, it was dark outside, and he could not see his toys. Tom was sad.
Tom's mom saw him and said, "Why are you sad?" Tom said, "It is dark and I can't count my toys." His mom had an idea. She gave Tom a big light.
Now, Tom could see his toys. He was happy. He counted his toys: one, two, three, four, five. Tom and his mom smiled and played with the toys. They had fun in the dark.
