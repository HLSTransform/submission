Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a great treasure box filled with jewels. Every night before bed, Lily would close her treasure box and put it under her bed.
One day, Lily's cat snuck into her room and knocked over her treasure box. All of her jewels spilled out onto the floor! Lily was very sad and didn't know what to do. But then she remembered that she could close her treasure box again and put all of her jewels back inside.
Lily was so happy when she saw that all of her jewels were safe and sound in her treasure box once again. She gave her cat a big hug and went to bed with a smile on her face. From that day on, Lily made sure to always close her treasure box tightly so that her jewels would stay safe.
