Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved playing with her shoes. One day, she found one of her shoes underneath her bed and it was dusty and old. She wanted to have fun with it, so she took it outside.
But then, a furious wind started to blow and it blew the shoe away! The little girl started to cry and looked around helplessly.
Just then, a kind old man appeared and said to her, "Why are you so sad, little one?"
The little girl said, "My shoe blew away and I feel so guilty!"
The old man smiled and said, "Don't worry, I'll help you get it back. Look up in the sky."
The little girl looked up and saw that the old man was holding her shoe in the wind. He settled it down onto the ground and said, "There you go! Don't be too guilty now."
The little girl was so happy that her shoe was back and she thanked the old man. She put on her shoe and went back inside, never feeling guilty again!
