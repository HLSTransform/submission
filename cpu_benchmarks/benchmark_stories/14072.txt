Mommy was walking outside with her little boy. He was three years old.
"Mommy, what's in the basket?", he asked.
"Oh, it's a surprise", Mommy said.
She opened the basket. The inside was gray. Mommy handed the little boy some items from the basket.
"These are different shapes and sizes. Can you sort them?", she asked.
The little boy smiled. He took the pieces and started to sort them. He put the round ones in one pile and the square ones in another. He put the small ones in the basket and the big ones on the ground.
Mommy laughed. "That's very good", she said.
The little boy smiled and finished sorting the pieces. When he was done, he held up a big smile. 
"I did it!", he said proudly.
Mommy was so proud of him. "You did a wonderful job, honey", she said. 
The little boy was so happy with himself. He closed the basket and held it close. Mommy and the little boy shared a big hug and went back inside.
