Once upon a time, there was a girl who wanted to celebrate. She was so impatient that she couldn't wait any longer. She looked around and saw a shiny red pedal. She quickly grabbed it and started pedalling to celebrate. She pedalled around and felt so happy and excited! She pedalled until she was so tired, and then she stopped to take a rest. After a nice rest she got back on the pedal and continued to celebrate. She pedalled until it was dark and then went home to her family. They were so happy to see her come home. Together, they celebrated with a big feast. The girl was so happy she had celebrated with her family. The End.
