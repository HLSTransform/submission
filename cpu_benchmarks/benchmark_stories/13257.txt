Once upon a time there was a wild rat. He scampered around the forest, looking for food. One day, he came across a big, red box sitting in the middle of the path. He sniffed at it and decided to take a closer look.
To his surprise, he heard a voice coming from inside. It was getting louder and louder, then suddenly the lid popped open. Out jumped a little boy wearing a green suit.
He looked at the rat and said, "I order you to get me food!" The rat was so scared he couldn't move. The boy smirked and said, "Go on, little rat. Now!"
So the rat scurried away to find food for the boy. He gathered up some berries and nuts and raced back to the boy. The little boy smiled, said thank you and then put the lid back on the box.
The rat shivered, wondering if he would ever see the boy again. He had done what he was ordered and that was that. As he scampered off, the forest grew wilder still.
