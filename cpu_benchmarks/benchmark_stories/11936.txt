Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She went on a trip to see her grandma. She rode in a car with her mommy and daddy for a long time. Finally, they arrive at grandma's house.
Grandma was cooking on the stove when they got there. The stove was hot and made yummy smells. Lily was excited to eat the food. She loved grandma's cooking.
After dinner, they went for a walk in the woods. They saw lots of trees and animals. Lily saw a wild bunny hopping around. She thought it was cute. They had a fun time outside. Then, it was time to go back to grandma's house and go to bed. Lily was tired but happy.
