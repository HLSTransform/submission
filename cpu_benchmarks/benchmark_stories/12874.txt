Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Tamika. She loved to go outside and play with her friends. One day, on a warm afternoon, Tamika and her friends decided to go on an adventure. 
As they explored, they came to a spot where they found many red pastels. The pastels were so bright and colorful that they were surprised! Tamika's friends decided to pick some of the pastels and put them in a basket.
Tamika wanted to pick some too, but before she could the ground started to shake. Out of nowhere a giant red dragon emerged from the ground! Tamika's friends were terrified and quickly ran away.
"Don't be afraid Tamika," said the dragon. "I'm here to protect the pastels." He then explained to Tamika that the pastels were very special and needed to stay away from people. He was happy that Tamika was not trying to take any.
Tamika said goodbye to her new friend and ran off to meet her friends. She told them all about the dragon and they were super surprised.
From then on, the friends knew to always be careful around the red pastels and never to take any. What a surprise!
