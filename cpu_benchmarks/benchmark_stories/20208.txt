Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to climb on the big rocks and balance on them. They pretended they were brave explorers in a wild land.
"Look, I can balance on this rock with one foot!" Lily said. She lifted her other foot in the air and smiled.
"Wow, you are so good!" Tom said. He tried to do the same, but he slipped and fell. He hurt his knee and cried.
Lily ran to him and hugged him. "Don't cry, Tom. I will help you. Let's go to mom and dad. They will make it better."
But before they could go, they heard a loud noise. They looked up and saw a big bird in the sky. It had a long beak and sharp claws. It was an eagle. And it had an arrow in its wing. Someone had shot it and made it angry.
The eagle saw Lily and Tom and swooped down. It wanted to catch them and eat them. Lily and Tom were scared. They had no place to hide. They were helpless.
"Help! Help!" they screamed. But no one heard them. The eagle grabbed them with its claws and flew away. Lily and Tom never saw their mom and dad again. The end.
