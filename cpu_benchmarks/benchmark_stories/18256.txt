Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear her favorite dress with flowers on it. Every day, she would wear it and twirl around in it, feeling happy.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She played on the swings and the slide, but then she noticed something. Her dress had a big stain on it! She started to worry that her dress was ruined and she wouldn't be able to wear it anymore.
But her mom was very careful and she knew how to get the stain out. She showed Lily a pattern of how to wash the dress and make it clean again. Lily was so happy that her dress was saved and she could wear it again. She hugged her mom and felt very grateful.
