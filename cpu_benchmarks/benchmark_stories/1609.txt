Mira was a little bird who liked to fly and sing. She had many friends in the forest, but her best friend was Rani, a big bear. Rani was very kind and reliable. She always helped Mira when she was in trouble, and shared her honey and berries with her.
One day, Mira and Rani were playing near the river, when they heard a loud roar. It was a mean lion who wanted to eat them. Mira and Rani were scared and ran away. The lion chased them through the trees and bushes, but he was not fast enough. Mira and Rani reached a big cave and hid inside.
The lion could not find them, and soon he gave up and left. Mira and Rani were safe, but they were very tired. They decided to sleep in the cave for the night. Mira found a soft spot on the floor and made a nest with some leaves and feathers. Rani curled up next to her and wrapped her arms around her. Mira felt warm and cozy in Rani's hug. She thanked Rani for being her friend and saving her from the lion. Rani smiled and said, "You are welcome, Mira. You are my friend and I will always protect you." They closed their eyes and fell asleep. They dreamed of flying and singing in the forest.
