Once upon a time, there was a persistent fireman named Tom. Tom loved to help people. One day, he was walking down the street when he saw a cat stuck in a tree.
"Meow!" said the cat. "Help me, fireman Tom!"
Tom wanted to help the cat. He tried to climb the tree, but it was too high. He tried to shake the tree, but it was too strong. He did not give up.
Finally, Tom had an idea. He found a long stick and used it to shut a window nearby. The noise scared the cat, and it jumped down from the tree.
"Thank you, fireman Tom!" said the cat. Tom was happy he could help, and he kept being a persistent fireman.
