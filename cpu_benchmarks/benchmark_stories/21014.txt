A boy was feeling frustrated. He had a cube, but he didn't know what to do with it. He decided to try something new. He threw the cube. It flew through the air and landed on the ground.
The boy was excited. He threw the cube again. This time, it flew higher. He kept throwing it and it kept flying higher. He had so much fun throwing his cube.
Eventually, he got tired and wanted to do something else. He picked up his cube and put it away in a safe place. He was happy and not frustrated anymore.
