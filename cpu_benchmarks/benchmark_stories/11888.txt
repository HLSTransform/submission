Once upon a time there was a girl, called Jane. She was very stubborn. Every day she would skip all the way to school, carrying her bag. But one day something happened! There was an earthquake which made the ground shake. Jane was so scared that she refused to move. She was much too stubborn to skip anymore. She stayed still, even when the tremor stopped, until it was too late for her to get to school. The teachers were so angry with her for being late. Jane never went to school on time again.
