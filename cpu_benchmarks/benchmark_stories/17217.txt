Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars all day long. One day, Timmy's favorite car rolled into a big scary hole. Timmy was scared and didn't know what to do. 
But then, his big brother came to the rescue! He climbed down the hole and got Timmy's car back. Timmy was so happy and hugged his brother tight. 
After that, Timmy and his brother went to the colorful shop to buy some more toy cars to play with. They had so much fun picking out new cars and playing with them all day long. Timmy was grateful for his brother's help and they had a great day together. The end.
