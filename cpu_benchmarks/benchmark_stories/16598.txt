Lily and Ben are twins. They share a room. Lily likes pink and Ben likes blue. But they do not like each other's things. Lily thinks Ben's cars are noisy and Ben thinks Lily's dolls are boring.
One day, Mom says they can change their room. She says they can paint the walls and get new beds and toys. Lily and Ben are glad. They think they can have their own colors and things.
But Mom says they have to agree on how to change their room. She says they have to share and be nice. Lily and Ben do not like this. They want to have their own way.
They start to argue. Lily says she wants pink walls and a princess bed. Ben says he wants blue walls and a race car bed. They say they do not want to see each other's things. They say they do not want to share.
Mom hears them and is sad. She says they have to stop fighting. She says they have to find a way to change their room that makes them both happy. She says they have to think of each other and not just themselves.
Lily and Ben are quiet. They think about what Mom said. They think about how they love each other. They think about how they can have fun together.
They decide to change their room in a new way. They paint the walls purple, because it is a mix of pink and blue. They get bunk beds, so they can have their own space but still be close. They get a toy box, where they can keep their cars and dolls and share them when they want to.
They show Mom their new room. Mom is happy. She says they did a good job. She says they are good twins. Lily and Ben are happy too. They hug Mom and each other. They say they like their new room. They say they are glad they changed their room and their minds.
