Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was always hungry and loved to eat. One day, he found a big barrel of candy. He ate and ate until he was very full. But he didn't stop there, he kept eating and eating until he felt sick. 
Later that day, Timmy's mom asked him to help her carry a big barrel of water from the river. Timmy didn't want to help because he was too full and didn't feel good. But his mom insisted, so he reluctantly agreed. 
As they were walking back, they heard a loud noise. Timmy started to panic and ran away, leaving the barrel behind. His mom was disappointed in him for not being brave and helping her when she needed him. 
Timmy learned that being too greedy can make you sick and being brave is important. From that day on, he made sure to only eat what he needed and always helped his mom when she asked.
