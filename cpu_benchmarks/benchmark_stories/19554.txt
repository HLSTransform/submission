Once upon a time, there was a lazy dinosaur. He didn't like to move around much and would rather take a nap than go explore. One day, his best friend, a triceratops, suggested they go to the beach together. The dinosaur was very excited to go exploring, but he couldn't find his shoes. Suddenly, he remembered he put them on around the other way, so he had to reverse them to find them. With his shoes in tow, the dinosaur happily set out for the beach with his friend. On the way, they saw so many cool sights, and the dinosaur had so much fun that he forgot all about being lazy. He even ran up a hill with his friend and splashed around in the sea. When it was time to leave, the dinosaur couldn't wait to come back and explore more.
