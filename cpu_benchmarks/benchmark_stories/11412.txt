Once upon a time, there were two friends. They were walking in the park. The sun was shining and birds were chirping. 
The first friend spoted something shiny on the ground. It was a large magnet. He picked it up and said to his friend "Look what I found!" 
The friend said "Wow, that's cool. Let's turn it around and see what else is inside!" 
The first friend shook his head. "No, that's not a good idea. We should leave it alone. It's probably someone's property." 
But the second friend didn't listen. He grabbed the magnet and turned it around. Suddenly, a loud alarm went off. The two friends were scared and started to run. They ran as fast as their legs could carry them. 
When they looked back, they saw a police officer chasing them. They were so scared that they couldn't move. The police officer soon reached them and arrested them for stealing the large magnet. 
And that's how their story ended.
