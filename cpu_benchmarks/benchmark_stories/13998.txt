Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a boy named Tim. Tim's mom had a shop where she would sell things. One day, she got a new thing to sell - scissors! Tim thought the scissors were cool.
In the town, there was another shop that also sold scissors. The two shops were competitive. Tim's mom wanted to sell more scissors than the other shop. So, she talked to the other shop's owner. She said, "My scissors are better than yours!"
The other shop owner said, "No, my scissors are better!" They both wanted to sell the most scissors. But then, Tim had an idea. He said, "Why don't we work together? We can sell our scissors in one big shop!"
Tim's mom and the other shop owner agreed. They started working together and sold even more scissors. The town was happy because they had the best scissors. The moral of the story is that working together can help everyone do better.
