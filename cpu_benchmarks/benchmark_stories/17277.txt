One sunny day, a little girl named Lily wanted to water her flowers. She went to get the hose but it was too heavy for her. She asked her mommy to help her. Her mommy said, "Let's try to carry it together." They both held the hose and walked to the flower bed.
Lily turned on the water and the hose made a big noise. She laughed and sprayed the water on the flowers. The sun was shining bright and made everything look so light and pretty. Lily was happy that her flowers were getting watered and that she had fun with her mommy. 
After they finished watering, they put the hose away and went inside for a snack. Lily told her mommy, "I like the hose and the light outside." Her mommy smiled and said, "Me too, sweetie."
