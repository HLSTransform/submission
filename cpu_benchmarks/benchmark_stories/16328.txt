Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun and pick flowers. One day, while she was playing, she found a shiny rock that sparkled in the light. It was so attractive that she couldn't take her eyes off of it. 
Lily brought the rock home and showed it to her mom. Her mom told her that the rock was actually a diamond, a very precious stone that people treasure. Lily was so happy that she found something so special. 
A few days later, Lily's mom took her to a jewelry store. Lily was excited to see all the pretty things inside. Her mom told her that they were there to sell the diamond that she found. Lily was sad at first, but her mom explained that they could use the money to buy things they needed. 
In the end, they sold the diamond and used the money to buy food for their family and toys for Lily. Lily learned that sometimes, the things we find can bring us happiness, but it's important to also think about how we can help others with what we have.
