Once upon a time, there was a giant. His house was enormous and had many rooms. Each day he would go into one of the rooms, called the chamber. Inside, he would write on the walls. Every day, he would write something new in his chamber. One day, he wrote about the stars and the moon. On another day, he wrote about the animals in the forest. He kept writing every day. He loved writing in his enormous chamber. Eventually, the chamber was so full of stories, the giant had to find a new chamber to write in.
