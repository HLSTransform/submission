Tom and Sam like to play football in the park. They kick the ball to each other and run after it. They have fun and laugh a lot.
One day, they see a big number on the ball. It is a six. Tom says, "Look, Sam, a number! Do you know what it means?" Sam says, "No, I don't. Do you?" Tom says, "I think it means how many times we can kick the ball before it pops."
They decide to test Tom's idea. They kick the ball six times and then stop. They wait and see if the ball pops. It does not. They are confused. They kick the ball again and again. It still does not pop.
They get tired and thirsty. They leave the ball on the grass and go to get some water. When they come back, they see a dog playing with the ball. The dog bites the ball and makes a hole in it. The air comes out of the ball and it goes flat. The dog runs away with the ball.
Tom and Sam are sad. They say, "Oh no, our ball is gone! And it is dirty and broken!" They do not understand why the number did not work. They go home and tell their mom what happened. She hugs them and says, "I'm sorry, boys. The number was not a rule. It was just a mark. It did not mean anything. But I have a surprise for you. I bought you a new ball. It is bigger and brighter and has no number on it. Do you want to play with it?" Tom and Sam smile and say, "Yes, please! Thank you, mom!" They go to the park and play with their new ball. They forget about the old ball and the number. They have fun and laugh a lot.
