One day, a sheep was in the field when he noticed something strange. He heard a loud noise coming from inside a nearby forest. The sheep was curious, so he decided to investigate. He ran through the trees until he saw a harsh puddle in a clearing. There, the sheep found a wolf struggling to escape. The wolf was stuck and the puddle was too deep for it to jump over. The sheep thought for a moment and then created an idea. He gathered some sticks and rocks from the ground and built a bridge over the puddle. The wolf was very thankful and quickly ran across the bridge to safety. The sheep watched as the wolf ran away and smiled. This sheep was brave and clever. All of the other animals were very proud!
