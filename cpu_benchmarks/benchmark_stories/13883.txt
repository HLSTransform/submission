Once upon a time, in a tidy little house, there was a girl named Amy. Amy loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, Amy's mom asked her to get a glass from the shelf. 
"Can you get a glass for me, Amy?" her mom asked. Amy reached up high, but she was too little. She tried and tried, but the glass would not yield.
Just then, Amy's big brother, Tim, came into the kitchen. He saw Amy trying to get the glass. "Let me help you," he said. Tim was tall, so he could reach the glass easily. He gave it to Amy, and she gave it to her mom.
Amy's mom was very happy. "Thank you, Amy and Tim!" she said. "You are both such good helpers." Amy and Tim smiled, feeling proud to help their mom. From that day on, they always worked together to keep their home tidy and full of love.
