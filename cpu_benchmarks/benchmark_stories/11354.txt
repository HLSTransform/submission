Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mary. Mary loved to play outside in the sunshine. 
One day Mary found a beautiful golden chain in the garden. She picked it up and it sparkled in the light. She couldn't wait to show her mom. 
But when she went to show her mom the chain, it had disappeared! 
Mary didn't know where it had gone. She started to feel very sorry. 
She asked her mom, "Mommy, did you mind the chain?"
Her mom said, "Oh no, sweetheart. I'm sorry. I didn't see it."
Mary smiled and said, "That's ok Mommy. I'm sure it will turn up soon." 
And it did! In the end, Mary found her chain in the corner of the garden. She was so excited! She put it on and felt like a princess. From that day, Mary never forgot to mind her belongings.
