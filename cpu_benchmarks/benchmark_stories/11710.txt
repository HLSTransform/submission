Teddy was a 3 year old who always liked to explore. He saw a creek and wanted to check it out. He picked a polite leaf off a nearby tree and put it in his pocket. 
He walked to the creek where he saw a frog. He smiled at it and the frog nodded back at him. Teddy smiled bigger and the frog nodded again. Teddy waved goodbye and the frog waved back. 
He continued to explore along the creek until he found a big rock. He sat on it and looked around. He saw butterflies flying nearby and thought it was so pretty. He stayed for a while and watched the insects flutter around. 
When it was time to go home Teddy was sad to leave. He said goodbye to the creek as he waved one last time. The creek nodded gently to him in a polite way and Teddy smiled. He was so happy to have made a creek friend.
