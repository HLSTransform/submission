Once upon a time there was a bear named Bob. He was very excited to hear about a van that was coming to his home. He rushed to his window and saw the big van driving up his driveway. He heard a sound and realized it was coming from the van. When the van stopped, Bob quickly went outside to see what was inside. 
When the doors opened, Bob saw a surprise! Inside the van were lots of balloons in all different colors! He was so excited he started bouncing. His mom and dad came outside too and laughed at Bob's happiness. They played with the balloons for a long time. 
After a while, Bob heard a sound of an engine. He quickly got up and looked outside. The van was driving away. Bob waved as the van drove off, hoping it would come back someday soon.  His mom and dad said goodbye and Bob went back inside, still excited about the colorful van.
