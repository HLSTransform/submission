Once upon a time, there was a cheerful little girl named Lucy. Every morning, Lucy would open her eyes and fill the room with sunshine. 
One day when Lucy was playing in the garden, she saw something sparkly and shiny near a rosebush. She went over to investigate, and discovered a beautiful jewel. She was so excited she ran inside and said to her family, 
"Look what I found! It's a jewel! It's so pretty!"
Lucy's family was so happy for her. They asked her to always remember to mind the jewel, to look after it and keep it safe. And ever since that day, Lucy has always been very careful to mind the jewel and keep it safe. 
Lucy always felt so cheerful whenever she looked at her precious jewel. It reminded her of how lucky she was to have such a beautiful thing in her life. 
And that is the story of Lucy and her jewel.
