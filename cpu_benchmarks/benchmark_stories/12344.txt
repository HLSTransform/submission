Once upon a time, there was a lazy dog who lived in a small house. The dog didn't like to do anything except lie around the house all day. One day, the dog spotted a cherry tree in the garden. The tree had lots and lots of ripe, juicy cherries. The dog quickly got to work and started picking the cherries one by one. 
Pretty soon, the dog had a basket full of cherries. On his way back inside, he bumped into a small girl who was looking for something. The girl had a surprised look on her face and asked: "What are those?"
The dog answered with a happy voice: "Cherries!" The girl smiled and gave the dog a big hug. Then she asked him: "If I give you a hug, can you give me one cherry?". The dog just nodded, and the girl gave him a hug. As promised, the dog gave the girl one cherry. 
The girl was very happy and thanked the lazy dog. She said goodbye and left with a cherry in hand, a smile on her face. The dog stayed in the garden, happily watching the girl as she walked away.
