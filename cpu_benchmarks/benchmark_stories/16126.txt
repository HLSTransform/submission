Bob was feeling frustrated because he wanted to go out. He wanted to wear his favorite jacket but it was too cold. He looked out of the window and observed how the air was very cold. He looked around and saw that his friends were all wearing jackets. He was so frustrated that he decided to go outside without his jacket.
He opened the door and went out. The cold wind hit him and he wished he had brought his jacket. He began to shiver and he started crying. He was so cold that he had to go back home.
When Bob opened the door he realized he had lost his key. He was so frustrated and disappointed because he could not get back in the house. He had to spend the night outside and he felt so cold. 
Bob learned an important lesson that day and never went out without his jacket again.
