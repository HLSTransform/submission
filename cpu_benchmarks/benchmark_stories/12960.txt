Jane had been feeling very sleepy all morning. She was so sleepy that she couldn't help but yawn. Finally, when her mom said it was time to go, Jane got into the car and closed her eyes.
When she woke up again, she was there already. Jane looked around and saw a huge stable. She had never seen one this big before! She was so excited that she forgot about how sleepy she was.
She ran inside the stable and went up to every horse she saw. She patted them, hugged them and even gave them a few treats. The horses were so happy to see her.
Jane had a great time at the stable and soon it was time to go home. She was sad to leave, but she was also very tired. As they drove home, Jane yawned and fell asleep.
