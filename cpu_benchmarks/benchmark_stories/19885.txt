Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the snow. One day, Lily and her friends decided to build a snowman. They rolled the snow into a big ball and placed it on the ground. Then they started to make the body and head of the snowman.
Suddenly, Lily's little brother came outside and accidentally knocked the snowman over. Lily felt nervous because she thought her friends would be upset. But instead, they all laughed and started to make a new snowman. They used ice to make the eyes and mouth of the snowman. It was the best snowman they had ever made!
