Once there was a silly rabbit who loved to play. One day he found a bin and decided to turn it over. He smiled as he watched it reverse onto the ground. He decided it would be fun to jump inside and he hopped in.
He wiggled and bounced around until he accidentally knocked the bin back over again. The rabbit was surprised but it made him laugh. He reversed the bin back onto the ground and giggled as he jumped inside again.
He kept reversing the bin onto the ground and jumping inside every time until he eventually got tired and lay down for a nap inside the bin. His friends came to find him but could not figure out where he was until they saw the reversed bin.
They were relieved to find him safe and sound but also found him very silly for taking a nap inside!
