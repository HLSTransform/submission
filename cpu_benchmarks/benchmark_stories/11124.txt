Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He liked to play with his toys in his room. One day, he saw an unknown toy under his bed. It was big, and he did not know where it came from.
Tim wanted to play with the unknown toy, so he tried to reach it. But it was too far away. He pushed his hand harder, and then he felt pain. Tim started to cry and yell for his mom.
His mom heard him yell and came running to his room. She saw the pain in Tim's face and helped him. She got the unknown toy for him and hugged him. Tim felt better, and they played with the toy together.
