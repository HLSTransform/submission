Tom and Lily liked to play in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. But they did not like the big dog that lived near the park. The big dog was rough and loud. He liked to chase and bark at Tom and Lily.
One day, Tom and Lily saw the big dog sleeping under a tree. They wanted to go to the swing, but they were afraid of the big dog. Tom had an idea. He said, "Let's throw some stones at the big dog. Then he will go away and we can play." Lily said, "OK, but be careful. He might wake up and bite us."
Tom and Lily picked up some small stones and threw them at the big dog. The big dog did not move. He did not even open his eyes. Tom and Lily threw more stones. They threw harder and harder. They thought it was fun.
But then, something bad happened. One of the stones hit the big dog on his nose. The big dog woke up. He was angry. He jumped up and ran after Tom and Lily. He barked and growled. Tom and Lily were scared. They ran away, but the big dog was faster. He caught up with them and bit them on their legs.
Tom and Lily cried. They cried very loud. Their legs hurt. Their legs were red and swollen. Their legs had an itch. They wished they had not thrown stones at the big dog. They wished they had been nice to him. They learned a lesson. They learned not to be mean to animals. They learned to be kind and gentle.
