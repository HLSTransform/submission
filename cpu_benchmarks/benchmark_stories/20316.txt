Lily and Ben like to play with bubbles. They have a big bottle of bubble soap and a wand. They blow bubbles in the park and watch them fly in the air. They try to catch them and pop them.
One day, a huge dog comes to the park. He sees the bubbles and thinks they are balls. He runs after them and tries to bite them. He barks and jumps and scares Lily and Ben. He pops all the bubbles with his teeth and tongue.
Lily and Ben are sad and angry. They want to play with bubbles, not with the dog. They tell the dog to go away, but he does not listen. He wants more bubbles. He knocks over the bottle of bubble soap and spills it on the grass. He licks the soap and makes a funny face.
Lily and Ben see the soap on the grass. They have an idea. They pick up some soap with their hands and throw it at the dog. The soap makes more bubbles in the air. The dog is surprised and confused. He tries to catch the soap bubbles, but they scatter and fly away. He runs around and around, but he cannot catch them.
Lily and Ben laugh and clap. They have fun throwing soap bubbles at the dog. The dog has fun chasing the soap bubbles. He stops barking and jumping and scaring them. He wags his tail and licks their faces. He is a friendly dog. He just likes to play. Lily and Ben make friends with the dog. They share their bubble soap and wand with him. They blow bubbles together and have a happy day.
