Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved his rug, it was soft and blue. One day, Timmy's mom came into his room and asked him to clean up his toys. Timmy didn't want to, so he shrugged his shoulders and said "no". His mom got upset and told him to clean up or he wouldn't be able to play with his toys later. Timmy didn't like this, so he tried to pull his rug tight over his toys so his mom couldn't see them. But his mom saw what he was doing and told him to clean up properly. Timmy finally listened and put his toys away.
