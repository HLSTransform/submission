Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big slide. Lily wants to go on the slide. Ben is scared.
"Come on, Ben. The slide is fun. You can be brave," Lily says.
"I don't know, Lily. The slide is high. I might fall," Ben says.
Lily holds Ben's hand. She smiles at him. "Don't worry, Ben. I will go with you. We can slide together. It will be fun."
Lily and Ben climb the steps. They sit on the slide. They hold each other's hand. They slide down. They laugh and scream.
"Wow, that was fun. You were brave, Ben," Lily says.
"Thank you, Lily. You were brave, too. Can we go again?" Ben says.
Lily and Ben hug. They run to the slide again. They have fun. They are happy. They are friends.
