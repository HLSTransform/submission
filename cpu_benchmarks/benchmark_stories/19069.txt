Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she saw a butterfly and decided to follow it. She ran after the butterfly, but it was too fast for her to catch.
Lily didn't want to give up, so she kept following the butterfly. She ran through the fields and over the hills, but the butterfly always stayed just out of her reach. Finally, Lily realized that she wasn't going to catch the butterfly, but she didn't feel embarrassed. She was proud of herself for trying her best and not giving up.
The moral of the story is that success isn't always about catching what you're chasing. Sometimes, it's about trying your best and being proud of yourself, even if you don't succeed. And it's okay to ask for help or try a different approach if you need to.
