Once upon a time there was a brave little boy named Mike. He and his family were out for a drive one sunny day, and Mike asked his mom, "Where are we going?"
His mom said, "We are going to the store, Mike."
Mike's face lit up and he said, "Can I get a joke?"
Just then, they drove past a big, scary-looking house, which made Mike a bit frightened. His mom said, "No jokes today, Mike. We're just going to get some groceries."
Mike pouted and didn't say a word. But as soon as they entered the store, Mike saw a funny-looking joke book, and he started to reach for it. His mom said, "Mike, that's too expensive. We're here to get groceries only."
Mike was very sad and a bit scared. His mom hugged him and said, "Let's get back in the car. I'll tell you a joke on the way home."
Mike smiled and said, "Okay, Mom!"
They left the store, and his mom told him a funny joke - one he hadn't heard before. Mike smiled and felt a lot less frightened. 
The End.
