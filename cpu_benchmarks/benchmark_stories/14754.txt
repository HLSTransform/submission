Lily and Tom were playing in the living room. They liked to pretend they were spies and use the radio to talk to each other. They had a secret code and a secret mission. They had to find the hidden treasure in the house.
But they were naughty. They did not listen to Mom when she told them to stay away from the radio. She said it was not a toy and it was very important. She said it was for emergencies only. She said she would be very angry if they touched it.
Lily and Tom did not care. They thought Mom was boring and they wanted to have fun. They took the radio and hid under the table. They whispered and giggled and made funny noises. They did not notice that they pressed a button on the radio. They did not know that they were sending a signal to the police.
The police heard the radio and thought there was a problem. They thought someone was in trouble and needed help. They got in their cars and drove very fast to the house. They turned on their sirens and their lights. They made a lot of noise.
Mom heard the noise and ran to the window. She saw the police and panicked. She thought something bad had happened. She ran to the door and opened it. She saw the police and asked them what was wrong. They told her they got a signal from the radio. They asked her if she was okay. She said she was okay. She did not understand.
Then she saw Lily and Tom under the table. She saw the radio in their hands. She realized what they had done. She was very angry. She scolded them and took the radio away. She apologized to the police and explained that it was a mistake. The police were not happy. They told her to be more careful and to teach her children to respect the radio. They left.
Lily and Tom were very scared. They knew they had been naughty. They knew they had caused a lot of trouble. They knew Mom was very angry. They knew they would be punished. They cried and said they were sorry. But it was too late. They had ruined their game and their day. They had a bad ending.
