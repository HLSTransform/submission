Once there was a bald man who was very tired. He had been working hard all day and couldn't keep his eyes open. He decided he needed a nap.
So, he lay down in the sun near a cactus. He closed his eyes and he soon fell into a deep sleep. The sun was warm and he was soon snoring.
The cactus was very close. Its spines were sharp, but it didn't bother the bald man. He just slept and slept.
When he woke up, he blinked and looked around. He had had a nice nap and he felt very refreshed. The cactus was still nearby, but the bald man didn't mind. He thanked the cactus for the beautiful nap and then went home, ready for another day.
