Lily and Ben are playing in the garden. They have many toys to play with. They have a ball, a bike, a doll, a car, and a file. A file is a thing that makes other things smooth. Lily likes the file. She likes to file her nails and make them shiny.
"Can I play with the file?" Ben asks Lily.
"No, it is mine. You can play with the ball or the bike or the doll or the car," Lily says.
"But I want to play with the file. It is fun. Please, Lily, let me have a turn," Ben says.
Lily thinks for a moment. She likes to share, but she also likes the file. She has to choose. She looks at Ben. He looks sad. She looks at the file. It looks nice.
"OK, Ben, you can play with the file. But only for a little while. Then you have to give it back to me," Lily says.
"Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend. I will be careful with the file. I will not break it or lose it," Ben says.
Lily and Ben are happy. They play with the file and the other toys. They take turns and share. They have fun in the garden.
