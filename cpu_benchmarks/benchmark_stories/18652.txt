Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and twirl around in her pretty dress. One day, she went to the park and saw a boy with a shiny toy car. 
"Wow, that's a cool car!" said Lily.
The boy smiled and let her play with it. But then, a mean man came and stole the car from Lily's hands. 
"Hey, that's not fair!" cried Lily.
"Don't worry, you're lucky to have me as a friend," said the boy. "I'll dance with you and make you feel better."
So, they danced and twirled around together, forgetting about the stolen car. Lily was happy to have a kind friend like him.
