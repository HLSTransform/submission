Once upon a time, there was a horse named Brownie. Brownie lived in a stable with his friends. They ate hay and ran around the fields. One day, Brownie was feeling sad. His friend, Spot, asked him why he was sad. Brownie replied, "I want to be a good horse and run fast like the others."
Spot said, "Imagine you are already a good horse. You can do it!" Brownie thought about it and felt better. The next day, Brownie ran faster than ever before. His friends were amazed and cheered for him.
From that day on, Brownie knew that he could be a good horse if he believed in himself. He always remembered to imagine himself as a good horse, and he became the fastest horse in the stable. The moral of the story is that if you believe in yourself, you can be anything you want to be.
