Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to row in her boat. One day, she went out to row but she felt very sad because her boat was empty. She sat down and started to cry.
Her mother came over and asked, "Why are you crying, Lily?" 
"My boat is empty, and I have no one to row with me," Lily said.
Her mother hugged her and said, "Don't worry, I will row with you and we can comfort each other."
Lily stopped crying and smiled. She got into the boat with her mother and they rowed together. They talked and laughed, and Lily felt very happy. From that day on, Lily never felt empty again because she knew that her mother would always be there to comfort her.
