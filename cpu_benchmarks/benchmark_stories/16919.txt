Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. They see many flowers in the park. Sara likes the red flowers. Tom likes the yellow flowers.
"Look, Sara, yellow flowers!" Tom says. He runs to the flowers. He wants to pick one.
"Wait, Tom, stay here!" Sara says. She runs after him. She does not want him to pick the flowers. She knows the flowers are not for picking. They are for looking.
"Why, Sara, why?" Tom asks. He does not understand. He likes the flowers. He wants to have one.
"Because, Tom, because," Sara says. She catches him. She hugs him. She explains to him. "The flowers are great. They make the park pretty. They make the bees happy. They make the air smell good. If we pick the flowers, they will die. They will not be great anymore. They will be sad. We will be sad. Do you understand, Tom?"
Tom thinks for a moment. He nods. He understands. He does not want to make the flowers sad. He does not want to make Sara sad. He does not want to be sad. He smiles. He says, "Okay, Sara, okay. I will not pick the flowers. I will look at them. I will smell them. I will be happy. You will be happy. The flowers will be happy. We are all great."
Sara smiles. She is proud of Tom. He is a good friend. She says, "Yes, Tom, yes. You are right. We are all great. Come on, let's go play on the swings. Maybe we will see a rainbow. That will be great too."
They hold hands. They run to the swings. They have fun. They are happy. The flowers are happy. The park is happy. The day is great.
