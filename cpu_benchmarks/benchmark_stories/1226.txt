Once upon a time, there was a little otter. The otter was very cute and had gray fur. One day, the otter was swimming in the river when it saw a big fish. The otter wanted to catch the fish, but it didn't understand how to do it.
The otter asked its friends for help, but they didn't know how to catch the fish either. Then, a wise old otter came along and showed the little otter how to catch fish. The little otter was so happy and thanked the wise old otter. From that day on, the little otter understood how to catch fish and was never hungry again. The end.
