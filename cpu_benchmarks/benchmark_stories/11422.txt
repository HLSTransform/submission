Alyx excitedly rushed down to the underground railway. Her mother had warned her that it was a very competitive place, but Alyx was determined to give it her best try. On the way, she heard a loud whistle and saw some people rushing around, making loud noises.
When Alyx arrived, she was intimidated by the number of people who had already gathered. She saw them shouting and making signs with their hands. When she looked around uncertainly, a friendly looking man smiled at her and said, "What brings you here, little one?"
Alyx smiled back and said, "I want to join the competition!" 
The man laughed and gave her a pat on the head. "That's the spirit!" he said. He showed Alyx how to line up and encouraged her to give it her best try. 
Alyx was determined to win the competition, so she focused on the task and blocked out her surroundings. Much to her surprise, she ended up winning first place!
As Alyx happily rushed home to share the news of her victory with her mother, she was already looking forward to the next competition. She knew that with practice and a lot of hard work, she could be unstoppable!
