Tom and Sam were friends. They liked to play with their toys. Tom had many toys, but Sam had only one. Sam's toy was a soldier. He loved his soldier very much.
One day, Tom came to Sam's house. He saw Sam's soldier on the floor. He picked it up and said, "This is a nice toy. Can I have it?"
Sam was sad. He said, "No, you can't have it. This is my toy. I own it. It is my only toy."
Tom did not listen. He said, "I want it. I have many toys, but I don't have a soldier. Give it to me or I will hit you."
Sam was scared. He did not want to fight. He said, "Please, don't hit me. You can have it. But please, be kind to it. It is a mild soldier. It does not like to hurt anyone."
Tom took the soldier and ran away. He laughed and said, "Thank you, Sam. You are a fool. I have your toy now. I will do what I want with it."
Sam cried. He had no toy. He had no friend. He was alone. He wished he had his soldier back. He wished Tom was not mean. He wished he was happy. But he was not. He was sad. The end.
