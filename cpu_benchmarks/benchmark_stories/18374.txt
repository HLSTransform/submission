Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to spin around and around in her pretty dress. One day, Lucy went to the market with her mom. She saw lots of fruits like apples, bananas, and oranges.
Lucy saw a foolish monkey at the market. The monkey was playing with the fruit. He threw an apple in the air and spun around to catch it. Lucy laughed and said, "Silly monkey, you are so funny!"
The monkey liked Lucy and wanted to be her friend. So, he gave her a big, red apple. Lucy said, "Thank you, monkey!" Then, Lucy and the monkey spun around together, holding the apple high in the air. They had so much fun at the market that day.
