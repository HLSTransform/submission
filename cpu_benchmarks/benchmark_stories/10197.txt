One day, a little frog named Tim wanted to reach a big red ball. The ball was on the other side of the mud. Tim thought the ball looked yummy. He wanted to play with the ball and maybe even eat it.
Tim jumped into the mud to get the ball. The mud was sticky and wet. Tim hopped and hopped, but the mud was hard to move in. He tried to reach the ball, but it was too far away.
Tim was very sad. He could not reach the yummy red ball. The mud was too hard to hop through. Tim stayed stuck in the mud, and he never got the ball.
