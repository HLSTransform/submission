Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat butter on her toast every morning. One day, she went to the kitchen to get some butter, but she couldn't find it. She looked everywhere, but still couldn't find it. This made her worried because she really wanted her butter on her toast.
Suddenly, her little brother came into the kitchen and started to disturb her while she was looking for the butter. He was making loud noises and running around. Lily didn't like this because she was trying to find her butter. She asked her brother to stop disturbing her, but he didn't listen.
Finally, Lily found the butter and was very happy. She put it on her toast and enjoyed her breakfast. She was no longer worried and her brother stopped disturbing her. From that day on, Lily made sure to always put the butter back in the same spot so she wouldn't have to worry about not finding it again.
