Sam and Mommy were out for a walk. Sam looked up at Mommy and asked if they could go to the park. Mommy nodded and they soon arrived.
At the park, they could see kids running around, playing on the swings and slides. Sam wanted to join in, but Mommy said no. She said she wanted to teach him how to hang upside down on the monkey bars.
Sam looked up at the monkey bars, wanting to try and was filled with excitement. Mommy guided him along the bars, until he finally reached the top. With a smile, Sam hung upside down and felt so proud of himself. 
The other kids in the park watched and cheered him on. Everyone was so noisy, it made Sam smile even bigger. Mommy was so proud of him for learning a new trick!
