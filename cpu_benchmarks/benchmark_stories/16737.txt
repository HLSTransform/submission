Tom was a boy who liked to play with his toy cars. He had many cars of different colors and sizes. He liked to make them zoom and crash on the floor. He did not like to share his cars with anyone.
One day, his mom said she had a surprise for him. She brought him a big box with a bow on it. Tom was excited. He opened the box and saw a fluffy dog. The dog had a black spot on his eye. It looked like a patch. Tom's mom said the dog was his new friend. She said his name was Patch.
Tom did not want a dog. He wanted more cars. He did not introduce himself to Patch. He pushed the box away and ran to his room. He slammed the door and played with his cars. He did not hear Patch whimper.
Patch was sad. He wanted to play with Tom. He liked cars too. He sniffed the box and found a red car. He took it in his mouth and wagged his tail. He thought Tom would like to see his car.
He followed Tom's scent to his room. He scratched the door and barked. Tom heard him and got angry. He opened the door and saw Patch with his car. He yelled at Patch and tried to take his car back. Patch did not let go. He growled and shook his head. Tom and Patch pulled and tugged on the car. The car broke in half.
Tom and Patch stopped. They looked at the broken car. They both felt sorry. They realized they had been mean to each other. They dropped the car pieces and sniffed each other. They licked each other's faces. They became friends.
Tom's mom heard the noise and came to see what happened. She saw Tom and Patch cuddling on the bed. She smiled and said she was glad they got along. She said Patch was a wise dog. He knew how to make Tom happy. She gave them both a hug and a treat. She said they could go to the store and buy a new car. Tom and Patch wagged their tails. They were happy.
