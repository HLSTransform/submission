Once upon a time, there was a big, tall frog. He lived in a pond with other frogs. One day, a little frog came to the pond. The big frog didn't like the little frog and wanted to eat him. But the little frog was smart and tried to resist the big frog. He jumped and hopped and tried to get away. The big frog chased him, but the little frog was too quick. Finally, the little frog found a safe place to hide and the big frog gave up. From then on, the little frog was happy in the pond with his new friends.
