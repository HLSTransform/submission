Once upon a time there were two little ants, Tiny and Harry. Tiny was very small and Harry was a bit bigger. They were best friends and were always up for a challenge.
One day Tiny and Harry decided to race to the top of the hill to win a crown. Harry was really excited and said to Tiny "Let's race!" Tiny replied "Ok, I'm ready!"
The race began and Harry started running. He was going very quickly, but Tiny was patient and slowly made her way up the hill. In the end, Tiny was able to catch up with Harry, and they both reached the top of the hill.
When they got there, there was a beautiful crown just for them! It was gold and shone in the sun. Tiny and Harry could not believe how lucky they were. They put on the crown and hugged each other in celebration.
They were so proud that they decided to stay at the top of the hill and share the crown together. Tiny and Harry had the best day ever!
