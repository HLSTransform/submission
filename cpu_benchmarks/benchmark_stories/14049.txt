Once upon a time there was a boy. He went to a farm with his mommy and daddy. The farm had lots of animals, and lots of corn. The corn stood tall and waved in the sunshine.
The boy wanted to see the animals. So he ran around excitedly, looking for them. Then he saw it - a big calm cow, in the middle of the corn field. He was so excited! He said hello to the cow, but the cow didn't answer.
The boy kept saying "Hello". Then, to his surprise, the cow said "Moo"! The boy laughed and was so happy. He hugged the cow and said "Moo" too!
The cow and the boy both smiled at each other and said "Moo" some more. They kept repeating it, back and forth, until they both were calm and the corn rustled in the breeze. The boy and the cow were very happy. That was the end of the story.
