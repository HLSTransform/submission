Once upon a time, there was a big city with lots of buildings and cars. One day, a family went to the city to see the sights. They saw tall buildings and bright lights. But the little boy wanted to play. So, they went to a park with a big slide and swings. The boy had so much fun playing with other kids. Suddenly, a fierce wind blew and they had to go home. The end.
