Once upon a time, there was a little boy who really needed a spoon. He didn't have one anywhere, so he asked his mom for help.
His mom put on her funny hat and took him to the store. When they got there, the little boy saw lots of spoons and got so excited!
He ran to the Silver Spoon section and picked out a sparkly one with a handle shaped like a star. It was so pretty and so shiny, he wanted it right away!
His mom smiled and said he could have it. The little boy was so happy! He ran home with the spoon and he had lots of fun playing with it. 
The end.
