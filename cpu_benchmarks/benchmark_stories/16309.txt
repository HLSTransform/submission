Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. But one day, her little brother Max came and started making a lot of noise. Lily didn't like the noise and asked Max to stop, but he wouldn't listen.
Lily got upset and started crying. Her mom heard the noise and came to see what was going on. She asked Max to please stop making noise and told Lily that she needs to be organized and play in her room so that she can have some quiet time.
Lily listened to her mom and went to her room to play. She organized her toys and played quietly. Max also stopped making noise and played with his toys quietly. They both had a good time playing without any noise.
