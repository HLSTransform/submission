Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lizzy who was very shy. She had a little rock which she kept close to her all the time. 
One day, she was out in the garden when she noticed a door, so she decided to open it. Inside the door was a beautiful garden and she wanted to explore it.
Just as she was about to walk to the garden, an old man stopped her. He said, "You must lock the door if you want to go in". Lizzy was very scared, but she nodded and said, "Ok".
The old man gave her the key, and Lizzy took it and used it to lock the door. After the door was locked, she felt much braver. She looked around the garden, and noticed all the lovely flowers, of all different colours.
She spent the day exploring the garden, and when it was time to leave, she locked the door again with the key. She waved goodbye to the old man and ran off home, still clutching her rock. She was very happy that she had been brave enough to explore the garden.
