Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved shoes and he had a pair of red shoes that he wore every day. One day, Timmy's mom noticed that his red shoes were getting too small for him. She told Timmy that they needed to go to the store to buy new shoes. Timmy was very eager to get new shoes because he wanted to show them to his friends.
At the shoe store, Timmy's mom asked the salesperson to supply them with new shoes for Timmy. The salesperson brought out different shoes for Timmy to try on. Timmy tried on many shoes, but he didn't like any of them. Then, the salesperson brought out a pair of blue shoes. Timmy tried them on and he loved them! He was so happy to have new shoes.
Timmy's mom paid for the shoes and they left the store. Timmy was so excited to show his friends his new blue shoes. He ran all the way home, eager to show them off. When he got home, he put on his new shoes and ran outside to play with his friends. They all admired his new shoes and Timmy was very happy. From that day on, he wore his blue shoes every day.
