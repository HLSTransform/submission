Once there were two friends - Winnie the pig and Ty the cat. Ty was a brave cat but Winnie was very shy and scared. Until one day something strange happened.
Gently swaying in the wind was a beautiful velvet blanket. Ty and Winnie saw it and Ty was brave enough to try and settle it. But Winnie was so scared, she could only watch as Ty jumped after the blanket.
But as Ty went to get the blanket, something unexpected happened - Winnie suddenly grew brave! She took a deep breath and ran after the blanket and when she caught it, she felt proud.
But then the biggest surprise came - there was something very special inside the blanket! Winnie and Ty were both so excited to see that it was filled with sparkly jewels!
After that day, Winnie was no longer scared. She felt proud and happy that she had been brave enough to catch the blanket. And Ty didn't feel ashamed - he was just glad to have a brave friend!
