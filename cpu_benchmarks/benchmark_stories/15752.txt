Once upon a time there was a prince who was restless. He wanted to explore the world and see what was out there. One day, he decided to sail away and find some adventure. 
He packed his bag and set sail in his boat. The sun was shining and there was a gentle breeze. He sailed along the coast and saw all sorts of new animals and plants.
The prince passed a pink beach and said to himself, “I must explore this beach.” He stopped and stepped off the boat. As he walked, he noticed a little starfish crawling along the sand. He bent down and asked it, “Where are you going?”
The starfish replied, “To the sea, where I can play with my friends.”
The prince smiled and said, “You are so lucky. I wish I could join you.” 
The starfish answered, “You can! Just hop back on your boat and sail away.”
The prince thanked the starfish and sailed away. He explored lots of new places and had wonderful experiences. He was so happy that he sailed away.
