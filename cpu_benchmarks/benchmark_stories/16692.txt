Tom and Lily were going to fly in an aeroplane with their mum and dad. They were very excited, but also a bit scared. They had never been in an aeroplane before.
They got to the airport and waited in a long line. Then they gave their bags to a man who put them on a big belt. They walked through a metal gate that beeped. They showed their tickets to a lady who smiled and said, "Have a nice trip!"
They followed their mum and dad to a big window. They saw many aeroplanes outside. Some were white, some were blue, some were red. They looked for the one that had their number on it. They found it. It was a big white aeroplane with a blue tail.
"Look, there's our aeroplane!" Tom said.
"It's so big!" Lily said.
They heard a voice on a speaker. It said, "Please board the aeroplane now. The flight is ready to start."
They walked to a door and showed their tickets again. They went inside a long tube that led to the aeroplane. They found their seats and buckled their belts. They saw a lady in a blue dress who gave them a smile and a candy.
"Hello, I'm your flight attendant. Welcome to the aeroplane. Please listen to the safety instructions and enjoy your flight," she said.
They heard a loud noise. The aeroplane started to move. It went faster and faster. Then it lifted off the ground. Tom and Lily looked out the window. They saw the airport get smaller and smaller. They saw the clouds get closer and closer. They saw the sun get lower and lower.
"It's getting dark," Tom said.
"Are we going to sleep in the aeroplane?" Lily asked.
"Yes, we are. We're flying to a place where it's morning when we get there. It's called a different time zone," their mum said.
"What's a time zone?" Tom asked.
"It's a way of telling the time in different parts of the world. Some places are ahead of us, some places are behind us. We're going to a place that's ahead of us, so we have to sleep in the aeroplane and wake up when we get there," their dad said.
"That's funny," Lily said.
"It's fun, too. We're going to see new things and meet new people. We're going to have a great adventure," their mum said.
Tom and Lily nodded. They felt happy and curious. They closed their eyes and cuddled with their teddy bears. They fell asleep in the aeroplane, dreaming of the place where it was morning.
