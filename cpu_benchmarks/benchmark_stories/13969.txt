Once upon a time, there was a big race. All the animals wanted to win. The rabbit was fast, but the turtle was slow. The rabbit thought he would win easily.
But the turtle was friendly and asked the rabbit to slow down. The rabbit didn't want to slow down because he wanted to win. The turtle kept going and going, and the rabbit got tired.
In the end, the turtle won the race! He was so happy and felt a great victory. The rabbit learned that being friendly was more important than winning.
