Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Molly. She was three years old and loved adventure. One day, she decided to go exploring and try something new.
Molly walked in the woods to see what she could find. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise and saw a big bear! Molly was scared, but she knew that bears could be dangerous.
She wanted to get away, so she calmly asked the bear, "Please bear, can I go?" The bear gave a nod and Molly ran away. But as she was running, she got her finger stuck in a tree.
Molly didn't know what to do. She was stuck and the bear was coming. She started to cry. "Help me, please!" she shouted. All of a sudden, a rabbit came by and saw what was happening.
The rabbit quickly hopped over and started chewin on the wood of the tree. After a few minutes, the wood was weak enough and Molly was able to free her finger.
Molly was so happy and thanked the rabbit for saving her. She learnt a valuable lesson that day - always be careful and respectful when you're exploring, because some things can be dangerous!
