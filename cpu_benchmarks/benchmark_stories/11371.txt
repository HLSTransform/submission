Once upon a time there was a generous man. He wanted to show kindness to everyone around him. One day, he had a great mystery to solve. He worked hard to figure it out.
He began to search everywhere, trying to melt the mystery. Everywhere he searched he found nothing. He became very frustrated and angry.
Finally, he found the secret to the mystery. But before he could share the answer, the generous man melted away into thin air.
The mystery was never solved. The man was gone forever and no one ever found out the answer to the mystery. It was sad day indeed.
