Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play catch with a ball. They throw the ball to each other and run to get it. They laugh and have fun.
One day, they play catch in the park. They see a big dog. The dog is brown and furry. The dog likes the ball too. He runs after the ball and catches it in his mouth. He does not give it back.
"Hey, that is our ball!" Tom says. He tries to get the ball from the dog. But the dog is faster and stronger. He runs away with the ball.
"Come back, dog!" Sam says. He chases the dog. But the dog is too fast. He runs to the other side of the park.
Tom and Sam are sad. They want their ball back. They are also tired and sleepy. They sit on a bench and rest.
A lady comes to the park. She has a leash in her hand. She sees the dog with the ball. She calls the dog.
"Rex, come here! Drop the ball!" she says. The dog hears her voice. He knows she is his owner. He drops the ball and runs to her. He wags his tail.
The lady sees Tom and Sam. She smiles and walks to them. She gives them the ball.
"I'm sorry, boys. Rex loves to play with balls. He did not mean to take your ball. He just wanted to play with you," she says.
Tom and Sam are happy. They get their ball back. They thank the lady and Rex. They pet the dog. He licks their faces.
"Can we play catch with Rex?" Tom asks.
"Sure, if you want. Rex likes to make new friends," the lady says.
Tom and Sam smile. They play catch with Rex. They have more fun. They are not sad or sleepy anymore. They are glad.
