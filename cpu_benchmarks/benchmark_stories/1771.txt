Once upon a time there was a girl called Anna who lived in a small village. She was troubled and very lonely. The only thing she had was a little box with a tiny thread in it, which had been given to her by her mother.
One day, Anna went to the river to get some water. But when she looked inside her box, she saw the thread had melted away. She started to cry, feeling more lonely and troubled than ever.
That night, Anna went to sleep and dreamed of playing with the thread. But when morning came, she was still alone and still troubled.
The end.
