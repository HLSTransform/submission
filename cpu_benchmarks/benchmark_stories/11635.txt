Once upon a time, a little panda named Tommy lived in a tall tree. Tommy was very hungry, so he climbed higher and higher in the tree. He wanted to reach the highest branches so he could find something yummy to eat.
"I'm so hungry!" Tommy said to himself as he kept climbing.
Just then, an eagle flying in the sky called out to Tommy, "Hey little panda, why don't you come and soar with me?"
At first, Tommy was scared and he was hesitant to go. He wasn't sure if he could trust the eagle. "What if I get hurt?" he asked the eagle.
The eagle saw Tommy's hesitation and said, "Don't worry, I will hold you tight the entire time. Come soar with me and you'll start feeling better."
Finally, Tommy decided to trust the eagle and they soared through the sky together. Tommy was filled with joy and he forgot he had ever been so hungry. 
The eagle took Tommy all the way to a clearing in the forest. There, Tommy saw a berry bush he had been wanting to eat from. He thanked the eagle for taking him on the soaring journey, before running to the bush to eat his fill. 
Tommy had found a delicious snack and his hunger was gone. He felt brave and happy that he had trusted the eagle.
