Ben and Mia are friends. They like to play with their bikes in the park. Ben has a red bike and Mia has a blue bike. They have helmets to keep their heads safe.
One day, they see a big truck on the road. The truck is very noisy. It makes a loud honk. Ben and Mia are scared. They stop their bikes and cover their ears.
"Go away, truck!" Ben shouts. "You are too noisy!"
The truck does not go away. It comes closer and closer. Ben and Mia think the truck will hit them. They start to cry.
"Help, help!" Mia cries. "We need help!"
A man sees them. He runs to them. He is the truck driver. He is not mean. He is nice.
"Hi, kids," he says. "I'm sorry I scared you. I was just trying to say hello. I like your bikes and your helmets. They are very cool."
Ben and Mia stop crying. They look at the man. He has a big smile. He has a helmet too. It is yellow.
"Hello," Ben says. "You have a helmet too."
"Yes, I do," the man says. "I need it to drive the truck. It is very big and heavy. Do you want to see it?"
Ben and Mia nod. They are curious. They wipe their tears. They follow the man to the truck. He shows them the truck. He lets them sit in the driver's seat. He lets them honk the horn. It is still noisy, but not scary.
Ben and Mia are happy. They thank the man. They say goodbye to the truck. They go back to their bikes. They ride in the park. They are not afraid of the truck anymore. They are brave.
