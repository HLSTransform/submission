Once there was a boy, and he was only three years old. He had a lot of toy horses and one day he decided to take them to a stable.
When he arrived, it was very peaceful. He saw many animals and he even said hello to them.
The boy then began to play with his horses. He threw them around and galloped them around the stable. He played until he was tired and the peaceful stable welcomed him and made him feel very happy.
When the sun set, the boy took his horses and went home, very satisfied with his day. He knew that the stable was special and he would come back soon.
