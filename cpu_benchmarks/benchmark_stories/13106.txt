Once upon a time there was a very rare bird. The bird was different than the others, because it never got wet. It sang a soft, beautiful song and when other birds heard it, they wanted to know the secret of why the bird stayed so dry.
The bird told them the truth. The truth was that the bird's wings were coated with magical feathers that kept it from getting wet. The other birds were amazed and wanted their wings to be like the bird's, but it was too late. The feathers that the bird had were very rare and there were no more left.
So, the bird continued to fly around happily, never getting wet, singing its beautiful song for all to hear. It was a very special bird and everyone enjoyed hearing its song and watching it fly. 
The end.
