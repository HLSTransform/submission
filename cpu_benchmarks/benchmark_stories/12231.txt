Once upon a time, there lived three friends, a fox, a rabbit and a hippo.
The fox always thought things were too hard and gave up when things got difficult. 
The rabbit was always happy and thought things were very easy.
The hippo had lots of experience and was wise.
The three of them went on a journey together and the fox got stuck in a deep hole. The rabbit wanted to help the fox, but they could not figure out how to get him out. 
The hippo suggested the fox to remember how hard he worked in the past and to believe in himself. 
The fox followed the advice and soon managed to climb out of the hole.
The fox was happy and realized life was not so hard after all.
The three friends learned that together, and with effort, anything is possible with an easy mindset. 
The fox and the rabbit were thankful to the hippo and remembered the lesson forever.
