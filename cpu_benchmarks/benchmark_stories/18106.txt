Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a shiny jewel on the ground. It was so pretty and sparkly, she picked it up and held it in her hand. It was sharp on the edges, so she had to be careful not to hurt herself. 
Lily showed her mommy the jewel and her mommy was very proud of her. She told Lily that the jewel was very special and that she should keep it safe. Lily decided to put the jewel in a little orange box that she had in her room. 
Every day, Lily would look at the jewel in the orange box and smile. She loved how it sparkled in the light. She was so happy that she found it and knew that she would always treasure it.
