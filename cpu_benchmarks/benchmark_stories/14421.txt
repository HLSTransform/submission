Once upon a time, there was a clumsy mailman named Tim. He wore a blue uniform and carried a big bag of letters. One day, as he was walking down the street, he accidentally dropped a letter in a mailbox. 
Tim felt very embarrassed because he knew he had made a mistake. He tried to reach inside the mailbox to get the letter back, but he couldn't. Then, a little girl who was passing by saw what happened and offered to help. 
The little girl was very kind and managed to retrieve the letter from the mailbox. Tim was so grateful that he gave her a big hug. From that day on, Tim was more careful when delivering letters and never dropped any more in the mailbox again.
