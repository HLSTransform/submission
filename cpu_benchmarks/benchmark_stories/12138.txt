Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go to the store with her mommy and daddy. One day, they went to the store to buy some fruits. Lily saw some prunes and asked her mommy if they could buy some. Her mommy said yes, and they put some prunes in their cart.
While they were walking around the store, Lily saw a cute and adorable toy. She asked her daddy if they could buy it for her, but her daddy said they didn't have enough money. Lily was sad but her mommy told her that they could come back and buy it another day.
Finally, they went to the cashier and paid for their fruits, including the prunes. Lily was happy because she got to buy something she wanted. When they got home, they ate the prunes and they were delicious. Lily was so happy and felt so good that she hugged her mommy and daddy.
