Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to watch the television, especially the shows with animals. One day, he saw a wild lion on the screen and he wondered if he could see one in real life. 
Timmy asked his mom if they could go to the zoo to see the lions. His mom said yes, and they went to the zoo together. When they got there, they saw many animals, including the lions. Timmy was so happy to see them up close and he thought they were very wild and cool. 
After their trip to the zoo, Timmy went home and drew a picture of the lion he saw on the television and the one he saw at the zoo. He showed his mom the picture and she was very proud of him. Timmy was happy that he got to see the wild lions and he couldn't wait to go back to the zoo again.
