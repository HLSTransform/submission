One day, a little fish named Swimmy loved to swim. Swimmy was a reliable friend, always there to help. All the other fish liked Swimmy because he was kind and good at swimming.
Swimmy found a big desk in the water. He thought it was strange, but he wanted to show his friends. So he told them to follow him to see the big desk. They all swam together to find it.
When they got to the big desk, they were all very happy. They played around it and had lots of fun. Swimmy was glad he could show his friends the big desk, and they all knew they could count on him.
