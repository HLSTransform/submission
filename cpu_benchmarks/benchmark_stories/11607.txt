Once there was a boy, who like to step around. He had a bucket of paint. He always liked to paint things. He even liked to paint his walls.
One day he decided to step up the wall and paint it. He was so excited! But he was deaf, so he didn't hear the paint bucket fall from the wall. The paint spread everywhere, making a big mess. 
The boy was very sad. He had to clean it all up. He threw away all the paint, but he couldn't get it all out of the carpet. He was so sad.
The boy learned a lesson that day. He never stepped and painted again!
