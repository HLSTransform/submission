Once upon a time, there were three friends who loved to play together. One day, they saw a vehicle passing by and they all wanted to ride it. But the vehicle was only big enough for one of them. 
The first friend said, "I want to ride it because it's different from anything I've ever seen!" The second friend said, "I want to ride it because I want to hop around like a bunny!" The third friend said, "I want to ride it because I've never been on a vehicle before!"
They argued and fought over who should ride the vehicle until they realized that they were not being good friends. They decided to take turns riding the vehicle and have fun together. They learned that sharing and taking turns is important and that being different is what makes each of them special. From that day on, they had fun together and always took turns riding the vehicle.
