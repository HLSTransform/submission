Joe was hungry. He wanted an apple, but there wasn't one in sight. He walked by the park and heard somebody say "Look, I have a pistol". Joe was a little scared so he stepped back. Suddenly he heard something moving quickly in the grass. It was a rabbit! Joe stepped closer and the rabbit started to bite his feet. Joe shouted in pain.
Joe was angry now. He wanted the rabbit to stop. He asked the person with the pistol for help. The person was happy to help, and he shot the pistol into the sky. The rabbit ran away and Joe was relieved. 
Joe thanked the person and looked at the pistol. He asked if he could borrow the pistol so he could get an apple. The person said no, that it wasn't safe. Joe was still hungry, but he knew he had to find another way to get food. He thanked the person again, and continued his search for food.
