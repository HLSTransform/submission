Once upon a time there was a boy called John who was three years old. One day he was playing in the garden and was looking for something to do. Suddenly he saw a secret hiding place that looked different. He wanted to explore it, so he went inside.
John saw a box that he wanted to open but he couldn't. He asked his mummy, "Mummy, can you help me open the box? It looks very special and I want to find what is inside it." Mummy said, "John, that is an adult's secret and you need to respect that. Everyone should have their own secret."
John thought about it for a moment and then he said, "I understand. Everyone should have a secret and I will keep it safe."
The moral of this story is that everyone should respect other people's secrets. Even if we are curious, we should be kind and accept that not everyone wants to share what is special to them.
