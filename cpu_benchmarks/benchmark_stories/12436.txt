Once upon a time there was a young boy named Tom. Tom was very modest and always very nice to everyone.
One day while Tom was out walking, he noticed a thick layer of creamy white snow on the ground. Tom couldn't help but smile. He loved the snow! "Let's make a snowman!" he said out loud.
He started picking up the snow and rolling it into a ball. After a few minutes he had a big round snowball! He rolled it to another spot and did the same until he had 3 balls of snow. Then he put them all together.
Tom searched around for some decorations and found some rocks to use as eyes, a branch for the nose and finally a scarf to wrap around the snowman's neck.
Tom stepped back and smiled. He had made a very modest snowman.
He folded his hands and said a quiet prayer. "Thank you for giving me this snow. I wish the snowman could come to life and be my friend."
Suddenly there was a bright sparkle of light, and the snowman started moving! His eyes twinkled and he blinked at Tom.
"Can I have some cream please?" the snowman asked.
It was magical! Tom quickly ran inside the house and got some cream for the snowman. After they shared the cream, Tom hugged his new snowman friend, and they started to play.
