Bee and Ant are friends. They like to play in the sun and look for food. One day, they find a big hive full of honey. Bee is happy. He says, "This is my home. There is a lot of honey here. Do you want some?"
Ant is hungry. He says, "Yes, please. I love honey. Thank you for sharing with me." He follows Bee to the hive. They see many other bees working and buzzing. Ant is scared. He says, "Are they angry? Will they sting me?"
Bee says, "No, they are fine. They are my family. They make honey and take care of the hive. They will not hurt you if you are nice. Come, I will show you where the honey is." He leads Ant to a comb full of golden honey. He says, "Here, you can have some. But not too much. We need to save some for winter."
Ant says, "Okay, I understand. I will only take a little bit. It is very sweet and yummy. You are very kind, Bee. I am glad we are friends." He takes a small bite of honey and smiles. Bee smiles too. He says, "Me too, Ant. You are very brave and smart. We are different, but we can share and have fun. That is what friends do." They eat some honey and then go back to play in the sun. They are happy.
