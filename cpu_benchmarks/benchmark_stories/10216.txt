Once upon a time, there was a little goat named Billy. Billy lived on a farm with his mom and dad. They all loved to play and eat grass. One day, Billy found a bitter plant. He did not like it at all.
Billy went to his mom and said, "Mom, I ate a bitter plant. It tasted very bad." His mom told him, "Billy, don't eat that plant. It's not good for you." Billy listened to his mom and went to play with his friends.
Later, Billy's friend, Timmy, ate the bitter plant too. Timmy started to complain, "Yuck! This plant is so bitter!" Billy told Timmy, "My mom said not to eat that plant. It's not good for us." Timmy and Billy both learned their lesson and never ate the bitter plant again. They played happily ever after.
