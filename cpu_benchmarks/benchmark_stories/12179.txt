Jack and his mom went to the store one day to buy some new things. Jack was so excited to see all the different things at the store! He saw a switch and asked his mom what it was. She smiled and explained that it helps organize things. 
When they got to the checkout counter, Jack's mom said, "Let's buy the switch!" Jack smiled and watched as his mom paid for it.
On their way home, Jack asked his mom why she bought the switch. His mom explained to him that it helps to keep things organized. 
Back at home, Jack saw a chair and asked his mom if he could put the switch next to it. His mom said yes and Jack happily put the switch on the wall. He switched it on and off, over and over again, just for fun. 
From then on, Jack and his mom kept things organized with the help of the switch.
