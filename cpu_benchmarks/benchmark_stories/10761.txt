Once upon a time, there was a little crab who loved to crawl. He lived near the sea with his family. The crab thought his life was boring. He wanted to go on an adventure.
One day, the little crab said to his friend, the fish, "I want to crawl away from the sea. I think it is boring here." The fish did not agree, but the crab did not listen. He crawled away from the sea to find something more fun.
The crab crawled and crawled until he was far from the sea. He found a big road with many cars. The crab tried to crawl across the road, but a car came too fast. The little crab could not crawl back to the sea. The end.
