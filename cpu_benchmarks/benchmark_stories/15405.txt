Once upon a time, there was a very lucky family. One day, they decided to take a holiday and stayed at a hotel. The hotel was very nice and the family was very excited to complete their holiday there. 
Every day, the family would do something different, like going to the beach, playing mini golf, and even visiting the zoo. They had lots of fun and were having a great time. 
Finally, the time came for the family to complete their holiday. But before they left, they were so lucky! They received a gift from the hotel. It was a surprise for them, and it made them very happy. 
The family thanked the hotel for their special surprise and happily left. They had enjoyed their holiday very much, and had been very lucky that the hotel had given them the surprise.
