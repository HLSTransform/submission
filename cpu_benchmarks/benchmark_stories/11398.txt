Once upon a time, there lived a kite who dreamed of soaring.
The kite asked her friends, "Do you think I can soar in the sky?" 
Her friends replied, "Of course! You just need a big, strong wind to help you."
The kite awoke early one morning and looked out the window. She saw a beautiful day; the sky was blue and the wind was blowing and her dreams seemed closer than ever.
The kite tied her strings to a big tree and waited patiently; she felt the soft breeze blowing and soon she was airborne. For a few glorious moments she glided, soaring through the clouds and feeling the wind under her wings. 
Finally the kite came down and found herself at the edge of a smooth sea. She looked out and saw a path of beautiful blue stretching into the morning sky. 
Smiling, the kite knew that this was the moment she had dreamed of her whole life. She took a deep breath and let the wind take her, soaring over the sea until she couldn't be seen anymore.
