Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, they decided to play a game of tag. Timmy was so excited to play that he rushed to the park.
When he got to the park, he saw a big barrel. It was so big that he could climb inside of it. The barrel was smooth and shiny. Timmy thought it was so cool.
As he was playing tag with his friends, he accidentally bumped into the barrel and it started rolling. Timmy tried to stop it, but it was too heavy. The barrel rolled all the way down the hill and into the pond. Timmy and his friends laughed and had so much fun watching the barrel float in the water.
