One day, a pretty cat named Lily went for a walk. She saw a big dog named Max. Max said, "Lily, come to my lecture later!" Lily was happy and said, "Yes, I will come!"
At the lecture, Max talked about how to zip up coats. All the animals listened and learned. Lily thought, "I will use this when it gets cold."
Later, it was cold and windy. Lily remembered Max's lecture. She zipped up her coat and felt warm. She was glad she went to Max's lecture and learned something new.
