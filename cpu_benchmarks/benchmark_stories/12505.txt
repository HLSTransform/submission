Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had a pony named Sparkles. Sparkles was a very sleepy pony and loved to take naps in the sun. One day, Lily went to the barn to see Sparkles and found her sleeping.
"Sparkles, wake up!" said Lily.
Sparkles slowly opened her eyes and yawned. "Oh, hello Lily. I was having a nice dream."
"What were you dreaming about?" asked Lily.
"I was dreaming about running through a field of flowers," said Sparkles. "I love to run and play."
"I remember when we went on a ride together," said Lily. "That was so much fun."
Sparkles smiled. "Yes, it was. We should do it again soon."
And so, Lily and Sparkles spent the rest of the day playing and having fun together.
