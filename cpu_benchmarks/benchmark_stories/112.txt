Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play dress-up. She had a unique dress that her mom made just for her. It was so pretty and sparkly, and Lily loved to wear it every day. 
One day, Lily's mom told her that they were going to a play. Lily didn't know what a play was, but she was excited to go. When they got there, the room was dark, but the stage was lit up with bright lights. 
Lily watched as the actors on stage pretended to be different characters. They would act like they were happy, sad, or scared. Lily thought it was so cool how they could pretend to be someone else. 
After the play was over, Lily told her mom that she wanted to be an actor when she grew up. Her mom smiled and said that Lily could be anything she wanted to be. And with that, Lily went home, still wearing her unique dress, dreaming of the day she could act on stage too.
