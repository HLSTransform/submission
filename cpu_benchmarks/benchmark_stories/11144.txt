Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the backyard with his dog, Spot. One day, Timmy found a treasure map in his backyard. The map showed a big X where the treasure was buried. 
Timmy was so excited! He and Spot started digging and digging until they found a box. Inside the box, there was a note that said, "The real treasure is the friends you make along the way." 
Timmy didn't understand what the note meant, but his mom explained it to him. She said that sometimes we get so focused on finding things that we forget about the people around us. Timmy realized that he had been so focused on finding the treasure that he hadn't even played with Spot. 
He decided to bury the treasure again and play with Spot instead. Timmy was ready to have fun with his best friend.
