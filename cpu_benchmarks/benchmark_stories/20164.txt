Lily and Ben were bored. They wanted to play, but it was raining outside. They asked their mom if they could go to the attic. Mom said yes, but be careful. There were many old things in the attic.
Lily and Ben climbed the stairs. They saw a big box. They opened it. They found many toys and clothes. They tried them on. Lily put on a dress. It was red and shiny. She looked at herself in a mirror. She felt attractive. Ben put on a hat. It was black and had a feather. He felt funny.
They heard a noise. It was a mouse. It ran out of the box. Lily and Ben screamed. They were scared. They wanted to remove the dress and the hat. But they could not. The dress and the hat were stuck. They were too small for them. They pulled and pulled. But they only ripped the dress and the hat.
Mom heard them scream. She ran to the attic. She saw them in the torn dress and hat. She was angry. She said, "What have you done? These were grandma's things. They were very old and precious. You have ruined them. You are very naughty. You have to go to your room. No more playing for you today."
Lily and Ben cried. They were sorry. They did not know. They followed mom to their room. They felt sad. They had no toys and no clothes. They had a bad ending.
