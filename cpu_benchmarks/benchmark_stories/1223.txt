Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big dog named Max. Max was very useful because he would always protect Lily when she was scared. 
One day, Lily wanted to feed Max some yummy treats. She went to the store and bought some bones and biscuits for him. Max was so happy and wagged his tail a lot. 
After feeding Max, Lily decided to name him her best friend. She loved Max a lot and knew he would always be there for her. 
From that day on, Lily and Max did everything together. They played, ate, and slept together. Lily was very happy to have such a useful and loyal friend like Max.
