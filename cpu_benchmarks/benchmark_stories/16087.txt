Dave was walking down the street to his friend's house. He was so excited to see her, and he couldn't wait! He wanted to turn the corner quickly to get there. But when he got to the corner, he noticed something wide and tall in his way. It was a giant yellow wall!
Dave was confused. He couldn't understand why the wall was there. He wanted to get to his friend's house, but he didn't know how he'd get over it. Then, he heard a voice from above the wall.
"Help me!" the voice yelled.
Dave yelled back and asked what happened.
The voice said that he was stuck on top of the wall and needed someone to help him down. Dave thought of a plan. He grabbed a stick and used it to help bring the person down.
The person thanked Dave and finally they were reunited. Dave was happy that he could help and that he could now turn the corner to his friend's house!
