Bert saw the shiny robot and wanted it right away! He had never seen a robot before and knew that he just had to have it. He asked his mom if he could buy it and she told him they would see. 
Bert asked his dad to come see the robot and he reluctantly agreed. When they went to the store, the robot seller showed them a clear robot. It was sparkly and Bert knew he had to have it. The seller asked for a lot of money, but Bert's dad said no. 
Bert was very sad but his mom said that if he saved his allowance for the next month he would get the robot. So, Bert worked hard to save his money so that he could buy the robot. 
Finally, a month later Bert had earned enough money. He asked his mom to take him to the store, but she said that the seller had already sold the robot. Bert was disappointed, but his mom had a surprise. She had quietly asked the seller to hold the robot and they had gone back to the store to buy it. 
Bert was very excited and hugged his mom. They went home with the shiny and clear robot and Bert was so happy to have it.
