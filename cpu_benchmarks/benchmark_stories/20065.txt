Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved the color pink and had a pink dress that she wore all the time. One day, Lily went to the park to play. She saw a boy who didn't have any friends to play with. Lily knew it wasn't kind to leave someone alone, so she went over to him and asked if he wanted to play with her. 
The boy was happy and they played together for a while. Lily noticed that the boy's shirt was also pink, just like her dress! She thought it was funny and they laughed together. After a while, it was time for Lily to go home. She said goodbye to the boy and gave him a big hug. 
Lily was happy that she could be kind to someone who needed a friend. She skipped all the way home, thinking about her new friend and how they both liked the color pink. It was a wonderful day at the park!
