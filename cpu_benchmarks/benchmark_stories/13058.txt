Dave was very fearful. He had just been invited to a special meeting. He was not sure why they asked him to come, but he was very anxious.
When it was time to go, Dave was shaking. He entered the room and saw many people there. He wanted to turn around and leave, but he was too scared.
He noticed everyone was looking at him. He wanted to disappear.
But then he felt a gentle hand on his shoulder. He looked up and saw a kind smile. It was Peter. Peter admired Dave for coming to the meeting. Dave felt better after he met Peter. 
Everyone in the room admired Dave for having the courage to come. Dave finally smiled. He was very happy and proud that day.
