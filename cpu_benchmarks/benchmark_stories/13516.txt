Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books and had a big bookshelf in her room. One day, Lily's mom came into her room and saw that the bookshelf was very dirty. 
"Lily, your bookshelf is so dirty! We need to clean it," said her mom.
"I love my bookshelf, but it is dirty. Let's clean it together," replied Lily.
So, Lily and her mom cleaned the bookshelf together. They took all the books off and wiped it down with a cloth. When they were finished, the bookshelf looked shiny and new. 
"I love my bookshelf even more now that it's clean," said Lily with a big smile. 
From that day on, Lily made sure to keep her bookshelf clean so that it would always look nice.
