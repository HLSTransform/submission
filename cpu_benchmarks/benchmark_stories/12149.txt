Once upon a time, there was a jeep. The jeep lived in the woods and was rarely seen by the people who lived near by. One day, the jeep went off and the people who lived near by heard a loud sound from far away.
The people asked each other, "what was that loud sound?" and nobody could answer. As days passed, the loud sound kept growing louder. 
The sound grew louder and louder, until one day, a little boy said, "It sounds like something is roaring!"
Each time the jeep ventured out, the roar grew louder and harsher. Everyone was scared and confused and did not know what the loud roaring was coming from. 
One day, the jeep ventured out, but this time there was something different. This time, the roar was even more harsh and powerful - it sounded like it was coming from a huge animal!
The little boy said, "It's a lion!" and everyone was so scared. Suddenly, the jeep came back and everyone saw it had a huge lion in it. 
Everyone was so amazed, but they understood that the roaring they had heard before was the lion. They were so glad the jeep had brought the lion back peacefully. 
The end.
