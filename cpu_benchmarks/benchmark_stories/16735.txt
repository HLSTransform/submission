Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to pretend they were knights and princesses. Tom had a sack and a sword. Lily had a crown and a dress.
"Let's go and fight the dragon!" Tom said. He put the sack on his back and held the sword in his hand. "You can be the princess and I will save you."
"OK, but where is the dragon?" Lily asked. She followed Tom to the shed. "Is he in there?"
Tom nodded. He opened the door and saw a big, black dog. The dog was sleeping on a pile of old clothes. Tom thought the dog looked like a dragon. He shouted, "There he is! The crazy dragon!"
The dog woke up and barked. He did not like Tom's noise. He jumped off the clothes and ran towards Tom. Tom was scared. He dropped the sword and the sack and ran away. Lily ran after him.
"Tom, wait!" Lily called. "That's not a dragon, that's Max! He's our neighbor's dog. He's friendly, not crazy."
Tom stopped and looked back. He saw Max wagging his tail and licking Lily's face. He felt silly. He went back to the shed and picked up his sword and his sack.
"Sorry, Max," Tom said. "I thought you were a dragon. Do you want to play with us?"
Max barked happily. He liked to play. Tom and Lily smiled. They decided to make Max their pet dragon. They put the sack on his back and the sword on his side. They gave him a name tag that said, "Max the Dragon".
They had fun playing in the garden. They forgot about being knights and princesses. They were happy to have a new friend.
