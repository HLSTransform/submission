One day, a big boy named Tom found a wallet on the floor. He felt lucky because the wallet had a lot of money inside. Tom wanted to buy a new toy with the money. So, he went to the toy store.
At the store, Tom met his friend, Sue. Sue saw the wallet and said, "Tom, that's not your wallet. You should find the person who lost it and give it back."
Tom thought about it and decided Sue was right. So, they went to the park to look for the person who lost the wallet. They saw an old man sitting on a rocking chair. The old man looked sad.
Tom asked the old man, "Did you lose a wallet?" The old man said, "Yes! I lost my wallet today." Tom gave the wallet back to the old man. The old man was very happy and said, "Thank you, Tom! You are a good boy."
Tom felt happy too. He knew that doing the right thing was better than buying a new toy.
