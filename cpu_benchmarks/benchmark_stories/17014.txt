Tim and Sam are brothers. They like to play with cars and blocks. But sometimes they fight. One day, Tim is mad at Sam. He thinks Sam is stupid. He wants to show Sam he is smarter.
Tim has a plan. He goes to the kitchen. He sees a plate on the table. The plate has a cake on it. The cake is for Mom's birthday. Tim takes the plate. He runs to his room. He hides the plate under his bed.
Sam sees Tim run. He is curious. He follows Tim. He knocks on the door. "What are you doing?" he asks. Tim does not answer. He is quiet. Sam opens the door. He looks around. He sees the plate under the bed. He is surprised.
"Tim, what is that?" he says. He points at the plate. Tim smiles. He thinks he is clever. He says, "This is a plate. It has a cake on it. The cake is for Mom's birthday. I took it. I will eat it. You are stupid. You do not know what a plate is."
Sam is angry. He thinks Tim is mean. He says, "Tim, you are wrong. I know what a plate is. A plate is for holding food. You do not eat a plate. You eat the food on the plate. You are stupid. You do not know what a cake is."
Tim is confused. He does not understand. He says, "What do you mean? A cake is a cake. It is sweet and soft. You can eat it. It is yummy."
Sam shakes his head. He says, "No, Tim. A cake is not just a cake. A cake is a gift. A gift is something you give to someone you love. You do not take a gift. You do not eat a gift. You share a gift. Mom made the cake for us. She loves us. We love her. We should give her the cake. We should say happy birthday. We should be nice. That is what a cake is."
Tim feels bad. He realizes he made a mistake. He says, "Oh, Sam. I am sorry. I did not know. I was silly. I do not want to eat the cake. I want to give it to Mom. I love Mom. I love you. Can you forgive me?"
Sam smiles. He says, "Yes, Tim. I forgive you. You are my brother. We can be friends. Come on. Let's take the plate back to the kitchen. Let's clean it. Let's put the cake on it. Let's surprise Mom. Let's say happy birthday. Let's be happy."
Tim and Sam hug. They take the plate. They go to the kitchen. They see Mom. They say, "Mom, we have something for you. We love you. Happy birthday!" They show her the plate. They show her the cake. Mom is happy. She hugs them. She says, "Thank you, Tim and Sam. You are so sweet. You are so smart. You are my best gifts. I love you." They eat the cake. They share the cake. They are happy. The end.
