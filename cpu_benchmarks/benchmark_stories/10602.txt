Mama and Son were in the kitchen. Mama had a clear mug in her hand. She said "I am going to bring some water in this mug".
Son was curious. He asked "Can I bring it?"
Mama smiled and said "Yes, you can bring it."
So, Son took the mug carefully in his small hands. He carefully carried it to the sink. He pulled on the handle to let the water flow inside the mug. Mama smiled and said "Good job".
Then, Mama took the full mug from Son. She looked inside to make sure the water was clear.
"Perfect," she said, "Now we can drink".
