Once upon a time, there lived an adventurous little girl. She was wild and loved exploring. One day, she decided to go for a walk in the woods.
As she was walking along, the little girl surprised a big piece of steel. It was shiny and new. She was so curious and she wanted to know what it was.
Just then, a scary bear stepped out from the bushes. It was a wild bear and it was very angry.
The little girl was scared and she didn't know what to do. Then she remembered the big steel piece she had found and quickly grabbed it.
The bear stepped closer and roared. The little girl held up the steel, and the bear was scared away.
The little girl was so brave and was pleased with her surprise discovery! She held onto the steel and went back home, very relieved.
