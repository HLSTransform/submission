Sara likes to bake with her mom. They make cakes and pies and cookies. Sara likes to mix and stir and pour. She likes to lick the spoon and smell the yummy things in the oven.
One day, Sara and her mom bake a big cake for dad's birthday. They put frosting and sprinkles and candles on it. Sara is very proud of the cake. She wants to show it to dad when he comes home.
But while they wait, Sara hears a noise outside. She looks out the window and sees an owl. The owl is brown and white and has big eyes. Sara thinks the owl is pretty. She wants to say hello to the owl.
She opens the door and goes outside. She brings the cake with her. She thinks the owl might like some cake too. She walks to the tree where the owl is sitting. She says, "Hi, owl. Do you want some cake?"
The owl looks at Sara and the cake. The owl is hungry. The owl likes cake. The owl swoops down and grabs the cake with its claws. The owl flies away with the cake. Sara is sad. She says, "Bye, owl. Bye, cake."
Mom hears Sara crying. She comes outside and sees what happened. She hugs Sara and says, "It's okay, Sara. We can bake another cake. The owl was just hungry. Maybe he will share the cake with his friends."
Sara feels better. She says, "Okay, mom. Let's bake another cake. A great cake. A cake that the owl can't take." Mom smiles and says, "Yes, let's do that. A great cake for a great dad." They go inside and bake another cake. They have fun and laugh. They hope dad will like the cake. They hope the owl will like his cake too.
