Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and eat yummy snacks. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to help her make dinner. She gave him a big bowl of potatoes and asked him to add some salt. Timmy grabbed the salt shaker and turned it upside down, shaking it over the potatoes. 
Suddenly, Timmy heard a loud noise outside. He looked out the window and saw a nosy squirrel trying to steal some food from the bird feeder. Timmy ran outside and scared the squirrel away. When he came back inside, he noticed that the potatoes were too salty. He told his mom what happened and they both laughed. Timmy learned that sometimes it's important to pay attention to what you're doing so you don't make mistakes.
