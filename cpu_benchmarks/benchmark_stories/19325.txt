Once upon a time there was a long avocado. It was very happy because it loved the sun and grew bigger every day. One day, a bird saw the avocado and wanted to shoot it. The bird was going to eat the avocado. 
The avocado was sad at first and didn't know what to do. Then, it had an idea. It remembered a bird it had seen the day before and tried to look like it. Suddenly, the avocado started to flap, just like the bird!
The bird was so surprised that it flew away. The avocado was happy and thanked the sun for the long days of heat and light. It flew away, far away, and was never shot again.
