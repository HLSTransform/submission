Once upon a time there was an old crocodile. He lived in a pond in a big forest. Everywhere he went he saw lots of animals but he never recognized them. He had never seen anyone else like himself.
One day, while he was swimming in the pond, he saw something familiar. It was another crocodile! The old crocodile was so happy. He swam closer to take a better look and the other crocodile began to move its tail. He recognized it was a friend.
The old crocodile was so happy. He swam around the pond with his new friend. Everywhere they went, the other animals would come and say hello to the two crocodiles. Now he was not alone anymore!
