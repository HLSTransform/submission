Once upon a time there was a tiny peach. He was an unusual peach because he loved to slide. He would slide on the grass and up and down hills.
One day, he decided he wanted to slide even higher in the sky. He decided to make a big slide that began at the top of a tree.
So the little peach gathered some branches and branches and put them together to make a slide. Then he climbed the tree and the slide started.
He slid down the tree, faster and faster. It was the most fun he had ever had. He went so high he was almost at the sky!
The little peach slid until he reached the bottom and then he rolled away. He had had so much fun sliding, he knew he wanted to do it again tomorrow!
