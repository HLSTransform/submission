There was a family who lived a happy, healthy life. One day, the youngest son wanted a snack before dinner. His mother refused, saying he needed to wait until dinner. The young boy was very angry and upset. He ran out of the house and started shouting in the street.
The police came soon and asked what was wrong. The young boy refused to tell them, so they said they would have to take him home. The young boy started to cry and said that he just wanted a snack.
The police officers understood the situation and told the boy's parents to encourage a healthy lifestyle. They said that the young boy could have a healthy snack before dinner. His parents reluctantly agreed and the young boy smiled.
