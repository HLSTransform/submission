Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved trucks, especially colorful ones. He liked to watch them drive by his house.
One day, Timmy saw a big, colorful truck parked outside his house. He walked up to the truck and said, "Hi, truck! You are so pretty!"
The truck spoke back to Timmy, "Thank you, little boy! I am carrying lots of toys for children to play with."
Timmy was so happy to hear the truck speak to him. He asked the truck if he could see the toys. The truck opened its back door and Timmy saw lots of colorful toys inside. He picked out a toy car and played with it all day long.
From that day on, Timmy always said hello to the colorful truck when it drove by his house. The truck would always speak back to him and Timmy knew that they were friends forever.
