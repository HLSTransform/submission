Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wander around her neighborhood and explore new places. One day, she found a magic word on the ground. It was a word that she had never heard before, but it made her feel comfortable and happy.
Lily picked up the word and put it in her pocket. As she continued to wander, she noticed that the word was glowing. She wondered what could happen if she said the word out loud. But she decided to wait until she found a special place to say it.
Finally, Lily found a beautiful garden full of flowers. She sat down on a comfortable bench and took out the magic word from her pocket. She closed her eyes and said the word out loud. Suddenly, the flowers started to dance and the birds started to sing. Lily knew that the magic word had made everything around her more beautiful. From that day on, Lily always kept the magic word with her as she continued to wander and explore.
