Once there was a man and a woman. The man and woman were rushing to the beach. They wanted to catch shrimp!
When they got there, they took out their net. It was very flexible! They dipped it into the ocean and waited.
Suddenly they felt a tug on the net. The woman pulled it up and sure enough, there were lots of shrimp in it! They were so excited!
The man and woman kept on rushing around the beach. They caught so many shrimp! Then, they had a big feast. Everyone was so happy and full.
The End!
