Lily liked to draw on pages with her crayons. She had many colors and shapes to make. She drew a sun, a flower, a cat and a house. She was happy with her pictures.
But then, her brother Max came and took her pages. He said they were his and he wanted to play with them. Lily was angry and said no. She wanted her pages back. Max ran away with them and Lily chased him.
Max went to the kitchen and saw a candle on the table. He had a bad idea. He wanted to burn Lily's pages and make her cry. He held one page over the flame and watched it turn black and curl. He laughed and said, "Look, Lily, your sun is gone!"
Lily saw what he was doing and screamed. She was scared and sad. She ran to the candle and tried to grab her pages. But the fire was hot and it hurt her hand. She cried and said, "Stop, Max, stop! You are mean and bad!"
Mom heard the noise and came to the kitchen. She saw the fire and the smoke and the tears. She was angry and scared too. She put out the fire and took the pages from Max. She said, "Max, what have you done? You could have hurt yourself and Lily and the house! You are in big trouble, mister!"
She hugged Lily and checked her hand. It was red and sore, but not too bad. She said, "Lily, I'm sorry your pages are ruined. They were very pretty and flexible. You can make new ones later. Are you okay, sweetie?"
Lily nodded and sniffed. She said, "I'm okay, Mom. But I don't like Max. He is mean and bad."
Mom said, "Max is your brother and he loves you, but he made a very bad choice. He needs to say sorry and learn to share and be nice. Come on, let's go to the living room and have some cookies and milk. And Max, you come too. You need to talk to me and Lily and apologize."
