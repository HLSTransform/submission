One day a little boy named Will went to play outside. It was Wednesday and he was very excited. He was singing and jumping around when he noticed something smelly. It was an old rotten log! He bent down to take a closer look and noticed lots of little bugs. He thought it was cool and he began to sing to them. The bugs moved and danced to Will's song. When he sang louder, more bugs would join the group. Will kept singing and dancing until nightfall, when his mom called him inside for dinner. Will said goodbye to the bugs and made a promise to sing to them again the next Wednesday.
