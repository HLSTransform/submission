Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends saw a big truck with lots of equipment. They went to see what it was for.
A kind man told them that the equipment was for a circus. Lily and her friends were very excited! They asked the man if they could see the circus. The man said yes and gave them lovely tickets.
At the circus, Lily saw a clown who could stretch his arms very long. She thought it was funny and laughed a lot. After the show, Lily and her friends went to say thank you to the kind man. They told him that they had a lovely time at the circus. The man was happy to hear that and gave them some popcorn to eat on the way home.
