One day, there was a tornado. It was loud and exciting. The wind sprayed a lot of water everywhere. Nobody wanted to go outside because it was too dangerous. Everyone stayed inside and watched the tornado go by.
It was very boring inside. The little boy was getting sleepy from watching the tornado. He decided to try something different. He opened the window and stuck his head out. He saw the wind spraying the water around. 
The little boy liked it so much that he started to spray the water himself. He had so much fun. He was spraying water everywhere. He sprayed water on his mom, his dad, and even his dog. They all laughed, and the tornado seemed less scary all of a sudden. The little boy was having a great time. 
The tornado finally left and the little boy stopped spraying. Everyone went outside and had a wonderful time. They laughed and played and talked about the tornado. Nobody thought it was boring anymore.
