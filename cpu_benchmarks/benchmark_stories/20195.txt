Anna and Ben love to play with blocks. They like to make stacks of different colors and shapes. Sometimes they pretend they are building ancient castles or towers.
One day, they found a big box of blocks in the attic. They were very happy and excited. They took the box to their room and opened it. Inside, there were many blocks they had never seen before. They were old and dusty, but very beautiful. They had letters and pictures on them.
"Wow, look at these blocks!" Anna said. "They are so pretty. I wonder what they say."
"Maybe they are from a long time ago," Ben said. "Maybe they are ancient blocks. Let's make a stack with them."
They started to sort the blocks by color and shape. They found some that were red and square, some that were blue and round, some that were yellow and starry, and some that were green and triangular. They also found some that were white and had no shape at all.
They decided to make a stack with the white blocks first. They put them one on top of another, trying to balance them. They made a very tall stack that reached the ceiling.
"Look, we made an ancient tower!" Anna said. "It's so high. I wonder what it means."
"Maybe it's a secret code," Ben said. "Maybe it tells a story. Do you want to hear it?"
"Yes, please," Anna said.
Ben looked at the blocks and made up a story. He said, "Once upon a time, there was a king and a queen who lived in an ancient castle. They had many blocks like these, and they used them to write messages to each other. They loved each other very much, and they always said 'I love you' with the blocks. They put them on their pillows, on their tables, on their walls, and on their roofs. They made stacks of love everywhere. They were very happy and lived for a long time."
Anna clapped her hands and said, "That's a beautiful story, Ben. I love it. And I love you, too."
She hugged him and said, "You are my best friend."
They smiled and looked at their stack of love. They felt very happy and proud. They decided to make more stacks with the other blocks, and to tell more stories. They played for a long time, until their mom called them for dinner. They put the blocks back in the box and carried it downstairs. They thanked their mom for the blocks and told her about their ancient tower. She smiled and said, "I'm glad you had fun. And I love you, too."
