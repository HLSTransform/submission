Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. One day, Lucy was feeling very brave, so she decided to go exploring. She went into the kitchen and opened the fridge. Inside, she saw something very scary. It was a big, black spider!
Lucy didn't want to stay near the scary spider, so she decided to send it away. She carefully grabbed it with a tissue and took it outside. Once outdoors, she opened the tissue and watched as the spider scurried away.
Feeling happy and relieved, Lucy went back to the kitchen. She knew she had been very brave, so she decided to celebrate by getting something to eat. She opened the fridge and saw a delicious surprise: chocolate cake! She had a big slice and enjoyed every bite.
Soon, it was time to go to bed. Lucy thanked her lucky stars that the spider was gone and smiled to herself as she headed off to her bedroom. This had been a very exciting and scary day but she was so brave!
