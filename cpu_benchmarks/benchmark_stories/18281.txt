Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside with his friends, but one day it was too hot to play. Timmy's mom said, "Let's relax inside and watch a movie." Timmy agreed and they went inside to watch a movie.
As they watched the movie, Timmy's mom said, "I wish we had some popcorn." Timmy remembered that his dad had bought some popcorn earlier that day. He said, "I'll go get it!" and ran to the kitchen.
When Timmy got to the kitchen, he saw that the popcorn bag was on top of the fridge. He tried to reach it, but he was too short. Timmy thought for a moment and then got a chair to stand on. He was able to reach the popcorn and brought it back to his mom.
They enjoyed the movie and the popcorn together while they relaxed. Timmy felt proud that he was able to help his mom and get the popcorn. From then on, he always remembered to check if there was popcorn before they watched a movie.
