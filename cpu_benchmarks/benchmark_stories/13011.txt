One day, it started to rain. Big droplets of water fell gently from the sky and wet the ground. Every patch of land was touched by the rain.
Two children, Jack and Lucy, stood out on the porch. They were curious about the rain. They watched as it pattered everywhere. The two of them were so impatient, they couldn't wait to go out and explore!
Jack and Lucy jumped up and down in excitement. They ran outside, into the wet grass, and started spinning in circles. They chased each other around, laughing and screaming. They couldn't get enough of the rain!
Finally, the rain stopped. Now the two of them were very wet but also very happy. In the garden, they found a very special patch. It was filled with green plants and colorful flowers. They both jumped in, squishing into the soft mud and giggling away.
