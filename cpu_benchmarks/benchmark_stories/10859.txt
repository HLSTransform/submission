Once upon a time, there was a cat named Fluffy. Fluffy was very sleepy and needed to take a nap. So, Fluffy went to his bed and took a nap. While Fluffy was napping, his owner came in and wanted to play with him. But Fluffy was still napping, so his owner decided to play with a match instead. 
But playing with matches is very dangerous and stupid. Soon, the match caught on fire and the owner got scared. Fluffy woke up from his nap and saw the fire. He quickly ran to his owner and meowed loudly. His owner understood and quickly put out the fire. From then on, Fluffy's owner never played with matches again and Fluffy continued to take his naps. The end.
