Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw pictures of animals and flowers. One day, she drew an image of a big, yellow sun in the sky.
Lily felt happy and proud of her drawing. She showed it to her friends at school. They all said it was pretty.
But then, Lily's little brother came along and scribbled all over her picture. Lily felt angry and foolish for leaving it out where he could reach it.
She tried to fix the picture, but it was ruined. Lily felt sad and upset. She didn't want to show her friends anymore. They would think she was a bad artist.
In the end, Lily threw her drawing away and never drew again. She felt like a fool for thinking she was good at something.
