One night the lightning arrived. It was a big flash across the sky. Everyone saw it and was afraid. 
Then an elderly man arrived. He had a big smile on his face and waved to everyone. Everyone stopped being scared. The elderly man said that the lightning was here to help make the world a better place. 
He said that lightning brings new ideas and hope to make the world brighter. Everyone smiled and felt happy. They all thanked the elderly man for his words and he smiled back. 
The next day, the sky was brighter and everyone knew the lightning had arrived to help them.
