Mrs. Jones sighed and looked around her living room. Everywhere she looked, rice was scattered across the floor. She had no idea what happened and turned to her son, Tom.
"Tom, did you do this?" asked Mrs. Jones.
Tom shrugged and looked down at his feet. He opened his mouth to speak but closed it again, not sure of what to say.
Mrs. Jones smiled and shook her head. "You can tell me, Tom," she said.
Tom sighed and shrugged his shoulders again. But Mrs. Jones saw something playful in his eyes. She gave him a warning look and said, "This had better not happen again, young man."
Little did Mrs. Jones know that, soon enough, the rice would come back in a much more playful form. The next morning, Tom presented Mrs. Jones with a big bowl of rice filled with colorful fruit and small toys hidden in it. 
Mrs. Jones smiled, surprised at the creative use of the rice, and scooped up a handful. She looked over her shoulder at her son and gave him a warm smile of understanding. Tom smiled back and, with one last shrug, changed the mess of rice into a fun game.
