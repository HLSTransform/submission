Once there was a young bird, who wanted to soar in the sky. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't seem to fly.
One day, the bird heard about a magical chamber. Inside the chamber was a secret that would help the bird soar. 
The bird flew up to the chamber and knocked on the door. "Who's there?" said a voice from inside.
The bird replied, "Its me, the young bird who wants to soar in the sky. May I come in and learn the secret to flying?"
"Yes, come on in," the voice said.
The bird entered the chamber, and was amazed by what she saw. She saw a beautiful feather and a golden hourglass. 
The voice said, "This feather is your ticket to flying. Use the independent spirit within you to soar. Put the feather in your hair, close your eyes and imagine yourself flying as high as you can."
The bird followed the instructions and felt her heart soar. Miraculously, she was able to fly! From that day forward, the young bird became an independent flyer who was able to soar through the sky.
