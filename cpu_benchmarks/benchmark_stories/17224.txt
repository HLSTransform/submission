Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One night, she had a nightmare and woke up crying. Her mom came to her room and asked, "What's wrong, Lily?"
"I had a bad dream," Lily said.
Her mom hugged her and said, "It's okay, it was just a nightmare. Let me sing you a song to make you feel better."
Lily's mom sang a lullaby and soon Lily fell asleep. The next day, Lily realized that her nightmare was just an ordinary dream and she felt silly for being scared. She learned that sometimes things may seem scary, but they are not always as bad as they seem. From that day on, Lily was not afraid of nightmares anymore.
