Lily and Tom were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they went to the forest with their mom and dad. The forest had many big trees and green leaves. Lily and Tom wanted to climb the trees and see the birds and squirrels.
"Can we climb, mom?" Lily asked.
"Yes, but be careful and stay close," mom said.
Lily and Tom found a tree that had a low branch. They held hands and climbed up the branch. They felt happy and excited. They saw a nest with three eggs and a blue bird. The bird was gentle and did not fly away.
"Hello, bird," Tom said. "You have pretty eggs."
The bird chirped and nodded. Lily and Tom smiled and waved. They climbed down the branch and ran to their mom and dad.
"Look, mom, look, dad," they said. "We saw a bird and her eggs. She was gentle and nice."
Mom and dad hugged them and praised them. They said they were brave and kind. Lily and Tom felt proud and loved. They had a fun day in the forest.
