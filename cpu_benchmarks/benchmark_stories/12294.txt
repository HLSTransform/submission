One day, an old dancer sneezed. She was feeling dry from dancing all day. She decided to take a break and have a drink.
"Mama, why did you sneeze?" asked her little daughter. 
"My nose was dry and it tickled," the old dancer said with a smile. 
The old dancer got a drink and felt much better. She quickly finished her drink and said, "Let's continue dancing!" 
The little girl and the old dancer started to dance together. They twirled and spun and jumped. Soon they were both laughing and smiling. 
"What a fun way to spend the day!" exclaimed the old dancer. 
The daughter smiled and hugged her mother tight. "I love dancing with you, Mama!" she said with a grin. 
The old dancer hugged her daughter back and said, "I love dancing with you too! Now, let's go find some more music!" 
The old dancer and her daughter kept dancing until the sun went down. It was a fun day of dancing and sneezing!
