Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toys all day long. One day, his mom asked him to clean up his room and put all his toys in the bin. Timmy didn't want to do it because he was having too much fun playing. 
But then, his mom explained that it was important to be honest and do what she asked. Timmy thought about it and decided to quit playing for a little while and clean up his toys. It was hard work, but he felt proud of himself when he was done. 
From then on, Timmy learned that sometimes it's important to quit playing and do what needs to be done. And when he was honest and did what his mom asked, he felt really good inside. The end.
