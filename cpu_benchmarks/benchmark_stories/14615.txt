Once upon a time there was a little girl named Toby. She was very brave and strong. Toby loved to play outside and explore new things.
One day, Toby went on a new adventure. She followed a path until she saw a castle. She walked inside and there was a big surprise. A giant was waiting for her! The giant introduced himself as Victory and said he was the King of the castle. Toby was scared at first, but she was brave and stood tall.
Victory then showed Toby around the castle. He showed her the library, the kitchen, and the library. Toby was amazed by how big and grand the castle was!
At the end of her tour, Victory presented Toby with a little crown. He said this was a special victory crown to show Toby all the victories she could have if she kept being brave. Toby put on the crown, thanked Victory, and ran home to show her family.
