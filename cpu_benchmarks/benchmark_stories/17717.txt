Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very happy. She had lots of friends and they would play together all day long. She had lots of toys too and every time she played she was smiling. 
All of her friends wanted to join her in her fun but one day, she found something that stopped them. It was a pink worry. It looked like a long string and it was so big it filled the room! 
The little girl tried to join the string but it was so long that she couldn't move it. One of her friends noticed and came to help. He smiled and said that he would join with her so that they could make it move together. 
So they held hands and pulled as hard as they could. Suddenly, the string started to move and soon it was all gone! The little girl and her friends were so happy. From then on, they would join together to play and never let pink worries get in the way again.
