Once upon a time there was a girl named Lucy. She was very happy and always liked to dress up in different clothes. One day she was outside playing when she saw her friend Joe. He had on a silly hat and was telling a joke. 
Lucy smiled and asked him to share the joke with her too. Joe told her the joke and Lucy laughed so hard she could not stop. Joe liked that she had enjoyed his joke.
Then Lucy said to him, "Let's dress up different and make our own joke!" Joe thought this was a great idea and they began looking around for different things to wear.
Joe found some funny glasses and a bow tie, while Lucy put on a colorful dress and a straw hat. When they looked at each other they both started laughing and made up their own silly joke.
They laughed together all afternoon long. Lucy and Joe had lots of fun dressing up in different clothes, telling jokes and being friends.
