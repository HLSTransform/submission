Once upon a time there was a compassionate girl named Sara. Every day she would tell a story to the children in her neighborhood. The children adored her, and each time she finished her stories, they would all smile.
One day, Sara took her stories to the park and told them to a group of 3 year olds. They were enthralled with the stories and each one of them had a huge smile on their face.
When her stories were finished, the children surrounded Sara and she gave them each a hug. They told her that they loved her stories and Sara smiled back. She was happy that so many children had been able to share and enjoy her stories.
Sara continued to go to the park every day and tell stories to the children. She was always so compassionate and caring, and the smiles on the children's faces brought her joy. 
At the end of each day, the children would thank Sara for the stories and wave goodbye. She would wave back, feeling content and loving that she had shared her stories with them.
