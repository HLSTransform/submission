Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bake cakes with her mommy. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to help mix the batter for the cake. Lily was so excited to be helpful. She mixed the batter with a big spoon and made sure it was all smooth.
After they put the cake in the oven, Lily's mommy asked her if she knew what "speed" meant. Lily shook her head. "Speed means how fast something goes," her mommy explained. "Like when we drive in the car, we can go fast or slow."
Lily thought about it for a moment and then said, "I like going slow because then I can see everything." Her mommy smiled and said, "That's a helpful way to think about it, Lily." And they waited for the cake to bake at just the right speed.
