Once upon a time, there was a very wealthy man who loved to sit in his chair. He always looked down on the people who had less than he did. Every day, he would remind himself how wealthy he was, and how better he was than anyone else.
One day, an old woman walked up to the wealthy man and said she wanted to change places. The man laughed and said no. But the old woman asked again, and again the wealthy man said no.
Finally, the old woman asked the wealthy man, "if I can make this chair move backwards, will you agree to change places with me?". The wealthy man thought it was impossible, but he agreed. The old woman then began to move the chair slowly backwards. 
The wealthy man then realised how fortunate he was, and how truly blessed he was to have all the wealth he had. He learned a lesson that day and made sure to never again look down on other people who didn't have as much as him. 
The moral of this story is that being truly wealthy is about what you have in your heart, not just what you have in your pocket.
