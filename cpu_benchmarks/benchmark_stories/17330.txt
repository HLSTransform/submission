Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with puzzles. One day, she found a big puzzle that was very scary. She didn't know how to solve it.
Lily asked her mom for help. "Mommy, this puzzle is too hard. Can you help me?" she said. Her mom smiled and said, "Of course, sweetie. Let's work on it together."
They worked on the puzzle for a while, but it was still too hard. Lily felt like giving up. "I surrender, Mommy. This puzzle is too scary," she said. But her mom encouraged her to keep trying.
Finally, after many tries, they solved the puzzle together. Lily was so happy and proud. "We did it, Mommy! We solved the scary puzzle!" she exclaimed.
