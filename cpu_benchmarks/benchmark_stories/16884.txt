Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play with his friends in the forest. One day, Benny was feeling sad because he couldn't find his favorite carrot. 
Benny's friend, a little bird named Billy, saw that Benny was sad and asked, "What's wrong, Benny?" 
Benny replied, "I lost my favorite carrot. It's the one that always makes me feel comfortable." 
Billy said, "Don't worry, Benny. I'll help you find it." 
So, Billy flew up into the trees to get a better point of view. From up high, he saw something orange bouncing in the grass. "Benny, look over there!" he shouted. 
Benny ran over and sure enough, it was his favorite carrot. "Thank you, Billy! You're the best friend ever!" Benny said happily. 
From that day on, Benny made sure to keep his favorite carrot close by so he wouldn't lose it again.
