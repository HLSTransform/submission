Once upon a time there was a brave girl. She could do lots of things. She was very strong and she never gave up.
One day she went for a walk in the woods. But soon, she met a witch! The girl was scared, but she stayed brave.
The witch said, “Do you want something special?” The girl said yes. Then the witch gave her a magical ring.
The girl was so happy. She thanked the witch and ran off.
She wore the magical ring everywhere. Even when things were tough, she felt strong. She was very thankful for the witch's gift. She never forgot.
