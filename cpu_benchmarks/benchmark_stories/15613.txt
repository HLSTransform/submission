Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to pretend they were cowboys and robbers. Lily had a hat and a pistol. Ben had a scarf and a bag. Lily was the cowboy and Ben was the robber.
"Stop, robber! Give me your bag!" Lily said. She pointed her pistol at Ben.
"No, cowboy! You can't catch me!" Ben said. He ran away with his bag.
Lily chased him. She was fast and tough. She caught up with him near the slide. She grabbed his bag and pulled it.
"Let go, cowboy! That's mine!" Ben said. He pulled back.
"Tell me your name, robber! Or I will shoot!" Lily said. She held her pistol close to his face.
Ben was scared. He did not like the pistol. He did not want to get shot. He said his name.
"My name is Ben. Please don't shoot me, cowboy!" Ben said.
Lily smiled. She liked Ben. He was her friend. She put down her pistol.
"My name is Lily. I won't shoot you, robber. Do you want to play something else?" Lily said.
Ben nodded. He was happy. He did not like to be a robber. He liked to play with Lily.
"OK, Lily. What do you want to play?" Ben said.
Lily thought for a moment. She had an idea.
"Let's play pirates!" Lily said.
Ben agreed. They put on their hats and scarves. They took their pistol and bag. They ran to the sandbox. They were pirates now. They had fun.
