Once upon a time, there was a fancy sailor who loved to crawl around the world. He was looking for adventure and was often out of sight. One night, he came across a pond and looked in. He saw a beautiful, giant fish swimming around. Without a thought, the sailor jumped right in! The water was cold and crisp, but that didn't stop him. He swam and swam, trying to reach the fish.
Hours later, the fancy sailor finally caught the fish! But the fish had some wise words for him. The fish said, "Be careful of what you wish for. You wanted adventure, so be thankful for what you have. Crawling around won't take you far".
The fancy sailor listened to the fish and was glad he did. He smiled, thanked the fish and promised to never forget it's wise words. From then on, the sailor found other ways to explore the world, but always remembered the lesson. Adventure can be found everywhere, even while you crawl.
