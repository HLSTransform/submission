Once upon a time, there was a kind dog named Max. Max loved to play with his ball and go for walks with his owner. One day, Max saw a tiny bird with a broken wing. The bird was very patient and waited for Max to come closer.
Max knew he had to protect the bird from other animals who might want to hurt it. So, Max stayed with the bird until it was strong enough to fly again. Max was happy to help the bird, even though he knew the bird was ignorant and didn't understand how to stay safe from danger.
In the end, the bird flew away and Max felt proud of himself for being a good protector. From that day on, Max knew that it was important to help others who were in need, even if they didn't know how to keep themselves safe.
