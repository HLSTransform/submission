Once upon a time there was a girl named Anne. One day, Anne had a very special wish. She wanted to spin very high in the sky. So, Anne went outside and found a round wheel. She jumped onto the wheel and started to spin round and round. With each spin, Anne went higher and higher into the sky. 
Anne couldn't stop spinning. She spun faster and faster until she reached the sky. Up in the sky, Anne could see all the way to the mountains and the sea. She kept spinning in the sky until the wheel became too weak to spin any more. 
With one last spin, Anne spun high in the sky and then came back down to the ground. Everyone was so surprised to see Anne return to Earth from the sky. From then on, Anne made a wish every day to spin in the sky, but no one ever saw her do it again.
