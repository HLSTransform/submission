Once upon a time, there was a cart. The cart was very big and strong. One day, the cart was in the park and it wanted to go home. But it didn't know which way to go!
That's when a wise old fox came by. He saw the cart and how it looked so lost. He said, "Do not worry, little cart. I will help you get home."
The fox hopped on the cart and started to reverse. The cart started to roll and roll until it reached its street. The cart was so happy and thanked the fox for its help.
The fox said, "No problem, my friend. I am always happy to help. Wise carts like you should always get back to where they belong!"
And the cart quickly went home!
