Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Pat. Pat lived in a big house with his parents and his little brother. Pat was always nice to his brother, but one day, he was a bit mean. He said an unkind thing to his brother. Pat's brother became sad.
Pat felt so guilty for what he had done. He knew he had to make it right. So Pat apologized and asked his brother to forgive him. He promised to be better from then on.
His brother felt a little better after Pat said sorry. To show how sorry he was, Pat decided to do something special. He took his brother to the store and bought him a nice big container of yogurt! It was an unusual kind of yogurt with lots of fun flavors. His brother was so happy. Pat was so happy his brother was happy.
Families sometimes have misunderstandings, but Pat showed his brother how important forgiveness is. He showed what can happen when one brother forgives the other. With a big jar of unusual yogurt as an extra special treat, Pat and his brother were happy and felt closer than ever.
