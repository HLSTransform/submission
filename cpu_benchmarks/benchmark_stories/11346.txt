Emily looked at the beautiful flowers. She saw some butterflies fluttering around them. She smiled and decided to pick a few. She carefully moved them into her basket.
Suddenly, her tummy rumbled. She knew it was almost lunchtime. Emily carefully put the flowers back and moved towards the house. Her mom was in the kitchen and when she saw Emily, she smiled. She asked, "What would you like for lunch?".
Emily thought for a moment. She felt thoughtful, and it seemed like the perfect time to try something new. Her mom asked, "What about a tasty salad?". Emily nodded and said, "Move me to try it please!".
Her mom laughed and said, "Of course!". She moved to the fridge and made a gentle salad for Emily's empty stomach. She served it with a smile.
Emily tucked into the delicious salad and knew she had made a wise decision. She thanked her mom for being so thoughtful.
