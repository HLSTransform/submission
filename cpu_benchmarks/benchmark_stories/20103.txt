Sara and Tom were happy. They liked to play with their toys and read books. They had a big box full of toys and books. One day, their mom said they had to go on a journey. She said they had to visit their grandma, who lived far away.
Sara and Tom did not want to go. They wanted to stay and play. They tried to resist. They said no, no, no. They hid under the bed. They cried and kicked. But their mom was firm. She said they had to go. She said grandma was sick and needed their hugs. She said they could bring some toys and books with them.
Sara and Tom packed their bags. They chose their favorite toys and books. They said goodbye to their box. They got in the car. They were still sad and angry. They did not talk to their mom. They looked out the window and saw the trees and houses go by.
The journey was long and boring. Sara and Tom felt sleepy. They closed their eyes and dreamed of their box. They did not notice when the car stopped. They did not hear their mom say they had arrived. They did not see their grandma waiting for them.
Their mom woke them up. She said they were at grandma's house. She said they should get out and say hello. Sara and Tom opened their eyes. They saw their grandma smiling at them. She looked old and tired, but also kind and sweet. She hugged them and kissed them. She said she was so happy to see them. She said she had a surprise for them.
Sara and Tom followed their grandma inside. They saw a big room full of toys and books. They saw a big box with a bow on it. Their grandma said it was for them. She said she had collected all the toys and books she had when she was a child. She said she wanted to share them with them.
Sara and Tom were amazed. They ran to the box and opened it. They saw all kinds of toys and books they had never seen before. They saw dolls and cars and puzzles and games. They saw stories and pictures and poems and songs. They felt curious and excited. They thanked their grandma and hugged her. They started to play and read.
Sara and Tom were happy. They forgot about their journey and their box. They enjoyed their grandma's toys and books. They talked and laughed with their grandma. They learned new things and had fun. They realized their grandma was not sick and sad, but strong and wise. They loved their grandma and she loved them. They were glad they came.
