One day, a little boy named Tim went to class. The sun was shining bright outside. Tim was a little scared because it was his first day at school. He did not know anyone there.
In his class, he saw a girl named Lily. She was also scared. Tim said, "Hi, I'm Tim. Are you scared too?" Lily said, "Yes, I am scared. My name is Lily." They became friends because they were both scared.
Together, they learned that school was not so scary. They played and had fun. The sun kept shining, and Tim and Lily were happy in their class. They were not scared anymore.
