Once upon a time, there was a wide carrot. It was so big, that it could be seen from far away. Two friends, Jim and Jane, wanted to see the big carrot. So they walked to it and looked at it. 
The carrot was so big that they couldn't carry it. So Jim had an idea. He said that they should take turns taking a bite of it. Jane thought that it was a great idea and she went first. She bit the carrot and it tasted so good!
Jim had a turn too, and he said that it was the best carrot he had ever tasted. They decided to keep the carrot for later. They put the carrot in Jim's pocket and then they went back home. 
Every time they had a snack, they remembered the wide carrot.
