One day, there was a little girl who was scared. She had been wandering for a long time. Everywhere she looked she couldn't find a place where she belonged. She felt like she was all alone in the world. 
Then one day, she found a root. It was special to her because it was the place she knew she belonged. She held onto it tightly, feeling safe and secure. 
The little girl started to make the root her own. She planted some flowers around the root and kept it nice and clean. Whenever she felt scared, she would come to it and know that she belonged somewhere. 
The little girl was never scared again, because she knew that her root was her special place to belong.
