Lily loved to read books. She liked to learn new words and say them out loud. She had a big book of animals that her mom gave her. She opened the book and saw a picture of a giraffe.
"Wow, look at this!" she said to her mom. "What is this animal?"
"That is a giraffe, Lily," her mom said. "It is a very tall animal that lives in Africa. It has a long neck and spots on its fur."
Lily pointed to the giraffe's neck. "Why is its neck so long?" she asked.
"Because it needs to reach the leaves on the trees," her mom said. "The leaves are its food. The giraffe can grow very tall and eat a lot of leaves."
Lily nodded. She thought the giraffe was brilliant. She wanted to grow tall too and eat leaves. She said the word "giraffe" over and over. She liked how it sounded.
"Can you say another word, Lily?" her mom asked. "How about this animal?" She turned the page and showed her a picture of a penguin.
Lily looked at the penguin. It was black and white and had a beak and wings. It was very different from the giraffe. She tried to say the word "penguin" but it was hard.
"Pen...pen...ping?" she said.
"Almost, Lily," her mom said. "It is penguin. Try again."
Lily repeated the word. "Penguin. Penguin. Penguin."
"Good job, Lily!" her mom said. "You are learning new words every day. You are a brilliant reader."
Lily smiled. She felt happy and proud. She hugged her mom and her book. She wanted to read more and more. She loved words.
