Ben and Mia are playing in the garden. They see a yellow house with a big door. They want to see what is inside.
"Let's go, Ben!" Mia says. "Maybe there are toys or candy in there."
They run to the door and try to open it. But it does not move. It has a lock on it. They look for a key, but they cannot find one.
"Maybe we can break the lock," Ben says. He picks up a stick and hits the lock. But it is too hard. The stick breaks.
"Ow!" Ben says. He drops the stick and rubs his hand.
Mia sees something shiny under a bush. She goes to look. It is a key. It has a yellow tag on it. She picks it up and runs to the door.
"Look, Ben! I found a key!" Mia says. She puts the key in the lock and turns it. The lock clicks and the door opens.
They discover a room full of books and toys and pictures. They are happy and excited. They go inside and play.
"Wow, this is amazing!" Ben says. "Look at all these things!"
"Who do you think lives here?" Mia says. "Maybe it is a fairy or a wizard."
They do not know that the yellow house belongs to their grandma, who loves to read and collect things. She is out for a walk, but she will be back soon. She will be surprised to see her grandchildren in her secret room. She will hug them and tell them stories. They will have a lot of fun.
