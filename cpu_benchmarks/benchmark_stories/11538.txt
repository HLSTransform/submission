Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to collect things. He had a big box where he put all the things he collected. One day, Tim found a small boat near the river. He was so excited to add it to his collection!
Tim showed the boat to his friend, Sara. "Look, I found a boat!" said Tim. Sara looked at the boat and said, "It looks scary!" The boat had a scary face painted on it. But Tim didn't mind. He thought it was cool.
Together, Tim and Sara played with the scary boat in the river. They had so much fun that they forgot it was scary. And from that day on, the scary boat was one of Tim's favorite things in his collection.
