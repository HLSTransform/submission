Once upon a time, there was a lovely bird named Bella. She lived in a big tree near a park. Bella loved to sing and play with her friends. One day, she heard about a fun party in the park.
Bella told her friends about the party. They all wanted to go and enjoy it. They knew that there would be good food and fun games. So, they planned to meet at the big tree before the party.
At the party, Bella and her friends had a great time. They enjoyed the food and played all the games. Bella was so happy that she sang her most beautiful song for everyone. The other birds loved it and clapped their wings.
The next day, Bella found a surprise under the big tree. It was a gift from her friends to say thank you for the lovely song. Bella smiled and knew that she had the best friends ever.
