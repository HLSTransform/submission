Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her favorite figure - a little princess. One day, Lily's mom gave her a magic potion that made things shrink. Lily was so excited to try it out, so she poured a little bit on her princess figure. Suddenly, the princess started to shrink and Lily couldn't believe her eyes! 
But as the princess got smaller and smaller, Lily started to feel a little gloomy. She didn't want her favorite toy to be so tiny. So, she poured some more potion on the princess and she grew back to her normal size. Lily was so happy and hugged her princess tight. From that day on, Lily knew that sometimes things can shrink, but with a little bit of magic, they can always grow back to their original size.
