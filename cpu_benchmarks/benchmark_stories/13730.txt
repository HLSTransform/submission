Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, her mommy said, "Lily, can you help me prepare dinner tonight?" 
Lily was very excited and asked, "What are we making, mommy?" 
"We are making spaghetti," replied her mommy. 
Lily helped her mommy handle the spaghetti noodles and put them in the pot to cook. She also helped her mommy make the sauce by stirring it with a big spoon. 
After dinner was ready, Lily's mommy said, "Lily, can you help me clean up the dishes?" 
Lily replied, "Yes, mommy!" As she was washing the dishes, she accidentally dropped a dull knife on the floor. Her mommy quickly picked it up and said, "Be careful, Lily. We need to handle sharp objects with care." 
From that day on, Lily always remembered to be careful when handling sharp objects.
