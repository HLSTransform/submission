Anna and Ben like to play hide and seek in the park. They take turns to count and hide. One day, they see a big shadow on the grass. It looks like a monster.
"Who is that?" Anna asks.
"Maybe it is a dragon," Ben says.
They are scared, but curious. They decide to hide behind a tree and watch the shadow.
The shadow moves closer and closer. It has a long neck, a big head, and sharp teeth. It makes a loud noise.
"Roar!"
Anna and Ben scream and run away. They think the shadow is going to eat them.
But then, they hear a voice.
"Hey, kids, don't be afraid. It's me, Mr. Frost. I'm making an icy sculpture of a dinosaur for the winter festival. Do you want to see it?"
Anna and Ben stop and look back. They see a man with a big hose and a lot of ice. He is spraying water on the ice to make it look like a dinosaur.
"Oh, it's not a monster. It's a sculpture," Anna says.
"It's very cool," Ben says.
Mr. Frost smiles and invites them to come closer. He shows them how he makes the sculpture and lets them touch the icy dinosaur.
Anna and Ben are happy. They like the sculpture and they like Mr. Frost. They thank him and go back to play hide and seek. But this time, they hide behind the icy dinosaur.
