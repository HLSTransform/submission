Once upon a time there was a yellow comet in the sky. Everyone loved it because it made the night sky look so colourful. One day, the comet flew very close to the moon. The people wanted the comet to stay forever. So, they decided to bury it in the ground.
The people used many tools to dig a big hole. Then, they carefully lowered the comet inside it. They made sure it was snug and cosy. After it was buried, everyone smiled and clapped.
The people built a big yellow marker over the comet. Everyone could see it from far away. They named it "The Yellow Comet". It was a special place that everyone loved.
The end.
