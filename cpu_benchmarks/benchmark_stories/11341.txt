Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Rita. She loved animals, so one morning she went to the zoo. 
Rita found a big enclosure with a gorilla inside. The gorilla looked very sad and was frowning. Rita asked a zoo keeper why the gorilla was so unhappy, and the zoo keeper replied in a mild voice, 
"He's been here by himself for a while, he's just lonely I think". 
Rita understood and started to wave and smiled at the gorilla. The gorilla waved back and started to smile too! 
Rita was so delighted that she came back the next day. This time, the gorilla was smiling and running around the enclosure. Rita waved and said hello and the gorilla waved back. 
Rita was very happy to see the gorilla happy, and she smiled too.
