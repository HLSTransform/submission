Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big yellow slide that looked fun. They ran to the slide and waited for their turn.
"Can I go first?" Lily asked Tom.
"OK, you can go first," Tom said. He was a good brother.
Lily climbed up the steps of the slide. She was very happy. She looked down and saw Tom waiting for her. She smiled and waved. Then she slid down the slide.
But when she reached the bottom, she saw something strange. A big yellow dog appeared next to the slide. It had a long tail and floppy ears. It looked friendly, but Lily was scared. She did not know the dog.
"Tom, Tom, help!" Lily cried. She ran to Tom and hugged him.
Tom saw the dog too. He was not scared. He liked dogs. He walked to the dog and said, "Hello, dog. What is your name?"
The dog wagged its tail and licked Tom's face. It barked and said, "Woof, woof. My name is Sunny. I live in the park. I like to play with children."
Tom laughed and petted the dog. He said, "Hi, Sunny. You are a nice dog. Do you want to play with us?"
Sunny nodded and said, "Yes, yes. I want to play with you. Can I go on the slide too?"
Tom looked at Lily and said, "Lily, this is Sunny. He is a friendly dog. He wants to play with us. Can he go on the slide too?"
Lily looked at the dog. She saw that he was not mean. He was just lonely. She felt sorry for him. She said, "OK, Sunny can go on the slide too. But he has to wait his turn."
Sunny barked and said, "Thank you, thank you. You are very kind. I will wait my turn."
Lily and Tom and Sunny played on the slide. They had a lot of fun. They became friends. They were happy.
