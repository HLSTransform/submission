Once upon a time, there was a nice girl named Sarah. She was very polite and she loved to paint. 
One day, Sarah went to the park with her mom. While she was there, she saw a boy playing alone. She went up to him and said "hello". The boy didn't answer, he just smiled. 
Sarah asked him if he wanted to play together. He nodded his head, so they played together for a while. Sarah taught the boy how to paint and he was very good at it. 
At the end of the day they said goodbye and Sarah was very happy. She said that the boy was very polite. Then she went home and told her mom about the nice boy she had met at the park.
