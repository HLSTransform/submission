Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she saw a funny machine in the corner of the park. It had buttons and knobs and made a lot of noise. Lily was curious and went to explore the machine. 
As she pressed the buttons, the machine suddenly started to shake and shiver. Lily got scared and ran away. She realized that she should not have touched the machine without knowing what it does. 
From that day on, Lily learned that it is important to be careful and ask for help when she is unsure about something. She also learned that some things may seem fun, but they can be dangerous if not used properly.
