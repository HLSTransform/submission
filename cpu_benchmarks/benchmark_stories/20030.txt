Lily was a unique girl. She liked to run very fast and explore new places. She did not like to stay at home or play with dolls. She wanted to see the world.
One day, Lily saw a big map on the wall. She saw many colors and shapes on the map. She asked her mom what they were. Her mom said they were countries and oceans and mountains. She said east was the direction where the sun came up.
Lily was curious. She wanted to go east and see the sun. She put on her shoes and her hat and ran out of the door. She ran and ran and ran, looking for the sun. She did not see her mom or dad or brother or sister. She did not see her house or her street or her school. She only saw trees and flowers and birds and bugs.
Lily ran until she was very tired. She stopped and looked around. She did not know where she was. She did not see the sun. She only saw the moon and the stars. She felt scared and lonely. She wished she was at home with her family.
Lily heard a voice. It was her mom. She was calling her name. She had a flashlight and a hug. She had been looking for her all night. She was very worried and angry and happy. She took Lily by the hand and walked her back home. She said Lily was a unique girl, but she should not run away like that. She said east was very far and dangerous. She said Lily should stay close and safe.
Lily said she was sorry. She said she wanted to see the sun. She said she loved her mom. Her mom said she loved her too. She said she would show her the sun in the morning. She said she would read her a story about east and other places. She said she would help her explore the world, but in a safe way.
Lily smiled. She hugged her mom. She was glad to be home. She was still curious, but she was also happy. She learned a lot from her run. She learned that east was not easy to find. She learned that home was where her heart was. She learned that she was a unique girl, but she was not alone.
