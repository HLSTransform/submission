John peered into the classroom. It looked so big and bright! He was careful as he stepped inside.
He saw lots of desks and chairs. He also saw lots of paint and toys. He loved it!
John looked around for his teacher but couldn't find her. He saw a group of kids playing but he didn't recognize anyone.
John was curious. He wanted to find out what was going on. He peeked down the hallway and he saw his teacher. She was talking with another adult. 
John waved at his teacher and she waved back. She smiled at him and then returned to her conversation. John was happy and excited to start his first day at school. He was also careful to follow all the rules.
