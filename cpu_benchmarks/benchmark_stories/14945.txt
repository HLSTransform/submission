Sammy loved his special pink tube. He carried it everywhere with him. When he was playing with his tube, his mom came to him and said - "Now, Sammy, promise me that you won't lose your tube okay? It's your favorite". Sammy smiled and promised his mom. 
The next day, Sammy was having fun, running and playing with his friends when they all wanted to go swimming. "Oh, not without your special tube!", his friends said. Sammy looked around and couldn't find it. He started looking for his tube everywhere in the park. "Where is it? Where could it be?" he said. 
After a while, he saw something pink under the tree. He ran toward it and when he saw it close, he was very happy - it was his special pink tube. Sammy thanked the tree and ran to his mom. 
He told her the whole story, and Sammy smiled and hugged him. His mom said, "I knew you'd keep your promise, Sammy!". Sammy was very happy. From that day, Sammy never forgot to bring his pink tube with him.
