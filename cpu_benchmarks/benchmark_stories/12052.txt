Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and collect flowers. One day, she found a bottle of perfume and decided to try it on. The perfume smelled very nice and deep. She loved it so much that she filled the bottle with water to make it last longer.
Lily's friend, Timmy, saw her with the bottle of perfume and asked if he could try it too. Lily told him that it was just water now and not perfume anymore. Timmy didn't listen and poured the water on himself, hoping to smell nice like Lily.
But the water didn't smell like perfume and Timmy was very disappointed. Lily explained to him that it's not good to pretend to be something you're not and that it's better to be happy with who you are. Timmy learned a valuable lesson that day and promised to always be himself. The end.
