Once upon a time, there was a delicate little girl. She loved to take walks in her neighborhood. One day, while on her walk, she stumbled upon an old bookstore. She had never seen a store like this before. She decided to go in and take a look. There were so many books! She was so excited and decided to read one. She found a book about animals and quickly began reading.
The little girl read about bears, tigers, and other animals. She read for a long time, learning about each animal. She was fascinated by the stories, and before she knew it, it was time to go home.
But the little girl did not forget the store. Every time she took a walk, she would go back and read even more! Her love for reading was strong, and she always looked forward to finding new books to explore.  With her newfound passion, she never stopped reading.
