Anna was a princess who liked to hug everyone. She hugged her mommy and daddy, her friends and toys, and even the flowers and trees. She was very happy and kind.
One day, a prince came to visit her castle. He said he wanted to be her friend and play with her. Anna was excited and hugged him too. But the prince was naughty. He did not like to hug. He pushed Anna away and laughed at her. He said hugs were silly and weak.
Anna was sad and hurt. She ran to her room and cried. She did not want to play with the prince anymore. She wanted to hug someone who was nice and gentle.
Her mommy and daddy heard her cry and came to her room. They asked her what was wrong. Anna told them about the naughty prince. They hugged her and said they were sorry. They said hugs were not silly or weak. They said hugs were a way to show love and care.
They asked Anna if she wanted to go outside and hug some flowers and trees. Anna smiled and nodded. She dried her tears and went with them. She hugged the flowers and trees and felt better. She saw the prince looking at her from the window. He looked lonely and bored. Anna waved at him and said, "Do you want to hug too?" The prince did not answer. He turned away and went to his room. Anna shrugged and hugged her mommy and daddy. She was happy and kind.
