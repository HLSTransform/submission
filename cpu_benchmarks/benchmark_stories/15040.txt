Once upon a time, there was a big dog called Bob. Bob had a regular tail and he loved to play. One day, Bob decided to explore. He entered a forest full of adventure.
Bob had been walking for a while and then he heard a strange noise. He stopped and listened carefully. "Help! Help!", the noise said.
Bob followed the voice and entered a clearing. At the centre of the clearing was a tiny mouse. "Oh, thank you for coming to my rescue!" the mouse said.
Bob asked the mouse what was wrong. "Well, I was walking through the woods and got my regular tail caught in a bush," the mouse replied.
Bob smiled and said, "Don't worry, I can help you." He used his strong paws to untangle the mouse's tail from the bush.
The mouse was so thankful and the two friends said goodbye. Bob continued his adventure, but this time he was more careful. He knew that an unexpected tail can be quite a surprise!
