Once upon a time, there was a cute little girl called Lily. She liked to play outside every day. On one very sunny day, Lily decided to go jogging. She ran and ran until she came to a big market. But when she got there, Lily was not happy. The market was very ugly! 
Lily wanted to go home, but she did not know the way. She didn't have any grown-ups to help her. So she started jogging again. She ran and ran until she saw a familiar big tree. Then she knew the way home. She was so happy! 
Lily jogged all the way home. When she got there, her mum and dad were very proud of her. They gave her a big hug and said she was a brave little girl. Then, she played happily outside until it was time to go to bed. 
The end.
