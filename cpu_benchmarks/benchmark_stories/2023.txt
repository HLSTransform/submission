Once upon a Tuesday, there was a jolly little girl named Jane. She loved to explore the outdoors and was always wondering what she would find.
One day, Jane was walking through the park and she wondered if she would find something fun. As she continued walking, she saw an old man sitting on a bench. Jane thought he looked very kind and went to talk to him. 
The old man said hello and smiled. Jane said hello back and asked, "What are you doing here?"
The old man said, "I like to come to this bench on Tuesdays and wonder about the world. It makes me happy." 
Jane smiled and thought this was a jolly idea. She sat on the bench with him and asked, "What should I wonder about first?"
The old man said, "Well, what do you think would make you the happiest?"
Jane thought for a moment and said, "I think I'd like to wonder what a rainbow looks like up close." 
The old man smiled and said, "Let's go find it!"
And off they went, wondering what they would find.
