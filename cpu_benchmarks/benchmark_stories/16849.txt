Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the library with his mom. The library was a big building with lots of books. It was always quiet in the library, which Timmy liked.
One day, Timmy went to the library with his mom, but it was very noisy. There was a man who kept screaming and making loud noises. Timmy didn't like it, and neither did his mom. They tried to ignore the man, but it was too noisy.
Suddenly, the man started throwing the books around and making a big mess. Everyone in the library was scared and started to scream. Timmy and his mom ran out of the library as fast as they could.
The library was closed for a long time, and Timmy couldn't go back. He was sad because he loved going to the library. But he knew he couldn't go back because it wasn't safe anymore. The end.
