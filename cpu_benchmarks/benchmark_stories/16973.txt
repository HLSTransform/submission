Lily and Ben liked to play with their toy record. It was a big round thing that made music when they put it on a box. They had many records with different songs. They liked to sing and dance with the records.
One day, they went to camp with their mom and dad. They brought their record and their box with them. They wanted to show their friends at camp how to play with them. But when they got to camp, they saw a big sign that said "No records allowed". The camp leader said records were too loud and old. He said they had to use CDs or phones instead.
Lily and Ben were sad. They did not like CDs or phones. They liked their record and their box. They tried to hide them in their tent, but the camp leader found them. He took them away and threw them in the trash. He said they were junk and they had to learn new things.
Lily and Ben cried. They wanted their record and their box back. They did not like the camp leader. They did not like the camp. They wanted to go home. But their mom and dad said they had to stay for a week. They said it was good for them to try new things.
Lily and Ben were very sad. They had no record, no box, no music, no fun. They had a bad camp. They had a bad ending.
