Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big poster. It says: "Race for the Queen". Lily and Ben want to race.
They go to the start line. There are many other kids. They all wear red, white and blue. Lily and Ben wear yellow. They are the only ones. They are not afraid. They are brilliant.
The man with the whistle says: "Ready, set, go!" Lily and Ben run as fast as they can. They pass the other kids. They see the finish line. It has a big flag. It has the queen's face on it. Lily and Ben smile.
They cross the finish line together. They are the first ones. They are the winners. They are very happy. The man with the whistle gives them medals. They are shiny and gold. They have the queen's face on them too. Lily and Ben say: "Thank you!"
The queen is watching. She is on a big screen. She sees Lily and Ben. She claps her hands. She says: "Well done, Lily and Ben! You are brilliant! You make me proud!" Lily and Ben wave to the queen. They feel very special. They are the best.
