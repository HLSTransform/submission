Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park every day. They had a lot of fun on the swings, the slide and the seesaw. But their favorite thing was the rope bridge. It was high and long and wobbly. They pretended they were crossing a jungle or a mountain.
One day, they saw a new boy in the park. His name was Max. He looked sad and lonely. Lily and Ben wanted to be nice to him. They asked him if he wanted to play with them. Max nodded and smiled. They showed him the rope bridge and told him it was fun.
But Max was scared of the rope bridge. He thought it was too high and too wobbly. He did not want to cross it. He said he would wait for them on the other side. Lily and Ben said okay and started to cross the rope bridge. They held the rope tight and walked slowly.
But when they were in the middle of the bridge, they heard a loud snap. One of the ropes had broken. The bridge tilted and shook. Lily and Ben screamed. They were afraid they would fall. They looked for Max, but he was not there. He had run away.
Lily and Ben did not know what to do. They were stuck on the bridge. They cried for help. But no one heard them. They wished Max had stayed with them. They wished they had a friend who would not leave them.
Then they saw a man coming. He was wearing a hat and a badge. He was a park ranger. He saw Lily and Ben on the bridge. He ran to help them. He had a big rope. He threw it to them and told them to hold it tight. He pulled them to safety. He hugged them and said they were brave.
Lily and Ben thanked the park ranger. They were happy he had saved them. They learned a lesson that day. They learned that a true friend is someone who remains with you when you need them. They learned that a rope can be tight or loose, but a friendship should always be tight.
