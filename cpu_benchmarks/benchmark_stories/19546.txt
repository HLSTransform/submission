Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack who loved to play with chalk. He would draw beautiful pictures on the sidewalk and people would be so amazed. One day, one of his friends came over to play and daringly suggested that they should draw a giant castle. Jack was a bit scared, but his friend was so friendly that Jack eventually agreed.
So together, they began to draw a big castle with lots of flags. They laughed and giggled, and as they continued to draw, the chalk pictures became more and more grand. Once they finished, they proudly admired their work. What a grand castle they had made!
 
Jack and his friend were so proud of what they had done. They hugged and joked around as people passed by, admiring their work. It was a beautiful day, and Jack and his friend had created something so beautiful together.
