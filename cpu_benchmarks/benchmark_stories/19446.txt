Once upon a time, there was a confused little bunny called Tim. Tim lived very close to a big station. When Tim got to the station he always looked up and felt so small.
One day, Tim had an idea. He wanted to improve the station. He got some friends together and they started to paint the station in bright colours. They put gorgeous flowers around it too. Slowly but surely, the station began to look more beautiful.
Everyone was so happy with the improvements that they decided to have a special party. Tim was so excited he hopped about in joy. At the party, everyone ate yummy food and Tim and his friends played lots of games. They all had a wonderful time. 
Now it was impossible to miss the station when you were close, because it was so pretty. Tim was proud that he and his friends had improved the station and he was happy that it made all the other bunnies smile.
