Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max was very sad because he had a bone stuck in his paw. Max's friend, a cat named Lily, saw him and asked, "Max, what happened? Why are you so miserable?"
Max replied, "I stepped on a bone and now it's stuck in my paw. It hurts a lot."
Lily knew just what to do. She gently pulled the bone out of Max's paw and he felt much better. Max thanked Lily and said, "You're my best friend. I don't know what I would do without you."
Lily smiled and said, "That's what friends are for." And they both walked away happily together.
