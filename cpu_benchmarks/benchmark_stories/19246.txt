Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a baby. They were so happy, they could not stop smiling.
One day, the mommy found some glue. She whispered to the baby, "Let's make something!"
The mommy and baby grabbed some paper and got to work. The glue was thick and sticky. The baby put a lot on the paper and made sure everything was stuck together real tight.
When the mommy and baby finished, they had made the most beautiful picture. It was a big, colorful sun with lots of happy faces.
The mommy and baby looked at the picture and smiled. They knew that something special had been created - and it was all because of the glue!
