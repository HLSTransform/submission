Once upon a time, there was a clown named Bobo. Bobo was very good at making people laugh. He had a big red nose, funny shoes, and a big smile. But sometimes, Bobo would forget things.
One day, Bobo was getting ready for a big party. He put on his funny clothes and his big red nose. But when he looked in the mirror, he saw that he forgot his hat. Bobo felt frustrated. He needed his hat to make the children laugh.
Bobo looked everywhere for his hat. He found it under his bed. He put it on his head and went to the party. The children laughed and clapped when they saw Bobo. Bobo was happy that he did not forget his hat. And from that day on, he always remembered to wear his hat to make everyone laugh.
