Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to collect stamps. One day, he went to the park to show his stamp collection to his friend, Billy. 
Billy looked at the stamps and said, "Wow, Timmy! You gained a lot of new stamps since I last saw your collection."
Timmy smiled and said, "Yes, I did. I traded some of my old stamps for these new ones."
Suddenly, a big dog ran up to them and barked loudly. Timmy and Billy were frightened and didn't know what to do. 
Just then, a kind man came over and calmed the dog down. He said to Timmy and Billy, "Always remember that when you're scared, it's important to stay calm and ask for help. You two did a great job staying safe." 
Timmy and Billy thanked the man and went home with a valuable lesson learned.
