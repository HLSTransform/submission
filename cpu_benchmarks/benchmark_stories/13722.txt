Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she saw her mom carrying a jug of water. 
"Mommy, what's in the jug?" asked Lily.
"It's water," replied her mom. 
Lily took a sip of the water and made a funny face. "It's bitter," she said.
"That's because it's hot outside and the water tastes different," explained her mom. 
Lily understood and went back to playing. She picked some flowers and brought them inside to show her mom. "Look, Mommy! These are pretty!" she said. 
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, they are. Thank you for sharing them with me." 
Lily felt happy and proud that she made her mom smile. She went back outside to play, feeling content.
