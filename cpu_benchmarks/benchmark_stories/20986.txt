Once there was a boy named Tom. Tom was 3 years old and very curious. He'd spend long days playing and having fun with his friends and family. One day, Tom saw something funny. His cat was chasing a butterfly! Tom laughed and smiled at the sight - it was so funny! 
But then, Tom's cat got into trouble. The butterfly flew away, and the cat got stuck up a tree! Everyone was worried, but Tom thought it was still funny. He smiled and said, "The cat is stuck in the tree and can't come down - it looks funny!" 
Tom's family tried to think of a way to help the cat, but Tom stayed smiling and laughing. He said, "The cat will find a way down - don't worry!" And eventually, he did. The cat jumped down, and Tom smiled and hugged his pet. 
Tom had lots of fun, even when his cat got into trouble. He was so happy, that he couldn't help but smile!
