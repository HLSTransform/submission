Once upon a time, there was a boy called John. John was very hungry, so he asked his mom for a snack. His mom said, "No, you already ate". But John disagreed. He wanted a snack. He asked again, but his mom still said no.
John was getting angry. He stomped his feet and shouted "NO". But his mom still disagreed. Then he saw something shiny on the floor. It was a comb! 
John smiled. He picked up the comb and said, "Mom, can I have the comb?" His mom said, "Yes, but only if you eat your dinner". John was happy! He agreed to eat his dinner.
They both sat down at the table and had a nice dinner. John was no longer hungry and he had his comb too. They agreed that it was a good idea to have dinner. The end.
