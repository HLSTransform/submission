Once upon a time there was an adorable fisherman. Every day he would gather together his fishing gear and head to the lake to catch some fish.
One day, unfortunately, the fisherman couldn't catch any fish. He tried for a long time as the sun slowly set, but he didn't have any luck.
He felt sad and disappointed. He knew he had to gather his gear together and head home.
When he reached home, he saw that an animal had gotten into his house. The animal had made a mess and taken some food!
The fisherman was unhappy but he knew there was nothing he could do. He sadly gathered his things and left.
The adorable fisherman never caught any fish that day, but he did learn an important lesson. Sometimes bad things can happen, even if you don't mean for them to.
