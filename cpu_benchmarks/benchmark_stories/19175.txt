Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot loved to play and discover new things. One day, Spot went for a walk with his family. They went to the park and played with a ball. Spot was very happy.
While playing, Spot saw a big rock. He wanted to discover what was behind it. Spot ran to the rock and tried to climb it. But he slipped and fell down. Spot felt hurt and started to cry.
His family heard him cry and ran to help him. They tried to make Spot feel better, but he was still hurt. They took him home and put a bandage on him, but Spot didn't want to play or discover anymore. Spot was sad and stayed in his bed, and his family was sad too. They all wished they could make Spot happy again, but they couldn't. The end.
