Tom and Lily went to the zoo with their mom. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and birds. But their favorite was the big gorilla. He was amazing. He could swing from the trees, beat his chest, and make funny noises.
"Can we feed him, mom?" Tom asked.
"No, sweetie, we can't. The zookeepers take good care of him. He has his own food and water," mom said.
But Tom and Lily were curious. They wanted to see what the gorilla liked to eat and drink. They saw a sign that said "Do not feed the animals". But they did not read it. They sneaked away from mom and went to the snack stand. They bought a banana and a soda.
They ran back to the gorilla cage. They saw the gorilla sitting on a rock. He looked bored. Tom and Lily waved at him. He looked at them. They threw the banana and the soda over the fence. The gorilla caught them. He peeled the banana and ate it. He liked it. He opened the soda and drank it. He did not like it. He made a sour face. He spat it out. He threw the can back at Tom and Lily. It hit Tom on the head. It hurt. He cried.
Mom heard Tom cry. She ran to them. She saw what happened. She was angry and scared.
"What did you do? You could have hurt the gorilla or yourselves! Don't you know you should never feed the animals? They have special diets and needs. You could make them sick or angry. You should respect them and follow the rules," mom said.
Tom and Lily felt sorry. They apologized to mom and the gorilla. They learned their lesson. They never fed the animals again. They still liked the gorilla, but they watched him from a safe distance. They admired his amazing skills and beauty. They thanked the zookeepers for taking care of him. They enjoyed the rest of the day at the zoo.
