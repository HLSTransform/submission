Once there was an ordinary figure. He wanted to change his life, so he decided to get a big box. Inside the box he found a little square with a surprise inside; it was a new figure! He was so excited. He quickly traded the ordinary figure with the new one and he put it in the room.
The new figure was better than the ordinary one; it was bigger, brighter and had lots of cool shapes. The figure was also special because it moved around and had a funny voice.
From then on, the ordinary figure was replaced by the new figure. Every day he talked to it, and it said funny things that made him laugh. It was the most wonderful thing ever and it made him so happy. 
The little boy and the new figure had lots of fun together and became the best of friends. They sang songs, danced and laughed a lot. Everything was perfect now that the ordinary figure had been replaced.
