Jack was a little boy of three. He loved the backyard of his house. It was always so beautiful.
He used to go to the backyard every day to play. One day, he saw a tall tree on the other side of the fence. He wanted to look at it closer. He wanted to lean against the fence to look at the tree.
Jack leaned against the fence and looked at the tree. He looked up into the branches and watched the birds come and go. It was so beautiful. He was happy that he could enjoy this view.
Jack leaned against the fence for a long time, looking at the tree. When he was ready, he went back inside and left the beautiful backyard behind.
