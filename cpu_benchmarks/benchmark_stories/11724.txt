One day the wind came. It was wet and cold. Mommy and Daddy took Sally outside. Daddy was holding Sally's hand.
The wind was blowing and loved to tickle Sally's face. Sally laughed and laughed. Daddy laughed too.
Mommy wanted to play in the wet wind, too. She found an umbrella and opened it up. The wind came and caught the umbrella. Mommy and Daddy laughed as they ran with the wind.
Sally didn't like the wind anymore. The wind was blowing so hard. She asked Daddy to take her inside. He picked her up and carried her inside.
The wind kept coming, wet and cold. But Mommy and Daddy knew it was time to stay inside and be warm and dry. They laughed and talked about the fun they had in the wet wind.
