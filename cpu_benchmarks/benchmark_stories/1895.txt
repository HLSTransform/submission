Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jenny. She was very creative and she loved to use her imagination in everything she did. She was in her bedroom one day and she noticed something strange.
Jenny: "Mommy, what is that?"
Mom: "That, Jenny, is a bed."
Jenny: "A bed? What's a bed?"
Mom: "Well, a bed is a place to sleep and rest. Now, why don't you climb into it and see what it feels like?"
So Jenny climbed into the bed and she recognized that it was very comfy. She snuggled in and it felt warm and cozy.
Jenny: "Mommy, I like this bed!"
Mom: "That's good, Jenny. You are so creative!"
Jenny smiled and snuggled into the bed even more. From then on, she always remembered the feeling of a bed, and it made her feel safe and secure.
