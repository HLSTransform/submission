Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who went to school every day. She loved her classroom because it was full of toys and books. One day, Lily was playing with her friends when she accidentally touched something sharp. She cried out in pain and her teacher came over to see what happened.
"Are you okay, Lily?" asked the teacher, who was a little bit nosy.
Lily nodded and said, "I hurt my finger on something sharp."
The teacher looked around and found a pencil with a broken tip. She threw it away and gave Lily a band-aid for her finger. From then on, Lily always made sure to be careful in the classroom and watch out for sharp things.
