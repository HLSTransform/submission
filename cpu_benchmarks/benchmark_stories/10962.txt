One day, a little car named Zoomy was driving down the road. Zoomy loved to go fast. He would zoom down the street and all the other cars would watch. They thought Zoomy was impressive because he was so fast.
Zoomy had a friend named Milky. Milky was a big milk truck. One day, Zoomy and Milky were talking. Zoomy said, "I like to zoom, but I wish I could do something important like you, Milky. You bring milk to everyone."
Milky smiled and said, "Zoomy, you are fast and impressive. You can help me bring milk to everyone. We can be a team."
So, Zoomy and Milky worked together. Zoomy would zoom ahead and tell everyone that Milky was coming with their milk. Everyone was happy to see Zoomy and get their milk from Milky. They made a great team and everyone loved them.
