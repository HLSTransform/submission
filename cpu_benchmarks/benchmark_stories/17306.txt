Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat candy, especially the yummy ones. One day, her mom gave her a big bag of candy. Lily was so happy and started to eat them right away.
Suddenly, her mom came back and saw that Lily had eaten too much candy. She said, "Lily, you can't eat all of that candy. It's not good for you." But Lily didn't want to stop eating the candy.
So her mom had an idea. She said, "Let's wrap the candy in a cord and give it to our neighbor. She will be very happy to receive it." Lily thought it was a good idea and helped her mom wrap the candy in a cord.
They went to their neighbor's house and gave her the candy. The neighbor was very happy and said, "Thank you so much! This is so yummy!" Lily felt happy too, knowing that she had done something good.
