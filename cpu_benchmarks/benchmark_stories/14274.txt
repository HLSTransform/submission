Jill looked out of her bedroom window. She saw a mysterious butterfly fluttering around a big yellow flower in the garden. She was so excited that she quickly ran outside.
When Jill got closer to the flower, she discovered a little pot of butter in the grass too. Jill looked around and saw no one around, so she decided to take the butter back to her bedroom.
On the way back up to her room, Jill heard her mom calling out. 
"Jill, where did you get that butter from?"
Jill was scared, so she kept quiet and tried to run away. But her mom stopped her.
"I can see you have something mysterious going on, why don't you tell me what it is?" her mom said calmly.
Jill knew it was time to tell the truth. She explained that she had found the butter by the flower. Her mom smiled and said, 
"Well, if the butter is meant to be yours, then I suppose it's okay for you to keep it. But remember not to keep going outside without telling me first."
Jill thanked her mom, gave her a big hug and then went back to her room with the butter. She couldn't wait to start making something delicious with it!
