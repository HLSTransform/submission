Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to take pictures with his camera. He took pictures of flowers, animals, and his family. One day, Timmy wanted to test his camera to see if it could take pictures in the dark.
Timmy went outside at night and tried to take pictures. He couldn't see anything, so he used a flashlight to help him. But when he looked at the pictures, they were all black. Timmy felt foolish for thinking the camera could take pictures in the dark.
Feeling sad, Timmy went back inside and went to bed. But during the night, he heard a loud noise outside. He looked out the window and saw a thief trying to steal his camera! Timmy ran outside to stop the thief, but the thief had a gun. Timmy was scared and didn't know what to do. The thief shot Timmy and took the camera. The end.
