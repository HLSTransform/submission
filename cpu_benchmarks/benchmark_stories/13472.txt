Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty dress with a zipper on the back. One day, she went to the park with her mom and saw a merry-go-round. She got on it and started to spin around and around. It was so much fun!
After that, Lily and her mom went to the lake. The water was so deep, Lily couldn't see the bottom. She wanted to swim, but her mom said it was too deep for her. Instead, they sat on the shore and watched the ducks swim by.
As the sun started to set, Lily and her mom went back home. Lily was tired from all the fun she had that day. She hugged her mom and went to bed, dreaming of the spinning merry-go-round and the deep lake.
