Tim and Mia are playing in the park. They like to imagine they are different animals. Tim says, "I am a tiger. I can run fast and roar loud." He pretends to chase Mia and makes a big noise.
Mia laughs and says, "I am a bird. I can fly high and sing sweet." She flaps her arms and hops away from Tim. She makes a small noise.
They run and jump and have fun. They see a bright flower. It is yellow and red. It looks like a fire. Tim says, "Wow, look at that flower. It is so bright. It is like a tiger's fur."
Mia says, "Yes, it is. It is also like a bird's feather. It is so pretty. Can we pick it?"
Tim says, "No, we can't. It is not ours. It belongs to the park. We can look at it and smell it, but we can't touch it."
Mia says, "OK, you are right. It is better to leave it here. Maybe other animals will like it too."
They smile and nod. They go back to their game. They imagine they are a tiger and a bird. They are happy.
