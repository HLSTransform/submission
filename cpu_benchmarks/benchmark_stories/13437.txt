Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toy boat in the bathtub. One day, his mom said, "Timmy, let's go to the beach and sail your boat in the big ocean!"
Timmy was so excited! He packed his bucket and shovel, and his boat too. When they arrived at the beach, Timmy saw a big, open sea in front of him. He put his boat in the water and it sailed far away. Timmy ran after it, but it was too fast.
Suddenly, Timmy saw something shiny in the sand. It was a gold coin! He picked it up and showed it to his mom. She said, "Wow, Timmy, you found treasure! Let's keep looking for more gold." Timmy smiled and continued to play with his boat, knowing that he was a lucky sailor.
