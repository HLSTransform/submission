Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Greta. Greta wanted new clothes for her birthday. Every day she looked around her room to find new clothes that she liked, but she didn't see anything.
One day, Greta spotted a harmless light in the corner of her room. She got closer and she saw that the light was coming from a box. She opened the box, and inside were lots of colorful, sparkly clothes. She was so happy!
Greta put on all the clothes, and she felt extra special. She noticed that every time she wore the clothes, they seemed to increase. Soon, the box was empty and Greta had a big wardrobe filled with all sorts of clothes! She was very happy.
From that day onwards, Greta would always pick out the most harmless clothes whenever she wanted to wear something special. And she was never without something new to wear.
