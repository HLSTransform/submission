Ben and Sam are friends. They like to play baseball in the park. Ben has a new baseball bat. He is very proud of it.
"Look at my bat, Sam!" Ben says. "It is big and shiny. I can hit the ball very far with it."
"Wow, Ben, your bat is nice!" Sam says. "Can I try it?"
"OK, Sam, you can try it. But be careful. Do not drop it or break it." Ben says.
Sam takes the bat from Ben. He swings it in the air. He feels strong and happy. He sees a tall tree near the fence. He wants to hit the ball over the tree.
"Watch this, Ben!" Sam says. "I will hit the ball over the tree!"
Sam throws the ball in the air. He swings the bat hard. He misses the ball. He loses his balance. He drops the bat. The bat flies out of his hand. It hits the fence. It makes a loud noise.
"Oh no, Sam!" Ben says. "You dropped my bat! You broke my bat!"
Ben runs to the fence. He picks up his bat. He sees a big dent in it. He feels sad and angry.
"I am sorry, Ben!" Sam says. "I did not mean to drop your bat! I did not mean to break your bat!"
Sam runs to Ben. He hugs him. He says he is sorry again.
Ben looks at Sam. He sees his friend's face. He sees his friend's tears. He feels sorry for Sam. He remembers they are friends.
"It is OK, Sam." Ben says. "It was an accident. You did not do it on purpose. I forgive you. We are still friends."
Ben hugs Sam back. He smiles. He says they can still play baseball. He says they can share his old bat. He says they can have fun.
Sam smiles too. He says thank you to Ben. He says he is glad they are friends. He says they can have fun too.
They go back to the park. They play baseball. They share the old bat. They hit the ball. They run. They laugh. They are happy.
