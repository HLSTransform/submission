Once upon a time there was a wise cat who liked to stir things. She would stir her breakfast and stir her lunch. One day, she decided to stir a car. She stood on top the car and stirred it around. Things were spinning in circles, and it seemed like fun! Suddenly, the car started to move and the cat couldn't stop! The car zoomed down the road, faster and faster. The wise cat was scared and tried to jump off, but it was too late. The car crashed into a tree at the end of the road and the wise cat was badly hurt. The bad ending was sad, but everyone learned not to stir a car again.
