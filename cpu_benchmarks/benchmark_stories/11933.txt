Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved collecting shells. She had a big box full of different kinds of shells. One day, her friend came over to play and saw the messy box. Her friend asked Lily if she could help her organize the shells. Lily was nervous at first but then agreed to help.
Together, they sorted the shells by size and color. They put the big shells in one pile and the small shells in another pile. They also put the white shells in one pile and the colorful shells in another pile. After they finished organizing, Lily's friend told her that it's important to keep things tidy and organized so that it's easier to find things when you need them.
Lily learned an important lesson that day. She realized that organizing things can be fun and helpful. From that day on, she always made sure to keep her shells and other things organized.
