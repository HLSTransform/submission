Once upon a time there lived a pale little bird. Every day the bird would display its beautiful feathers and chirp happily. People from all around the neighborhood gathered to admire it.
One day its owner decided to bring it to the market. The pale bird was scared but showed no signs of fear. At the market the bird displayed again, its beautiful feathers fluttering in the breeze. Everyone was amazed!
Suddenly a man in the crowd blew a whistle. The bird was shocked! But then it started flapping its wings and began to sing. The crowd cheered and clapped as the bird displayed its wonderful song.
The pale bird continued to whistle for the rest of the day. Everyone was so delighted to hear the little bird's song. From that day forward the bird has been known as the whistling wonder of the market!
