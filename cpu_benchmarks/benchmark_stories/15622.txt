Ben and Lily were playing with balloons in the park. They liked to blow them up and tie them with strings. Then they would throw them to each other and catch them.
"Throw me the red balloon, Ben!" Lily said.
"OK, Lily, here it comes!" Ben said. He threw the balloon fast and hard.
But the balloon did not go to Lily. It went to a big dog that was running in the park. The dog saw the balloon and jumped to catch it.
Pop! The balloon burst in the dog's mouth. The dog was surprised and scared. It barked loud and ran away.
Ben and Lily were also surprised and scared. They dropped their other balloons and ran to their mom.
"Mom, mom, a dog popped our balloon!" they said.
Mom hugged them and said, "It's OK, my loves, it was just an accident. The dog did not mean to pop your balloon. He was just playing too. Maybe we can get you some more balloons later."
Ben and Lily nodded and smiled. They were not mad at the dog. They still liked balloons and dogs. They just wanted to play with them in a different way.
