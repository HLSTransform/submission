One day, a teacher took her class to the park. It was a sunny day and everyone was having fun.
The teacher wanted to measure how long it took the kids to run across the park. All the children lined up and were excited to start the race. The teacher was very helpful and showed them where to start and stop.
When the race was over, the teacher measured how long it took all the kids to run. She wanted to see who was the fastest. Everyone had fun and cheered each other on.
The class was so helpful that the teacher was very proud. She even gave them a prize for being so fast. Everyone was happy and laughed for the rest of the day.
