Once upon a time, there was a little duck named Ducky. Ducky lived in a pond with her friends, the fishies. One day, it rained a lot and the pond started to flood. Ducky got very scared and asked her fishy friends what to do.
One fishy said, "We need to yield to the flood and swim to higher ground!"
Ducky was very sleepy and didn't want to swim, but she knew she had to be brave. So, she followed her fishy friends and they swam to a nearby hill. 
But when they got there, they saw that the hill was already crowded with other animals who had also run away from the flood. They were all arguing about who should be allowed to stay. 
Ducky said, "Let's not fight. We can share the hill and all sleep here tonight."
Everyone agreed and they all had a peaceful night's sleep. The next day, the flood had gone down and they all went back to their homes in the pond, happy to be safe and sound. The end.
