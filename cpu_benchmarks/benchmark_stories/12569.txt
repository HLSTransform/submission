Lily and Tom were hungry. They wanted to eat something yummy. They saw a big pot on the stove. It had soup inside. They smelled the soup. It smelled good.
"Let's cook the soup," Lily said. "We can have it for lunch."
"OK," Tom said. "But how do we cook it?"
Lily looked around. She saw a strip of cloth. It was red and white. It was hanging on a hook. She took it. She wrapped it around her hand. She said, "This is a mitt. It can help us cook. We can use it to hold the pot."
Tom nodded. He saw another strip of cloth. It was blue and yellow. It was on the table. He took it. He wrapped it around his hand. He said, "This is a mitt too. I can help you cook. We can use it to stir the soup."
Lily and Tom went to the stove. They used their mitts to hold and stir the pot. They did not know that the stove was hot. They did not know that the soup was boiling. They did not know that they had to be careful.
The soup bubbled and splashed. It burned their mitts. It burned their hands. It spilled on the floor. Lily and Tom screamed. They dropped the pot. They ran away.
Mom heard the noise. She came to the kitchen. She saw the mess. She saw the empty pot. She saw the burned mitts. She saw Lily and Tom. They were crying. They had red marks on their hands.
Mom was angry. She was also worried. She said, "What did you do? Why did you touch the stove? Why did you try to cook the soup? You could have hurt yourself. You could have started a fire. You should never cook without me. You should always ask me first."
Lily and Tom felt sorry. They said, "We are sorry, Mom. We were hungry. We wanted to eat the soup. We thought we could cook it. We did not know it was dangerous. We did not mean to make a mess. We did not mean to burn the mitts. We did not mean to waste the soup."
Mom hugged them. She said, "I know you did not mean to do anything bad. But you have to learn to be safe. Cooking is not a game. It is not for little kids. It is for grown-ups. You have to wait for me to cook for you. You have to listen to me when I tell you what to do and what not to do. You have to be careful and smart. Do you understand?"
Lily and Tom nodded. They said, "We understand, Mom. We will not cook without you. We will listen to you. We will be careful and smart. We love you, Mom."
Mom smiled. She said, "I love you too, Lily and Tom. Now let me see your hands. I will put some cream on them. It will make them feel better. Then I will make you some sandwiches. They will make you feel full. And then we will clean up the kitchen. We will make it look nice. OK?"
Lily and Tom said, "OK, Mom. Thank you, Mom."
They followed Mom to the bathroom. They learned their lesson. They never tried to cook without Mom again.
