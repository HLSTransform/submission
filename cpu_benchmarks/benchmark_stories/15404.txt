Once upon a time, there was a little girl and she had a special tea party. At the tea party, the little girl guessed what everyone wanted to eat and drink. But the other people were very foolish. They wouldn't guess what the little girl wanted.
Finally, the little girl said "I want tea!" but they still didn't guess it. So she made her own tea. She put in lots of sugar, just the way she liked it. 
The other people were surprised. They asked the little girl how she knew what she wanted. She laughed and said "I just guessed!" 
The people were so tickled by the little girl's wisdom that they couldn't help but giggle. They all enjoyed the tea party, even though it was a bit foolish of them not to guess what the little girl wanted.
