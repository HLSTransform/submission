Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books, especially the ones with pictures. One day, she found a book with an unknown cover. She was curious and wanted to read it, but her mom said she couldn't until she finished her breakfast. 
Lily ate her breakfast quickly and asked her mom if she could read the book now. Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, I permit you to read it." Lily was so happy and ran to her room to start reading. 
As she turned each page, she saw beautiful illustrations and read interesting stories. She was so engrossed in the book that she didn't even realize how much time had passed. When she finished, she ran to her mom and said, "Thank you for permitting me to read that amazing book!"
