Once upon a time, there was a dark figure in the forest.
The figure was mysterious and nobody knew what it was.
One brave child wanted to find out, so he decided to try and answer.
The child stepped closer to the figure. He shouted out, "What are you?" 
The figure did not answer.
The little boy was scared, but he was determined to get an answer. The next time he shouted out, "Who are you?"
Suddenly, the figure replied in a deep and mysterious voice, "I am the night!"
The little boy's eyes were wide with shock and joy. He kept asking questions and the figure answered some of them.
The little boy was so proud that he had found the answer! He said his goodbyes to the dark figure and ran away, happy that he'd got his answer.
