Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a big farm. He had lots of animals like cows, pigs, and sheep. One day, he wanted to go to the store to buy some food for his animals. He got in his car and drove really fast. He liked to speed because it made him feel happy.
As he was driving, he saw a little bird on the side of the road. The bird looked sad and the farmer felt thoughtful. He stopped his car and got out to see if the bird was okay. The bird had hurt its wing and couldn't fly. The farmer took the bird back to his farm and took care of it until it was better.
From that day on, the farmer didn't speed anymore. He realized that it was more important to be kind and thoughtful to others, even if it meant taking things slower. The little bird became the farmer's friend and would visit him every day on the farm.
