Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her toys and sing songs. One day, Lily's dad asked her a question. He said, "Lily, what do you want for dinner?" Lily didn't answer because she was too busy playing. 
Later that day, Lily's dad was fixing something in the house with a hammer. Lily wanted to play with the hammer, but her dad said no because it was dangerous. Lily got angry and called her dad selfish. 
The next day, Lily's dad went to work and Lily was left alone. She wanted to play with the hammer again, so she snuck into her dad's toolbox and got it out. But when she was playing with it, she accidentally hit herself and got hurt. She cried and cried, but no one was there to answer her calls for help. 
From that day on, Lily learned that it's important to listen to her parents and not be selfish. She wished she had answered her dad's question and listened to him when he said no to playing with the hammer.
