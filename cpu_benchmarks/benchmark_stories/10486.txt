Once upon a time, there was a wild curtain. It seemed so fluffy and soft. One day a little girl named Lily decided to go explore it. She was very brave and curious. She carefully opened the curtain and entered a new world. Inside was a meadow full of flowers and a garden full of vegetables. Lily was so excited, she ran and ran and ran around the meadow and garden until she was tired. She felt so happy and content under the wild curtain, she decided to stay a while and explore.
