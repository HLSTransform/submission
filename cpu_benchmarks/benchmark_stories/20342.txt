Lily and Max were playing in the park with their toy automobiles. They liked to zoom them around on the grass and pretend they were on a big road. Lily had a red automobile and Max had a blue one. They were both shiny and fast.
"Look at my automobile, Lily!" Max said. "It can go very fast and make loud noises. Vroom, vroom!"
"Mine can do that too, Max!" Lily said. "But mine is also unique. It has a pink bow on the front and a sticker of a unicorn on the side. See?"
Max looked at Lily's automobile and nodded. "That is unique, Lily. But I like mine better. It is more cool and strong."
Lily and Max started to race their automobiles on the grass. They wanted to see who had the faster one. They zoomed and vroomed and laughed. But then they saw a big yellow sign on the grass. It said "Yield".
"What does that mean, Max?" Lily asked.
Max shrugged. "I don't know, Lily. Maybe it means we have to stop and let someone else go first."
"Who else, Max? There is no one else here."
"Maybe it is for the birds or the squirrels or the bugs. Maybe they want to cross the grass too."
Lily and Max looked around and saw some birds and squirrels and bugs on the grass. They decided to be nice and yield to them. They stopped their automobiles and waited for them to pass.
"Hello, birds and squirrels and bugs!" Lily and Max said. "We are yielding to you. You can cross the grass now."
The birds and squirrels and bugs looked at Lily and Max and their automobiles. They smiled and thanked them. They crossed the grass and went on their way.
Lily and Max felt happy. They learned a new word and made some new friends. They decided to share their automobiles and play together. They zoomed and vroomed and laughed some more. They had a lot of fun in the park.
