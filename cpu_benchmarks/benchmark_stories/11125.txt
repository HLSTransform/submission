Once upon a time, there was a wide tree. Under the tree, a man would sell things. One day, he had a violin to sell. A little girl saw the violin and wanted it. But she did not have enough money.
The girl went home and thought of ways to get money. She decided to sell her toys. She told her friends, and they wanted to help. They all sold their toys together. The girl knew she would soon have the violin.
The next day, the girl and her friends went to the wide tree. They had enough money to buy the violin. The man was happy to sell it to them. The girl played the violin and made beautiful music. Her friends danced and clapped. They were all so happy.
