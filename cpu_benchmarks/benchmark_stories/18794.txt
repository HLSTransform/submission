Lila likes to swing. She likes to feel the wind on her face and the sun on her hair. She likes to go high and low, fast and slow. She likes to swing with her friends and sing songs.
One day, Lila goes to the park with her mom and dad. They bring a big bag of rice. They want to feed the birds. Lila likes the birds. They are pretty and noisy. They have many colors and sounds.
Lila and her mom and dad walk to the pond. They see many birds. Ducks, geese, swans, pigeons. They open the bag of rice and throw some to the water. The birds come closer. They quack and honk and coo. They eat the rice and splash the water.
Lila laughs and claps. She wants to feed the birds too. She takes some rice from the bag and throws it to the air. The birds fly and catch the rice. They flap their wings and make more noise.
Lila sees a big swing near the pond. She runs to it and climbs on. She asks her dad to push her. He does. Lila swings and swings. She feels the wind on her face and the sun on her hair. She sees the birds in the sky and the water. She sings a song.
Lila is happy. She likes to swing. She likes to feed the birds. She likes the park. She likes her mom and dad. She has a good day.
