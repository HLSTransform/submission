Once upon a time, there was a big, red truck. The truck was made of strong steel and it could carry lots of things. One day, a man needed to move a heavy box, so he asked the truck for help. The truck used its strong wheels to pull the box onto its bed. 
After the man finished loading the box, he thanked the truck and gave it a spicy treat. The truck loved spicy snacks! As the truck drove away, it thought about how happy it was to help the man. From that day on, the truck knew that it was strong enough to pull anything that needed moving.
