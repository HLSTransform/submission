Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and make things with her hands. She was very creative! 
One day, Lily went to the park to play. There, she met a new friend named Timmy. They played together on the swings and the slide. 
After playing for a while, Timmy showed Lily a bow he had made out of sticks and string. Lily thought it was very cool and asked Timmy to show her how to make one too. 
Together, they gathered sticks and string and made bows of their own. Lily was very proud of her bow and showed it to everyone she met at the park that day. She was happy to have met a new friend and learned something new too!
