Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to share and have fun together. But then Lily saw a shiny car that Tom had. She wanted to play with it too.
"Tom, can I have the car?" Lily asked.
"No, it's mine. You have your own toys," Tom said.
Lily felt angry and sad. She tried to grab the car from Tom, but he held it tight. They started to pull and push each other. They both began to cry.
Mom heard the noise and came to see what was wrong. She saw Lily and Tom fighting over the car. She was not happy.
"Stop, stop! What are you doing?" Mom said. "Why are you crying?"
"Lily wants my car, but it's mine!" Tom said.
"I want the car, but Tom won't let me!" Lily said.
Mom sighed. She took the car from them and put it on the shelf. She hugged Lily and Tom and said, "Listen, my loves. You have many toys to play with. You don't need to fight over one car. Fighting makes you cry and hurts your feelings. Sharing makes you happy and friends. Do you want to be happy and friends?"
Lily and Tom nodded. They wiped their tears and said, "Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Lily. Sorry, Tom."
Mom smiled and said, "That's OK. I love you both. Now, why don't you play something else together? How about this puzzle? It has many pieces, so you can help each other."
Lily and Tom agreed. They took the puzzle and went to the floor. They started to fit the pieces and make a picture. They talked and laughed and helped each other. They felt happy and friends. They forgot about the car. They had peace.
