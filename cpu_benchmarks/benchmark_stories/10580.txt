Once upon a time there was a small boy who loved to wander. He lived in a big yellow house. He was always dropped off at a park near his house and he would wander around it.
One day he discovered a yellow apple tree. There were many yellow apples on the tree. He was so happy. He picked one off the tree and took a big bite out of it. It was so tasty and delicious.
He wanted to share it with his friends so he picked more apples from the tree and took them back to the park. He shared the yellow apples with all of his friends. Everyone thought they were so tasty.
He was so happy. He enjoyed his day wandering around the park with his friends and eating yellow apples. He couldn't wait to go back again.
