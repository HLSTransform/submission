Mummy and daddy took Anna to a big building. Anna had never been in such a big place before. Inside the building there were lots of people in rooms doing different things. 
Mummy said to Anna, "It's time for your piano lesson." They went to one of the rooms, where Anna saw a piano! 
Anna was very excited, so she clapped her hands. Mummy said, "It's time to study the piano." Anna was a bit confused, but then she sat down at the piano. 
Mummy said, "Let's start with the scale. Do you remember how to play the scale?" Anna tried very hard to remember, but she just couldn't do it. She was getting frustrated. 
Mummy said, "It's OK if you don't remember. Just try your best, Anna". Anna tried again and she finally played the scale correctly. She was so happy! 
Mummy said, "Well done, Anna! With a bit of practice, you'll be an amazing piano player!"
