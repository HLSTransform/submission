Once upon a time, there was a hunter. He had a weird job. Every day, he had to clean the forest. He had to take away all the big sticks and leaves. He had to make sure the animals had enough room to play. 
One day, while he was cleaning the forest, he found something very weird. It was a big rock! He had never seen a rock like this before. It was shaped like a triangle and even had a funny face on it. 
The hunter was curious so he decided to bring it home. At home, his children were very excited. They asked lots of questions about the weird rock. The hunter couldn’t answer any of them – he was as confused as his children! But what he did know was that the rock made for a great toy. 
After playing, the kids had to clean. They worked together to tidy the room, dust the shelves and make everything neat and tidy again. They had so much fun cleaning the room, even though it was a weird job. 
The End.
