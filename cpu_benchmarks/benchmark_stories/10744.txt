Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. One day, Mia decided to wander outside in her big backyard. She liked to look at the pretty flowers and chase the butterflies that flew by.
As Mia walked around, she found a small, unknown path. She followed the path and saw a tiny cut on a tree. Mia was curious and said, "I wonder who made this cut on the tree?" Just then, a friendly squirrel came down from the tree and said, "I made the cut, Mia. I was trying to find food."
Mia smiled and said, "Oh, I see! Well, I can help you find food!" So, Mia and the squirrel wandered together in the backyard, picking up nuts and berries. They had a fun day, and Mia made a new friend.
