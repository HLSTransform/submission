Once upon a time there was a group of friends. They were walking in the park one day when they noticed something mysterious. They went over to investigate and saw a large diamond. It was beautiful! 
One of the friends wanted the diamond for himself, so he grabbed it. The others hated him. They felt he was being very selfish.
The group decided to try and get the diamond back. They followed the greedy friend to his house and came up with a plan. When he opened his door, they jumped out and took the diamond from him. Everyone was happy again.
The mysterious diamond had brought the group of friends closer together, and they vowed to never let anyone take away something so valuable again.
