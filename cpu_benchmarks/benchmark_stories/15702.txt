Once upon a time there was a very special girl named Jane. Jane was a three year old with a very big dream. She wanted to win a crown! 
It was finally the day of the competition and Jane was so excited! Jane was competing with all the other children in her town and she knew it would be hard.
"Don't worry Jane," said her mom. "I know you will do great!"
Jane walked into the competition room with a big smile. She saw all the other children looking very competitive. But Jane wasn't afraid.
After everyone finished competing, it was time to give out awards. Jane was sweating and nervous. Then the leader of the competition announced that the winner of the crown was Jane! Everyone clapped and cheered.
Jane was so excited she could hardly believe it. She was the happiest and proudest three year old around. She decided to wear her crown everyday and never take it off!
