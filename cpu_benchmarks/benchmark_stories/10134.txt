Sara and Ben are twins, but they are very unique. Sara likes to paint and sing, and Ben likes to run and jump. They also have different colors of hair and eyes. Sara has brown hair and blue eyes, and Ben has blond hair and green eyes.
One day, they go to the park with their mom and dad. There is a lot of snow on the ground, and it is very cold. Sara and Ben want to play in the snow. They make a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They also make snowballs and throw them at each other. They laugh and have fun.
Then, they see a sign that says "Snowman Contest". It is a game where you can make a snowman and win a prize. Sara and Ben want to join the game. They ask their mom and dad if they can. Their mom and dad say yes, and they help them make another snowman.
Sara and Ben make a very unique snowman. They use powder to make it shiny and sparkly. They also use fruits and vegetables to make its face and buttons. They use a banana for its nose, grapes for its eyes, a carrot for its mouth, and corn for its buttons. They also use a broom for its arm and a bucket for its hat.
When they are done, they show their snowman to the judge. The judge is a nice lady who wears a red coat and a hat. She looks at all the snowmen in the park. She sees some big snowmen, some small snowmen, some funny snowmen, and some scary snowmen. But she likes Sara and Ben's snowman the best. She says it is the most unique snowman she has ever seen.
She gives Sara and Ben a blue ribbon and a big hug. She says they win the game. Sara and Ben are very happy. They thank the judge and their mom and dad. They also share their prize with their friends. Their prize is a big box of cookies. They eat some cookies and give some to their snowman. They say it is the best day ever.
