Once, there was a very adventurous girl. She wanted to explore the world and see new things all the time.
One day, she decided to go to the park. On her way there, she heard a strange sound. It sounded like birds talking. She walked toward the sound and saw two birds sitting on a tree branch.
The girl said to the two birds, "Hello, birds! I love exploring the world."
The two birds disagreed and started chirping loudly.
The girl shrugged her shoulders and said, "Well, if you don't want to explore the world, that's up to you. I am going to keep exploring."
The birds kept chirping and watched as the adventurous girl walked away. She still wanted to explore, despite what the birds had said.
