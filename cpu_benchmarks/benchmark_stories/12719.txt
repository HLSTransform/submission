Freddy was excited as he watched his mom work. She was using a special pen with different colored inks! Freddy asked if he could try. His mom said yes, and gave him a piece of paper and the pen.
He looked at the colorful inks and then started to draw. He smiled as he made some neat designs with the pen. He felt so proud of what he had created. Suddenly, his mom gasped and took the ink away from him.
Confused, Freddy looked at his mom. She said that he should never try to do that again. She explained that different colors of ink were for different kinds of work, and mixing them would make a big mess. Freddy said that he understood and then went back to coloring.
