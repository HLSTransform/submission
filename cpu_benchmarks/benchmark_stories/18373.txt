Once upon a time, there was a giant. The giant was very big and strong. But he was also very fearful. He was scared of many things. One day, the giant was walking in the forest. He saw a big lake. The giant was scared, but he wanted to bathe.
The giant put one big foot in the lake. It was cold! He was scared, but he wanted to be clean. So, he put his other big foot in the lake too. He was now in the water to bathe. The giant was still fearful, but he was brave.
After the giant was done, he felt very happy. He was not scared anymore. The giant learned that it was okay to be fearful, but it was also good to be brave. From that day on, the giant was not scared to bathe in the lake.
