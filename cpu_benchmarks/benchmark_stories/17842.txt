Once upon a time, there were two friends. They liked to do things together. One day, they had a new idea. They decided to join the yarn together.
The yarn was different colors - pink, yellow, blue, and green. They had to be careful and make sure the yarn stayed joined. It was a little difficult, but they didn't give up.
Finally, the yarn was connected! They felt very happy, and laughed a lot. They took the connected yarn and went to play. It was so much fun!
The two friends had a great day playing with the yarn. They would never forget the time they joined the yarn together.
