Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play dress-up and wear pretty dresses. One day, she put on her favorite pink dress and went outside to play.
But then, she saw two boys fighting over a toy. Lily didn't like fighting, so she went over to them and asked if they could share the toy. They stopped fighting and played together nicely.
After playing for a while, Lily noticed a nosy cat watching them from a nearby tree. She went over and petted the cat, and it purred happily.
Finally, it was time for Lily to go back inside. She took off her dress and put on her pajamas. She climbed into bed and fell asleep, dreaming of all the fun she had that day. The end.
