Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to wear pretty dresses and bows in her hair. One day, Lily's friends told her that her style was not cool. They said she should wear different clothes and not be herself. 
Lily felt scared and sad. She didn't want her friends to not like her anymore. So, she tried to change her style to fit in with her friends. But, she didn't feel happy anymore. 
One day, Lily's mom told her that it's important to be yourself and not change for others. She said that true friends will like you for who you are. Lily realized that her mom was right. She decided to go back to her own style and not be scared to be herself. Her friends saw how happy she was and learned that being yourself is always the best.
