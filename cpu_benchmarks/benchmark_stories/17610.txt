Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to eat apples and bananas. One day, her mom took her to the store to buy some more fruit. Lily saw a toy she wanted, but it cost too much money. She was sad because she couldn't buy it. 
Suddenly, Lily saw a boy who was embarrassed because he spilled his juice. She felt bad for him, so she shared her apple with him. The boy was happy and said thank you. 
Lily learned that helping others is better than buying things with a high price. She felt proud of herself for being kind to the boy. From that day on, she always shared her fruit with others.
