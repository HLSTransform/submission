Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy who loved their baby. One day, the baby was feeling wild. She wanted something very special. She looked at the sky and saw a helicopter up high. She demanded it!
Mommy and Daddy tried to explain that it was just flying in the sky. But the baby was so wild, she kept on demanding the helicopter. Mommy and Daddy knew that they had to do something special.
They got a big surprise for the baby. They took her outside and showed her a very special helicopter! The baby was so excited! The helicopter took the baby on a wild flying adventure. As they raced through the sky, the baby laughed and laughed.
When the baby finished her special adventure, she hugged Mommy and Daddy tightly. They were so happy the baby was happy. The wild baby was always demanding something special, but this time she was very pleased!
