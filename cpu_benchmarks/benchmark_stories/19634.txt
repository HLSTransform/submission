Nina was very popular at school. All her friends wanted to play with her. One day, she got a new toy car. It was red and shiny, and it had buttons that make funny sounds.
Nina was excited to show her friends. She got ready to use the car, but then she noticed the car was empty. She wondered how she could fill the car up.
Then she had an idea. She asked her friends to help her. She filled her car with lots of tiny rocks. Her friends all laughed when they saw that the car was too heavy to move.
Nina was not giving up. She emptied the car, and then she filled it with tiny pieces of paper. But the car still wouldn't move. Finally, Nina filled the car with feathers and it worked! The car moved around the room very slowly, but it was amazing.
 NIna shone the light on the car and added some speed. Now the car could go really fast and they played games with it all day. Everybody was happy. Nina was the most popular kid in school!
