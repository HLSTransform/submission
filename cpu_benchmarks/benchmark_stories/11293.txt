One day, there was a little girl playing in the park. It was hot outside, so she was hot too. Suddenly, she started to cry because she was feeling sad. But then, her mom came and comforted her. She gave her a hug and said 'It's ok, I'm here'. The little girl felt better.
Then, they went over to a cart. It was full of toys and candy! The little girl's eyes lit up and she smiled. She picked out her favorite toy and she felt happy again.
Next, they sat down in the shade of a big tree and had an ice cream. It was cold and it tasted so good. The little girl felt comforted again. Her mom hugged her and said 'I'm so happy that you're smiling again'. The little girl smiled a big smile and said 'me too!'.
