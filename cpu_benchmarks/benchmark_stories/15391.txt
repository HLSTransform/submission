Once upon a time, there were two friends. They loved to play together and always tried their best. One day they wanted to try something different. They asked their mommy if they could have a fight.
At first, their mommy said no, but after thinking about it, she said yes. The two friends were so excited. They ran to the backyard and started their fight.
They punched and kicked each other, trying so hard to see who was the winner. They were both so strong and determined. Everyone who watched them was very amazed.
After a long time, one of the friends won the fight. The other friend was very envious and sad. But in the end, they both hugged each other and smiled. They reassured each other that it was only a game and that they were still the best of friends.
