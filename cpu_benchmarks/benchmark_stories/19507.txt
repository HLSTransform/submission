Jill was feeling anxious. She had been dreading this day for weeks on end. It was her first day at school and she was so scared. 
Her teacher smiled at her and handed her a piece of chalk. She was excited to hold it in her hands. She grabbed it and tried to draw a picture of a flower on the blackboard. 
But no matter how hard she tried, her hand would not stay still. She was so nervous that the picture was a big mess.
Her teacher was kind and she helped Jill to find the courage she needed to finish the picture. Beautiful flowers soon appeared on the board.
Jill smiled at her handiwork, but before she could even finish going over the lines with red chalk, she lost her balance and fell. She was embarrassed, but the teacher comforted her and helped her back on her feet. 
Jill had come to this special day ready to learn and have some fun. All the anxiousness she felt that morning was gone, and she was ready to make her own flowers with the chalk.
