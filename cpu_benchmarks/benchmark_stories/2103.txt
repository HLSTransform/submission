Once upon a time, there were three little bears who lived in a big forest. One day, they decided to go on an adventure and pick some berries. They walked and walked until they found a big berry bush. But the bush was too tall for them to reach the berries. So, they decided to unite and stand on each other's shoulders to get the berries. They picked and picked until they had a big basket full of delicious berries. Suddenly, they heard a noise and saw a harmless rabbit hopping towards them. The bears shared their berries with the rabbit and they all became friends. From that day on, they went on many more adventures together.
