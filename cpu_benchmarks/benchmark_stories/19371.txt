Once there was a boy named Tim. He loved to swim in the ocean.
One day, he ventured out too far and the waves carried him further and further away from the shore.
He tried to swim back, but the current was too strong. He struggled and struggled until he was too tired. 
Suddenly, he was rescued by a fast boat. He looked out and saw the shore getting closer and closer. 
When they finally reached the shore, Tim thanked the people on the boat for helping him. 
He promised himself he would never swim too far out into the ocean again.
