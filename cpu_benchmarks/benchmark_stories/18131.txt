Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a purple dress that she loved to wear every day. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. She saw a big black dog and wanted to pet it, but her mother told her not to because it might bite her. 
Lily's friend, Timmy, came over and saw the dog too. He wanted to pet it, but his mother also said no. Timmy got mad and said, "I want to pet the dog! I don't care what my mom says!" 
Lily said, "You shouldn't do that, Timmy. If you don't listen to your mom, she might punish you." 
Timmy didn't want to listen to Lily and went to pet the dog anyway. But the dog didn't like it and barked loudly. Timmy got scared and ran away. Lily's mom came over and said, "See, Timmy got scared because he didn't listen. It's important to listen to your parents so you don't get hurt." 
Lily nodded and said, "I'm glad I listened. I don't want to get punished or hurt."
