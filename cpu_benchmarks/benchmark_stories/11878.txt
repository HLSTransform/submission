John was excited to peek inside the stable. He wanted to see the horses. He had never seen horses before and didn't know what to expect.
John slowly opened the stable door. Inside he saw a large, fair horse. He could tell the horse was strong and beautiful. He moved closer to get a better look and the horse neighed.
John was scared at first but he reached out to touch the horse. He started to pet her. But then the stable door slammed shut. He was locked inside!
John was scared and called for help. But no one came. He was stuck in the stable all night. Finally, the sun rose and the fair horse took John outside.
John was relieved but he was also sad. He knew he couldn't stay in the stable forever. The bad ending was that John had to leave the stable without getting to say goodbye to the beautiful, fair horse.
