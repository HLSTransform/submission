Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max loved to play in the yard. He would run and jump and chase his tail. But one day, Max felt sad. He didn't want to play anymore. He wanted to hide.
Max looked around the yard for a good hiding spot. He saw a big bush and thought it would be perfect. He crawled under the bush and waited. He felt safe and hidden.
After a few minutes, Max heard his owner calling his name. "Max, where are you?" Max didn't want to come out of his hiding spot. He felt too sad to play. But his owner found him and gave him a big hug. Max felt better knowing that he wasn't alone.
