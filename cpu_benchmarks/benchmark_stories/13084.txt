Once there was a young girl called Mia. She loved to climb up the big oak tree in the garden. Every day, she would balance on the thick vine and go as high as she could go.
One time, Mia saw a big bird in the tree. She wanted to be friends with it, so she balanced carefully on the vine and made her way closer. She smiled as the bird started chirping at her.
Mia soon became very good at balancing on the vine. She could spread her arms wide and keep her balance for a long time. She had so much fun being with the bird that she kept going higher and higher!
But then one day the vine suddenly broke. Mia suddenly felt herself falling and the bird was screeching above her. But just before she hit the ground, Mia grabbed one of the branches and held on tightly. She managed to save herself and balance carefully back on the ground.
Mia was so glad that she was safe. She waved goodbye to her bird friend and rushed inside to tell her parents what had happened. From then on, Mia made sure to stay close to the ground when she was playing.
