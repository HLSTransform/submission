Once upon a time, there was a big room. In the middle of the room was a big open microphone. One day, a little boy named Jack went to the room. He saw the open microphone and he was very excited. He walked up to the microphone and said "hello". 
Then, a beautiful angel appeared. The angel said to Jack, "I am so happy to meet you". Jack was so amazed and he said "Wow, this is so cool". The angel and Jack became fast friends.
Jack and the angel talked for a long time. They talked about all kinds of things. Jack asked questions and the angel answered. He was so happy to meet the angel.
After a while, Jack and the angel had to leave. Jack waved goodbye and said, "It was so nice to meet you". The angel smiled and said, "I hope to see you again soon". And they both left the big open room.
