Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the grass and listen to the crickets chirp. One day, she found a cricket that was very slow and couldn't hop like the other crickets. Lily felt sad for the cricket and decided to take care of it. 
She brought the cricket inside and gave it some water and food. Then, Lily asked her mom if they could bake some cookies for the cricket. Her mom said yes, so they started to mix the ingredients together. Lily loved to help her mom bake, especially when they got to use the big mixing bowl. 
After they baked the cookies, they gave one to the cricket. The cricket loved it and started to chirp happily. Lily was so happy that she could help the slow cricket and make it feel better. From that day on, Lily would always listen to the cricket chirp and smile, knowing that she had helped a little creature in need.
