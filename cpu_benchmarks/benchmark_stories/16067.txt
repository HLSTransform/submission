Once, there was a strong man who lived in the city. Everyday, the man went for a walk with his wallet. One day, the man passed an old man and the old man made a joke. The man laughed and said, "That was a very funny joke". 
The old man replied, "Thank you, I can always make people laugh. I have many jokes". Then, he looked at the strong man's wallet and said, "You have a nice wallet, can I see it?" 
The man opened his wallet and the old man said, "Ah, now this is a nice wallet". Then, the old man put a tiny imaginary bug inside the man's wallet and said, "This little bug will bring you lots of luck". 
The man was very thankful and thanked the old man. He kept the wallet with the little bug inside with him and he said goodbye to the old man. From that day onward, the man always felt strong and lucky.
