One day, a little bird named Tim was flying in the sky. He loved to sing his favorite song. As he flew, he saw a big, smelly shoe on the ground. Tim was curious and wanted to see the shoe up close.
He flew down and landed on the shoe. "Ew, this is very smelly!" said Tim. Just then, a friendly frog named Sam hopped by. "Hi, I'm Sam!" said the frog. "What are you doing on that smelly shoe?"
"I wanted to see it, but now I want to go," said Tim. As he tried to fly away, his foot began to slip on the shoe. "Help!" Tim cried. Sam quickly hopped over and helped Tim get his foot unstuck.
"Thank you, Sam!" said Tim. "You're welcome," replied Sam. "Now, let's go play somewhere that's not so smelly!" They both laughed and hopped away to play together, and Tim sang his favorite song as they went.
