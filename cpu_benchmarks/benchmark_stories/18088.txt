Once upon a time, there was a kind bear named Ted. He loved to eat jelly sandwiches every day. One day, while he was eating his sandwich, he heard a loud snap. It was his favorite spoon that broke! 
Ted was sad because he loved that spoon. So, he went to his friend, a wise owl, to ask for help. The owl told him that he could fix the spoon with some glue. 
Ted was happy because he could use his favorite spoon again. He thanked the owl for his kind help and went back home to enjoy his jelly sandwich with his fixed spoon. From that day on, Ted was careful not to snap his spoon again.
