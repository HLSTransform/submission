Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a great day at the park with her friends. They played on the swings and went down the slide. When it was time to go home, Lily's mom asked her to help cut some vegetables for dinner. Lily was happy to help and used a big knife to cut the carrots and potatoes.
Later that night, Lily went to turn off the lights in her room. She couldn't reach the knob to turn it off, so her dad came in to help. He showed her how to use the knob to turn the light off. Lily was proud that she learned something new and went to bed with a smile on her face. The end.
