One day, a little girl was playing with her string. She loved it so much and was grateful for it. She spun it around her body and laughed as it flew in the air. Suddenly, she sneezed! She was so surprised and laughed all the more. She felt the sneeze tickle her nose and made her eyes water. She then opened her eyes and saw the string was tangled around her. She quickly untangled it and said thank you for the surprise that made her laugh even more. She was so very grateful for her string. The end.
