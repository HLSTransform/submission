One day, a little dog named Spot went for a walk. Spot was a happy dog, but today he felt a bit sad. The wind was bitter and cold, and made Spot shiver. As he walked, he saw a big tree. Spot thought, "I will lay under the tree to hide from the wind."
Under the tree, Spot saw a big red ball. He was very excited because he loved to play with balls. Spot picked up the ball and ran around the tree. He was so happy that he forgot about the cold wind. Then, a little girl named Lily came to the tree.
"Hi, Spot!" said Lily. "I lost my ball. Have you seen it?" Spot wagged his tail and showed Lily the big red ball. "Thank you, Spot!" said Lily. They played with the ball together, and Spot was not sad anymore. The bitter wind did not bother them, because they were having so much fun.
