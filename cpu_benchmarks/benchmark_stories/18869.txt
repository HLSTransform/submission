Lila and Ben like to play in the snow. They make snowballs and snowmen and snow forts. They have fun and laugh a lot.
One day, they see a big lake with ice on top. They wonder if they can walk on the ice. They go closer and touch the ice. It is cold and hard and shiny.
Lila says, "Let's try to walk on the ice. It looks like fun." Ben says, "OK, but be careful. The ice might break." They hold hands and step on the ice. It makes a cracking sound. They giggle and take another step.
Suddenly, the ice snaps under their feet. They fall into the water. It is very cold and wet and scary. They scream for help.
A man hears them and runs to the lake. He has a long stick. He throws the stick to Lila and Ben. He says, "Grab the stick. I will pull you out." Lila and Ben grab the stick. The man pulls them out of the water. He wraps them in a warm blanket. He says, "You are safe now. Don't ever walk on the ice again. It is very dangerous." Lila and Ben say, "Thank you. You are very kind and useful." They hug the man and go home with him. They learn a lesson and never walk on the ice again.
