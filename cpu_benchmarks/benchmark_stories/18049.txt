Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to ride his bike every day. One day, he went to the park to ride his bike. He saw his friend, Johnny, and said, "Hi Johnny, do you want to ride bikes with me?" Johnny said, "Yes, I do!" 
They rode their bikes together and had so much fun. They went all the way around the park and even found a new way to ride. Timmy said, "This way is so cool! I'm sorry I didn't show you before." Johnny said, "That's okay, I'm just happy we found it now!" 
After they were done riding, they sat down on the grass and talked. Timmy said, "I'm sorry if I ever hurt your feelings before." Johnny said, "It's okay, I forgive you." They both smiled and knew they would always be best friends.
