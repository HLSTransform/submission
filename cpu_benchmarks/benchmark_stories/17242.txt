Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toy pistol. He would pretend to be a cowboy and shoot bad guys.
One day, Timmy's friend Johnny came over to play. Johnny wanted to play with Timmy's pistol, but Timmy didn't want to share. They started to argue.
"I want to play with the pistol," Johnny said.
"No, it's mine," Timmy answered.
Johnny got angry and started to cry. Timmy felt bad and realized he should share his toys with his friend.
"Okay, you can play with the pistol," Timmy said. "But you have to be careful and not break it."
Johnny was happy and they played together, having a perfect time.
