Ben and Mia like to ride their bikes in the park. They have red bikes with bells and baskets. They go fast and ring their bells. They see many things in the park: trees, flowers, dogs, birds.
One day, they see a big hill. Ben says, "Let's ride down the hill. It will be fun." Mia says, "No, Ben. The hill is too high and steep. It is not safe." Ben says, "Don't be scared, Mia. I will go first and show you." Mia says, "OK, Ben. But be careful."
Ben rides his bike to the top of the hill. He looks down and sees a rough path with rocks and holes. He thinks, "This will be fun." He pushes his bike and goes down the hill. He goes very fast and feels the wind in his hair. He rings his bell and shouts, "Whee!"
But then, he sees something on the path. It is a big olive. Someone dropped it from their picnic. Ben tries to avoid the olive, but he can't. His bike hits the olive and slips. Ben falls off his bike and rolls down the hill. He hurts his head, his arms, his legs. He cries, "Ow, ow, ow!"
Mia sees Ben fall and cries, "Ben, Ben, are you OK?" She runs down the hill to help him. She sees blood and dirt on him. She is very scared and sad. She says, "Ben, I told you not to ride down the hill. It was not safe. Why did you not listen to me?" Ben says, "I'm sorry, Mia. I wanted to have fun. But I was wrong. The olive made me fall. It was a bad olive." Mia says, "It's OK, Ben. I forgive you. But we need to get help. You need a doctor." She hugs him and calls for help. The end.
