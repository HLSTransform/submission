Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was very shy. She lived near a big cross in the park. Every day, she would go to the park to look at the cross and feel so happy.
One day, the little girl was very brave. She went up to the cross and smiled. She held up her arms and smiled. Then, she started to display her happy dance. She jumped up and down, waving her arms around. Everyone in the park was so happy.
The little girl danced for a long time. When she was done, she was so proud of herself. The cross had seen her display her happy dance, and so had the other people in the park. The little girl walked away with a big smile on her face.
