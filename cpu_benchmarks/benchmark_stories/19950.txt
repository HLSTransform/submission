Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with blocks. They make towers and bridges and houses. They have fun.
One day, they see an ant on the floor. The ant is small and black. It walks fast. Tom and Sam are curious. They want to see the ant better.
"Look, an ant!" Tom says.
"Let's catch it!" Sam says.
They run after the ant. They try to grab it with their hands. But the ant is too quick. It runs away.
"Let's use a block!" Tom says. He picks up a block. He tries to drop it on the ant. But he misses. The block falls on the floor. It makes a loud noise.
"Oops!" Tom says.
"Let's add another block!" Sam says. He picks up another block. He tries to drop it on the ant. But he misses too. The block falls on the floor. It makes another loud noise.
"Oops!" Sam says.
The ant is scared. It runs under the sofa. Tom and Sam can't see it anymore.
"Where is the ant?" Tom asks.
"I don't know. It's gone." Sam says.
They look at the blocks on the floor. They are sad. They broke their towers and bridges and houses.
"That was a stupid idea." Tom says.
"Yes, it was. Let's not do that again." Sam says.
They pick up the blocks. They start to build again. They are careful. They don't chase the ant anymore. They have fun.
