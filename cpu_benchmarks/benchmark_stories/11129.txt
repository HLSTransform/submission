One day, a little puppy named Max was very excited. He wanted to play with his friends in the park. Max loved to run, jump, and dive into the grass. He told his mom, "I want to play with my friends today!"
Max's mom said, "Okay, but be careful near the pond. You might slip and fall in!" Max nodded and ran to the park. He saw his friends playing near the pond. They were all having fun.
Max played with his friends, running and jumping around. Then, he saw a big ball near the pond. Max got excited and ran to get the ball. He forgot what his mom said about being careful. Max took a big dive to catch the ball, but he slipped and fell into the pond. His friends helped him out, and Max learned to always listen to his mom.
