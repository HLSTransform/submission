Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy and his mommy wanted to go to the zoo. They got a ticket and went inside. The animals were so lively and made Timmy very happy. He saw monkeys, lions, and even a big elephant. 
Timmy's mommy told him to stay close to her so he wouldn't get lost. Timmy listened and held his mommy's hand tight. They walked around the zoo and saw many different animals. Timmy loved the zoo and wanted to stay there forever. But when it was time to go home, he was very tired and fell asleep in the car.
