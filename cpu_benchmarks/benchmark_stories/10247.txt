Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going on car rides with her mommy and daddy. One day, they went on a long drive to the park. Lily was eager to play on the swings and slide.
When they arrived, Lily's daddy parked the car and told her to release her seat belt. "Can I go play now?" asked Lily. "Not yet, we have to get your stroller out of the trunk first," replied her mommy.
Lily patiently waited until her mommy released the stroller from the trunk. "Yay, let's go to the swings!" Lily exclaimed. She sat in her stroller and her mommy pushed her to the playground. Lily had so much fun playing and swinging that she didn't want to leave. But eventually, her mommy said it was time to go home. "Okay, bye-bye swings," said Lily as she waved goodbye.
