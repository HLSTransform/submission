Once upon a time, in a tidy farm, there lived a little girl named Lily. She had a pet cow named Moo. They loved to play together. Every day, they would go to the big hay pile near the barn to play.
One sunny day, Lily and Moo found a big stick. They decided to play a new game. They put the stick in the hay and started to spin it. The hay spun and spun, and it became a big mess. Lily and Moo were having so much fun.
But then, Lily's mom came and saw the messy hay. She was not happy. She told Lily and Moo that they needed to clean up the mess. Lily and Moo felt sad. They worked together to make the hay tidy again. They learned that they should not make a mess when they play. And from that day on, Lily and Moo always cleaned up after themselves.
