Lily and Max were best friends. They liked to play with dolls and cars and books. They always shared their toys and snacks. They were very happy.
One day, Lily had a bad nightmare. She dreamed that a big monster came and took all her toys and Max away. She woke up and cried. She ran to her mom and dad and told them what she saw.
"Don't worry, Lily. It was just a bad dream. Nothing can hurt you here. Max is safe too. Do you want to call him and say hello?" her mom said.
Lily nodded and smiled. She loved to talk to Max. Her mom gave her the phone and dialed Max's number. Lily waited for Max to answer.
But Max did not answer. Instead, a loud roar came from the phone. It was the monster from Lily's nightmare. It had found Max and his toys. It was angry and hungry. It wanted to eat Lily too.
Lily screamed and dropped the phone. She was very scared. She hugged her mom and dad. But they could not help her. The monster was coming for her. It broke the door and entered the house. It was big and ugly and mean. It saw Lily and smiled.
"Hello, Lily. I have been looking for you. You have such adorable toys. And such an adorable friend. But now they are mine. And you are mine too. Come here and share your snack with me." the monster said.
Lily cried and shook her head. She did not want to share anything with the monster. She wanted Max and her toys back. She wanted the nightmare to end. But it was too late. The monster grabbed her and ate her. The end.
