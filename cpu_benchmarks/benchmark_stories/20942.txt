Once upon a time there was a tiny berry, who loved to hug. It was so modest, living all by itself in the forest. Every day, it would hug the trees and logs, just to stay happy.
One day, an animal came by and glanced at the berry. The animal told it, "I have a surprise for you. I will bring it tomorrow." The little berry was so excited!
The next day, the animal came back and said, "I have a big hug for you!" He gave the berry a hug and the berry felt so much joy! It hugged the animal tight, never wanting to let go.
The animal hugged back and said "I am glad you liked it. I thought you may need a hug like this." The berry was so thankful for the surprise and for the animal's kindness. And that's why the berry continued to hug each day.
