Once upon a time, there was a humble bug named Zip. Zip loved to go on journeys. One day, Zip decided to go on a big journey to find a new home.
On his journey, Zip met a big bird. The bird said, "Hi, Zip! Where are you going?" Zip said, "I am on a journey to find a new home." The big bird said, "I can help you. Hop on my back and we will find a new home together."
Zip and the big bird flew high in the sky. They saw many homes, but none were right for Zip. Then, they saw a big tree. Zip said, "That tree looks like a good home for me." The big bird said, "Okay, let's go down and see."
As they got closer to the tree, a mean cat saw them. The cat jumped up and caught the big bird. Zip fell off the bird's back and landed on the ground. Zip was sad and scared. He had lost his new friend and did not find a new home.
