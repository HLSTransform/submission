Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a red dress that she loved to wear. One day, Lily went to a big palace with her mommy and daddy. Inside the palace, there were many rooms with pretty decorations.
In one room, there was a big table with lots of food. Lily wanted to taste everything! She tried the sweet cake and the juicy fruit. She even tried the spicy sauce, but it was too hot for her. 
After eating, Lily explored more of the palace. She saw a big red carpet and a throne fit for a king. Lily felt like a princess in the palace. She was so happy to have visited such a beautiful place with her family.
