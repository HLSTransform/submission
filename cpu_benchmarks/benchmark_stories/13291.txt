Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to dance. She danced all day, every day. She would dance in the morning, in the afternoon, and even at night. She was always happy when she danced.
One day, Mia felt very tired. She had danced all day long and her legs were sore. Mia's mom saw her and said, "Mia, you look tired. You should rest now." Mia nodded and went to her room to sleep.
That night, Mia had a dream. She dreamed about a big dance party. All her friends were there, and they were dancing together. Mia was so happy. When she woke up, she remembered her dream and smiled. She couldn't wait to dance again with her friends.
