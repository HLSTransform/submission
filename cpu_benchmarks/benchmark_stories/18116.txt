Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived with her parent in a big house. One day, Lily found a fake bird in the garden. She thought it was real, but her parent told her it was just a toy. 
Lily wanted to play with the fake bird, so she took it inside the house. She tried to make it whistle like a real bird, but it wouldn't make any sound. Her parent then showed her how to whistle, and they both whistled together. 
Lily was so happy that she could whistle like her parent. She played with the fake bird for a while, but then she realized that it wasn't as fun as playing with real birds outside. So, she went back to the garden to look for some real birds to whistle with.
