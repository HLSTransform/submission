Sara and Ben like to play with snow. They make a big structure with snow. They make a snowman. The snowman has a hat, a scarf, a carrot nose and two rocks for eyes.
"Hello, snowman!" Sara says. "You are our friend."
"Yes, you are very nice," Ben says. "We will play with you every day."
But the sun is hot. The sun makes the snow melt. The snowman starts to get smaller and smaller. His hat falls off. His scarf slides down. His nose drops to the ground. His eyes roll away.
"Oh no, snowman!" Sara cries. "You are melting!"
"Please don't go, snowman!" Ben says. "We love you!"
But the snowman cannot talk. He cannot stay. He melts away. Sara and Ben are sad. They hug each other.
"Maybe we can make another snowman when it snows again," Sara says.
"Maybe," Ben says. "But we will always remember this snowman. He was our friend."
