Once upon a time, there was a poor farmer who had a lot of sheep. He loved his sheep very much and took care of them every day. One day, he needed to buy some food for his sheep but he didn't have any money. He went to the store and asked the lady if he could pay her later.
The lady was kind and understood the poor farmer's situation. She said he could pay her later and gave him the food for his sheep. The farmer was very happy and thanked the lady. He went back to his farm and fed his sheep.
The sheep were very happy too because they had food to eat. They bleated and jumped around in the field. The farmer smiled and watched his sheep play. He knew he had to work hard to pay the lady back, but he was grateful for her kindness.
