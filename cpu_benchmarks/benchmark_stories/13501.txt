Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to draw. She drew pictures of flowers, animals, and even her family. One day, she drew a beautiful picture of a rainbow.
Lily's mom saw the picture and said, "Wow, Lily! You are so creative! This picture is amazing!"
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, Mommy!"
Later that day, Lily saw her friend Sarah crying. When she asked what was wrong, Sarah said she lost her favorite toy. Lily wanted to help, so she gave Sarah her own favorite toy to make her feel better.
Sarah smiled and said, "Thank you, Lily! You are such a kind owner of your toys."
Lily felt happy that she could make her friend feel better. She learned that giving to others can make them happy and that being kind is always a good thing. The end.
