Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and paint all day long. One day, her mom said, "Lily, it's time to shut off the TV and do something creative." 
Lily got out her paints and started to draw a picture of a flower. She loved to use lots of colors and make her pictures very pretty. Suddenly, her mom said, "Lily, can you hear that bird singing outside?" 
Lily listened and heard the bird too. She said, "Yes, mommy. It's singing a pretty song." Her mom replied, "That's right, Lily. It's nice to use our ears and listen to the sounds around us." 
Lily finished her painting and showed it to her mom. Her mom said, "Wow, Lily! You're so creative. I love your painting." Lily smiled and said, "Thanks, mommy. I love to draw and paint."
