Sara and Ben were at the park with their mom. They saw a big maze made of green bushes. They wanted to play in it.
"Can we go in the maze, mom?" Sara asked.
"Sure, but be careful and stay together," mom said. "I will observe you from here."
Sara and Ben ran into the maze. They turned left and right, looking for a way out. They saw many flowers and birds in the maze. They also saw other kids playing.
"Hello, I'm Sara. This is my brother Ben," Sara said to a girl with a red hat.
"Hi, I'm Lily. Do you want to play with me?" the girl said.
"Yes, please. Do you know how to get out of the maze?" Ben asked.
"I think so. Follow me," Lily said.
Lily led them to a big sign that said "Exit". They walked out of the maze and saw mom waiting for them.
"Did you have fun?" mom asked.
"Yes, mom. We made a new friend. Her name is Lily. She showed us the way out of the maze. She is very fair," Sara said.
"That's nice. Do you want to play some more?" mom asked.
"Yes, mom. Can we go on the swings?" Ben asked.
"Sure, let's go," mom said.
Sara, Ben, and Lily ran to the swings. They took turns pushing each other. They laughed and had a good time. Mom observed them and smiled. She was happy to see them enjoy the park.
