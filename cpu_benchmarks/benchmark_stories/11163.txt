Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to cook. One day, she wanted to make a cake, but her mom was using the stove to make dinner. 
Lily asked her mom, "Can I use the stove to make my cake?" 
Her mom replied, "Not right now, sweetie. But why don't you be creative and find another way to make your cake?" 
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "I can use the microwave!" 
Her mom smiled and said, "That's a great idea, Lily. You can yield a delicious cake in the microwave." 
So Lily got to work and made a yummy cake in the microwave. Her mom was so proud of her creative thinking and delicious cake. They enjoyed it together for dessert that night.
