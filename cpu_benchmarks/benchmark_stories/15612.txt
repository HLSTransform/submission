Lila and Ben were twins, but they were very different. Lila liked to play with dolls and dress up. Ben liked to play with cars and trucks. One day, they went to the park with their mom. They saw a big slide and a swing and a sandbox.
"Let's go on the slide!" Lila said. She ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. She slid down with a big smile.
"Let's go on the swing!" Ben said. He ran to the swing and pushed it with his feet. He swung high and low with a big laugh.
They played for a long time, until they heard their mom call them.
"Time to go home, kids!" she said. "It's getting cold and dark."
Lila and Ben ran to their mom. They saw that she had a bag with them.
"What's in the bag, mom?" Lila asked.
"Some beans for dinner," mom said. "They are warm and yummy."
Lila and Ben liked beans. They shivered in the cold air and hugged their mom.
"Can we have some beans now, mom?" Ben asked.
"Not now, sweetie," mom said. "We have to cook them first. But you can have a cookie if you want."
Lila and Ben smiled. They took a cookie from the bag and ate it. They liked cookies too.
They walked home with their mom, holding her hands. They were different, but they loved each other and their mom. They were happy.
