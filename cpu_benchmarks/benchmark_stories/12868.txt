Once there was a puppy. His name was Bob. Bob was very playful. He loved to explore and sniff things. One day he found a big tail. He thought it was very fun and grabbed it with his teeth. He started to pull it, but it was attached to something bigger. Bob was very embarrassed! It turns out the tail belonged to a large bear. The bear was very angry. He growled and tried to swat Bob away. Bob quickly ran away, but couldn't forget how embarrassed he felt. 
He learned his lesson to be more careful and avoid embarrassment. From then on, Bob was very careful whenever he stumbled upon something playful.
