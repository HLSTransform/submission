Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to look up at the stars and dream about flying to a planet far away. One day, she asked her mom, "Can we go on a spaceship to visit a planet?"
Her mom replied, "We can't go to a planet, but we can learn about them. Let's sort these pictures of planets by their colors." Lily eagerly helped her mom sort the pictures.
Later that day, they went to the park and saw a boy crying. Lily asked him what was wrong. The boy said his toy had broken. Lily felt compassionate and gave him her favorite toy to play with. The boy stopped crying and smiled.
Lily's mom was proud of her kind heart and said, "You are a very compassionate girl, Lily." Lily smiled and looked up at the sky, dreaming of the day she could visit a planet and make new friends.
