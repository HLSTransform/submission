Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park near their home. One day, they saw a big map of the world on a wall. It had many colors and shapes.
"What is that?" Lily asked.
"That is a map. It shows all the countries in the world," Ben said.
"What is a country?" Lily asked.
"A country is a big place where many people live. They have different names and languages and flags," Ben said.
"Wow, that is cool. Can we go to a country?" Lily asked.
"Maybe when we are older. But we have to be careful. Some countries are not nice. They can hurt us or take our things," Ben said.
Lily looked at the map. She pointed at a green shape.
"What about that country? It looks nice and green. Is it harmless?" she asked.
Ben looked at the shape. He shook his head.
"No, that is a bad country. They are mean and scary. They have big guns and bombs. We should never go there," he said.
Lily felt sad. She liked the green color. She wanted to see the country.
"But maybe they are not all bad. Maybe some of them are nice and friendly. Maybe they want to play with us," she said.
Ben frowned. He did not like Lily's idea.
"No, they are not. They are our enemies. We should not talk to them or forgive them. They are bad, bad, bad," he said.
Lily and Ben started to argue. They raised their voices and pushed each other. They were not friends anymore.
A lady saw them fighting. She came over and stopped them.
"What is going on here? Why are you fighting?" she asked.
Lily and Ben told her about the map and the country. The lady smiled.
"I see. Well, you know what? That country is not bad. It is actually very nice. I know because I come from there. I am from the green country," she said.
Lily and Ben were surprised. They looked at the lady. She did not look mean or scary. She looked kind and gentle. She had a pretty dress and a smile.
"Really? You are from the green country?" Lily asked.
"Yes, I am. And I am not your enemy. I am your friend. I came here to visit and learn. I like your country too. It is also nice and colorful. There are many good people here, like you," she said.
Lily and Ben felt ashamed. They had been wrong about the country and the lady. They had been rude and mean.
"I am sorry. I was wrong. I did not know. I should not have fought with you," Lily said.
"Me too. I am sorry. I was wrong. I did not know. I should not have fought with you," Ben said.
They hugged each other and said sorry. They were friends again.
The lady smiled. She was happy.
"That is good. I am glad you are friends again. You know, the world is a big and beautiful place. There are many countries and people. They are different, but they are also the same. They all want to be happy and safe and loved. They all have feelings and dreams and hopes. They all can be good and kind and helpful. They all can be friends. We should not judge them by their colors or shapes or names. We should learn about them and respect them and forgive them. We should be peaceful and friendly and happy. That is the best way to live," she said.
Lily and Ben nodded. They agreed with the lady. They learned a big lesson that day. They thanked the lady and said goodbye. They went back to play in the park. They looked at the map again. They saw many colors and shapes. They saw many countries and people. They saw many friends.
