Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to cook with her mom in the kitchen. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help make spaghetti for dinner. Lily was so excited to help!
As they were cooking, Lily accidentally made a messy sauce spill on the counter. "Uh oh, Mommy! I made a mess!" she said. 
"It's okay, Lily. Let's clean it up together," her mom replied. 
After they cleaned up the messy sauce, Lily's mom showed her how to make a loop with the spaghetti on her fork. "Look, Lily! You made a loop! Great job!" her mom exclaimed. 
Lily was so happy and proud of herself for helping cook dinner and making a loop with her spaghetti. She couldn't wait to eat it and tell her dad all about her cooking adventure.
