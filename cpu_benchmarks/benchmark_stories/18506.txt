Lila and Ben are best friends. They like to play together every day. They have a task to do. They have to clean their room before they can go outside.
But Lila and Ben are very tired. They want to take a nap. They lie down on their bed and close their eyes. They dream of a big adventure.
In their dream, they are pirates. They sail on a ship with a loyal parrot. They look for treasure on an island. They fight with a mean crocodile. They find a chest full of gold and jewels.
"Wow, this is so fun!" Lila says.
"Yes, we are the best pirates ever!" Ben says.
They hear a loud noise. It is their mom. She knocks on the door.
"Lila, Ben, wake up! It's time to clean your room!" she says.
Lila and Ben open their eyes. They see their toys and clothes all over the floor.
"Oh no, we forgot our task!" Lila says.
"Maybe we can do it later?" Ben says.
"No, we have to do it now. Or we can't go outside." Lila says.
They get up and start to tidy their room. They put their toys in the box and their clothes in the closet. They make their bed and fluff their pillows.
They finish their task. They are proud of themselves.
"Good job, Lila and Ben!" their mom says. "Now you can go outside and play."
They run to the door. They grab their hats and their loyal parrot.
"Thank you, mom!" they say.
They go outside and play. They pretend to be pirates again. They have a lot of fun.
They are happy. They are best friends.
