Ana was at the zoo with her parents. She was so excited to see the animals.
As she walked by the gorilla enclosure, she blinked her big eyes wide open. She had never seen one before.
Suddenly, there was a deep growl. Ana jumped back in surprise. She looked up and saw a big gorilla standing in front of her. It was so tall!
Ana asked her mom, "What do I do?"
Her mom said, "It's okay. He's a very spoiled gorilla. Just smile at him"
Ana smiled and blinked her eyes. The gorilla smiled back and went back to playing with his friends.
Ana was happy. She had just made a new friend!
