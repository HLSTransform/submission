Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. One day, Jack was playing in his room when he found a mysterious box. It was big and made of wood. Jack wondered what was inside the box, so he opened it and found that it was full of toys! He was so excited and he wanted to keep them all. 
But then he remembered something his mom said. She said, "Always keep your toys hidden!" So Jack decided to hide the box in his closet and keep the keys with him in his pocket. That way he could open the box whenever he wanted and still keep it hidden. 
When his mom came home, she asked Jack what he was doing. Jack said, "I found a box full of toys and I'm keeping it hidden in my closet." His mom smiled and said, "That's a very good idea. That way, you can play with them whenever you want without anyone knowing!" 
Jack hugged his mom and went back to his room to play with the secret box of toys. And he kept his toys hidden forever!
