Once upon a time, there was a fisherman named Jack. Jack was very hairy and had a big beard. One day, Jack went to the lake to catch some fish. He wore his favorite hat and coat.
As he was fishing, a little girl named Lily came by. "Hi, Mr. Fisherman! What are you doing?" she asked. "I'm trying to catch some fish for dinner," Jack replied.
Lily looked at Jack's hairy face and giggled. "You look funny with all that hair!" she said. Jack laughed and said, "I know, but it keeps me warm when I'm out here fishing."
After a while, Jack caught a big fish. "Wow, that's a big one!" Lily exclaimed. "Can I help you carry it back to your house?" Jack smiled and said, "Sure, that would be great!" Together, they carried the fish back to Jack's house and had a delicious dinner.
