Maury had a basketball. He wanted to play with it, but it was dirty. So he found a bucket and some soap, and he began to clean.
He scrubbed and scrubbed, but the dirt was tough. He kept scrubbing, though, even when his arms hurt. Finally, with one last scrub, the dirt was gone.
The basketball was clean and shiny now. Maury was so happy, he couldn't wait to play with it. He dribbled it all around the house, and his parents cheered. He had worked so hard to make it clean.
It was the best game of basketball ever. Maury and his parents played together, and had so much fun. They all thanked Maury for his hard work. His basketball was clean and ready for lots of games!
