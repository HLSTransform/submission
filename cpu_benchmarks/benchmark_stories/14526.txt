Once there was a happy little girl. She wanted to build something with her friends. So she asked her mom for some clay.
The clay was soft and smooth. The little girl took it outside with her friends.
They started to build with the clay. They made a tower that was tall and strong. They were so proud of their tower.
Then they made a tooth out of the clay. They made it so clear that it sparkled in the sunshine.
The little girl was so proud of her tooth. She took it home with her. Now she has a beautiful clear tooth sitting on her dresser.
