Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her fragile doll. One day, Lily's mom told her that they were going to visit her grandma. Lily got worried because she didn't want to leave her doll behind. 
"Mommy, can I bring my doll with me?" Lily asked.
"I'm sorry sweetie, but we can't bring fragile things on the trip," her mom replied.
Lily was sad but understood that her doll couldn't come. Later, her mom permitted her to bring her favorite stuffed animal instead. Lily was happy again and hugged her mom. "Thank you, mommy!" she said.
When they arrived at grandma's house, Lily showed her the stuffed animal. "Look, grandma! Mommy permitted me to bring him with me!" she exclaimed.
Grandma smiled and said, "He looks like a great companion for your trip. Don't worry, your doll will be safe at home." 
Lily was relieved and enjoyed playing with her stuffed animal during the visit. When they returned home, she ran to her room to check on her doll. She was happy to see that her doll was still in one piece.
