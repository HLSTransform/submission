Once there was a girl and her name was Jane. Jane was three years old and she lived with her family. One day, Jane's family gave her a scooter for her birthday. She was so excited and couldn't wait to try it out! 
So she went outside and put on her helmet. Then she got on her scooter and started riding around. She felt so fast and free! She rode past the park and the playground. She even rode around her neighbor's house. But then, something unusual happened. 
She turned a corner and saw a big dog. The dog was barking and it scared Jane. She was so scared that she started crying. Her family heard her and came outside. They ran over to comfort her and make sure she was okay. After a few minutes, Jane calmed down and was feeling normal again. 
Jane learned an important lesson that day. She learned that it's okay to be scared sometimes, but you have to be brave and face your fears. Then you can get back to having fun on your scooter!
