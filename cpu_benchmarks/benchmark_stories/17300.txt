Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to hop around in the springtime when the flowers were blooming and the sun was shining. One day, Benny was hopping along when he saw a big, scary bear. Benny was frightened and didn't know what to do.
The bear looked at Benny and asked him why he looked so scared. Benny didn't know what to say, so he just shrugged his shoulders. The bear saw how little and cute Benny was and decided not to hurt him. Instead, the bear asked Benny if he wanted to play a game of tag.
Benny was so happy that the bear wasn't going to hurt him that he agreed to play. They played tag all afternoon and had so much fun. From that day on, Benny wasn't afraid of bears anymore and he loved to hop around in the springtime with all his animal friends.
