Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and go to the park. One day, she saw a clown in the park. The clown was wearing a crazy hat and had a big red nose. 
Lily went up to the clown and said, "Hi Mr. Clown, why do you look so crazy?" 
The clown replied, "I'm trying to sell my balloons, but nobody wants to buy them." 
Lily felt sad for the clown, so she asked her mom for some money to buy a balloon. She gave the clown the money and he gave her a big red balloon. 
Lily felt happy that she could help the clown. She learned that sometimes, it's important to help others even if they look different or seem crazy. From that day on, Lily always tried to help others whenever she could.
