Once upon a time, there was a little ant. The ant was walking around looking for food. Suddenly, a big foot came down and almost squished the ant. The ant was scared and ran away.
The ant met a friendly bird and said, "I need help. I want to move to a safer place." The bird said, "I can help you. Let's go find a new home."
They searched for a new home and found a sour apple. The bird said, "This apple is sour. We can't live here." The ant said, "Thank you for helping me. I learned that it's important to have good friends who help you make good choices." And the ant moved to a new home with the bird's help.
