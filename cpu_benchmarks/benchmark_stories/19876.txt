Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with his toys and run around in the yard. One day, Spot's owner took him to the park. At the park, Spot saw a ball and he wanted to play with it. But the ball belonged to another dog, so Spot couldn't play with it.
After playing for a while, Spot got tired and his owner gave him a massage. The massage felt good and Spot fell asleep. When he woke up, he saw that the sun was setting and it was getting dark. Spot got scared because he didn't like the dark. But his owner hugged him and told him everything was okay.
Spot felt safe with his owner and he knew he belonged with him. They went home together and Spot slept deeply all night long.
