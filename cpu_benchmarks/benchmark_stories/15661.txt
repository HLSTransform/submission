One day, Papa was in the garden. He looked around and saw that the lumber was dirty. He said, "We need to polish this wood so it looks nice again."
Mama then came out of the house and said, "Yes, I think so too. I just don't have time today. I'm too tired and lazy."
Papa kissed Mama's forehead and said, "It's okay. I will do it."
He got some cloth and polish and started to clean the lumber. He worked hard and made sure that every part shined.
When he was done, Mama said, "That's great, Papa! Now it looks so nice."
Papa smiled and said, "Yes, it does."
