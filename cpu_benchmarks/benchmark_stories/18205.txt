Once upon a time, a big race was going to happen in the forest. Many animals were going to run. The race would include all the animals. The winner would get a big prize and feel the victory. 
One small rabbit was very intelligent. He liked to think and solve problems. He wanted to win the race. But he was not the fastest animal. He thought, "How can I win the race?"
The day of the race came. All the animals started to run. The rabbit had a plan. He saw a big tree that had fallen down. All the animals had to go around it. The rabbit thought, "I can jump over the tree and save time." So, he jumped over the tree and won the race. 
All the animals were happy for the rabbit. They learned that being intelligent can help you win. The moral of the story is that using your brain can lead to victory, even when you are not the strongest or the fastest.
