Once upon a time, a little girl named Joy had a favorite cookie. The cookie was round and golden, and it was her absolute favorite. One day, Joy held the cookie so tight that it broke in two!
Joy was so sad that her cookie was broken. She began to cry, but then her mommy came up with a great idea. She got something new to replace the broken cookie!
It was a new cookie, but it was even more special than the last one. It was round and sparkly, and Joy hugged it tight. She was so happy to have her new cookie!
The cookie never broke again. Every day, Joy played with it and hugged it tight. The sparkly cookie was Joy's favorite, and it never had to be replaced again.
