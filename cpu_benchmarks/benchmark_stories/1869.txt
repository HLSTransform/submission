The world was in a bad way. Everywhere people were suffering. People were feeling tired and miserable.
One little girl was feeling this way too. She was only three and yet she was already feeling very worn out.
But she decided to look around her, and she noticed that, even though the world seemed like a big, bad place, she could still try to make things better.
Every day, she would do a little job to help out. She would tidy her bedroom, wash up the dishes and help carry shopping.
This made the world a better place, and everyone around her began to feel a little bit happier. And, slowly but surely, the little girl began to feel less tired too, and the world around her seemed ever so slightly brighter.
