Once upon a time, there was a little spider who lived in a big tree. The spider liked to spin cobwebs all day long. One day, a big wind came and blew the cobwebs away. The spider was sad because all of its hard work was gone.
But then, a big bug came along and got stuck in one of the cobwebs that was left. The spider knew what to do and quickly spun more cobwebs to catch the bug. The spider was happy because it had caught a big meal.
Later that day, it started to rain and the spider got uncomfortable because it was getting wet. Suddenly, a big lightning strike hit the tree and scared the spider. But it was okay because it had made a cozy little home in the tree and was safe from the storm. The end.
