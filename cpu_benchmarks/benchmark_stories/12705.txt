Once upon a time, there were two friends named Lily and Jack. They were very good friends and often played together. One day, Jack had a disagreement with Lily. He wanted to hang a painting in a frame on the wall but Lily disagreed.
"Let's hang it up," said Jack.
"No, no," Lily shook her head.
"It will look really good," Jack insisted.
But Lily didn't agree. "No frame," she said firmly.
Jack was frustrated and couldn't see why Lily didn't want to hang the painting in a frame. He thought it would look much better.
Finally, Jack decided that he would just put the painting up without the frame. He put it up with some sticky tape and stepped back to look at it.
"See, it looks really good!" said Jack, pleased with his work.
Lily smiled. "Yes, it looks really good."
Jack was happy that they had agreed. From then on, the painting was a nice decoration in the room and Jack and Lily continued to be good friends.
