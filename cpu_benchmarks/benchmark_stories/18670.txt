Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to ride her bike. One day, she got a new bike that was very fast. She could speed around the park with her new bike.
Lily's mom also gave her a lime to eat. It was very sour, but Lily loved it. She ate it while she was riding her bike.
The bike was very smooth, too. It didn't make any loud noises and Lily felt like she was gliding on the pavement. She loved her new bike and her lime snack. The end.
