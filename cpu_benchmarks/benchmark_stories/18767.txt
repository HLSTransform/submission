Tom and Mia were friends who liked to play outside. One day, they found a big pile of leaves in the park. They wanted to jump in the leaves and have fun.
But Tom saw a leaf that was different from the others. It was red and shiny and had a funny shape. He picked it up and showed it to Mia.
"Look at this leaf! It is so pretty and cool. I want to keep it," he said.
Mia looked at the leaf and frowned. She did not think it was pretty or cool. She thought it was ugly and weird. She wanted to throw it away.
"No, that leaf is bad. It does not belong here. It is not like the other leaves. You should give it to me and I will get rid of it," she said.
Tom and Mia started to argue. They both wanted the leaf, but for different reasons. They did not listen to each other. They did not share. They did not discuss.
They pulled and tugged on the leaf, trying to take it from each other. They did not notice that the leaf was getting torn and ripped. They did not notice that the wind was blowing the other leaves away. They did not notice that a dog was coming towards them.
The dog was big and brown and had a wet nose. He liked to chase things that moved. He saw Tom and Mia and the leaf. He thought they were playing a game. He wanted to join.
He ran towards them and barked. He jumped on them and licked their faces. He grabbed the leaf in his mouth and ran away.
Tom and Mia were scared and surprised. They stopped arguing and looked at the dog. They saw the leaf in his mouth. They saw the pile of leaves gone. They felt sad and silly.
They realized that they had been mean and greedy. They realized that they had wasted their time and their fun. They realized that they had lost their leaf and their friend.
They got up and ran after the dog. They called his name and asked him to come back. They hoped he would give them the leaf and play with them. They hoped they could say sorry and make up. They hoped they could learn to be nice and share.
