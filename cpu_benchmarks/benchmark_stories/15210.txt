Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a rich man named Tom. Tom had a big house with many things inside. One day, he decided to organize his house because it was very messy. He started with the living room.
In the living room, he found an old ashtray. He picked it up and said, "I don't need this anymore." Tom gave the ashtray to his friend, Sam, who needed one. Sam was very happy and said, "Thank you, Tom! You are very kind."
After organizing his house, Tom felt good. He learned that giving things to others can make them happy. He also learned that it is important to keep things neat and clean. From that day on, Tom always tried to help others and keep his house organized.
