Once upon a time there was a clean white rabbit. Every day the rabbit liked to hop in the nearby meadow. One day, the rabbit heard a voice coming from the meadow. He hopped closer and listened carefully. 
The rabbit heard a loud squealing from some baby pigs in the meadow. They were very upset and were making an awful racket. The rabbit heard one pig saying, "I can't find my clean blanket". The rabbit knew that would make the pig very sad, so he hopped closer to help. 
He searched the meadow and soon he found the blanket inside a large bush. Quickly he ran over and presented the blanket to the pig. The pig was very happy to have his clean blanket back. 
The pig thanked the rabbit and they all hopped off together, happy to have solved the problem together. The End.
