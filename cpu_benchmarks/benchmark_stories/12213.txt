Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Daisy. Daisy was three years old, and she loved playing with the soft, furry teddy bears that her parents gave her. Daisy always made sure to take good care of them.
One day, Daisy's mom asked her, "Daisy, what do you like most about your teddy bears?"
Daisy thought for a moment, then said, "I like their soft, furry texture and the way they feel gentle and mild in my arms."
Daisy's mom smiled at her and said, "That's so sweet. You really care about your teddy bears, don't you?"
Daisy smiled and said, "I sure do. They're like my best friends." 
Daisy hugged her teddy bears close and imagined all the fun adventures they would have together. She knew that so long as she continued to care for them, their mild and comforting texture would never change.
