Once upon a time there was a shy bird that lived in its birdcage. It enjoyed singing but it never had the courage to sing outside. One day, the bird saw a butterfly zoom past it. The bird became so excited that it found the courage to open its wings and zoom outside too.
The little bird was so amazed by what it saw outside. It saw so many new things. But after a while, the bird felt a bit scared and so it started zooming back to its birdcage. 
When it got back, the bird met its best friend, a cat. The cat asked the bird, "Where have you been? You were gone for so long!"
The bird replied, "I zoomed outside. I saw so many new things and I wanted to explore, but I was a bit shy, so I came back." 
The cat said, "That's okay. You don't have to be scared. Come outside again when you're ready. I'll be here waiting for you." 
The bird smiled and said, "Okay, I think I will!" Then the two friends said goodbye, and the bird zoomed back out to explore.
