Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Benny. He loved honey very much. One day, he went to the forest to find some honey. He met a little bee named Buzz. Buzz was happy to see Benny and said, "Hello, Benny! Do you want some honey?"
Benny was very happy and said, "Yes, please! I love honey!" Buzz set off to get some honey for Benny. While Buzz was gone, Benny saw a big tree. He thought it would be fun to climb it. So, he climbed the tree and waited for Buzz to come back with honey.
When Buzz came back with honey, he couldn't find Benny. He looked around and saw Benny on top of the tree. Buzz said, "Benny, be careful! You might fall!" But Benny didn't listen. He was too excited about the honey.
Suddenly, Benny slipped and fell from the tree. Buzz quickly flew down and caught Benny before he hit the ground. Benny was safe and happy to have his honey. He said, "Thank you, Buzz! You saved me! I promise to be more careful next time." From that day on, Benny and Buzz became good friends and always looked out for each other.
