Once upon a time, there was a dove who wanted to fly. She was so excited to spread her wings and soar into the sky. But the dove was so small, she couldn't quite fly yet.
So she asked the wind, "Please help me fly!" The wind listened carefully and blew gently. The dove could feel the wind helping her take off from the ground.
But then a rude crow saw the dove trying to fly. The crow cawed loudly and blew down hard to keep the dove from flying.
The dove was so scared. She asked the wind again, "Please help me fly away from this crow."
The wind listened and blew hard. The dove flew up high and away from the rude crow. She finally reached the sky and flew around happily.
The wind smiled at the dove and said, "You did it! You used your wings to fly and that's why I helped you." 
The dove thanked the wind and flew away. She was so happy and felt so free up in the sky.
