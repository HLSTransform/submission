Lily and Max were happy to go to the park with Mom. They put on their sunglasses and hats to protect their eyes and heads from the sun. They saw many things in the park: flowers, birds, dogs, and other children.
"Look, Lily, a slide!" Max said. He ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. He slid down fast and laughed. "That was fun! Come on, Lily, you try!"
Lily followed Max to the slide. She was a little scared, but she wanted to try. She climbed up the ladder slowly and sat on the slide. She held on to the sides and slid down. She smiled and said, "That was fun, too!"
Mom watched them and clapped. She was happy to see them having fun. She took out a bottle of water and a snack from her bag. She called them, "Lily, Max, come here! It's time for a break. You need some water and a snack."
Lily and Max ran to Mom. They took off their sunglasses and hats and put them in the bag. They drank some water and ate some snack. They thanked Mom and gave her a hug.
"Can we play some more, Mom?" Max asked.
"Sure, but first you need to shut the bag, so nothing falls out," Mom said.
Lily and Max shut the bag and put it on the bench. They put on their sunglasses and hats again and went back to the slide. They played some more and had a lot of fun. They were happy.
