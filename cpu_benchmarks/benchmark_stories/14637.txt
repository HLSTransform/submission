Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Benny. He was three years old and loved to learn new things. 
One day, he watched some people wearing masks. He thought they looked very nice. Benny wanted to learn how to wear one too. 
He asked his mom if he could have a mask. His mom said yes and she helped him put it on. Benny was so excited to learn something new. 
He ran around the house wearing his new mask. He loved the way it felt and how it covered his face. His mom laughed at how silly he looked. 
Benny was so proud of himself. He had learned something new and he was wearing a nice mask. He had a lot of fun that day. 
The End.
