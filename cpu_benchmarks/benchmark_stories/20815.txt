Mia and her mother were walking in the park. The day was sunny and nice so Mia was happy. But her mother was not happy. She was selling things in the park.
Mia asked her mother, "What are you selling?" 
Her mother said, "I'm selling these clothes. They look dark and nice." 
So Mia looked around and saw people buying things from her mother. Mia was happy that her mother was making money. 
But then it became dark in the park and people started to leave. Soon there was nobody who wanted to buy things from her mother. Mia was sad.
Mia's mother said, "That's it! I didn't sell anything today." Then she was angry and walked away. Mia was left feeling sad in the dark park.
