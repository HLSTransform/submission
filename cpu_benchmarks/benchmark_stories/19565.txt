Once there was a girl named Emma. Emma was so lovely. Every day she went to the park to have fun.
Today Emma was excited to go to the park. On the way she stopped to pick up some grapes. When she arrived at the park, there was a tall hill covered in grass.
At the top of the hill, Emma saw a big slide. She quickly ran up the hill, with her basket of grapes in hand. When she reached the top, she looked over the slide.
Emma held the basket of grapes to her chest and then, she slid down the slide. She screamed with joy as she went fast, faster and faster. When she reached the bottom she was filled with happiness.
Emma hugged her basket of grapes and smiled. She was so happy to have found a slide to have fun on and grapes to snack on. She felt the lovely sun on her face and smiled.  Emma had a wonderful day.
