There was a sheep who loved wool. Every day, the sheep would look in the mirror and brush its wool until it was soft and smooth. The sheep really liked pink. It wished it had a snuggly pink wool jumper to wear.
One day, the sheep went on a long walk through the forest. After a while, it found a pink wool jumper lying on the ground. The sheep's eyes lit up. It quickly picked it up and tried it on. The jumper was a bit too big for the sheep, but it loved it anyway.
The sheep continued on its walk, wearing its new jumper with excitement. Later, it discovered that the jumper had a hole in the back. The sheep's ears drooped and it shrugged sadly. Oh well, perhaps it could patch the hole and make a quilt out of the wool.
The sheep decided it would still make the best of its pink wool jumper. It smiled to itself, and went on its way.
