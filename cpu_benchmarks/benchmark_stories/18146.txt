One day, a boy named Tim went to ride his bike. He loved to ride up and down the street. His bike was red and shiny. Tim was the owner of the bike, and he took good care of it. He would clean it and make sure the tires were full of air.
As Tim was riding, he saw a tired dog lying on the grass. The dog was big and brown. Tim stopped his bike and walked over to the dog. He asked, "Are you lost, doggy?"
The dog wagged its tail and barked. Tim knew the dog needed help. He decided to find the owner of the dog. Tim and the dog walked around the street, asking people if they knew the dog.
Finally, they found the owner. She was a nice lady who was looking for her dog. She said, "Thank you, Tim, for finding my dog!" Tim felt happy that he could help. The lady and her dog went home, and Tim rode his bike back to his house, feeling tired but happy.
