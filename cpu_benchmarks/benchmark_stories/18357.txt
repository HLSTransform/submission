Once upon a time, there was a brown dog named Buddy. Buddy lived on a farm with his friend, a little boy named Tim. They loved to play together in the farm's big yard.
One day, Tim asked his mom, "Can I go play with Buddy on the farm?" His mom said, "Yes, I permit you to play with Buddy, but be back before dinner." Tim was very happy and ran outside to find Buddy.
Tim and Buddy played all day on the farm. They ran, jumped, and laughed. They had so much fun. When it was time for dinner, Tim and Buddy went back inside the house. They were tired but happy.
