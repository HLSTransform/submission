Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a flexible little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and watch the sunrise. Every morning, she would wake up early and go to the park.
One day, Lily found a big red ball in the park. She wanted to play with it, but it was stuck in a tree. She tried to pull it down, but it was too high. Lily didn't give up. She used her flexible body to bend and stretch to reach the ball.
Finally, after trying many times, Lily was able to pull the ball down from the tree. She was so happy and played with it all day. As the sun began to set, Lily knew that tomorrow, she would wake up early again to see the sunrise and play with her new red ball.
