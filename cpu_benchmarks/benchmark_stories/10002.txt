Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went on a long car ride with her family. Along the way, she saw many pretty things outside her window. She saw big trees, blue sky, and green grass. She said, "Wow, what a beautiful landscape!" 
After a while, Lily got tired and felt a little cranky. Her mom told her to relax and take a nap. Lily closed her eyes and soon fell asleep. When she woke up, she saw a mountain in the distant. She said, "Look, a big mountain!" 
Finally, they arrived at their destination. Lily was so happy to be there and see all the new things. She felt excited and couldn't wait to explore more.
