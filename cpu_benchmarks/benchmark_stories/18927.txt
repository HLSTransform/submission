Lily liked to play with her mom's vase. It was big and shiny and had pretty flowers on it. Sometimes, Lily would pretend the vase was a cup and she would drink from it. She knew mom did not like that, but Lily thought it was fun.
One day, mom was busy in the kitchen and Lily saw the vase on the table. She ran to it and grabbed it with both hands. She lifted it to her mouth and made a slurping sound. She did not see the water inside the vase. It spilled all over her face and clothes and the floor. Lily gasped and dropped the vase. It broke into many pieces.
Mom heard the noise and came to see what happened. She saw Lily and the broken vase and the water. She was very angry. She said, "Lily, what did you do? You broke my vase! That was very naughty! You are not supposed to play with it or drink from it!"
Lily felt very guilty. She knew she did something bad. She looked at mom and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I wanted to drink from the vase. I did not know it had water. I did not mean to break it. Please don't be mad at me."
Mom sighed and hugged Lily. She said, "I'm not mad at you, Lily. I'm just sad that you broke my vase. It was a gift from grandma. You have to be more careful with things that are not yours. And you have to listen to me when I tell you not to do something. Do you understand?"
Lily nodded and said, "I understand, mom. I love you. And I love grandma. Can we get her a new vase?"
Mom smiled and said, "Maybe we can. But first, let's clean up this mess. And then, let's change your clothes. You are all wet."
