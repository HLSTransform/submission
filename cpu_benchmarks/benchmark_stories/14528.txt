Jill and Jack were playing outside in their garden. They were laughing and having fun. Then they saw a big puddle. Jill jumped in and started to splash. The puddle was so big, the water went everywhere.
Jack wanted to join the fun, so he jumped in too. They splashed and splashed until the puddle was all gone. The water on their faces made them laugh even more.
Then they heard music coming from the park. It was a band playing music. They decided to go there and they ran to the park. When they arrived at the park, they could see the band performing. Everyone was clapping and dancing.
Jill and Jack decided to have a snack. They both had some sour lemonade and some sour apples. But they decided the sourness was too much and they still wanted to have fun. They decided to dance to the music and they splashed around in the park. They laughed and danced until they were all tired.
