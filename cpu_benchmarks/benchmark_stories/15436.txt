Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived on a farm. On the farm, there were lots of animals. Everyday, the little girl went out and fed them all. She fed the pigs with apples, the cows with hay, and the chickens with corn.
The little girl's mom was so proud of her. One day, she decided to teach the little girl a new lesson. She wanted her to be calm when she fed the animals. So the little girl sat quietly and watched the animals eat.
At the end of the day, the little girl was very happy. She had learned to be calm and feed the animals. She knew that if she fed them calmly, the animals would be happy and well taken care of.
