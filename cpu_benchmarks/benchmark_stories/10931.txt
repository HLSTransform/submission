Once upon a time, there was a boat. The boat was big and blue. It could sail on the water. The boat had a name. It was called "The Happy Boat". 
One day, the boat wanted to travel to a faraway land. It wanted to see new things and meet new friends. So, it set sail on the sea. The sun was shining, and the waves were dancing. The boat was happy. 
But then, a big, ugly storm came. The wind was blowing, and the sea was angry. The boat tried to stay strong, but it was too weak. The storm was too strong. The boat sank to the bottom of the sea. 
And that was the end of the happy boat.
