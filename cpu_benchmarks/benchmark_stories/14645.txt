Once upon a time, there was a young dog. His name was Chase. One day, Chase was playing in the garden when he saw a trail. It was a long shiny trail of stones and twigs. He was fascinated. He wanted to know where it led to.
Chase followed the trail. It twisted and turned through the garden, and then went out into a field. As Chase kept walking, he felt more and more troubled. He did not know if he was still on the right trail or not.
Suddenly he heard a noise. He saw a person throwing rocks at something just ahead. Chase was scared. He wanted to run away, but he had to find out what was going on. He slowly crept closer to get a better look.
The person was throwing rocks at a poor little bird, trying to hurt it! Chase was very angry. He wanted to help the bird, so he started barking and running to scare the person away. It worked! The person ran away, leaving the trail and the bird alone.
Chase had saved the bird. He felt proud and happy. He followed the trail all the way back home, but this time he felt a lot more sure of himself.
