Sara loves to play with her ball. She kicks it and throws it and rolls it on the ground. She likes to make it go fast and far. Sometimes she runs after it and tries to catch it before it stops.
One day, Sara is playing with her ball in the park. She sees a big hill and thinks it would be fun to roll her ball down it. She runs to the top of the hill and pushes her ball hard. It goes very fast and very far. Sara is happy and wants to get her ball back.
She starts to run down the hill, but she does not see the big rock in her way. She trips over the rock and falls to the ground. She feels a terrible pain in her knee. She cries and cries. She wants her mommy.
Her mommy hears her cry and rushes to her. She picks her up and hugs her. She sees the blood on her knee and says, "Oh, Sara, you have a boo-boo. Let me clean it and put a band-aid on it. It will be okay."
She takes Sara to the bench and wipes her knee with a wet cloth. She puts a band-aid on it and kisses it. She says, "There, all better. Do you want to play with your ball some more?"
Sara shakes her head. She says, "No, thank you. I don't like the hill. It is too fast and too far. I want to play on the slide. It is slow and safe."
Her mommy smiles and says, "Okay, let's go to the slide. But be careful, okay?"
Sara nods and says, "Okay, mommy. I will be careful. I love you."
Her mommy says, "I love you too, Sara." They hold hands and walk to the slide. Sara forgets about her boo-boo and has fun again.
