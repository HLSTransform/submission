Gina went outside to pick flowers. She enjoyed their colors and the smell of the garden. The sun was shining, and all of the flowers looked very happy.
Then something strange happened. There was a small bird sitting on a tree, and it had something in its beak. It flew down and dropped the message in Gina's hands. She opened it up and read it out loud. 
"'Pick something smelly and bring it back to this tree,'" Gina read.
Gina was so excited! She ran around the garden, trying to find something smelly. She finally found a smelly mushroom and put it in her pocket.
Gina went back to the tree and put the smelly mushroom under it. The small bird came back and flew away with the mushroom in its beak.
Gina smiled. She had done a very special thing: she had delivered a message!
