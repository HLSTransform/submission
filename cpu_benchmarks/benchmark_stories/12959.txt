Once upon a time, there was a boy named Sam. He was very brave, but he was scared of going to visit his aunt. He asked his friend Jill if it was easy to go.
Jill said, "No it's not easy, but don't worry, Sam. I will go with you to the visit and it won't be scary!"
Sam smiled and said, "Thanks, Jill. I feel better now!"
The next day, Sam and Jill went to visit Sam's aunt. But when they arrived, they heard loud noises coming from her house.
Sam was scared, but Jill said, "It's OK, Sam. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about."
When they went inside, they saw that Sam's aunt's house was being decorated for his birthday party. Everyone cheered!"
Sam was relieved, and then he and Jill had a very special visit and a fun time at the party. Sam learned that if he faced his fear, then the visit was actually quite easy.
