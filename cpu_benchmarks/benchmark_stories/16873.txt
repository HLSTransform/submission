Once upon a time, a jolly daughter was playing in her backyard. She saw a big ball and wanted to play with it. She tried to kick the ball, but she fell down. She stood up and tried again, but she fell down again. She needed to balance better to play with the ball. So, she held her arms out to balance and kicked the ball. She was so happy that she could play with the ball without falling down.
