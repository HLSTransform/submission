Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was a small jug. She would fill it with water and pretend to pour tea for her teddy bear. 
One day, Lily's brother came to her room and asked if he could play with her jug. Lily said no because it was her favorite toy. Her brother got upset and said, "But I want to play with it too!" 
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "Okay, you can play with it but you have to give it back to me before the end of the day." Her brother agreed and took the jug to play with. 
At the end of the day, Lily's brother brought the jug back to her and said, "Here you go, Lily. I had fun playing with it but I know it's your favorite toy." Lily smiled and said, "Thank you for giving it back to me." And they both went to bed happy.
