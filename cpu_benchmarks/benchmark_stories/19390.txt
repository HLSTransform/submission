Once there was a mighty football. It was the mightiest football anyone had ever seen. Everyone could hear it rolling down the street. It looked so happy and lively.
One day, a little boy named Jack saw it and yelled, "Look! A football!" He was so excited by what he was seeing. He ran as fast as he could. He was so close to touching it but then it rolled away.
Jack screamed loud enough for the whole neighborhood to hear. Everyone came out of their homes to find out what was going on. Jack was so proud that he found the mighty football. He screamed and cheered.
Jack and his friends all took turns playing with the mighty football. They laughed and cheered as they kicked the football to each other. They had so much fun. 
The day was extra special for Jack because he found the mighty football. He will always remember the day of screaming and cheering.
