Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily liked to walk around her neighborhood with her mommy. One day, they went for a walk and saw a present on the sidewalk. Lily was so happy to see the present and wanted to open it right away. But her mommy said they should wait until they got home.
Lily was very calm and patient while they walked back home. When they finally got home, Lily's mommy let her open the present. Inside was a new toy that Lily loved very much. From that day on, Lily always looked for presents on their walks and was always calm and patient when waiting to open them.
