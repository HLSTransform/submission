Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch his favorite television show every day after school. One day, Timmy's television suddenly froze and he couldn't watch his show. Timmy was sad and didn't know what to do.
Timmy's mom tried to fix the television, but it wouldn't work. Timmy's dad was honest and told Timmy that they needed to buy a new television. Timmy was happy to hear that they would get a new television, but he was sad that he couldn't watch his show for a while. Finally, the new television arrived and Timmy was able to watch his show again.
