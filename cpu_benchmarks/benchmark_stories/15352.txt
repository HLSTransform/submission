Once upon a time, there was a girl with a pink plate. She was very excited to use it for the first time. She had so much fun playing with it.
When it was time for lunch, the girl grabbed her plate and put her food on it. Suddenly, her plate started to gain something special. When she looked more closely, she saw that it had big pink stars all over it! 
The girl was so excited! Every time she put food on her plate, more stars appeared. 
After lunch, the girl was able to take the plate with her wherever she went, and she enjoyed seeing all the stars shine. It made her feel so happy. Everyone she met was amazed by the plate and its stars.
The girl was so proud of her plate and the stars she had gained. She would never forget the day she got her special pink plate.
