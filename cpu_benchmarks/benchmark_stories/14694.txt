John was very silly. He was in first grade and was taking an exam. He was going to tie the test up with a bow when the teacher saw him. The teacher said, "John, you don't need to tie the exam. It's already finished!" 
John's face got very red and he said, "Oh, sorry teacher. I thought it would be fun to tie it up." 
The teacher smiled and said, "That's very kind of you John. But don't worry, I will take care of it."
After the teacher had tied up the exam, he gave it back to John and said, "Now go off and play. Don't worry about the exam, it's finished now." 
John smiled happily and ran off to play with his friends. He was glad the teacher was understanding and let him have some silly fun.
