Once upon a time, there was a smelly skunk named Stinky. He lived in a big forest with lots of trees and animals. One day, Stinky went to visit his friend, a rabbit named Floppy. Floppy was eating some carrots and Stinky requested if he could have one. Floppy gave him a carrot and they both laughed and played together.
Later, Stinky went to visit his other friend, a squirrel named Nutty. Nutty was counting some nuts and Stinky asked him what number he was on. Nutty said he was on number ten. Stinky thought that was a lot of nuts and he didn't want any because he was still full from the carrot.
After a fun day with his friends, Stinky went back to his home in the forest. He was tired and decided to take a nap. Before he slept, he requested that his friends come over again tomorrow to play. Then, he fell asleep and dreamt of more adventures.
