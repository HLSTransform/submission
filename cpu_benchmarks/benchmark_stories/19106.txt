Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his toys and going on adventures. One day, Timmy got lost in the woods. He started to panic because he didn't know how to get back home.
Suddenly, a hero appeared! It was Timmy's big brother, Jack. Jack knew the woods well and was able to find Timmy. Timmy was so happy to see his hero and gave him a big hug. But Jack looked sad because he was worried about Timmy.
Together, they walked back home and Timmy learned that it's important to stay close to his family so he doesn't get lost again. From that day on, Timmy knew that his big brother was his hero and he felt safe knowing that Jack would always be there to help him.
