Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the sand pit at the park. It was his favorite thing to do. One day, Timmy met a girl named Sally. Sally was very nice and they became friends. Timmy thought Sally was very pretty and he wanted to marry her one day.
But Timmy knew that marrying someone was difficult. He didn't know how to do it. He asked his mom and dad, but they didn't know either. Timmy thought and thought about it. Then he had an idea! He would ask Sally to marry him and they could figure it out together.
So, the next day at the sand pit, Timmy asked Sally to marry him. Sally was very happy and said yes! They didn't know how to get married, but they knew they loved each other and that was all that mattered. From that day on, Timmy and Sally played together every day at the sand pit and knew they would be together forever.
