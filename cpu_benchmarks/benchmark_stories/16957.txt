Lily loved to sing. She sang every day, in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. She sang to her toys, to her mom, to her dad, and to her cat. She wanted to be a musician when she grew up, like her auntie Anna.
One day, auntie Anna came to visit. She brought her guitar and her microphone. She played and sang for Lily and her family. Lily thought she was brilliant. She clapped and cheered.
"Can you teach me how to sing like you?" Lily asked auntie Anna.
"Of course, sweetie. Singing is fun and easy. You just have to practice and improve. Do you want to try?" auntie Anna said.
"Yes, please!" Lily said.
Auntie Anna gave Lily the microphone and showed her how to hold it. She played a simple song on the guitar and sang along. Lily listened and tried to copy her. She sang loud and clear, but sometimes she missed the notes or the words.
"That's okay, Lily. You're doing great. Singing is like a game. You have to learn the rules and the tricks. The more you play, the better you get. You have a beautiful voice. You just have to improve it." auntie Anna said.
Lily smiled and nodded. She liked the game. She wanted to improve. She wanted to be a brilliant musician like auntie Anna. She sang again and again, until she got the song right. Auntie Anna hugged her and praised her.
"You're amazing, Lily. You're a natural musician. You've improved so much. I'm so proud of you." auntie Anna said.
Lily felt happy and proud. She thanked auntie Anna and gave her a kiss. She sang some more songs with her, and then with her mom, her dad, and her cat. She had a lot of fun. She decided to sing every day, to practice and improve, and to be a brilliant musician.
