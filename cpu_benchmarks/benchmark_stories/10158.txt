Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mom. Lily saw a butterfly and wanted to catch it. Her mom said, "Be careful, Lily. We have to protect the butterfly."
Lily saw a boy playing on the slide. He was very loud and not being quiet. Lily's mom said, "Let's go play somewhere else. It's too noisy here." 
Lily and her mom found a quiet spot to play. They saw some kids playing a game. One kid said, "I want to win every time!" Lily's mom said, "It's not fair to always win. Everyone should have a turn to win." 
Lily had a lot of fun at the park that day. She learned that it's important to protect animals, be quiet when needed, and play fair with others.
