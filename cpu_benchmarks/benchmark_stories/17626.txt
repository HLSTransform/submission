Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat yummy snacks. One day, Lily's mom brought home a beautiful violin. Lily was so happy and wanted to play it right away.
As she was playing, her little brother came in and wanted to play too. But Lily didn't want to share her new toy. They started to fight over the violin and accidentally broke it.
Lily felt very sad and her brother felt bad too. They knew they shouldn't have fought over the violin. Lily's mom was upset too and told them they needed to learn to share and be kind to each other.
Sadly, Lily never got to play her beautiful violin again. She learned that fighting over things isn't worth it and that it's always better to share and be kind.
