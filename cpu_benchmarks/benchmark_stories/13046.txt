Jack loved watching the television. He was three years old, and the television showed him so many brilliant things.
One day, Jack was sitting on the carpet, watching his favorite show. He was getting so excited, he started clapping his hands. Suddenly, he accidentally tore a hole in the screen! 
Jack was very sad. He started to cry. His mom heard the noise and came to check. She saw the television had a tear in it. 
Mom was not angry. She was very loving and hugged Jack close. She said, "it's okay, Jack. We will fix the television and make it brilliant again. You just have to be careful next time." 
Jack nodded, and he and his mom hugged each other. They both felt better.
