The naughty dancer drove a car. It was a big, shiny car. He drove very fast. He wanted to see how fast he could go. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise. He looked to the side and saw a big truck. The truck was going very fast. The naughty dancer was scared and quickly pressed on the brakes. The car slowed down, and the truck drove away. He was very relieved that he had stopped in time, and decided he was better off driving a little slower.
