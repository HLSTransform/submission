Once upon a time, there was a lazy bird named Tweety. Tweety loved to sleep all day and never wanted to work. One day, Tweety saw a helicopter flying in the sky. It was carrying lots of food and toys for the children. Tweety wanted to fly like the helicopter, but he was too lazy to learn how to fly.
One day, the children were sad because the helicopter had to go away. Tweety saw this and felt bad. He decided to help the children by using his wings to part the clouds and make the sun shine brighter. The children were happy and thanked Tweety for his help. 
From that day on, Tweety realized that it's important to help others and not be lazy all the time. He learned that even small actions can make a big difference in someone's life.
