Once upon a time, there was a brave girl who lived in the west. She was very independent and liked to do things all by herself.
One day, her mother said it was time to get ready for bed, but the brave girl wanted to keep playing. She screamed, "No! I don't want to go to bed!"
Her mother said, "It's important for you to get enough sleep every night. Come now and I'll read you a story."
The brave girl wanted to stay independent, so she screamed once again, but her mother made her go to bed.
When she woke up the next morning, she felt rested and refreshed. She smiled and went out to explore the west.
