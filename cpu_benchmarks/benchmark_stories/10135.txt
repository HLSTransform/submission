Lily was a young girl who loved to read books. She had many books in her room, but her favorite one was a book about stars. She liked to look at the pictures of the bright stars and learn their names.
Every night, before she went to sleep, she would read her star book with her mom. They would point at the stars and say their names together. Lily wanted to see the stars for real, but they were too far away.
One night, Lily had a special idea. She took her star book and a flashlight and went to the backyard. She turned on the flashlight and shone it on the book. She saw the stars on the book shine back at her. She felt like she was in space.
She looked up at the sky and saw the real stars shining too. She smiled and waved at them. She felt like they were her friends. She said their names out loud and thanked them for shining.
She went back to her room and hugged her star book. She was happy and sleepy. She dreamed of stars and books and shining.
