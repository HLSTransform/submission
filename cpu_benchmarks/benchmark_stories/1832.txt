Jake was three years old. One day he and his family went to the park. When he arrived, he noticed a huge old tree with a swing attached to it.
"Mommy, can I swing?" he asked with excitement.
"Yes!" his mom replied. 
Jake was so happy. He ran to the swing and hopped on. He started to swing as high as he could. He looked up and saw the sky above him. He felt so free and happy. 
Suddenly, a blackbird flew under the swing and made a loud noise. Jake screeched with surprise and stopped swinging. 
The bird flew away and Jake's mom ran to him. 
"Are you ok, honey?" she asked.
"Yes," Jake said, ready to swing again. "Let's swing higher!" 
And so Jake and his mom continued swinging until dinner. Jake had so much fun and couldn't wait to come back and play on the huge tree swing again.
