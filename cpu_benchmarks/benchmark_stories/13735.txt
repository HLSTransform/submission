Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the store with her mommy to buy candy. One day, while they were at the store, Lily saw a bright red balloon. She wanted it so badly, but her mommy said no.
Lily was sad and started to cry. Suddenly, a kind lady came over and waved at Lily. She gave her the balloon and Lily was so happy! But then, a big boy came and tried to take the balloon away from Lily. Lily didn't want to give it up, so she held on tight.
The boy got angry and started to pull on the balloon. Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. Just then, her mommy came over and saw what was happening. She told the boy to stop and gave Lily a big hug. From then on, Lily was always careful with her balloons and never let anyone take them away.
