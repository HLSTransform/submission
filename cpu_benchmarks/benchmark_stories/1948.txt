Once upon a time, there lived a happy little girl named Lucy. She was always excited to go on adventures. 
One day, Lucy heard about a special zoom where she could go with her mommy and daddy. She was so excited she rushed to tell her mommy.
"Mommy, daddy, can we go on the zoom?" she asked. 
Her mommy and daddy smiled. "Yes, we can go on the zoom! It's going to be so much fun," said Mommy.
So the next day, when all the family got dressed up and went on the zoom, Lucy was so happy! 
When they got to the zoom, Lucy saw that lots of people were all around them. Mommy and Daddy took Lucy's hand and told her that everyone was at the zoom to watch them get married! 
Lucy was so excited! She had never seen a wedding before and now it was her mommy and daddy getting married!
The family said their special vows and got married. Lucy had the best time at the zoom and always remembered this special day when her mommy and daddy got married.
