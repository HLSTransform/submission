Once upon a time, there was a library that was full of books. The library was very big, and was full of tall shelves. The library was also very quiet.
One day, a rude boy went to the library. He started to run around and he was very loud. But he wasn't being careful and he bumped into one of the shelves. Suddenly, the shelf started to reverse! It started to move backwards, and it pushed all the other shelves too.
The books started to fall and fly everywhere! Everyone in the library was very scared, and the librarian was very angry. They all started to run away from the library because it was so noisy.
Eventually, the shelf reversed back to where it started. Everyone was happy that the naughty, rude boy was gone. They all went back into the library and put the books back in their right places. That was the end of the big, noisy adventure!
