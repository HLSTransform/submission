Once upon a time, there was an original trap. It was built by a man who wanted to catch something important. He asked his friend for help, and together they put the trap in a secret spot.
The man waited near the trap, hoping to catch something. After a while, a little rabbit hopped into the trap! The man was so excited that he asked his friend to help him carry the trap away.
Once they reached the man's home, he looked at the trap and smiled. He thanked his friend for the help and released the rabbit into the wild. He hoped that the rabbit would find its way home, and be safe again.
