Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside and explore the world around him. One day, he went on an adventure with his friend Sally. They walked for a long time until they saw a big mountain with smoke coming out of the top. Timmy asked Sally what it was and she said it was a volcano.
They decided to climb the volcano and see what was inside. As they climbed higher and higher, the air got hotter and hotter. Finally, they reached the top and saw a big hole with lava inside. Timmy thought it looked pretty and useful, but Sally warned him that it was dangerous.
Suddenly, the ground shook and rocks started falling. Timmy and Sally tried to run, but it was too late. The volcano erupted and they were trapped. Timmy cried out for help, but nobody could hear him. They were stuck on the volcano forever.
