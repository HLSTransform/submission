Once upon a time there was a mighty cat called Toby. He lived by himself and was always looking for adventure.
One day Toby heard a strange noise coming from the nearby lake. It sounded like someone was in trouble. He ran to investigate and found a small fish struggling in the lake. 
"Please help me!" cried the small fish.
Toby did not know what to do. He thought for a moment and decided to use the salt he had in his pocket. He sprinkled the salt into the lake and the fish immediately began to swim quickly away.
Toby had rescued the little fish! He was so proud of himself. He waved goodbye to the fish and ran home to tell his friends about his mighty rescue!
