Once upon a time, there lived a girl named Sara who was very independent. Every morning she would get dressed by herself, make her own breakfast and take a walk to the beach.
Today was no different, and soon she was standing on a sandy beach with the sun shining down on her. She watched the waves pass by - back and forth, back and forth. 
Suddenly, she heard a small voice saying, "Sara, why do you come here every day?" 
Sara looked around and saw a little boy about her age. She smiled at him and replied, "I like the beach - it's fun to watch the waves pass by."
The little boy nodded and said, "Me too! Maybe we can be friends and come here together every day?"
Sara agreed with a big smile and the two of them "high-fived" to celebrate their friendship. From that day on, they both continued to come to the beach every day to play and watch the waves pass.
