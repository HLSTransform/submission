Once upon a time, there was a warm little pig. She loved to dress up in clothes. One day, she found a pretty dress. It was pink and sparkly. She put it on and felt so good.
The pig asked her friends to come see her new dress. When they arrived, they were amazed. They were so happy for her.
The pig twirled and danced in her dress. She was so happy. She danced until she was tired. Then she curled up in bed, dreaming of the warm dress.
The end.
