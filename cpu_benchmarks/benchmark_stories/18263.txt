Once upon a time, Timmy and his mom went to visit the zoo. They saw many animals like lions, tigers, and elephants. Timmy was very happy to see all the animals, but he wanted to see a gorilla the most. 
Finally, they found the gorilla and Timmy was so excited! He went up to the gorilla and said, "Hi gorilla, you are big and strong!" The gorilla looked at Timmy and said, "Thank you, little boy. I am honest and kind too." 
Suddenly, another gorilla came and started to fight with the first gorilla. Timmy got scared and ran to his mom. His mom said, "Don't worry Timmy, the zookeepers will come and help the gorillas." 
After the fight was over, Timmy went back to visit the gorillas. The first gorilla said, "Thank you for visiting me again. You are a good friend." Timmy smiled and said, "I will visit you again soon, my gorilla friend."
