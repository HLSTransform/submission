Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One morning, she woke up and wanted to make pancakes with her mommy. But when she tasted the batter, it was sour! 
Lily didn't like the sour taste, so she asked her mommy to add some sugar. Her mommy added the sugar and they mixed it together. Then they made the pancakes and they were delicious! 
Lily was happy because she helped make breakfast and it was yummy. She ate her pancakes and had a good morning with her mommy. The end.
