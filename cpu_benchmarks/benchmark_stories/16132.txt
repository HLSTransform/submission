Once, there was a rhinoceros who was very adventurous. He loved going on long walks and seeing new places. On one warm summer day the rhinoceros decided to explore the forest. As he walked, he discovered many wonderful things. He saw bright birds, tall trees and soft grass.
Then, the rhinoceros heard a funny noise. He looked around and saw a small rabbit with a big smile on his face. The rabbit had been laughing. The rhinoceros was so surprised that he began to laugh too. Before long, the two animals were laughing together. They laughed until their tummies hurt and their faces were red.
The rhinoceros and the rabbit became the best of friends. They spent the rest of the day exploring the forest and doing silly things. And every time they played, they would always laugh and laugh.
