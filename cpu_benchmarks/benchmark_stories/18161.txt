Once upon a time, there was a friendly dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with his friends in the park. They would run, jump, and chase each other all day long.
One day, Spot's owner taught him a new trick. The trick was called "accept the heel." Spot had to sit and let his owner put a special heel toy in his mouth. Spot learned the trick very fast because he was a good dog.
The next day, Spot and his owner went to the park. Spot saw his friends and wanted to show them his new trick. His owner said, "accept the heel," and Spot did the trick for his friends. They all clapped and cheered for Spot. He was so happy and proud to be a friendly dog who could do a fun trick.
