Once upon a time, there was a duck. He was looking for somewhere to play but he couldn't find a place. He asked a serious looking dog for help, but the dog said no. Then he asked a cat for help, but the cat said no, too. The duck was very sad.
Just then, a nice cow came along. The cow said to the duck, "You can come and play with me, but only if you lend me something." The duck was happy and said,"Yes, of course! What do you need?" The cow said, "I need you to lend me your wings." The duck was a bit worried, but he said, "okay."
Then the duck gave the cow his wings and the cow flew off into the sky! The duck was surprised. A little while later, the cow came back and gave the duck his wings back. Then the duck and the cow played together until it was time to go home. They both had a lot of fun - and the duck was very happy to lend his wings.
