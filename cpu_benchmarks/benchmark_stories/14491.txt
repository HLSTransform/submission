Once there was a girl named Emma. Emma wanted to go to the zoo, so she asked her mom for a ticket. Her mom gave her a ticket and Emma was so happy. She filled it out and put it in her pocket. 
Emma ran to the zoo and was so excited. She was so alert while she was looking at all the different animals. She saw elephants, monkeys, and lions!
At the end of the day she had to turn in her ticket to leave. She filled it into the slot and the machine beeped happily. Emma smiled and said goodbye to the zoo. She had a wonderful time and couldn't wait to go back!
