Once upon a time, there was a girl called Amy. She was 3 years old and loved to explore.
One day, she saw a big, shiny thing near a tree in the garden. She ran over to see it. It was a dictionary! She picked it up and sat with it in the grass.
At first, she looked through the dictionary but couldn't make out what it said. She was too young to understand the strange words.
But then she noticed the dictionary had a dangerous spider inside! Amy quickly put the dictionary down and sat away from it.
She was scared, but also excited! She ran to find her mum and showed her the spider. Her mum was worried, but also very proud of Amy for spotting such a dangerous creature.
