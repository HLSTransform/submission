One day, Tom and his little brother, Joe, were in the kitchen. Tom was stirring something in a pot on the stove, while Joe was looking around. He looked up and noticed a wrap hanging from the handle of a drawer. He tugged on it and it came off!
Tom asked "What have you got there, Joe?" Joe replied "It's wrap!"
Tom smiled, "That's right. It's a wrap. It's a bit lazy," he said, pointing to the handle. "Let's wrap this around that handle so nobody can open it."
Tom and Joe wrapped the wrap around the handle. Tom said "Now it's nice and tight. Now nobody can open the drawer without taking the wrap off."
Joe laughed and said, "That was fun!" Tom smiled, glad he had helped his brother to be so smart and successful.
