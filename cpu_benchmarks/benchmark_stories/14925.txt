Once upon a time there was a little girl, her name was Stella. Stella loved to explore, so one day she set out to find a hidden town. She traveled far and wide, looking for the small town. 
At last, Stella saw the hidden town. She was so excited. Little homes made of straw and small shops made of clay were all tucked away in the shadows of the trees. She went up to the first house and peeked inside. What she saw made her smile. 
Inside the house, a family of mice was enjoying a tasty snack. They hadn't noticed Stella, and she didn't want to disturb them, so she quietly backed away. She moved on to the next house and the next shop, and she loved everything she saw. 
At the end of her adventure, Stella sat down and enjoyed watching the hidden town. It was her special secret and she loved sharing it with the animals who lived there.
