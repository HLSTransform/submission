Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big, brown teddy bear that she loved very much. One day, Lily's mom gave her a new novel to read. It was about a princess who lived in a castle.
Lily sat down with her teddy bear and started reading the novel. But she soon realized that her teddy bear was too big and was covering the words in the book. She said to her teddy bear, "Please remove yourself so I can read."
Teddy bear moved aside and Lily continued reading. She was so engrossed in the story that she didn't notice when her mom came in and said, "Lily, it's time for bed." Lily closed her novel and gave her teddy bear a big hug before going to sleep.
