Max was walking in the park when he saw a duck. He wanted to get close to the duck, so he started to walk towards it. Suddenly, Max stumbled on a rock and he fell. He started to cry. Just then, a light shined down on the duck and it flew away. Max felt sad that the duck had gone away, but he smiled when he saw the beautiful light in the sky. He knew that the duck was safe now. Max was very happy and he remembered his stumble in the park.
