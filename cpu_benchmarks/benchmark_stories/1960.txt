Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was feeling scared as it was suddenly very dark outside. The wind was so cold that it made her shiver.
Suddenly she heard a strange noise in the air. It was like something big was flying towards her. She wrote and hid behind a tree.
But then what she saw was amazing! A huge purple dragon had come to give her a big surprise! She was so happy and waved her hands to give it a welcome.
The dragon stepped down from the sky and gave the little girl a big hug. She didn't shiver anymore. She knew she was safe.
The dragon said its goodbyes, flapped its huge purple wings and flew away into the night.
The little girl was never scared anymore. She felt safe and happy and knew that the purple dragon was always looking out for her.
