Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a wiggly tooth that was about to fall out. Her mommy said, "Lily, we need to take your tooth out so the tooth fairy can bring you a surprise."
Lily was scared, but she let her mommy take her tooth out. It didn't hurt at all! Her mommy said, "Wow, Lily! That was an expensive tooth! The tooth fairy will bring you something special tonight."
That night, Lily put her tooth under her pillow and went to sleep. In the morning, she woke up and saw a shiny coin under her pillow. She said, "Mommy, the tooth fairy took my tooth and left me a coin!" Her mommy smiled and said, "That's right, Lily. The tooth fairy always takes teeth and leaves a surprise in return."
