Once upon a time, there was a wild lion. He lived in the jungle with his friends. One day, the lion saw a lemon on the ground. He picked it up and smelled it. The lemon was sour! The lion decided to wave the lemon at his friends to show them how sour it was. His friends laughed and made silly faces.
The lion and his friends played all day in the jungle. They ran and jumped and roared. When the sun began to set, the lion said goodbye to his friends and went back to his den. As he lay down to sleep, he thought about the lemon and how it made him and his friends laugh. He decided that he would try to find more lemons tomorrow to share with his friends.
The next day, the lion went on an adventure to find more lemons. He searched high and low and finally found a whole tree full of them! He picked as many as he could carry and ran back to his friends. When he got there, he waved the lemons in the air and his friends cheered. They all took a bite of the sour fruit and made silly faces again. The lion was happy that he could make his friends laugh and they all lived happily ever after.
