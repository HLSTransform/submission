Annie and her dad were at the beach. They were both so excited.
"Let's go and get the raft, daddy!" said Annie.
Her dad smiled at her, and they both walked to the raft rental store. But when they got there, they found the raft was broken.
"Oh no!" said Annie.
"Don't worry, Annie," replied her dad. "We can still relax here. Look, the beach is really nice, and we can wade in the water."
Annie and her dad sat in the sand, playing games and wading in the shallow water. They had a lot of fun, but Annie was still sad that they couldn't use the raft.
"Daddy, maybe we can fix the raft," she suggested.
Her dad smiled. "You're so smart, Annie! Let's try it."
Annie and her dad worked hard and eventually managed to fix the raft. Annie was so proud of her dad for doing such a great job.
"Come on Annie! Let's go for a ride on the raft," said her dad.
Annie was so happy, and she jumped in the raft with her dad. As they sailed away, Annie looked around, feeling so relaxed.
