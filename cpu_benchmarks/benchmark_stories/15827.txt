Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to sing and dance. One day she saw a big blackboard on the wall. She asked her mom, “Can I sing on it?”
“Yes, of course,” her mom said.
Sue was so excited! She started to sing a fancy song about flowers, birds, and trees. Sue's singing made the blackboard look so beautiful that everyone wanted to join in.
Soon, her mom and dad, her brother, and even her little dog were dancing and singing along. It was the best day ever!
