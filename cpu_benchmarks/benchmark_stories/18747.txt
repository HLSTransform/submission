Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to kick the ball to each other and run after it. The ball was yellow, like the sun and the flowers. It was a happy color.
But then, a big dog came running towards them. The dog was black and brown, and had a loud bark. Ben and Lily were scared of the dog. They thought the dog might bite them or take their ball. They ran away from the dog and hid behind a tree.
"Go away, dog!" Ben shouted. "This is our ball, not yours!"
The dog did not listen. It chased the ball and caught it in its mouth. It shook the ball and made it squeak. The dog was having fun with the ball.
But then, the dog started to sneeze. It sneezed once, twice, three times. The ball flew out of its mouth and rolled away. The dog sneezed again and again. It rubbed its nose with its paw. It looked unhappy.
Ben and Lily peeked out from behind the tree. They saw the dog sneezing. They felt sorry for the dog. They wondered why the dog was sneezing so much.
"Maybe the dog is allergic to yellow," Lily said. "Maybe the ball makes the dog sneeze."
"Maybe the dog is not so bad," Ben said. "Maybe the dog just wanted to play with us."
Ben and Lily decided to be brave and help the dog. They walked slowly towards the dog and held out their hands. The dog stopped sneezing and looked at them. It wagged its tail and licked their hands. It was a friendly dog.
"Hi, dog," Ben said. "We are sorry we were scared of you. Do you want to play with us?"
The dog barked and nodded. It was a harmless dog. It just liked yellow things.
Ben and Lily smiled and threw the ball for the dog. The dog ran after the ball and brought it back. They played together until it was time to go home. They had made a new friend.
