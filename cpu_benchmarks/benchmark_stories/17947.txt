Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a long, soft, blue blanket that she loved very much. She would rub her blanket when she was happy, sad, or sleepy.
One day, Lucy's blanket was gone. She looked under her bed, in her toy box, and even in the kitchen. She could not find her blanket anywhere. She was sad and did not know where her blanket could be. It was a big mystery.
Lucy asked her mom for help. Her mom looked in the laundry room and found the blanket. It was clean and warm from the dryer. Lucy was so happy to have her blanket back. She rubbed it on her cheek and felt cozy. The mystery was solved, and Lucy could sleep well again.
