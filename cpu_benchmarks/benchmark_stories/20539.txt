Once upon a time there was a grumpy old bear. He lived in a garden that was very quiet. One day he heard a sound. He listened closely and he heard a ring!
The old bear looked around and he saw a bell. It was ringing and he wanted to know why. He followed the sound and he saw a little boy. He was smiling and ringing the bell.
The old bear was confused. He asked the little boy why he was ringing the bell and the boy said it was because he was happy to be in the garden. The old bear smiled and he was no longer grumpy.
The little boy and the old bear became friends. They would spend their days together in the garden ringing the bell and playing together.
