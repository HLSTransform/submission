Once upon a time there was a mom and a dad who were getting ready to go on a trip. They were getting married so they needed to hurry and get everything packed. The dad looked around their house and said they needed lots and lots of money because a marriage can be very expensive. He told his wife that they needed to start packing right away.
The mom and dad gathered all the things they needed and put them in their suitcases. Dad told the kids to hurry and get dressed, so they rushed to put on their neatest clothes. They said goodbye to their house, getting in the car, and setting off on their way.
When they arrived, they saw that the marriage was a fancy one. Everything was so pretty and expensive. The mom, dad, and kids all waited in line to go and get married. When it was their turn to go up, they clasped hands and got married. 
The family then hugged and kissed each other. They were so happy to be married and together. The dad said that this was the best thing he ever did and everyone agreed. They were so glad they hurried and got everything done in time to get married.
