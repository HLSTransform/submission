Once upon a time there was a little girl named Emma. She loved fruits and especially pears. One day she wanted to find the best pear ever, so she asked her mom for help.
Emma: "Mommy, can you help me find the best pear?" 
Her mom smiled and said: "I know just the place." 
So they went to the local market. There they saw so many colorful pears. Emma couldn't believe her eyes. 
Suddenly, an old lady came up to them and suggested: "You should try these pears. They certainly are very juicy and flavorful."
Emma was happy and said: "Thank you! I think I'll try those ones." 
The old lady smiled and said: "I recommend you try these two. They are the best!" 
Emma and her mom looked at each other and smiled. Emma took the two pears home and they were so juicy and colorful. 
Emma was so happy and thanked her mom for helping her find the best pears.
