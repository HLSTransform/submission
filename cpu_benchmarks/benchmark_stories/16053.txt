Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy. She was only three years old. Every day, she liked to play in her garden. 
One day, she was walking in the garden when she slipped and fell on the ground. When she stood up, she noticed a notebook lying on the floor. It looked very old and it was full ofscribbles. But Lucy didn't care, she loved it!
In the notebook, Lucy found a delicious recipe for a cake. She started searching for the ingredients she needed in the kitchen. After she found everything she needed, she started baking.
When the cake was done, she put it on the table and shouted out loud: "Mom, the cake is ready!". Her mom came into the kitchen and said "Wow, this cake looks so delicious!".
But then, her mom spotted the notebook and said "Where did you find this notebook, Lucy?". Lucy smiled and said "I slipped and I found it in the garden!".  Her mom smiled and said "That sounds like a very special find".
