Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Joe. He wanted to go on a grand adventure, but he needed something to help him.
He found a box with a lock on it. He tried to unlock it, but it was too hard for him.
Joe asked his mom for help. His mom told him that if he helped around the house, she would unlock the box for him. Joe was excited!
He quickly got to work, cleaning the dishes, tidying the toys and making his bed. After he had done this, his mom came back with a key. She unlocked the box for Joe.
When he opened it, Joe was so impressed! Inside was a beautiful set of new clothes! He quickly put them on and started exploring the world, on a grand adventure!
