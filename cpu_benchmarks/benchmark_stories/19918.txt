Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie lived in a tree with its family. One day, the birdie noticed a crack in the tree. The crack was very weak and could break any time. The little birdie was scared that the tree might fall and include its home. 
The birdie decided to tell its family about the crack. The family listened to the little birdie and decided to move to a new tree. They didn't want to stay in a weak tree that could break any time. 
The little birdie was happy that it spoke up and saved its family. They found a new tree that was strong and safe. The birdie felt proud that it helped its family and kept them safe.
