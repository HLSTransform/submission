Tim and Kim were twins who loved to swim. They had a big pool in their backyard, where they played every day. They liked to dive into the water and splash each other. They also had many toys that they could float or sink in the pool.
One day, Tim and Kim saw a new toy in the pool. It was a big boat that looked like a shark. It had a mouth that could open and close, and a tail that could move. Tim and Kim were curious and excited. They wanted to play with the boat.
They swam to the boat and touched it. It felt hard and smooth. They saw a button on the boat that said "on". They pressed it and the boat came to life. It made a loud noise and started to swim around the pool. Tim and Kim laughed and followed it.
But then, the boat did something bad. It opened its mouth and bit Tim's arm. Tim screamed and tried to pull away, but the boat was too strong. It dragged him under the water. Kim was scared and cried for help. She saw their dad running to the pool.
Their dad jumped into the water and grabbed the boat. He pulled it off Tim's arm and threw it out of the pool. He lifted Tim out of the water and hugged him. He saw that Tim's arm was bleeding and hurt. He said, "Don't worry, son. I'll take you to the hospital. They will do an operation and make your arm better."
Tim and Kim went to the hospital with their dad. The doctors and nurses were very nice and gentle. They gave Tim some medicine and put a bandage on his arm. They said he was brave and strong. They also said they would fix the boat and make it safe.
Tim and Kim stayed in the hospital for a while. They got some ice cream and stickers. They also got a new toy. It was a soft and cuddly dolphin. They named it Dolly. They said they liked Dolly better than the shark boat. They said they would never dive near the shark boat again.
