Mommy was in the kitchen cooking. She was using a lot of heat to make dinner.
The little boy watched Mommy and asked, "Mommy, why do you need to use so much heat?"
Mommy replied, "I need it to cook the food sweetheart. Without heat, the food would be terrible!"
The little boy thought about this for a moment and said, "Can I help you cook? I want the food to be yummy!"
Mommy smiled and said, "Of course! Let's cook something delicious together!"
So, the little boy and Mommy cooked dinner. The little boy loved watching and helping his Mommy cook. When dinner was done, Mommy showed him how to turn off the heat.
The food smelled wonderful and tasted even better. The little boy was so proud that he and Mommy had cooked together. It was a terrific dinner!
