Once upon a time, there was a yellow bird. The bird lived in a small cage. It wanted to fly and play with its friends.
One sunny day, a kind girl saw the yellow bird. She felt sad for the bird. She wanted to help the bird. So, she opened the cage to release it.
The bird was very happy. It flew in the mild air. It played with its friends. The girl was happy too. They all played together in the sun.
