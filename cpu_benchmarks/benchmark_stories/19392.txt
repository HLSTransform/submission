Lily was feeling hot and wanted some shade. She saw a big tree in the park and thought it would be a useful spot. She ran over and sat underneath it. The shade felt so cool and Lily was happy.
But when she looked up, she saw a cat perched in the branches. He was staring down at her. They looked at each other for a moment and then the cat started to meow.
Lily smiled and said, "Hello kitty!" The cat seemed to like that and meowed again. He jumped down from the tree and started rubbing against Lily's legs.
She reached out and started patting him. The cat was so happy, he curled up and fell asleep in the seat that Lily had made for him.
It was hot, but the shade from the tree kept them both cool. Lily stayed there for a while, petting the cat and enjoying her time in the useful shade.
