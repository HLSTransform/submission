Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She wanted to go on a trip with her family, but she needed a passport to go on an airplane. Her mommy and daddy said they would provide her with a passport so she could go on the trip too.
Lily was very excited to go on the trip. She wanted to be independent and walk around by herself. But her mommy and daddy told her she had to hold their hands so she wouldn't get lost.
When they got to the airport, Lily showed her passport to the nice lady at the desk. The lady said she was all set to go on the airplane. Lily was so happy and proud that she had her own passport and could go on the trip with her family.
