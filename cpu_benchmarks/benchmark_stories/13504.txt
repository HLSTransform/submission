Once upon a time, there was a bird named Tweety. Tweety was very wise and always knew what to do. One day, Tweety saw a fountain in the park and wanted to fly over it. But, Tweety didn't know how to fly high enough to get over the fountain.
Suddenly, Tweety saw a friend named Speedy. Speedy was a fast mouse who could zoom around quickly. Tweety asked Speedy for help to fly over the fountain. Speedy agreed to help and climbed onto Tweety's back.
As they approached the fountain, Tweety flapped his wings as hard as he could and Speedy zoomed around to help them fly higher. They made it over the fountain and landed safely on the other side. Tweety was very happy and thanked Speedy for being such a good friend. From then on, Tweety and Speedy had many more adventures together.
