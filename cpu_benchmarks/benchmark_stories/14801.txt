Jill and Ben were jolly twins who liked to play in the park. They had a big red ball, a yellow kite and a blue bike. They ran, jumped and laughed all day long.
One day, they saw a new animal in the park. It was big and brown, with long ears and a fluffy tail. It was a wild rabbit. Jill and Ben wanted to be friends with it. They ran after it, calling, "Hello, rabbit! Come and play with us!"
But the rabbit was scared of the twins. It ran away, hiding behind a bush. Jill and Ben followed it, but they could not catch it. They tried to give it some carrots, but it did not come out. They tried to sing to it, but it did not listen. They tried to be quiet, but it did not trust them.
The twins were sad. They wanted the rabbit to like them. They sat on the grass, looking at the bush. They waited and waited, but the rabbit did not show up.
"Maybe the rabbit is sleepy," Jill said. "Maybe it needs a nap."
"Maybe we should sleep too," Ben said. "We are tired from playing."
They lay down on the grass, next to each other. They closed their eyes and fell asleep. They dreamed of the rabbit and the park.
The rabbit peeked out from the bush. It saw the twins sleeping. It was curious. It hopped out and sniffed them. They smelled nice. They looked nice. They were not scary. They were jolly.
The rabbit decided to be brave. It nudged Jill's hand with its nose. Jill opened her eyes and smiled. She petted the rabbit gently. The rabbit liked it. It licked Jill's face. Jill giggled.
Ben woke up and saw the rabbit. He was happy. He reached out and stroked the rabbit softly. The rabbit wagged its tail. It nuzzled Ben's cheek. Ben laughed.
The twins and the rabbit became friends. They played and cuddled and shared carrots. They were jolly and wild and sleepy. They had a lot of fun.
