Tom and Lily were best friends. They liked to play with blocks and build things. One day, they decided to build a huge heart with red blocks. They worked hard and had fun.
But then, Sam came along. Sam was mean and rude. He saw the huge heart and laughed. "What a silly thing! Hearts are not made of blocks! Hearts are for babies!" He kicked the huge heart and made it fall apart. Tom and Lily were very sad and angry.
"Hey, stop that!" Tom shouted. "You are a bad boy! You broke our heart!"
Sam did not care. He said, "I don't care. I don't like hearts. I like cars and trucks. They are cool and fast. You are boring and slow."
Lily cried. She said, "You are wrong. Hearts are not boring. Hearts are beautiful and warm. They show love and kindness. You don't have a heart. You have a stone."
Sam felt a little sorry. He did not know what love and kindness were. He had no friends. He was lonely and cold. He said, "I don't have a stone. I have a heart. But it is small and hard. No one likes me. No one plays with me."
Tom and Lily felt sorry for Sam. They knew he was unhappy. They said, "We can be your friends. We can play with you. We can teach you how to build a heart. A heart can grow bigger and softer if you share it with others."
Sam smiled. He said, "Really? Can you do that? Can you help me?"
Tom and Lily nodded. They said, "Yes, we can. Come on, let's build a new heart together. A huge heart for all of us."
They picked up the blocks and started to build. They talked and laughed. They gave each other hugs. They made a huge heart with red blocks. And they felt a huge heart in their chests. They learned that building a heart is not silly. It is the best thing to do.
