One day, Mommy and Daddy had a plan. They got some wire and some tools. Daddy put the wire around the yard. Mommy watered the plants. 
It started raining and the wire got wet. Mommy and Daddy had to stop their plan. So they went back into the house. 
Mommy got a towel and dried off the wire. Daddy put it back around the yard. 
Finally, their plan was done. Mommy and Daddy were very happy. They hugged each other and smiled.
