Once upon a time, in a small village there was a puddle. Little Chris was a wise three year old and he liked to help the villagers. One day, he decided to make the puddle bigger. He thought this would be better for everyone.
He went upstairs and found a bucket. He took the bucket and the went back to the puddle. He carefully poured the water from the bucket into the puddle. His friend from the village, little Tania, saw him doing it and came closer. 
Tania: "What are you doing, Chris?" 
Chris: "I'm making the puddle bigger because it will be better for everyone"
Tania: "That is wise of you" 
Chris smiled and kept pouring for a while. After a few minutes, the puddle was much bigger. Chris and Tania were very happy. 
The children watched the puddle until it started to get dark. When they had to go home, they saw many happy villagers enjoying the big puddle. Little Chris was very proud of what he had done.
