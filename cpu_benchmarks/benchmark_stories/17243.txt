Once upon a time, there was a man. He was very playful and loved to play with his toys. One day, he lost his favorite toy and felt sad. 
He looked for it everywhere but couldn't find it. Then, he remembered something his mother had told him. She said that if he believed hard enough, his wish would come true. 
So, the man closed his eyes and believed with all his heart that he would find his toy. And guess what? When he opened his eyes, there it was! The man was so happy and grateful that he hugged his toy tightly. 
From that day on, the man always remembered to believe in himself and his dreams. And he continued to be playful and have fun with his toys every day.
