Once, there was a thin flower. It was in a very small garden and it wanted to bloom. But it didn’t have enough sunshine and rain. The flower felt very sad.
But then, one day, a special razor came and cut through the ground. It was very sharp and that’s how it made the flower very happy! The razor made the garden bigger, so the flower had more space to bloom.
Finally, the flower did bloom. It was beautiful! At the same time, the sun and the rain came and made it even brighter. Everyone in the garden cheered happily.
And ever since, the thin flower has been blooming with joy each day. It’s a happy flower!
