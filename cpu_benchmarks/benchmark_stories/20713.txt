Once upon a time there was a bald man. He loved to whistle and one day he was walking by the beach. He heard a strange sound, it was loud and deep. He looked up, and to his surprise he saw a whale! It was swimming and blowing bubbles. The man smiled and started to whistle. The whale heard him and started to whistle back. Suddenly the man felt like he was flying! The whale was taking him on the most amazing ride. It was the best day ever! The whale carried the man through the water and they laughed and sang together. Then the whale went away, but the man never forgot how fun it was to whistle with a whale!
