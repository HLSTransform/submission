Once upon a time, there was a sign in the sky. It was very big and bright, like a star. Everyone wanted to record what it said.
When they looked, they saw that it said it was harmless. Everyone was so happy! They all wanted to record what the sign said and share it with everyone. 
Everyone ran all around the town telling everyone the good news. Every day they would go outside and record what the sign said. It was a reminder of how kind and gentle the world could be. 
Soon all the people in town were happy and full of joy from the sign's message. For a long time, they remembered the sign, and still talk about it today. 
And that is the story of the harmless sign!
