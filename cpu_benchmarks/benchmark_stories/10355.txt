Anna and Ben were playing with their balloons in the park. They liked to blow them up and let them go. They watched them fly away in the sky.
"Look, mine is higher than yours!" Anna said.
"No, mine is faster than yours!" Ben said.
They argued and argued. They did not see the little bird that was flying near them. The bird was hungry and curious. It saw the balloons and thought they were fruits. It flew towards them and tried to bite them.
"Ouch!" the bird cried. The balloon popped in its mouth. It was not a fruit. It was a bad thing. The bird was scared and hurt.
Anna and Ben heard the bird. They looked and saw it on the ground. It was shaking and spitting. They felt sorry for the bird.
"Are you okay, bird?" Anna asked.
"We are sorry, bird. We did not know you would try to eat our balloons." Ben said.
The bird looked at them with sad eyes. It could not speak. It wished they had not released their balloons in the air. It wished they had been more careful and kind.
Anna and Ben learned a lesson. They learned that their balloons could hurt other animals. They learned that they should not be ignorant and selfish. They learned that they should share and respect the park.
They picked up the bird and took it to a vet. They hoped the bird would get better. They promised to never play with balloons in the park again. They decided to play with balls instead. They also decided to be friends and not fight. They were happy and grateful. The bird was happy and grateful too.
