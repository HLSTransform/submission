Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her backyard. One day, she found a lime on the ground. It was green on the outside and white on the inside. She picked it up and showed it to her mom.
"Mommy, look what I found!" said Lily.
"That's a lime, sweetie," said her mom. "It's a fruit."
Lily was curious about the lime. She squeezed it and smelled it. Then, she asked her mom, "Can we release the seeds from the lime?"
"Sure, let's cut it open," said her mom.
They cut the lime open and released the seeds. Lily was amazed at how many seeds were inside. She decided to plant them in the ground and watch them grow. From that day on, Lily loved to explore and discover new things in her backyard.
