Once upon a time, there was a kitty who loved to play outside. One day, the kitty saw a big orange ball and she wanted to play with it. But the ball was stuck in a bush with lots of fur. The kitty tried to pick up the ball, but it was too hard. 
Suddenly, the kitty saw a little girl walking by. The kitty meowed and the little girl saw her. She came over and saw the ball stuck in the bush. The little girl picked up the ball and gave it to the kitty. The kitty was so happy and played with the ball all day long.
After playing with the ball, the kitty noticed her fur was covered in leaves and dirt. The little girl saw the kitty's fur and gently brushed it with a comb. The kitty felt so much better and purred with happiness. From that day on, the kitty and the little girl became best friends and played together every day.
