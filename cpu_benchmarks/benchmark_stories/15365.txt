One day, John felt very thoughtful. He had a plan to make everyone happy. He went down to the kitchen and grabbed some jars of jam. He started to give out the jam to everyone he knew.
At first, people were happy to get the jam, but after awhile, it started to cause them to suffer. Too much jam was not good for anyone!
John thought about how he could help his friends, so he came up with a different plan. He decided to give out jam sandwiches instead! This way, his friends would not suffer and could still enjoy the jam.
Johnâ€™s thoughtful plan worked! His friends thanked him for the thoughtful jam sandwiches and he smiled, knowing that he made them all happy.
