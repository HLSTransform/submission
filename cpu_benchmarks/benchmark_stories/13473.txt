Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sleep with her pillow every night. One day, Lily's daddy washed her pillow and it felt unusual to her. She didn't like it because it felt different from her usual pillow.
Lily cried and said, "Daddy, my pillow doesn't feel right. It's unusual and I don't like it."
Daddy said, "Oh no, I'm sorry. Let me remind you that it's still your pillow, it just got cleaned. It will feel better soon."
Lily felt better after daddy reminded her and she hugged her pillow tightly. From that day on, she remembered that sometimes things can feel unusual, but it doesn't mean they are bad.
