Once there was a little girl named Lucy. She was wearing her favourite clothes; a pink dress and yellow shoes. She was walking in the park when she spotted a butterfly on a flower. She admired the butterfly, its wings seemed to blink in the sunlight.
Suddenly a different butterfly flew by. It was bigger and brighter than the first one. Lucy couldn't help but smile.
Just then, a voice called out to her. It was her mother. "Lucy! Time to go". Her mother looked friendly and polite. 
Lucy said goodbye to the butterflies and thanked them for the nice surprise. She promised to come back soon to say hello. 
Her mother smiled, it was time for them to go home. Lucy happily took her mother's hand, and off they went.
