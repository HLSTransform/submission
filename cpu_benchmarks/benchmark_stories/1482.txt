There was a busy church. The pastor saw a little girl crying outside. He decided to go and comfort her. He asked her what was wrong and she said her tummy was sore. 
The pastor took her inside the church and gave her some warm soup and bread. He gave her a big, soft blanket to keep her warm. 
The girl smiled and soon she felt better. She thanked the pastor and he said it was no problem. He said he liked to help people who were unhappy or sad. He said he was there if she ever needed a friend.
The girl thanked him again, said goodbye and went back home. She was so glad that the pastor had been there to comfort her.
