Once upon a time, there was an honest ostrich. Her name was Tilly. She liked to run and play in the fields near her home. 
One day, Tilly ran around so much that she got very tired. Then, to her surprise, she fell asleep. 
As she slept something remarkable happened. She began to levitate! Suddenly, Tilly flew above the trees and all over the sky! 
A nearby farmer saw Tilly and he started shouting at her. 
"Come down, Tilly! Come down this instant!", he yelled. 
Tilly nervously called out to the farmer, "I'm sorry, but I don't know how to get back down."
The farmer replied, "You have to trust your instincts and let yourself fall. It will be like you're taking a big jump, but just trust and you'll land safely." 
So, Tilly trusted and fell. And, just like the farmer said, she landed on her feet, safe and sound.
