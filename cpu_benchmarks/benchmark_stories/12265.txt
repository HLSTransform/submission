One day, a little kitten was walking through the forest, looking for something to do. Suddenly, he spotted a big, ugly log lying on the ground. The kitten thought he could do something fun with the log, so he walked up to it and scratched it with his paw.
"What are you doing?" said a voice from inside the log. The little kitten was so surprised that he jumped back. He looked inside and saw a chipmunk peeking out.
The chipmunk walked out of the log and said to the kitten, "My home was in there, but it has been cut in two. Can you help me find something else to live in?"
The little kitten was happy to help, so he went to the nearby trees and found a nice hole for the chipmunk. The chipmunk smiled and thanked him.
The two new friends said goodbye and the little kitten went back to his own home, happy that he had helped the poor chipmunk find a new home.
