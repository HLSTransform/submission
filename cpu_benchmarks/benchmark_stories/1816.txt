Once upon a time there was a young princess. She was very happy because she was getting married. On the day of her marriage, the princess heard yelling coming from outside. She opened the door and saw something terrible! Her fiancé was yelling at another young princess. 
The young princess felt so sad. She knew she had to do something. She walked closer and confronted her fiancé. He said that he had decided to marry the other princess instead. 
The young princess was so upset that she ran away. She ran and ran until she got far away from the castle. She was so sad that she never wanted to get married again. She never saw her fiancé or the other young princess ever again. 
The young princess lived her life alone, never finding true love.
