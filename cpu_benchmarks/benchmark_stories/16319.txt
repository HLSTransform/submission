There was a little bird named Tweetie. Tweetie had a broken wing and could not fly high like the other birds. One day, Tweetie saw some smoke coming from a nearby tree. Tweetie was scared and did not know what to do. 
Then, a group of birds came and started to tease Tweetie. They said mean things like "You can't fly, you can't help us!" But one kind bird named Blue saw that Tweetie was in trouble and flew to get help. 
Soon, the firemen came and put out the fire in the tree. They also saw that Tweetie had a broken wing, so they took Tweetie to the vet. After a few weeks, Tweetie's wing was all better and Tweetie could fly high again. The mean birds felt bad for teasing Tweetie and apologized. From that day on, they all became friends and looked out for each other.
