Once there was a brave little mouse called Monty. One day he went on an adventure. He said to himself, "I am so brave! I will have a great time exploring the world".
Monty journeyed for a very long time. As he explored, he faced many challenges including a big, slippery rock. "How can I get over that?" Monty asked himself. Then something exciting happened. He noticed a rope tied around a nearby tree and it had a way to balance across the rock.
Monty stood on the rope and was very brave. He balanced all the way across the slippery rock. When he reached the other side he was so happy and his excitement echoed throughout the meadow.
He said to himself, "I am so brave! I knew I could do it!"
