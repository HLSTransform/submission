Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the big open field near his house. One day, Timmy was running and he slipped on a banana peel. He fell down and scraped his knee.
His mom came outside and saw Timmy crying. "What happened?" she asked.
"I slipped on a banana peel," Timmy said while pointing to the peel on the ground.
His mom picked him up and brought him inside to clean his scrape. After she put a bandage on his knee, Timmy felt better. He asked his mom if they could go back outside and play in the landscape.
His mom said yes and they went back outside. Timmy was still a little ashamed that he fell, but he didn't let it stop him from having fun.
