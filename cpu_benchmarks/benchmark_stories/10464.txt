Once upon a time, there was an elderly man called George. He was very kind and gentle, but the neighbourhood children would sometimes tease him. One day, when everyone was still asleep, George had an idea. He decided to take a walk and see the sun wake up. 
So early that morning, he left for his walk. All the neighbourhood children were still asleep in their beds. As George stepped out, he saw a beautiful landscape waiting for him. When the sun was about to rise, the space filled up with the first rays of light.
As the sun slowly rose, the neighbourhood children woke up to the beautiful sight. They stopped teasing George and thanked him instead. From then on, the elderly man was known as a wise and kind neighbour.
