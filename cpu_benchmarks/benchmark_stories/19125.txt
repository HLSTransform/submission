Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to eat candy, but her mom said she could only have one piece a day. One day, Lily found a whole bag of candy on the ground. She picked it up and ran to her mom.
"Look, Mommy! I found candy!" Lily said.
"Where did you find it?" her mom asked.
"On the ground!" Lily replied.
Her mom looked at the bag and the weather outside. It was calm and sunny.
"Well, it's a nice day and you've been good, so you can have a piece," her mom said.
Lily was so happy. She picked a piece of candy and started to chew. It was the best candy she ever had! She thanked her mom and ran outside to play.
