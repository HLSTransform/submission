Billy was very excited. He was standing on the doorstep of his new house with his parents, waiting to unpack. His dad opened the door and they all stepped inside.
Billy's mum smiled. "This is the start of a new adventure, sweetheart!", she said.
Billy smiled back and ran into the living room. He noticed the bright yellow armchair in the corner and the sofa with the soft purple cushions. 
Suddenly he saw something strange. At the window was a giant wing!
"What is that, Mum?" he asked, pointing.
His mum laughed. "That's a wind chime. It will make a delicious sound when the wind blows."
Billy nodded and smiled back. He couldn't wait to unpack his new bedroom. He knew it was going to be full of exciting surprises!
