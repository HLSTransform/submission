It was a sunny day and a boy was walking outside. He saw a wet book on the ground. He picked it up and looked at it. He knew he wanted to read it! So he decided to take it home.
When the boy got home he was really excited. He wanted to open the book and start reading. But when he opened it, the pages of the book were stuck together. It was all wet!
The boy was disappointed, he couldn't read the book. But then he had an idea. He quickly ran back outside and found a puddle.
He jumped in and got really wet.
When he got back home he opened the book again. Now that he was wet, the pages weren't stuck together anymore. He smiled and started to read. He was so happy that he had his own book to read!
