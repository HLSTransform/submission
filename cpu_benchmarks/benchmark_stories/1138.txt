Once there was a little girl named Jenny. She was three years old and loved going to the park. One day, Jenny went to the park with her parents. She saw a big fountain in the middle of the garden. Jenny wanted to explore it. She quickly ran to the fountain. Suddenly, she saw a rude puppy in the fountain! The puppy was barky and tried to bite her when she came close. So Jenny snapped her fingers and the puppy flew far away without hurting her. 
Jenny was very happy she was brave enough to snap her fingers and send the puppy away. She looked at the fountain and saw lots of colourful fish swimming in it. Jenny asked her parents if she could touch the fish and they said yes. She put her hand in the water and the fish started swimming around it. It was so fun!
From that day, whenever Jenny wanted to have some fun, she would go for a visit to the fountain at the park. She would snap her fingers and play with the fish. She was so happy and thankful she was brave enough to snap her fingers and send the puppy away.
