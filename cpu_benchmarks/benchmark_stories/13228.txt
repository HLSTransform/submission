Mia was a beautiful little girl with bright, orange hair. She was playing outside when suddenly her ball rolled away. She ran after it, but it rolled too far and rolled right into an old, broken mirror. The mirror fell and broke into many pieces. Mia felt very sad and started to cry.
Suddenly, something orange and sparkly caught her eye. Mia reached out and picked up the orange piece of the broken mirror. It glittered in the light but she was still sad about the broken mirror.
Suddenly, a friendly old lady came from the house next door and saw Mia. She said, "Don't worry Mia, we can fix it!" The old lady took Mia's hand and together they fixed the broken mirror.
When it was all done, Mia put the orange piece back in the mirror and it was as good as new! Mia was so happy and thanked the old lady for helping her. From that day on, every time Mia looked in the mirror, she saw her beautiful, orange hair.
