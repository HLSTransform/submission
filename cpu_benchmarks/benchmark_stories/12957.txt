Once there was a little red bird. He liked to peek at secrets. One day, he heard an animal. It was a little creature called Mr. Rabbit.
"I have a secret," Mr Rabbit said. "But I can't tell you!"
The little red bird begged and begged.
"Please," he said. "Let me in on the secret."
But Mr Rabbit shook his head.
"If I tell you, I'll get in trouble," he said.
The little red bird thought of an idea.
"I won't tell anyone," he said. "I promise. I'll lie to everyone."
Mr Rabbit thought about it. Then he decided to tell the little red bird his secret.
The little red bird was so excited. He kept the secret with him always, and he never told a single lie.
