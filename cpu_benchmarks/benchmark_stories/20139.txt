Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big rock with many colors on it. It looks like an image of a rainbow.
"Wow, look at this rock!" Anna says. "It is so pretty!"
"Can I touch it?" Ben asks.
"Sure, but be careful. It might be hard or sharp," Anna says.
They both touch the rock gently. It feels smooth and cool. They see some sparkles on it.
"It is like a treasure!" Ben says.
They decide to take the rock home and show it to their mom. They put it in their backpack and run to the bike rack.
On the way home, they stop at a bakery. They smell something delicious.
"Can we have a cookie, please?" Anna asks.
"Of course, you can. You are such good kids," the baker says. He gives them each a big chocolate chip cookie.
"Thank you, mister!" Ben says.
They eat their cookies and share some with the rock. They think the rock likes it too.
They arrive home and show their mom the rock.
"Look, mom, we found a rainbow rock!" Anna says.
"It is beautiful, sweeties. Where did you find it?" mom asks.
"In the park, near the slide. It was shining in the sun," Ben says.
"You are very lucky. This is a special rock. It is called a quartz. It has many minerals inside that make it colorful and shiny," mom says.
"Wow, we learned a new word. Quartz!" Anna says.
"Yes, you did. And you know what? You can keep the rock as a souvenir of your adventure. You can put it on your shelf or make a necklace with it," mom says.
"Yay, thank you, mom!" they both say.
They hug their mom and their rock. They are happy and proud of their discovery.
