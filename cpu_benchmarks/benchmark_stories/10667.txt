Mama was baking a cake. She put the ingredients in a big bowl and mixed them all together. She was pushing the spoon around the bowl but she was not stirring fast enough. 
"Mama, can I help?" Ella asked. 
Mama smiled and said, "Yes, Ella. You can push the spoon around the bowl. Just like this." Mama showed Ella how to push the spoon in circles around the bowl.
Ella started pushing the spoon too. They both pushed the spoon around the bowl and laughed together. Then Mama said, "Look Ella, the spoon is breaking the rice!"
Ella was surprised and said, "What does the broken rice do, mama?"
Mama said, "It helps make the cake sweet. Now we can put the broken rice in the cake and it will taste yummy when it's baked." 
Ella was happy that she helped. They both finished stirring and put the cake in the oven. And when it was ready they both had a delicious piece of sweet cake!
