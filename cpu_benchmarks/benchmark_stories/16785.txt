Tom and Lily were playing near the pond. They liked to look at the fish and the ducks. They had some cheap bread to feed them.
"Look, Lily, a big fish!" Tom said, pointing at the water.
"Wow, can we catch it?" Lily asked.
"No, we can't. It's not nice to catch the fish. They live in the pond and they are happy there," Tom said.
"But I want to catch it. It looks fun. And I want to see it up close," Lily said. She took a stick and tried to poke the fish.
"Stop it, Lily! You are scaring the fish. And you might fall in the pond. It's deep and cold and dirty," Tom said.
"I don't care. I want the fish. You are mean and boring," Lily said. She did not answer Tom. She kept poking the fish with the stick.
Tom was angry and sad. He did not like to fight with Lily. He wanted to play with her and have fun. He tried to take the stick from her.
"Give me the stick, Lily. You are being bad. The fish will bite you," Tom said.
"No, it's my stick. Go away, Tom. You are not my friend," Lily said. She pulled the stick and pushed Tom.
Tom fell on the ground. He hurt his knee and his elbow. He started to cry.
Lily saw Tom crying. She felt sorry for him. She dropped the stick and ran to him.
"I'm sorry, Tom. I didn't mean to hurt you. Are you okay?" Lily asked.
Tom looked at Lily. He saw that she was sorry. He stopped crying.
"I'm okay, Lily. It's just a scratch. I'm sorry too. I was mean and boring," Tom said.
They hugged each other. They were friends again.
They picked up the bread and fed the fish and the ducks. They smiled and laughed. They had fun near the pond.
