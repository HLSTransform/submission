Sara and Ben are playing outside in the snow. They make a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They give him a carrot nose and two coal eyes. They are very happy with their snowman.
"Look, our snowman is smiling!" Sara says.
"Yes, he is. He likes the snow," Ben says.
They hear a loud noise. It is a big gray dog. He is running towards them. He looks angry and hungry. He barks and growls.
"Help! A dog!" Sara screams.
"Run! Run to the house!" Ben shouts.
They drop their snowballs and run as fast as they can. The dog chases them. He is faster than them. He is almost near them.
"Freeze!" a voice says.
It is Dad. He is holding a stick. He is alert and brave. He stands between the kids and the dog. He waves the stick and yells at the dog.
"Go away! Leave us alone!"
The dog stops. He is scared of Dad. He turns around and runs away.
"Are you okay, kids?" Dad asks.
"Yes, Dad. Thank you, Dad. You saved us," Sara and Ben say.
They hug Dad. They are safe and warm.
"Let's go inside and have some hot chocolate," Dad says.
They nod and smile. They follow Dad to the house. They leave their snowman behind. He is still smiling. He is happy in the snow.
