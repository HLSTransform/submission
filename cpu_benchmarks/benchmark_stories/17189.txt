Once upon a time, there was a lively child named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore the world around him. One day, Timmy went to the park to play with his friends.
As Timmy was playing, he saw a big dog lying under a tree. Timmy's friend said, "Don't go near that dog, he might bite you!" But Timmy wanted to pet the dog, so he went closer.
The dog didn't bite Timmy, instead, the dog licked Timmy's hand. Timmy was happy and said, "I'm glad I didn't listen to you, my friend. That dog is friendly and likes to lie under the tree."
