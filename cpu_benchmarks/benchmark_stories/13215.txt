Once there was a butterfly. It wanted to fly high in the sky. But all the other animals thought it was weird.
The butterfly kept practicing and practicing. It wanted to fly like the birds. But the birds laughed and said it couldn't do it.
The butterfly knew it could do it. So it kept trying, again and again and again.
Then one day, something amazing happened. The butterfly spread its wings and it flew up and up and up into the sky. It was so happy!
The other animals were so surprised. They had never seen anything like it before. They all cheered and clapped for the butterfly. It was so proud to be able to fly like it had wanted.
