Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in their room. They have a big box of toys. They have dolls, cars, balls, books, and a furry bear. The furry bear is their favorite toy. They hug him and talk to him.
One night, Anna and Ben cannot sleep. They hear a loud noise outside. They are scared. They hold their furry bear and hide under the blanket. They whisper to each other.
"What is that noise?" Anna asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a monster." Ben says.
They hear the noise again. It sounds like a clap. Clap, clap, clap. They shiver.
"Maybe the monster is clapping his hands. Maybe he wants to eat us." Ben says.
"No, no, no. Don't say that. Maybe he is happy. Maybe he wants to play with us." Anna says.
They peek out of the blanket. They see a bright light in the window. They see a big shape in the sky. It has wings and a tail. It is a dragon. The dragon is clapping his wings. He is smiling. He is not a monster. He is a friend.
"Hello, little ones. I am Dino, the dragon. I am flying by your house. I saw your light. I wanted to say hello. Can I play with you?" The dragon says.
Anna and Ben are surprised. They are not scared anymore. They are curious. They smile back.
"Hello, Dino. We are Anna and Ben. We are twins. We like to play with our toys. You can play with us. Do you like our furry bear?" They say.
The dragon nods. He lands on the roof. He is careful not to break anything. He reaches his head through the window. He gently takes the furry bear. He hugs him and talks to him.
"I like your furry bear. He is soft and warm. He is a good toy. Thank you for sharing him with me." He says.
Anna and Ben are happy. They clap their hands. They have a new friend. They play with the dragon and the furry bear. They have fun. They forget about the night. They fall asleep. The dragon watches over them. He is happy too. He flies away. He claps his wings. He says goodbye. He will come back another night.
