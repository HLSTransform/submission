Once upon a time there was a girl named Jill. She was only three-years-old. Every day she went to the pond with her mommy to feed the shrimp. 
One morning, when Jill arrived at the pond, she noticed that something was wrong. The water was very dirty!
Jill asked her mommy, "Why is the water so dirty?" 
Her mommy replied, "I don't understand."
Jill and her mommy walked closer to the pond so they could get a better look. Suddenly, they saw the reason why the water was so dirty. Jill pointed to a big pile of leaves.
Jill said, "Look, mommy! The leaves are making the water dirty. Can we pick them up?"
Her mommy smiled and said, "Yes, let's pick them up so the shrimp can have clean water."
Jill and her mommy worked together, and after only a few minutes all the leaves were gone! The water was clean again and the shrimp were happy. Jill was proud that she helped to make the water clean again!
