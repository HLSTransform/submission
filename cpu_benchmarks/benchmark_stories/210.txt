Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play outside when it is sunny. But today it is rainy and they have to stay inside. They are very bored.
They look at the window and see a big puddle. They want to jump in the puddle and splash. They ask their mom if they can go outside. Mom says no, it is too wet and cold. They have to wait until the rain stops.
Anna and Ben are sad and angry. They think mom is mean. They look for something fun to do inside. They find an umbrella in the closet. They open the umbrella and pretend it is a tent. They crawl under the umbrella and make funny noises.
Mom hears the noises and comes to see what they are doing. She sees the umbrella on the floor and the twins under it. She smiles and says they are very clever. She asks if they want to play a game with her. They say yes, they want to play.
Mom takes the umbrella and holds it over her head. She says she is a giant and they are tiny ants. She pretends to chase them around the room. They run and hide and laugh. They wave at mom and she waves back. They have fun and forget about the rain. They are not bored anymore.
