Sammy went to class to store her fat book. His teacher said, "It needs to go on the shelf!" Sammy looked around the class, but he didn't see any shelves. Suddenly, he spotted a big, fat shelf right in the corner. He grabbed his book and quickly stored it on the shelf. 
Sammy was happy and said, "I'm so glad that I found a place to store my fat book!" Then, he ran back to his friends, who were playing in the corner. They cheered and said, "Way to go, Sammy!" Sammy smiled and he knew that his book was safe. 
The next day, Sammy visited his class again, but this time he was carrying two fat books. He stored both of the fat books on the shelf and felt proud of himself. He had put them on the shelf all by himself! 
Sammy was very happy. He carried his books to the corner and played with his friends. They continued to play until it was time to go home. Sammy and his friends waved goodbye and said, "See you tomorrow!"
