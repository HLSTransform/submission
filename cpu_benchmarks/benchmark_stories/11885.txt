Once upon a time, there lived two friends, Sean and Sarah. They always liked to play together.
Today, they decided to play chess. Sean placed all of the pieces on the board and said to Sarah, "Let's play a game!". Sarah agreed, and they both sat down to play. 
As the game began, Sarah said to Sean, "I will jump in and dive for the black chess piece". Sean was surprised and said, "Wow! You are so brave! That fat chess piece is so far away!". 
Sarah smiled and then jumped in. She swam and swam until she reached the black chess piece and picked it up. Then, she swam back and placed it on the board.
Sean was amazed, "Wow Sarah, that was so cool! You are the best chess player I know!". Sarah blushed and said, "Thanks Sean, you're pretty good too!" 
The two friends laughed and enjoyed the rest of their game. 
What a great day they had!
