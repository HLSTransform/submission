Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to draw and color. One day, Lily was coloring with her black crayon when she accidentally got some on her hands. 
Lily tried to wash her hands, but the black color wouldn't come off. So, she asked her mom for some glue. Her mom gave her some glue and told her to put it on her hands. 
Lily put the glue on her hands and waited for it to dry. When the glue was dry, she peeled it off and the black color came off with it. Lily was so happy that the glue helped her separate the black color from her hands. From that day on, she always had glue in case she needed to separate any colors from her hands.
