Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was only three years old. One day she decided to take a walk in the woods. She walked deep into the woods, when she suddenly spotted a big poppy growing by a tree. She couldn't believe her eyes, it was so beautiful. She decided to meet it. As she got closer to the poppy, she could hear its sweet voice. 
The poppy said, "Hi there little girl, why don't you come and pluck me?" 
Lucy was so excited and she shouted, "Yes please!" 
The poppy laughed and said, "Go ahead and pluck me, I will make your day so much brighter." 
Lucy smiled widely and carefully plucked the poppy. As soon as she plucked it, the poppy gave her a big surprise. It was filled with deep red petals inside! 
Lucy couldn't believe what she was seeing. She thanked the poppy for the beautiful surprise and hugged it tight. She was so happy and went home with a big smile on her face.
