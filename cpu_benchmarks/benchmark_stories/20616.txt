Once upon a time there was a naughty bunny. He wanted to open a cup but he didn’t have the key. He looked around and found a key under a rock. He said, “Woohoo!” The bunny used the key to unlock the cup. He was so happy, he hopped around in circles. Inside the cup was a yummy surprise. It was a tasty carrot cake. The bunny took a big bite and smiled. He thanked the key for helping him unlock the cup. From that day on, the bunny was always very careful when looking for the key to unlock his cup.
