Once upon a time there was a happy little girl who lived in a big house near a fence. Every day she went outside and played by herself. She was always so cheerful to see the fence.
One day she was playing when she suddenly heard a loud sound. It was the postman coming to deliver something! When he arrived, the little girl was so excited to receive her special package.
She ran over to the postman and opened the package. Her face lit up when she saw what was inside. It was a brand new toy! 
The little girl was so happy that she started to run around, jumping and shouting. She was so cheerful that even the birds in the sky sang along with her. 
Soon, the little girl was tired, so she took her new toy over to her house and played with it in the garden. Whenever she looked over the fence, she smiled and thought about the day she had received a special package.
