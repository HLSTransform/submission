Once upon a time, there was a poor man. He had no money and no food. He was very sad and decided to plan a way to get food.
He went to a nearby tree and saw an avocado. He decided to try to get it. He climbed the tree, reached out and plucked the avocado.
He took it to his house and cooked it in a pan. After eating he felt happy. He thanked the tree for the avocado.
From then on, the man was never poor again. He was able to eat good food and was able to plan ahead for his growing family.
The end.
