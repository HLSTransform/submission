Once upon a time there was a little beetle. He was a very gentle beetle and he wanted to fly. One day his mum told him that he is allowed to fly.
The beetle was very excited and flapped his wings. He flew around the garden, over the trees and up in the sky.
He had so much fun flying and making friends with other beetles. But then he got very tired and had to lay on a leaf to rest.
His mum came to pick him up, she was very gentle and carried him back home. The beetle was so happy he was allowed to fly and he will never forget the experience. He fell asleep dreaming of flying all night.
