Once there was a little girl named Mollie, who wanted to be a dancer. Every day, she asked her mom and dad if she could go to dance class. Finally, her parents said yes she could go!
Mollie was so excited! She got all her stuff ready and went to dance class. At first, some of the steps were difficult for her, but she kept on trying. Very soon, she could do all the moves.
Every week, Mollie would go to dance class and practice. All the other kids were so excited to see her and learn new moves. After class, they would all split up and go home.
Mollie loved going to dance class. She kept getting better and better. Her parents were so proud of her! Now, Mollie is an expert dancer, and she loves to show off her moves.
