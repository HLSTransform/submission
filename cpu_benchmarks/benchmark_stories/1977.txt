Once upon a time, there was a bossy angel named Pip. Pip loved flying through the sky, giving people happy dreams and hope. 
One day, Pip was allowed to go to the Earth for a visit. Pip was so excited!
As Pip flew to Earth, she saw a family who needed some help. Pip decided to ask them if she could help, but they just laughed.
Pip was sad and asked, "Why don't you allow me to help you?" 
The family smiled and replied, "We think you are too bossy". 
Pip realized what they meant and nodded. She thought to herself, "I can be bossy, but I only want to help people." 
So, with a happy heart and gentle spirit, Pip waved goodbye and continued her flight. She was glad that she was able to share her angel magic with the world!
