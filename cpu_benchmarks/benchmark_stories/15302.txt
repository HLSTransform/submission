Once there was a humble puppy. He loved to roam in the streets and look for an owner to bring him home. One day, he got very lucky! He found a kind family that wanted to bring him home with them. But the puppy was still a bit scared of the family and wanted to stay in the street a bit longer to think things over. 
The people waited patiently. Eventually, the puppy was ready. He barked and ran up to the family, ready to go home with them. The family was so happy and excited to bring the puppy to their home. 
The puppy had a lot of adventures with his new family. They taught him tricks and took him on long strolls in the park. He was the happiest puppy in the world with his new humble owner. The family and the puppy were best friends forever.
