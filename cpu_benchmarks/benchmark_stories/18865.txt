Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play baseball in the park. Tim has a big bat and a red ball. Sam has a thin bat and a blue ball.
One day, they go to the park to play baseball. Tim says, "I want to use your bat, Sam. It is thin and light. My bat is heavy and hard." Sam says, "No, Tim. This is my bat. You have your own bat. Let's play with our own bats."
Tim is not happy. He complains, "Your bat is better than mine. It is not fair. You always have the best things. I want to use your bat." Sam is not happy either. He says, "Stop complaining, Tim. You are being mean and selfish. You can't always have what you want. You have to share and be nice."
Tim and Sam start to argue. They yell and push each other. They forget about the baseball. They are not friends anymore.
A dog sees the ball. The ball is red and shiny. The dog likes the ball. The dog runs to the ball and grabs it with his mouth. He runs away with the ball.
Tim and Sam see the dog. They see the ball. They want the ball. They stop arguing. They run after the dog. They shout, "Hey, dog! Give us back our ball! That is our ball!"
The dog does not listen. He is happy with the ball. He runs faster and faster. He goes to his home. He hides the ball under his bed.
Tim and Sam are sad. They lose the ball. They have no bat. They have no baseball. They have no fun.
They look at each other. They feel sorry. They say, "I'm sorry, Sam." "I'm sorry, Tim." They hug and make up. They are friends again.
They go to the park. They find a stick and a can. They use the stick and the can to play baseball. They have fun. They are happy.
