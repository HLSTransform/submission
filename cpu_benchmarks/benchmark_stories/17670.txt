One chilly day, Jack the jolly fisherman went out on his boat with his good friend, Spikey. Now, Jack loved to fish and Spikey loved to help, so they made a wonderful team.
The breeze blew and they felt a slight shiver. Suddenly, they spotted a big fish on their line. Jack and Spikey quickly grabbed the rope and pulled it up. Suddenly, the fish was on the boat!
Jack and Spikey cheered and hugged each other in excitement. The fish was so big and beautiful and Jack could not believe it. Jack named him Finny and promised to take care of him.
So, with Finny swimming happily in the water, Jack and Spikey went home, feeling jolly and content.
