Once there was a little girl named Sarah who wanted to do something special. She thought of a great idea. She wanted to bow like a princess. She tried it but it was harder than she thought. She tried and tried but she couldnâ€™t do it.
Sarah was very thirsty, so she went to get some milk. But when she opened the cupboard, she saw that the milk had spilled everywhere! Sarah was very careful and picked up the spilled milk with a cloth, but she was too tired to go get some more milk from the store.
Sarah thought she would never be able to make her dream come true! But then she had an idea. She remembered the spilled milk that she had picked up, so she grabbed a cup and tried to fill it. She was very careful and managed to fill the cup without spilling any more milk.
She quickly tried to bow again, and this time she did it! Sarah was so excited, she had done it! She was so happy and thankful, she had managed to do it using only the spilled milk. Sarah was so proud of herself.
