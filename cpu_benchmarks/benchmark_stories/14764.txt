Lily and Ben are playing with paint and paper. They like to make different shapes and colors with their fingers and brushes. Lily dips her finger in red paint and makes a big circle on her paper. She shows it to Ben and says, "Look, I made a sun!"
Ben nods and smiles. He dips his finger in blue paint and makes a small circle on his paper. He shows it to Lily and says, "Look, I made a moon!"
Lily and Ben decide to make more circles with different colors. They spread the paint on their papers and make yellow, green, purple and orange circles. They are having fun and making a lot of noise.
Mom comes to see what they are doing. She sees the colorful circles and the messy paint. She says, "Wow, you made a lot of circles! They are very pretty, but you also made a lot of mess. And you are very loud. Can you please clean up and be quiet?"
Lily and Ben look at Mom and say, "Sorry, Mom. We will clean up and be quiet. But can we keep our circles? We like them."
Mom smiles and says, "Yes, you can keep your circles. They are very nice. But next time, please use less paint and be more careful. And don't be so loud. OK?"
Lily and Ben say, "OK, Mom. Thank you." They hug Mom and start to clean up. They are happy with their circles and their Mom.
