Once upon a time there was a nice little girl. She loved to play with her film camera. She would insit on taking pictures of her friends and family. 
One day she went to the park with her parents. She took out her camera and insisted she take pictures of the birds. She was determined to capture the birds on film and kept saying 'cheese' to them. Her parents were so proud and tried to get her to take pictures of other things, but she insisted on the birds.
The little girl was so excited when she got the film developed and saw all the nice pictures she had taken of the birds. She was so proud of herself and everyone around her was so impressed that such a little girl had managed to take such nice photos. The little girl knew that she had done a great job and everyone was happy that she insisted on taking the pictures.
