Max was walking in the forest one day when he wondered what he might find. Suddenly he spotted something sparkling in the dirt. It was a bright and shiny gem! Max was so excited he bent down to pick it up but he was a bit clumsy and knocked it away with his foot. Max quickly reached out and caught it, then he ran and hugged it tight. Max was so happy and he knew he wanted to keep the gem forever. He turned and smiled at the gem and wondered what he would do with it.
