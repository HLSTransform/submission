Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play outside. But today it is wet. The rain is falling from the sky. They cannot go to the park.
"Let's play with cars!" Tom says. He has many cars. He likes to make them speed on the floor.
"OK!" Mia says. She likes cars too. She picks a red car. Tom picks a blue car.
They put their cars on the floor. They say "Ready, set, go!" They push their cars with their hands. The cars speed across the room. They make noises like "Vroom, vroom!"
But then Tom's car hits a chair. It stops. Mia's car keeps going. It wins the race.
"Yay! I win!" Mia says. She is happy.
"Aw, no fair!" Tom says. He is sad.
"Don't be sad, Tom. It's just a game. You can try again." Mia says. She is kind.
"OK, Mia. You are a good friend. Let's play again." Tom says. He smiles.
They play with cars until the rain stops. Then they go outside. They have fun in the wet morning.
