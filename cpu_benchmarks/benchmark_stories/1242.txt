Once upon a time there was a generous mouse. He was always looking after others and was very kind. One day, he was looking around and saw a peanut. He thought that it looked delicious and he loved peanuts, so he took it. 
He was a generous mouse, so he decided to share it with his friends. He had many friends, like the birds, the fox and the frogs. He found them all and offered them the peanut. His friends were very happy and thanked him for being so generous. 
The mouse smiled and said he was happy to share it with his friends. He liked to make others happy and sharing the peanut made them happy. 
They all thanked the mouse again and continued on their journey. The generous mouse smiled and went back to looking for more peanuts.
