One day, Ben and Lily went to the beach with their mom and dad. They liked to play in the sand and look for shells. They saw a big wave coming and ran to the water. "Splash!" they shouted as the wave wet them.
But then they saw something terrible on the shore. It was a big fish that was not moving. It had no eyes and its skin was falling off. It smelled very bad. "Ew!" Ben and Lily said. "What is that?"
Their mom and dad came to see. "That is a fish that has rot," their dad said. "Rot means that it is very old and sick and has no life. We should not touch it or go near it. It can make us sick too."
Ben and Lily felt sorry for the fish. They wondered why it had rot and how it came to the beach. They wished they could help it. "Can we bury it in the sand?" Lily asked. "Maybe then it will not smell and other animals will not eat it."
Their mom and dad nodded. "That is a good idea," their mom said. "But we have to be careful and use a stick or a shovel. We do not want to touch it with our hands." They found a stick and a shovel and dug a hole in the sand. They pushed the fish into the hole and covered it with sand. They made a cross with two sticks and put it on top.
"Goodbye, fish," Ben and Lily said. "We hope you are happy now." They went back to play in the water and forgot about the terrible rot. They had fun with the waves and the shells. They were happy.
