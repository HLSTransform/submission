Once upon a time there was a little boy who loved playing in the park. One day, he decided to go out and explore. The little boy put on his red pants and went out. He climbed on the monkey bars and slid down the slide. After some time, he heard a weird smell. He looked down and noticed his pants were covered with something gross and disgusting. He started to speak and asked who had made the mess. Suddenly, a little cat came out from behind the bushes and meowed! The little boy understood that it was the cat who had made the mess. He laughed, picked up the cat and carried it away from the park. The boy and the cat had become friends!
