Lily and Ben were restless. They did not want to nap. They wanted to play. They saw some pens on the table. They had an idea.
"Let's mark the roof!" Lily said.
"Yes, let's mark the roof!" Ben agreed.
They took the pens and climbed on the bed. They reached for the roof. They began to mark it with many colors. They made lines, dots, circles, and stars. They laughed and had fun.
But they did not hear Mom coming. Mom opened the door and saw the mess. She was very angry.
"What are you doing?" Mom yelled. "You marked the roof! You ruined it! You are very naughty!"
She took the pens away and made them get down. She scolded them and sent them to the corner. She said they had to stay there until Dad came home. She said Dad would be very mad too.
Lily and Ben felt very sorry. They wished they had not marked the roof. They wished they had napped. They cried and hugged each other. They hoped Mom and Dad would forgive them. But they did not know if they would.
