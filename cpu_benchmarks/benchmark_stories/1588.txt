Once upon a time, there was a big fish called Tuna. Tuna lived in the ocean with his fish friends. One day, Tuna wanted to go on an adventure. He asked his friends to come along, but they were too scared. Tuna was patient and waited for someone to join him.
Finally, a little fish named Zip wanted to come with Tuna. They swam together through the ocean, seeing all kinds of creatures. Tuna was happy to have a friend with him. 
After a while, they got hungry. Tuna remembered he had a can of tuna in his backpack. Zip was confused, but Tuna explained that it was a special kind of fish that humans like to eat. They opened the can and shared the tuna. It was delicious! 
Tuna and Zip continued on their adventure, having fun and seeing new things. Tuna was happy he was patient and waited for a friend to come with him. They swam together, enjoying each other's company.
