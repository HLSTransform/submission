Once upon a time, there was a person. He was harmless. He was walking down the street and saw that there was a finish line. He wanted to see if he could finish it too.
He walked up to the finish line and asked the person there, "Can I finish the line too?" The person smiled and said, "Of course you can!"
The person was so excited. He started running as fast as he could. He felt the wind in his face and the joy of running as hard as he could. He made it all the way across the finish line and felt so proud.
The person at the finish line clapped and said, "You did it! You finished the line!" The person was so proud and happy. He had done something he didn't think he could do. 
He said to the person, "Thank you so much for helping me finish the line." The person smiled and said "You're welcome. It was my pleasure."
The person went home with a big smile on his face, feeling proud and happy that he had finished the finish line!
