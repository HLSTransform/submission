Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and read her books, but her room was very boring. She wanted to make it more fun, but she didn't know how. 
One day, Lily's friend came over to play. Her friend had a beautiful rug that Lily loved. She asked her friend if she could borrow the rug for a little while to put in her room. Her friend said yes, and Lily was so happy! 
Lily put the rug in her room and it made it look so much better. She played on the rug and read her books on it. When her friend came back to get the rug, Lily was sad to see it go. But she was grateful that she got to borrow it and make her room more fun. The end.
