Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jane who was feeling sad. She had a big problem and didn't know what to do. 
Her Mom came into the room and said, “What’s wrong sweetie? Why are you crying?” 
Jane tried to explain, but she was too upset to find the right words. Her Mom hugged her tightly and said, “Don’t worry, I’m here to comfort you.” 
After a few moments, Jane looked up and told her Mom, “I want a root to make me feel better.” 
Her Mom smiled and said, “I’ll go find you the perfect root.” She went outside and searched around until she found a sweet, little root. 
Mom brought the root back to Jane, who was surprised and happy. Jane said, “Thank you, Mom! I feel much better now.” 
Mom smiled and said, “I'm glad I could comfort you.” Jane hugged her Mom tightly and said, “I love you.”
