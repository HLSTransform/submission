Once there was a brilliant thief who was very sneaky. He would sneak into houses and take things without anyone noticing. He was so good at being sneaky that no one could ever catch him.
One day, the thief snuck into a house and found a pile of shiny coins. He was so excited! He quickly grabbed a bag and put all of the coins inside.
At that moment, the homeowner returned home and saw the thief. The thief knew he had been caught, and quickly ran away.
The homeowner called the police, who quickly came to help. The police searched all around, but they couldn't find the thief.
The thief was so sneaky and brilliant, that the police figure he must have gotten away. But no one knows where he is right now.
