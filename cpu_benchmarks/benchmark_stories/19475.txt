Once upon a time there was a bridge who was very weak. The bridge was not strong and needed help. All the animals who lived near the bridge noticed how weak it was and asked what they could do.
They decided to use a lot of strong sticks and logs to help the bridge. They put them all together, and the bridge was stronger. The bridge was so happy!
Now the bridge was no longer weak and the animals could use it to cross over to the other side. Every day they see the bridge and it is happy and strong. The bridge was now able to do its job.
The End
