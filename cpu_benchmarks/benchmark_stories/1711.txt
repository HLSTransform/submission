Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved going on adventures in the jungle. One day, he went on a search for a rhinoceros. He looked high and low but couldn't find one.
Suddenly, he heard a loud noise. It was a careless hunter who was trying to catch the rhinoceros. Timmy knew he had to help. He bravely ran towards the hunter and scared him away.
The rhinoceros was grateful and thanked Timmy. From that day on, they became good friends and went on many more adventures together.
