Once there was a patient little girl who wanted to do something special. She asked her mom and dad if they could order her some ice cream. They said yes and so the girl got very excited.
The ice cream truck soon arrived with lots of tasty treats. The girl quickly chose her favourite, an ice cream cone. She waited patiently while the ice cream man prepared her order.
Finally, it was ready to go! The girl took the cone, thanked the ice cream man and went to enjoy her treat. She was so happy when she tasted it.
The little girl was so patient throughout her experience, and it was so nice for it all to happen.
