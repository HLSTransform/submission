Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside in his backyard. One day, he saw his friend Billy walking by.
"Hi Billy, want to play with me?" Timmy asked.
"Sure!" Billy said.
Timmy showed Billy his new hut that he made out of sticks and leaves. "This is my hut, do you like it?" he asked.
"It's great!" Billy said. "Can we spend the day playing in it?"
"Of course!" Timmy replied. "It's our regular spot now."
