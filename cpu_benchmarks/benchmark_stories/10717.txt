Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to bounce around in the garden and eat carrots. One day, Benny saw a big billboard with a picture of a carrot on it. He got so excited that he bounced all the way over to the billboard to get a closer look.
But when he got there, he realized he was feeling very sleepy. So he lay down in the grass and took a nap. When he woke up, he saw that the billboard was gone! He was so sad that he couldn't see the picture of the carrot anymore. But then he remembered that he had plenty of real carrots to eat in the garden, so he bounced off to go find some.
