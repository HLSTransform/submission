Once upon a time, there was a bunny named Betsy. Betsy loved to draw with pastels, but her room was always messy. Her mom told her to tidy up before she could draw.
Betsy started to clean up her room, but she was sad because she wanted to draw. Suddenly, her friend Sammy arrived. Sammy also loved to draw, but he had a big box of pastels that he shared with Betsy.
Betsy was happy to see Sammy, but she was also worried because her room was still messy. Sammy noticed and said, "Don't worry about your room, let's draw together!" Betsy was so excited and they drew beautiful pictures together. Betsy realized that sometimes it's okay to have a messy room as long as you have good friends to draw with.
