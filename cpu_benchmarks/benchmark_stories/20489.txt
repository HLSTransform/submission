Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She loved candy more than anything else! Every day, she would go to the store and find new, creative ways to get lots of candy.
Sometimes she would bring something to trade with the storekeeper – like her old toys and clothes. Other times, she would smile and talk sweetly, hoping the storekeeper would be generous.
One day, the storekeeper offered her a special challenge. He said that if she could think of a really creative idea, she could have a whole bag of candy! The girl thought and thought until she came up with the best idea ever!
The next day, she brought the storekeeper a big box filled with all kinds of things – from toys to books to candies and all sorts of other goodies! The storekeeper was so impressed that he gave her two big bags of candy, and she couldn’t have been happier!
From then on, the little girl visited the store as often as she could. She always came up with creative ideas to get more candy, and the storekeeper always rewarded her with a big smile and plenty of treats.
