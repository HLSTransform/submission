Once there was a squirrel moving through the trees. He was looking for something, but he didn't know what it was. Suddenly he saw a little boy sitting all alone. The little boy was sitting on a log and he was sad. The squirrel stopped and said, "What's wrong?".
The boy looked up and said, "I can't find my mommy and I'm scared." The squirrel put his little paw on the boy's shoulder and said, "Don't worry, I'll help you find her." 
The squirrel and the boy began moving through the trees together. They called out for mommy and looked everywhere. But no matter how hard they looked, mommy was nowhere to be found. As the sun began to set, the boy started to cry.
The squirrel was sad too. He said, "It's ok. I'll stay with you until mommy comes back." The little boy smiled and hugged the squirrel. They stayed together until finally, just as the sun was rising, the boy and squirrel saw a woman walking towards them through the trees. It was the boy's mommy. 
The little boy ran to her and hugged her tight. His mommy was so happy to see him. The squirrel was happy too, and he knew that everything was ok. The little boy waved goodbye to the squirrel and thanked him for helping him find his mom. Then mommy and the little boy went home together
