One day, a cat named Tom was very hungry. He saw a tray with a big, yummy cake on it. He wanted to eat the cake, but it was on a high table.
A fast bird named Tim saw Tom and wanted to help. Tim said, "I can fly and get the cake for you, but you must bow to me." Tom bowed to Tim and said, "Please help me get the cake."
Tim flew fast and got the tray with the cake. He gave it to Tom, and they both ate the cake together. They were very happy and became good friends.
