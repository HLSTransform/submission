Once upon a time, there was a sad little girl whose heart was full of pain. She wanted to tell her story, but she felt like no one was listening.
One day, she went out for a walk and stopped at a pond. The pond was filled with calm, still waters and she felt safe there. She shared her story with the pond, and it seemed to understand.
"Please help me," she said. "My heart is full of sadness, and I don't know what to do!"
Just then, a soft voice behind her said, "I know how to help you, if you let me". She spun around, and saw an old woman with kind eyes.
The old woman said, "My shoulder always carries a hidden sadness. I feel it every day, and it's too heavy to bear. But I have found a way to suffer less. Let me help you, too."
The little girl was hesitant, but something in the old woman's eyes filled her with courage. She nodded, and the old woman put her arm around the girl's shoulder.
The girl felt a warmth pass through her body, and suddenly, something inside her heart shifted. The unfamiliar feeling of lightness filled her. The old woman winked, and said, "It's easier when you don't carry it alone".
