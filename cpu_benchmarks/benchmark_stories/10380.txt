Lily and Ben are squirrels. They love to play in the big park. They run and jump and climb on the trees. They look for nuts to eat and hide.
One day, they find a very big nut. It is brown and shiny and smells good. They both want the nut. They say to each other:
"I saw it first. It is mine!" says Lily.
"No, I saw it first. It is mine!" says Ben.
They start to fight over the nut. They pull and push and bite and scratch. They make a lot of noise.
A big bird hears them. It is a hawk. It has sharp claws and a long beak. It likes to eat squirrels. It sees Lily and Ben fighting over the nut. It thinks: "What a tasty snack!"
The hawk flies high in the sky. It swoops down to catch Lily and Ben. They are too busy fighting to notice. They are in danger.
But then, a friendly dog sees the hawk. It is Rex. He lives in the park with his human. He likes to chase birds. He sees the hawk trying to catch Lily and Ben. He thinks: "No, you don't!"
Rex barks loudly. He runs to the tree where Lily and Ben are. He jumps and snaps at the hawk. The hawk is scared. It drops the nut and flies away.
Lily and Ben see Rex. They realize what he did. They feel ashamed. They say to Rex:
"Thank you, Rex. You saved us. You are very brave and kind."
"You are welcome, Lily and Ben. I am glad you are safe. You are my friends."
Lily and Ben hug Rex. They say to each other:
"We are sorry, Lily. We are sorry, Ben. We were silly and greedy. We should not fight over a nut. We should share and care."
They break the nut in half. They give one half to Rex. They eat the other half together. They are happy. They learned a lesson. They love each other.
