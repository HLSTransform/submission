Once upon a time, there was a young boy called Jack. One day, Jack was feeling really sad and he didn't know what to do. He was missing his friends a lot. 
Then his grandma had an idea. She said, "Let's make you feel better. Let's give you a special hug!"
So she gave him a big, warm hug. Jack was amazed at how it made him feel – he felt so much better. 
The next day, Jack decided that he wanted to improve his hugs. He wanted to make them even better, so he tried to give his friends weird hugs! He wrapped his arms around them, tickled them, and even tried to spin them around. 
His friends were so surprised and laughed happily. Jack was even more surprised - he hadn't known that hugs could be so much fun!
From then on Jack gave everyone he met the same weird hugs. As he kept practising and improving, he found that he could make people smile and laugh every time. 
In the end, he realised that hugs were the perfect way to make people feel better – no matter how sad they were.
