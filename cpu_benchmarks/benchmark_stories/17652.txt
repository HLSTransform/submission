Once upon a time, a little pig wanted to buy some hay. He went to the market, but all the hay was too expensive. He was sad. Then a weird thing happened.
A big truck came to the market and it was full of hay. Everyone was very happy. The truck stopped and the driver said his hay was very cheap! The little pig was so happy. He ran over to the truck and bought all the hay.
Now the little pig has enough hay to sleep on. He loves his cheap hay and he always remembers the truck that came to the market and made him so happy. The End.
