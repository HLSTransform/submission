One day, a little girl named Lily was playing outside in the rain. She loved to jump in puddles and splash around. Suddenly, she saw a funny-looking mushroom. "Look, Mommy! A funny mushroom!" she said.
Her mommy came over and said, "Oh, that's a special mushroom. If you touch it, you might shrink!" Lily was scared, but she was also curious. She reached out and touched the mushroom.
Suddenly, Lily started to shrink! She was as small as a toy. "Help, help!" she cried. But her mommy scooped her up and brought her inside. After a few minutes, Lily started to grow back to her normal size. "That was crazy!" she said. "I don't want to shrink again." From that day on, Lily never touched any funny-looking mushrooms again.
