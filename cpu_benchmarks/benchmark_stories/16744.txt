Lily was a brave girl. She liked to play with her dolls and her bike. But one day, she fell off her bike and hurt her arm. It was very sore and she cried a lot.
Her mom and dad took her to the hospital. There were many people and machines there. Lily was scared. She did not like the hospital. She wanted to go home.
A nice lady with a white coat came to see Lily. She said she was a doctor. She looked at Lily's arm and said she needed a bandage. She also gave Lily a sticker and a lollipop. Lily smiled a little.
The doctor said Lily had to stay in the hospital for a while. She showed Lily a bed with a curtain. She said Lily could sleep there and watch TV. She also said Lily could have a visitor.
Lily thought of her best friend, Max. He had a toy car that he liked to show her. She wondered if he could come to the hospital. She asked her mom and dad.
They said yes, but they had a surprise for Lily. They said Max was already in the hospital. He was in another bed, hidden by a curtain. He had a cold and had to rest.
Lily was happy and surprised. She wanted to see Max. She managed to get up from her bed and walk to his bed. She pulled the curtain and saw Max. He was happy and surprised too. He showed Lily his toy car. He also gave Lily a hug.
Lily and Max played with the toy car and watched TV. They forgot about their hurts and their fears. They were glad they had each other. They were brave together.
