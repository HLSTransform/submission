Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and write on paper. One day, she asked her mom for a new notebook to write in. Her mom gave her an original notebook with a pretty dress on the cover. 
Lily was so happy and started to write stories in her new notebook. She wrote about a princess who wore a beautiful dress and went on adventures. 
Her little brother saw her writing and asked, "What are you doing, Lily?" 
"I'm writing a story about a princess," Lily replied. 
"That's cool," her brother said. "Can I draw a picture for your story?" 
Lily smiled and said, "Yes, that would be great!" 
Together, they made an original story with pictures and words. Lily was so proud of her new notebook and the story she wrote with her brother.
