One day, a fat cat and a small dog were walking in the park. They saw a big jar of jam on a table. The cat said, "I want to eat that jam!" The dog said, "Me too! Let's unite and get it together."
They tried to jump up to the table, but they were too short. A little bird saw them and knew what they wanted. The bird said, "I can help you get the jam, but we must unite to do it." The cat and the dog agreed.
The bird flew up and pushed the jam off the table. The fat cat and the small dog caught it. They all shared the jam and were very happy. They learned that when they unite, they can do big things.
