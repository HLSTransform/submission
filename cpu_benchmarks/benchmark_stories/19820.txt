Once upon a time there lived a little girl. She was so small that everyone called her a "teeny-weeny". She lived with her mom in a cozy house. 
But one night, something terrible happened. A big hook crept into the teeny-weeny's bedroom. As the hook came closer, the teeny-weeny began to scream. 
Her mom rushed in and saw the hook. She took the teeny-weeny in her arms and helped her to feel safe again. The teeny-weeny was so tired that she fell asleep in her mom's arms. 
The mom took the teeny-weeny back to her bedroom and tucked her in bed. Then, the mom used her magic to make the terrible hook disappear.
The teeny-weeny slept soundly all night, safe and secure with her mom nearby. In the morning, the teeny-weeny woke up feeling happy and relaxed.
