Once upon a time, there was a boy named Max. Max had a razor that he used to shave his dad's beard. One day, Max's dad asked him to go to the store to buy milk. Max was tired, but he wanted to help his dad, so he said, "Okay, I will go." Max put on his shoes and started to jog to the store. 
When Max got to the store, he saw his friend Lily. "Hi, Max!" Lily said. "What are you doing here?" Max replied, "I came to buy milk for my dad." Lily said, "That's nice of you. Do you want to play?" Max said, "I'm too tired to play. Maybe later." 
Max bought the milk and jogged back home. When he got home, his dad was happy to see him. "Thank you for getting the milk, Max," his dad said. Max replied, "No problem, dad. I'm happy to help."
