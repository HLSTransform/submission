Once there was a little girl named Jane. She was three years old and very brave. One day, she was walking in the park. She saw a zoom and wanted to ride it. She looked upon the zoom and chose the blue one. 
Jane got on the zoom and started to pedal. It was very exciting! She went around and around, squealing with delight. Soon, she came to a rough patch of grass. It bumped up and down and made the zoom go faster. 
Jane loved it! She wanted to stay zoom until the sun went down, but eventually her mom said it was time to go home. Jane got off her zoom and she chose a different one for next time. 
The end.
