Once there was a brave fish who lived in the big deep blue sea. Every day he would swim happily in the sunny waters, looking for his friends. One day, he saw something unusual. It was a net!
The brave fish stayed very still. He could feel the net closing around him. He was going to be trapped! Suddenly, another fish swam up and said, "Let me help you!"
The brave fish smiled. Together, they worked to untangle the net so the brave fish could escape. Eventually, they were able to work the net free. The brave fish was so happy!
But then, the other fish began to tease him. "Why were you so scared of the net?" he said. The brave fish didn't know what to say! He was embarrassed that he'd been caught.
But then his friend said, "That was so brave of you to face the net." The brave fish smiled. He felt so happy and proud. He had faced the net, and he was free!
