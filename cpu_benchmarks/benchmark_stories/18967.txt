One day, a little boy named Tim wanted to play hockey. He had a colorful hockey ball. He asked his friend, Lily, to play with him. Lily said, "Yes, let's play!"
They went to the park to play. Tim hit the ball with his hockey stick. The ball went far away. It went into the bushes. Tim and Lily looked for the ball. They could not find it. The ball was hiding.
Tim said, "Let's play hide and seek with the ball." Lily agreed. They looked and looked. At last, they found the colorful ball hiding behind a tree. They were happy and played hockey all day long.
