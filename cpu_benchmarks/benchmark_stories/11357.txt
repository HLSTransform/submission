Once upon a time, there were two friends called Max and Mia. Max and Mia loved playing with their blocks, building tall castles and having adventures.
One day, they disagreed on which colour block to put next. Max wanted to put a pink block, but Mia wanted to put a green block. Max crossed his arms and said 'No, pink!'. Mia crossed her arms and said 'No, green'.
Max and Mia kept disagreeing, until finally Max had a clear idea. He said to Mia 'Let's make a rainbow! A pink block will go first, then a green one. All the other colours can follow.'
Mia nodded and said 'Great idea!'.
So, Max and Mia worked together to make a beautiful rainbow castle with their blocks. They were very happy and agreed that it was much better than arguing.
