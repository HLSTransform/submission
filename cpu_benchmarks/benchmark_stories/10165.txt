Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max liked to follow his owner, Sarah, everywhere she went. One day, Max saw a cat and decided to follow it. The cat ran into an alley, and Max followed. Suddenly, Max heard a loud noise. He looked around and saw that there was a leak in a nearby pipe. The water was coming out fierce and fast. Max knew he had to go back to Sarah and tell her about the leak so she could call someone to fix it. Max ran back to Sarah and barked until she followed him back to the alley. Sarah saw the leak and thanked Max for being such a good dog and following his instincts.
