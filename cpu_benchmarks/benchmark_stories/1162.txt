Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived an elderly lady with her sister. They were very close and loved to take walks together. Every day, they would hold hands and walk around their garden, looking at the pretty flowers.
One sunny day, the elderly lady's sister saw a big, red ball in the garden. She wanted to take it home and play with it. But the elderly lady said, "No, we should not take things that are not ours."
The sister did not listen and took the ball home. They played with the ball all day, laughing and having fun. But soon, a little boy came to their house, crying. He said the ball was his and he had lost it.
The elderly lady and her sister felt very sad for taking the ball. The boy was angry and took his ball back. The sisters learned that it is not good to take things that do not belong to us. From that day on, they always remembered to be kind and honest.
