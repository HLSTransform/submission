Today Mummy baked a turkey for lunch. The kitchen filled with the delicious smell of the bird as it cooked. She smiled and nodded when she tasted it - it was perfect.
John was so excited. He had been waiting impatiently at the table for the turkey to be served. Mummy placed it in the middle of the table and John grinned. He nodded in approval.
Mummy put some vegetables on John's plate but he wasn't interested. He only wanted turkey. He asked for more, and Mummy had no choice but to give it to him.
John ate so much turkey that he was feeling a little bit spoiled. He burped and patted his tummy with satisfaction. Mummy smiled and shook her head - it was good to be a kid!
