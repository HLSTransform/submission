Once upon a time, there was a chubby little girl named Lucy. She loved playing in the park with her dolls. Every day, Lucy would take her dolls with her to the park and have lots of fun.
One day, Lucy was almost at the park when it began raining. She was so disappointed because she had been looking forward to playing there all day. Lucy was about to turn around and go home when she remembered that her dolls still needed to go to the park. So, she decided to delay the rain and try to make it in time.
Lucy ran as fast as she could. She was so close to making it to the park when the rain started to fall harder. Despite her best efforts, she was just a minute too late to reach the park and had to go in without playing with her dolls.
Lucy was sad, but she smiled when she remembered that she could go back again tomorrow. She knew that if she really wanted to play in the park with her dolls, she would just have to delay a little bit longer.
