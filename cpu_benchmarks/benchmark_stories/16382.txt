Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a curious little girl named Lily. Lily liked to play with her friends and look at all the colors in the forest. One day, Lily saw a big tree with a frown on its face. She was very curious and wanted to know why the tree was sad.
Lily asked her friends, the birds and the squirrels, if they knew why the tree was sad. They didn't know, but they wanted to help Lily find out. So, they all went to the tree and asked it why it was frowning. The tree said it was sad because it had lost its favorite color, green.
Lily and her friends wanted to make the tree happy again. They looked all over the forest to find the color green. They found green leaves, green grass, and even green bugs! They brought all the green things back to the tree. The tree was so happy to see all the green colors that it smiled again. Lily and her friends were very happy that they could help the tree find its favorite color.
