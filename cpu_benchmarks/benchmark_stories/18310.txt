Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He wanted to be a doctor when he grew up, but his mom told him he had to study hard to succeed. 
One day, Timmy got sick and had to go to the hospital. There, he met a nice nurse named Sarah. She was very busy, but she always had time to play with Timmy and make him feel better. 
Timmy loved Sarah and wanted to be a nurse just like her when he grew up. He worked hard in school and finally succeeded in becoming a nurse. 
But one day, there was a big accident at the hospital where Timmy worked. He tried his best to help, but there were too many patients and not enough nurses. Timmy was very sad that he couldn't save everyone.
