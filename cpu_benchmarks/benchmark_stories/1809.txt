Emma was out bike riding. She was so excited and worked up a sweat. Suddenly, she spotted a sign. It said, "Tough trail ahead!" She wanted to prove how brave she was so she filled with determination and set off.
She started off on the trail and it was very tough. She stumbled a few times but eventually started to get the hang of it. Finally, she was so close to the top. She cheered and cheered until suddenly, she made a wrong turn.
She found herself in a dark and scary part of the woods. Fear filled her chest. She tried to turn back, but it seemed that no matter which way she went she couldn't get back to the trail she was following before.
She sat and cried feeling lost and alone. Suddenly, a voice spoke up. It said, "Looks like you are in a tight spot. Don't worry, I will help you get back, but I will need something first..."
Emma trembled. She gave him the only thing she had with her - her bike. The mysterious figure then vanished into the dark night, leaving nothing behind but a dark and empty feeling. 
Emma was never able to find her way back home.
