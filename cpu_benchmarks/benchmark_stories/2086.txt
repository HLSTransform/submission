Once upon a time, there was a lively little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, Lily's mom asked her to sort her toys into different boxes. Lily did not want to stop playing, but she knew she had to listen to her mom.
As Lily sorted her toys, she noticed that her favorite toy, a teddy bear, was missing. She looked everywhere but could not find it. Lily started to cry because she loved her teddy bear so much.
Suddenly, Lily's little brother came into the room with her teddy bear in his arms. He had taken it without asking. Lily was upset and told her brother that it was not nice to take things without asking. Her brother apologized and gave her the teddy bear back. From that day on, Lily made sure to always put her toys away and keep them safe.
