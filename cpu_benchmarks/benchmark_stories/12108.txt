One day, a little boy named Timmy went to the park with his mom. Timmy loved going to the park because there were lots of things to do. He liked to swing on the swings and slide down the slide. 
While Timmy was playing, he saw a man with a big motor. The motor made lots of noise and Timmy thought it was interesting. He went up to the man and said, "Hi! What are you doing?" 
The man replied, "I'm fixing the swings. The motor helps me do my job." Timmy wanted to help too, so he said, "Can I help you fix the swings?" 
The man smiled and said, "Sure! You can help me hold the tools." Timmy was so excited to help. He held the tools while the man fixed the swings. When they were done, Timmy said, "Thank you for letting me help. That was fun!" And the man said, "You're welcome. It was nice to have some help."
