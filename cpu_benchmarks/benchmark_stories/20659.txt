Once upon a time there was a graceful girl. She always wore a smile and had a cheerful song in her heart. One day she was walking along humming when something shiny caught her eye. It was a notebook peeking out of her neighbor's window. She knew she shouldn't, but she wanted to see what was inside.
The girl opened the notebook and what she saw made her smile. Her neighbor had filled it with beautiful drawings. She flipped through the pages, admiring each one. When she came to the last page, she was so delighted that she couldn't help but clap her hands.
The girl's neighbor must have heard her, because a moment later he appeared in the window. He smiled and waved a hand at her in thanks. The girl lifted her hand to wave back and then the two of them just stood there for a moment, looking at each other in appreciation. She knew the notebook meant a lot to her neighbor, and that her applauding his work had really made him feel good.
So the girl smiled and waved goodbye and continued on her way. She felt so graceful and full of joy that she couldn't help but sing and dance for the rest of the day. And that's all there is to the story!
