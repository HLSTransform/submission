Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was so creative and always loved to explore. One day, she found something interesting. It was a big building! She was so excited and wanted to know what was inside the big building. She gathered her friends and they all went to the building together. 
When the little girl and her friends got inside the building, they were amazed. Everywhere they looked, there were creative items. Some were colors, some were shapes and some were even toys. The little girl and her friends ran around gathering all of the creative items. 
Before long, their arms were full! They laughed and played with their new treasures. Although they had to leave the building eventually, they will always remember their time there.
