Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his tools, especially his hammer. He would bang and tap on anything he could find. 
One day, Timmy's mom asked him to dress up quickly because they were going to the park. Timmy put on his red shirt and blue shorts as fast as he could. He was so excited to play on the swings and slide. 
When they got to the park, Timmy saw a big sandbox. He ran over to it and started digging with his shovel tool. He made a big hole and then filled it back up. He did this over and over again, having so much fun. 
As the sun started to set, Timmy's mom said it was time to go home. Timmy was sad to leave, but he knew he could come back and play with his tools again soon. He waved goodbye to the park and went home with his mom, feeling tired but happy.
