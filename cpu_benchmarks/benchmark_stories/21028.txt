Timmy was sad. He had wanted to design a boat to sail in the deep sea with an anchor, but his parents told him he was too young. But then one day, his parents returned home with a box and told him it had something special inside. 
Timmy was  excited and eager to open the box. Inside were all the pieces he needed to design his own boat. Timmy quickly got to work and soon had all the pieces put together.
He eagerly ran outside with his boat and found a deep pond. He took out the anchor and put it in the pond. Timmy put his boat on the water and started to pull the anchor. He was amazed to see that the boat started to move away from the shore. 
The wind was blowing and Timmy was loving the feeling of sailing in the deep pond. He had designed his own boat and it was working perfectly. Timmy waved goodbye as the wind took him further away. He was so proud of himself!
