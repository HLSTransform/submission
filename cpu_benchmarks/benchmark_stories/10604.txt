John and his dad were walking home from school one day, when they saw an elderly lady at the bus stop. She had lots of bags with her and seemed very tired.
John's dad turned to him. "John, why don't we help this lady by getting her a taxi?"
John nodded and ran ahead to the taxi stand. He called out, "Taxi!"
A taxi with a friendly-looking driver stopped in front of the bus stop and Uncle Willie unlocked the door. The elderly lady smiled gratefully.
John and his dad helped her with her bags and waved goodbye as the taxi drove away. The elderly lady thanked them with a happy smile as she waved goodbye.
John was very happy that he was able to help the lady. His dad said to him, "John, it's important to help others in need. Today, you unlocked the door to a better day for that lady."
