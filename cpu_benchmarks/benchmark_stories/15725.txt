Once there was a strong bear named Toby. He was walking through the woods one day when he smelled something sweet. He sniffed and sniffed 'til he found it - a jar of delicious jam! Toby was so happy and he quickly grabbed it.
However, when he looked up, he saw a naughty racoon hopping around him. The racoon quickly snatched the jar from Toby and smiled at him. The bear shouted and demanded, "Give me back my jar of jam!" But the racoon just laughed and hopped away.
Toby was very angry and followed the racoon. As they ran, the bear shouted, "Give me back my jam right now!" 
The racoon stopped and looked at Toby. He snickered and said, "Okay, Toby bear, if you can catch me, I'll give it back to you!" Toby raced forward and grabbed the jar of jam. The racoon was impressed and smiled. He put his hands up and said, "I guess you're strong enough to get it back!"
Toby was happy as he carried the jar of jam away. He knew he was strong enough and he was glad he won!
