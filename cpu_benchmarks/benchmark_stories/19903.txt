Once upon a time, there was a big yellow bird named Sunny. Sunny loved to sing and fly in the sky. One day, Sunny met a little bird named Tweetie. Tweetie was sad because she didn't have any friends. Sunny wanted to be Tweetie's friend, so he said, "Let's share some seeds and be friends!"
Tweetie was happy and said, "Yes! Let's share!" They ate the seeds together and sang songs. They had so much fun together that they decided to start a band.
They practiced every day and finally had a big concert. All the animals came to watch them play. They played so well that everyone clapped and cheered. They were a success!
But then, a big storm came and destroyed their nest. Sunny and Tweetie were sad because they had nowhere to live. They tried to find a new home, but they couldn't. They were so sad that they stopped singing and playing music. The end.
