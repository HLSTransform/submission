Sara and Tom are playing in the kitchen. They want to make a jug of lemonade for their mom. They think it is important to do something nice for her.
They find a big jug and some lemons. They squeeze the lemons with their hands and pour the juice into the jug. They add some water and some sugar. They stir the jug with a spoon.
"Look, we made lemonade!" Sara says. "It smells good!"
"Let's taste it!" Tom says. He takes a sip from the jug. He makes a funny face. "It is too sour!"
Sara takes a sip too. She agrees. "It is too sour! We need more sugar!"
They add more sugar and stir again. They taste it again. They smile. "Now it is good!" Sara says.
They pour some lemonade into two cups. They carry the jug and the cups to the living room. They find their mom reading a book on the couch.
"Mom, we made something for you!" Tom says.
"What is it?" Mom asks.
"It is lemonade!" Sara says. "We made it with lemons and water and sugar. It is important to drink lemonade when it is hot!"
Mom smiles. She takes a cup and sips the lemonade. She says it is delicious. She thanks Sara and Tom for their gift. She hugs them and tells them they are very sweet.
Sara and Tom are happy. They drink their lemonade with their mom. They think it is the best lemonade ever.
