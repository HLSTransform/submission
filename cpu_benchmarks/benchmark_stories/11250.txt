Once upon a time there was a little boy named Charlie. Charlie was a brave and daring boy, who was always ready to try anything. One day Charlie decided to try something new - coffee.
At first, Charlie's mom tried to discourage him, but Charlie was desperate to try it. "You must be careful," warned mom. 
So, Charlie went to his kitchen and made himself a cup of coffee. He took a sip and it was very dry and bitter. After a few sips, Charlie spat it out and quickly ran to his mom. 
"Mom," said Charlie, "the coffee isn't nice!" 
"That's ok," said mom with a smile. "Trying new things can be tricky sometimes. Let's encourage you to try something else." 
Charlie smiled. He was happy that his mom was there to encourage him.
