Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, his mommy told him that they needed to clean up his room. Timmy didn't want to clean up because it was hard work, but his mommy said it was important to learn how to keep things in order.
Timmy tried his best to clean up his toys, but he got distracted and started playing again. His mommy came back and saw that he hadn't finished cleaning. She got very upset and told Timmy that he needed to learn to listen and follow directions. Timmy felt sad and wished he had worked harder.
Later that day, Timmy went outside to play again. He saw a big dog and wanted to pet it, but he didn't know that he needed to ask the owner first. The dog got scared and bit Timmy. Timmy had to go to the hospital and get stitches. It was a very bad ending to his day, but he learned that it's important to listen and follow rules to stay safe.
