Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. Sally had beautiful pale blonde hair and big blue eyes. Everywhere she went, people would welcome her with a smile.
One day, Sally and her mommy went to the beach. As Sally looked around, she saw so many wonderful sights. There were birds swooping and diving, fish swimming in the ocean, and brightly colored umbrellas.
Sally got more excited when she spotted a sandy horse in the sand. She ran over to the horse and hugged it. "Welcome!" she said.
Sally loved seeing all the bright colors, but what she loved most was the pale blue sky. She felt so blessed to be able to see such a beautiful sight. She thanked God for the wonderful sky.
The happy little girl took in one last look of the sky before heading back home with her mommy. She was so grateful for the amazing sights she had seen that day.
