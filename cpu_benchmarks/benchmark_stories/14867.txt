Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He went on a trip with his family to visit his grandma. When they got to her house, they had to unpack their bags. Timmy helped his mom and dad unpack their bags too. 
After they finished unpacking, Timmy went to explore the backyard. He found a big well that made a noisy sound. Timmy was scared of the noise, but his dad explained that it was just the sound of the water. 
Later that day, Timmy's grandma made him a delicious sandwich. He ate it while sitting next to the noisy well. Timmy had a fun day with his family and was happy to visit his grandma.
