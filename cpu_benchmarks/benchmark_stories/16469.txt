Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to find pebbles and make shapes with them. Tom found a big, round pebble that was very clean and shiny. He was happy and showed it to Lily.
"Look, Lily, I found a nice pebble. It is round and clean and shiny. I want to keep it," Tom said.
Lily looked at the pebble and liked it too. She wanted to have it for herself. She tried to grab it from Tom's hand.
"No, Lily, this is my pebble. I found it first. You can find your own pebble," Tom said.
But Lily did not listen. She pulled hard and made Tom drop the pebble. The pebble rolled away and fell into a puddle. It became dirty and wet.
"Oh no, my pebble!" Tom cried. He was sad and angry.
Lily felt sorry for what she did. She saw that Tom was hurt and that the pebble was ruined. She wished she had not been greedy and mean.
"I'm sorry, Tom. I was wrong. I should not have taken your pebble. Can you forgive me?" Lily said.
Tom looked at Lily and saw that she was sorry. He did not want to be mad at her. He knew that pebbles were not as important as friends.
"It's okay, Lily. I forgive you. You are my friend. Maybe we can find another pebble together," Tom said.
They hugged and smiled. They learned that sharing and caring were better than fighting and taking. They went to look for another pebble together. They were happy.
