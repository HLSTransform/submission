Once upon a time, there was a man named Bill. One day, Bill wanted to get something in the mail. He went to the front door and he saw something cold. He opened it and there was a package! Bill opened the package and found a tasty treat. It was yummy!
After he finished eating, Bill had an idea. He went to the back yard and put the package in his mouth. Then he started running around the yard. He was delivering it to all his friends!
When he was done delivering, Bill was out of breath and his mouth was very cold. He was so happy to have been able to deliver the package to all his friends. He was so glad that he had shared his treat with everyone!
