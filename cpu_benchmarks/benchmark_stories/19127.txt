Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One morning, she went to the kitchen to make some toast for breakfast. She put the bread in the toaster and waited for it to pop up. When it was ready, she spread some butter on it and ate it all up.
After breakfast, Lily went to play with her toys. Her little brother, Max, wanted to play with her too, but he was being naughty and kept taking her toys. "Max, stop being naughty!" Lily said. "You need to share with me."
Later that day, Lily's mom asked her to help weigh some fruits and vegetables for dinner. Lily was happy to help and used the scale to weigh everything perfectly. When dinner was ready, Lily was proud that she had helped her mom.
