Lily loved her doll very much. She gave her doll a name, Anna, and played with her every day. She dressed her doll in pretty clothes, brushed her hair, and sang to her. Lily was happy with her doll.
One day, Lily had to go to the store with her mom. She did not want to leave her doll alone in her room. She was afraid that her brother, Tom, would take her doll and make fun of her. Tom was older and liked to tease Lily. He said that dolls were silly and only for babies. Lily did not like that.
So Lily decided to lock her doll in her closet. She found a key and turned it in the lock. She said to her doll, "Don't worry, Anna. I will be back soon. You will be safe here. I love you." She kissed her doll and closed the closet door.
But when Lily came back from the store, she could not find the key. She looked everywhere, but it was gone. She started to cry. She wanted to see her doll. She missed her doll. She knocked on the closet door and said, "Anna, are you there? I'm sorry, I lost the key. Please don't be mad at me."
Then she heard a voice from the closet. It was not her doll. It was Tom. He said, "Ha ha, Lily. I found your key. I opened the closet and took your doll. She is so ugly and stupid. Look what I did to her." He opened the closet door and showed Lily her doll. He had cut her hair, ripped her clothes, and drawn on her face. Lily was shocked and sad. She screamed and ran to her mom.
Tom was ashamed. He knew he had done a bad thing. He had hurt Lily and her doll. He had been mean and cruel. He wished he could take it back. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I'm sorry, Anna. I was wrong. Please forgive me." He gave Lily her doll and the key. He hoped they could be friends again.
