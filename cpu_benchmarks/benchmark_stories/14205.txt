A momma and her little one were in the garden. The sun was bright and there was a gentle motion in the wind. The little one watched as a butterfly flew gracefully across the sky. The little one was so patient. She waited and waited until the butterfly disappeared.
But then, it happened. Suddenly there was a loud noise, and the little one woke up. It was the noise of the gentle wind that had been so calming only moments ago. The little one could feel the motion of the wind again, but this time it was stronger.
The momma told the little one that the wind was only playing. She said it was time to go back inside. The little one listened and was patient, following her momma back into the house.
The wind tried to follow them, but it couldn't. Eventually, it settled down and the little one smiled, knowing that the wind had been only playing.
