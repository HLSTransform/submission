Tommy likes to record things with his toy camera. He likes to record his toys, his dog, his mom and dad, and his baby sister. He thinks it is fun to watch them later on the TV.
One day, Tommy decides to record his dad when he is taking a nap on the couch. He sneaks up to him and points his camera at his face. He presses the red button and says, "Dad, you are on TV!"
But Tommy does not know that his dad is not really sleeping. He is just pretending. He opens his eyes and makes a funny face at Tommy. He says, "Boo!"
Tommy is so surprised that he drops his camera and runs away. He is scared and embarrassed. He thinks his dad is mad at him.
But his dad is not mad. He is just playing. He picks up the camera and follows Tommy. He says, "Tommy, come back! I want to see your record. It is a funny sight. You are a good camera man."
Tommy hears his dad and stops. He turns around and sees his dad smiling. He smiles too. He is not scared or embarrassed anymore. He is happy. He runs to his dad and hugs him. He says, "Dad, you are silly. I love you."
They go to the TV and watch the record together. They laugh and have fun. Tommy thinks his dad is the best. He says, "Dad, can we record more things?"
His dad says, "Sure, Tommy. We can record anything you want. But first, let me record you. You are a wonderful sight. You are my son."
