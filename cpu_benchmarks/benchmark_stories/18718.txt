Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to look at bugs, but he couldn't see them very good. His mom got him a microscope so he could see them better. The microscope made the bugs look bigger! Timmy was so happy.
One day, Timmy was outside looking at bugs with his microscope when he heard his mom call him in for lunch. He didn't want to stop looking at the bugs, but he knew he had to go inside. He delayed for a little bit, but then he went inside.
After lunch, Timmy went back outside to look at bugs again. He found a really strong ant that could carry a big crumb! Timmy was amazed. He looked at the ant through his microscope and it looked even stronger up close. Timmy loved his microscope and looking at bugs.
