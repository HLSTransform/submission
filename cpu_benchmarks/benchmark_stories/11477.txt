Once upon a time, there was a little plant named Daisy. Daisy was a very pretty plant, with big green leaves and soft pink flowers. One day, Daisy wanted to grow bigger and taller. She asked how she could become bigger and taller.
Mama Plant said, "You need sunlight and oxygen to grow Daisy. But most of all, you need lots and lots of love." Daisy nodded.
The next day, Daisy felt the warm sunshine and breathed in lots of delicious oxygen. When the night came, she felt love from her mother for being so brave.
Days passed, and Daisy grew bigger and taller. She was so excited to see how pretty she was becoming! Eventually, Daisy was the tallest and prettiest plant among all the others. She was so proud of herself! 
"Thank you, Mama Plant," Daisy said. "I couldn't have grown up without your love and care." 
Mama Plant smiled and said, "It was my pleasure, Daisy. You make me so proud."
