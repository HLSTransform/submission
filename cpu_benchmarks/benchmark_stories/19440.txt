Once upon a time, two kids called Jack and Lily wanted to explore. They started to look around and discovered a symbol in a tree.
The symbol was very interesting. It was made of shiny stones and bright colours. Jack and Lily thought it was very pretty.
They decided to find out what it meant. Jack asked his mom, and she told them it was a special symbol that meant "explore and learn".
Jack and Lily were so excited. They decided that from now on, the symbol would be their adventure sign. Whenever they wanted to explore, they would look for the symbol.
Finally, Jack and Lily were ready for their next adventure. When they found the symbol, they knew they were in for a fine time.
