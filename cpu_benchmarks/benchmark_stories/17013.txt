Tommy likes to play with his balloons. He has many balloons of different colors. He likes to blow them up and tie them to his stand. His stand is a big stick that he found in the park. He puts his stand in the ground and ties his balloons to it.
One day, Tommy goes to the park with his mom and his stand. He blows up his balloons and ties them to his stand. He is very jolly. He likes to see his balloons dance in the wind. He likes to hear them make funny noises when he squeezes them.
But then, a big dog comes to the park. The dog sees Tommy's balloons and runs to them. The dog barks and jumps and tries to catch the balloons. Tommy is scared. He does not want the dog to pop his balloons. He runs to his stand and tries to hold his balloons.
But the dog is faster and stronger. The dog pulls on the balloons and makes them fly away. Tommy is sad. He cries and cries. He does not have any balloons left. He only has his stand.
His mom comes to him and hugs him. She tells him that it is okay. She tells him that they can get more balloons. She tells him that the dog did not mean to be bad. She tells him that the dog just wanted to play.
Tommy stops crying. He looks at the sky and sees his balloons. They are very high and very far. He wonders where they will go. He wonders if they will make someone else jolly. He smiles and says bye to his balloons. He picks up his stand and goes home with his mom. He still likes to play with his balloons. But he also likes to play with his stand. And he likes to play with his mom. He is very jolly.
