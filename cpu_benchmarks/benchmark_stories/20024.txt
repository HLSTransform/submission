Tom and Lily are twins. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big box near the slide. They want to see what is inside.
"Let's search the box!" Tom says.
"OK!" Lily says.
They run to the box and open it. They find many toys and books. They are happy. They start to take out the toys and books.
"I want this car!" Tom says.
"No, I want it!" Lily says.
They both pull the car. They have a fight.
"Stop!" a voice says.
They look up. They see a man. He is angry. He has a dark face.
"That is my box!" he says. "Give me back my toys and books!"
Tom and Lily are scared. They drop the car. They run away from the box. They run to their mom.
"Mom, mom!" they say. "There is a bad man in the park! He has a dark face and a big box!"
Their mom hugs them. She is worried. She looks at the box. She sees the man. He is not a bad man. He is a homeless man. He lives in the box. He has no home.
"Come on, kids," she says. "Let's go home. And let's be kind to people who have less than us."
