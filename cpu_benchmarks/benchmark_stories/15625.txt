Anna and Ben were bored. It was a gloomy day and they could not go outside to play. They looked around the room for something fun to do. They saw a big stack of cups on the table.
"Let's play with the cups!" Anna said.
"OK!" Ben said.
They took the cups and started to make towers and bridges and houses with them. They pretended they were giants and knocked them down. They laughed and had fun.
But then they got thirsty. They wanted to drink some juice. They looked for the juice bottle, but they could not find it.
"Where is the juice?" Anna asked.
"I don't know," Ben said.
They looked under the table, behind the sofa, in the closet, but they could not find the juice. They were sad and hungry.
"Maybe Mommy has the juice," Anna said.
"Let's ask her," Ben said.
They ran to the kitchen, where Mommy was making cookies. They saw the juice bottle on the counter.
"Mommy, can we have some juice?" Anna and Ben asked.
"Of course, my sweeties," Mommy said. "But first, can you help me put the cups back on the table? You made a big mess in the living room."
"OK, Mommy," Anna and Ben said.
They took the cups and put them back on the table. Then they drank some juice and ate some cookies. They were happy and full.
"Thank you, Mommy," Anna and Ben said.
"You're welcome, my loves," Mommy said. "Now, do you want to read a story with me?"
"Yes, please!" Anna and Ben said.
They cuddled with Mommy on the sofa and read a story. They forgot about the gloomy day and had a cozy time.
