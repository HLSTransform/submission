Jim was feeling thoughtful. He had something special he wanted to carry. He grabbed a sheet and held it tightly.
He walked around his house, looking for something to put in the sheet. He found some old toys and some balls. He scooped them up and carefully placed them in the sheet.
Next he went to the kitchen and grabbed some of his favorite snacks and put them in the sheet too. Finally, he found his teddy bear and put it in the sheet with the other things.
Jim smiled as he carried his sheet with all the special things he had collected. He was feeling so happy!
He walked outside and put everything in the car. Jim was going to show all his special things to his friends. They were going to have so much fun!
