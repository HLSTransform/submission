Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved playing with her toys and making a mess in her room. Her mom would always tell her to clean up, but Lily never listened.
One day, Lily went to the park and saw a big jet flying in the sky. She thought it was so cool and wanted to fly in a jet too. But then she remembered how messy her room was and how her mom would be miserable if she didn't clean it up.
So, Lily went back home and cleaned her room all by herself. It was hard work, but she felt proud of herself when she was done. Her mom was so happy and gave her a big hug. Lily learned that cleaning up was important and made her and her mom happy.
