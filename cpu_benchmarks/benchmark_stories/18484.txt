Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweet. Tweet lived in a cage in a house. One day, Tweet was singing a song when she heard a distant sound. She stopped singing and listened carefully. 
"Tweet, what's wrong?" asked the little girl who owned the house. 
"I hear a sound far away," replied Tweet. 
The little girl went outside to listen too. "I hear it too," she said. "It sounds like a dog barking." 
Tweet was scared of dogs. "Please don't let the dog come here," she said. 
"Don't worry, Tweet," said the little girl. "I will keep you safe in your cage." 
Tweet felt better knowing she was safe. She continued to sing her song, but she listened carefully for any more distant sounds.
