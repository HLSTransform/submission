Once upon a time there was a magical land where it never stopped raining. Everywhere that you looked, it was cloudy and wet. One day, the clouds began to melt and the sun started to shine.
Everyone was so excited! Everyone was so happy that the sun was shining and the sky was so blue. All of the children went outside to play and the adults smiled and laughed.
The sun was shining so brightly that it started to melt the snow. Inside the snow, everyone found a secret surprise - it was a beautiful cup of milk! Everyone was so amazed and they all clapped in excitement.
The magical milk was so amazing that it made everyone laugh and smile. Everyone drank the delicious milk and it was so yummy that it made them all feel happy.
From that day on, the magical land was always sunny and the magical milk was always there to make everyone smile. Everyone was so happy and thankful that the clouds melted and the sun shone.
