Once upon a time, there was a man and a little girl. The man and the little girl loved to go on walks in the woods together. On a lovely day, the man and the little girl went for a walk in the woods. 
As they were walking, the little girl saw something in the distance. She asked the man, "What is that?” The man replied, “It's a log!"
The little girl and the man ran up to the log. The man said, “You know what? Let's climb up it!” The little girl did not know how to climb, so the man said, “Here, I will help you.” 
The man lifted the little girl up and held her as she climbed the log. She was so excited and she laughed as she reached the top. Suddenly, the log started to wobble and the little girl started to fall. 
But the man was there and he caught her just in time. She was safe and sound. The man said, “See? I told you I would take care of you!” The little girl smiled and she said to the man, “I love you." 
The man smiled back and said, “I love you too.” They hugged each other and continued their lovely walk.
