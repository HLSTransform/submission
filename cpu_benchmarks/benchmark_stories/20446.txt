One day, two friends were playing in the sand. One of the friends found a shiny piece, and yelled to the other. She was so excited, and ran to show her friend the piece. Suddenly, a graceful bird flew over them. The friends stopped and watched in awe. 
The bird was so beautiful, with feathers so colorful. The friends looked at each other and smiled. They yelled out and waved in the air. The bird flew in circles and seemed to enjoy their company.
Eventually the piece of shiny metal had to be shared and the friends decided that one of them should keep it. The friends argued a bit and finally the other friend yelled out, “I will keep it!” They said goodbye to the graceful bird and went off together. They were happy they could share something so special.
