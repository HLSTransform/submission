Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a unique room with pink walls and a big bed. Lily loved to play with her dolls and read books in her room. 
One day, Lily's mom told her they were moving to a new house. Lily was sad because she hoped she could keep her unique room forever. But when they arrived at the new house, Lily was surprised to see that her new room was even better than her old one! 
It had a big window with a view of the garden and a cozy bed with fluffy pillows. Lily was so happy and felt grateful for her new room. She hugged her mom and said, "I hope we can live here forever!"
