Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big green hill. They want to go up the hill.
"Let's go, Anna!" Ben says. He runs to the hill. Anna follows him. They climb and climb. They are happy.
They reach the top of the hill. They see the whole park. They see trees, flowers, birds, and people. They smile. They feel the soft grass under their feet.
"Wow, Ben, look!" Anna says. She points to a rainbow. It has many colors. It is beautiful.
"I see it, Anna!" Ben says. He hugs her. They are happy.
They sit on the hill. They watch the rainbow. They smile. They are friends.
