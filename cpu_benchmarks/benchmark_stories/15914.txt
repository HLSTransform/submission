Once upon a time, there was an incredible ghost. His name was Jack. He loved to spend a lot of time outside in his garden. One day, he was spending time in his garden when he saw a fairy. Jack was very excited.
The fairy said to him, "Hi Jack! I came to ask you a question. I want you to spend the day with me in the forest so that I can show you something amazing!" 
Jack thought about it for a little while and decided that he wanted to go. So, off they went to the forest.
When they arrived, the fairy took Jack to a special place. It was a clearing full of sparkly stars! Jack had never seen anything so incredible.
The fairy said, "These stars are special. If you spend some time here, you will be able to see ghosts too!‚Äù
Jack was amazed. He didn't know that ghosts were real! He spent the whole day with the fairy and found out lots about ghosts. 
When it was time for Jack to leave, the fairy waved goodbye and wished him a wonderful day.
From then on, Jack would visit the clearing whenever he could, and he often saw the ghosts in his garden. Even though they were invisible to most people, Jack knew that they were really there!
