Once upon a time, a pretty bird lived in a big tree. The pretty bird had a nest made of soft cushion. The cushion was very cozy and warm. The bird loved to sit on the cushion and sing happy songs.
One day, a naughty cat saw the pretty bird. The cat wanted to catch the bird. The cat climbed up the tree and said, "I will catch you, pretty bird!" The bird was scared and wanted to escape.
The pretty bird quickly flew away from the tree. The cat tried to follow, but the bird was too fast. The bird escaped and found a new tree to live in. The bird said, "I am safe now!" And the bird lived happily ever after, singing songs in its new home.
