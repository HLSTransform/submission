Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big bow in her hair that was pink and sparkly. Lily loved her bow very much, and she wore it every day. One day, Lily went to the park to play on the swings. She saw a little boy who didn't have a bow in his hair. Lily felt sad for him because she knew how much she loved her bow. She walked up to him and said, "Do you want to belong to my bow club?" The little boy smiled and said yes. Lily felt mighty because she had made a new friend. From that day on, Lily and the little boy played together every day, and Lily always wore her pink and sparkly bow.
