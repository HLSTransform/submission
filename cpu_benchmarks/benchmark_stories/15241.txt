Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She and her mommy were walking through the park and she saw a big, tall mailbox. Sarah pointed at it and said, "Mommy, what's that?" 
Her mommy smiled and said, "That's a mailbox. That's where people put their mail so it can be delivered to them. See, there's even a flag on one side so the mailman knows when there is mail to collect." 
The little girl was excited. She asked if she could put something in the mailbox. Mommy said yes, so Sarah took a calm, steady pace and marched up to the mailbox. She reached inside and carefully placed her drawing inside. 
She stepped back and smiled proudly at her accomplishment. Sarah was very happy now that she had been able to do something helpful. She thanked her mommy and the two of them went on their way.
