Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play cops and robbers. Tom is the cop and Sam is the robber. They run around the yard and pretend to chase each other.
"Stop, robber! You are bad!" Tom shouts.
"No, I am not! You can't catch me!" Sam says.
Tom runs faster and faster. He catches Sam and puts him in jail. Jail is a big box with bars. Sam can't get out.
"Ha ha, I got you! You have to stay in jail for a long time!" Tom says.
He claps his hands. He is happy. He applauds himself.
Sam is not happy. He is sad. He does not like jail. He wants to get out.
"Please, cop, let me out! I am sorry! I will be good!" Sam says.
Tom thinks for a little bit. He is a good friend. He does not want Sam to be sad.
"Okay, robber, I will let you out. But you have to promise to be good. And you have to be my friend again." Tom says.
Sam promises. He is happy. He hugs Tom. They are friends again.
They go out of jail and play something else. They have fun. They are happy.
