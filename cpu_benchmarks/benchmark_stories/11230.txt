Once upon a time there was a fat plane. He wanted to fly very high in the sky and explore the world. He asked his best friend, a bird, to join him. But the bird said, “No, I must remain here and take care of my eggs.” The plane was disappointed but decided to go by himself. 
He flew and flew, getting higher and higher. He saw many new things that he had never seen before. After a while, he returned to his friend, the bird. He was very excited and wanted to share his adventure with her. But the bird just said, “I told you, I must remain here.” 
The plane was sad, but he understood. So he said goodbye to his friend, and then flew away again. He continued to explore the world and have new adventures. And each time he returned, his friend the bird would still be there, saying “I must remain here."
