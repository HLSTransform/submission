Once upon a time, there was a duck who loved to fly. She often flew in a zigzag path as she was so happy in the air. One day, the mild wind blew strong and pushed the duck off course. She tried to fly back to her zigzagging but the wind kept pushing her away.
The duck became frustrated and spoke out loud. "Why must the wind be so mean to me?", she said. 
Suddenly, a voice called out from above. It was a thunderous voice that made the duck quiver. It was a giant cloud that had struck the duck with a powerful gust of wind. "How dare you defy my wish!", the cloud shouted. "I have power to make you fly in whatever direction I wish!"
The duck was so scared. She tried to explain that she was just delighted to be flying in a zigzag, but the cloud was too angry. Suddenly, the cloud softened its voice and said,"Go now, but make sure you stay in the zigzagging path from now on."
The duck breathed a sigh of relief and agreed. She flew off in the zigzag path and never defied the mild cloud again.
