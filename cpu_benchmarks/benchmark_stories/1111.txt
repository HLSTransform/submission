Once upon a time there was a sweet little rabbit. He was so charming with his furry white fur and big floppy ears. His name was Benny and he loved exploring the woods.
One day Benny was hopping contentedly around the woods when he came to a small clearing. He saw something that made his eyes light up! There was a soft, green seat just for him. He hopped around it and snuggled up in the grass next to it. 
Benny decided that this was the perfect seat for him. He would come back to it every day and just sit there, listening to the birds and watching the squirrels. He felt so content sitting there and never wanted to leave. 
Benny lived there happily ever after and was always so cosy and comfortable on his charming little seat.
