Tom and Lily are playing in the house. They like to make forts with pillows and blankets. They find a big blanket in the closet and drag it to the living room. They see the stairs and have an idea.
"Let's make a slide!" Tom says. "We can remove the pillows from the couch and put them on the stairs. Then we can slide down the blanket!"
"Okay!" Lily says. "That sounds fun!"
They work together to remove the pillows and pile them on the stairs. They spread the blanket over the pillows and the stairs. They climb to the top of the stairs and look down.
"Are you ready?" Tom asks.
"I'm ready!" Lily says.
They hold hands and slide down the blanket. They go very fast and feel the wind in their hair. They laugh and scream.
But they slide too fast and too far. They reach the end of the blanket and the pillows. They fly off the stairs and land on the floor. They hit their heads and their arms and their legs. They cry and cry.
Mom hears the noise and runs to the living room. She sees Tom and Lily on the floor, bleeding and bruised. She sees the blanket and the pillows and the stairs. She is very angry and very scared.
"What have you done?" Mom yells. "You could have killed yourselves! You are very naughty and very stupid!"
She picks up Tom and Lily and takes them to the car. She drives them to the hospital. They need stitches and bandages and medicine. They are in a lot of pain and a lot of trouble. They are not happy. They are sorry.
