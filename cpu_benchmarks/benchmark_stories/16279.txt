Once there was a little girl named Gemma. She was three years old and loved to play in the park. One day Gemma was playing on the swings when she started to feel sick. She went to the hospital to see the nurse.
At the hospital the nurse looked at Gemma and said she was not feeling well. The nurse wanted Gemma to wait for some tests but Gemma was scared. In that moment Gemma realized she was alone and it was a tough thing to do.
The nurse was very nice to Gemma and explained what each of the tests were. The nurse was very gentle while doing the tests and Gemma felt better. Finally the tests were done and Gemma was feeling much better.
Gemma realized how lucky she was to have the nurse. The nurse was tough but also very kind and patient. Gemma was happy to be feeling better and playing in the park again.
