Once upon a time, there lived a brave boy called Charlie. Charlie lived beside a big scary factory. Every day, he could hear loud noises coming from the factory late at night. Charlie was curious and wanted to know what was going on. 
One day, Charlie plucked up the courage to go and inspect the factory. He slowly opened the door of the factory and was amazed by what he saw. There were lots of machines whirring and buzzing away. He noticed some lights appear and disappear. 
Charlie couldn't take it anymore and shouted, "What are you doing in here?". Suddenly, the machines stopped and a voice emerged from one of them, "We are making toys for children". Charlie felt so happy and said,"But why is it so noisy and scary?". The machine replied, "It can be loud and frightening at times, but it's all part of the job. We have to work really hard to finish making the toys".
Charlie realised that with hard work and effort, people could make beautiful things. As he left the factory, he knew that he too would need to work hard and finish the tasks ahead of him. He smiled to himself and went back home.
