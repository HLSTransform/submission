Sara and Ben like to play with cards. They have many cards with pictures of animals. They try to find two cards that have the same animal. They call this game "match".
One day, they find a new card in the box. It has a picture of a bee. Sara and Ben do not know what a bee is. They look at the other cards, but they do not see another bee.
"Where is the match for the bee?" Sara asks.
"I don't know. Maybe there is no match. Maybe the bee is alone." Ben says.
They are sad for the bee. They want to find a friend for the bee.
They go outside and look for a bee. They see many flowers, but no bees. They ask their mom if she knows where the bees are.
"Bees are very busy. They fly from flower to flower and make honey. They are not always available to play. But if you are quiet and gentle, you might see one." Mom says.
Sara and Ben follow mom's advice. They sit near a big flower and wait. Soon, they hear a buzzing sound. They see a yellow and black insect flying around the flower. It is a bee!
"Look, Sara, it's a bee! Just like our card!" Ben says.
"Hello, bee! Do you want to be our friend?" Sara says.
The bee lands on the flower and looks at them. It wiggles its antennae and makes a soft noise. Sara and Ben think the bee is saying hello.
They are happy. They have found a match for the bee. They go back inside and show mom their card and their new friend. Mom smiles and gives them some honey to eat. They share it with the bee. They have a sweet and fun time.
