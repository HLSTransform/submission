Once upon a time there were two little birds who lived in a tree. One of the birds was named Tim. The other little bird was named Tam.
One day they were singing and enjoying the nice weather when suddenly the sky became grey. Tim and Tam looked up and saw that it was starting to snow. They both froze in surprise. The snow was heavy and ugly, and Tam was scared.
Tim said, "Don't worry, Tam. We can stay warm by flying up to the top of the tree. Come on, let's go!"
Tam was a bit worried. Flying up high was harder for her because she was heavier than Tim. But Tam was brave, so she followed Tim and together they flew up to the top of the tree. From there, they could stay safe and warm.
The two birds huddled close together, and Tim said, "See Tam, don't worry, because here we can be safe and warm."
Tam smiled at Tim and said, "Thank you, Tim. I'm so happy we found a way to stay safe and warm!"
