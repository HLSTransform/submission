Once upon a time there was a princess. She was very careless and did not think very much. One day she decided to go for a spin. She ran and ran and twirled around in circles until she felt so dizzy she fell down. The princess felt silly and laughed. She got back up and spun and spun until she was so tired she had to rest. She was happy she was having so much fun but she remembered she had to be careful. So she ran back inside and found a spot to sit and rest. The princess was happy to be safe, and happy that she had learned to be more careful.
