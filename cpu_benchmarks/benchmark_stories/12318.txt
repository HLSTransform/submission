Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was only three years old and she loved trees. One day, she decided to climb a tree near her house. She reached the top and it was really high.
The girl felt really brave up there. She turned around and noticed a huge mountain in the distance. She was so excited, so she decided to rise up to the top. She wanted to try and reach the peak.
The girl began to clime the mountain. It was very steep and the journey was very tough. But the girl was determined and eventually, she arrived at the top. She was very happy and could see far and wide.
From the top of the mountain, she saw a little tree. It looked so small, so she decided to climb it too. When she reached the top of the tree, the view was even better. The little girl felt so proud of herself. Rise up, climb up, it didn't matter as long as she was having fun.
