Once upon a time, there was a big house with a fancy roof. Inside, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily was very happy because she had a lot of friends. Every day, she would talk to them and have lots of fun. 
One day, Lily's friends said to her, "Let's go on the roof". Lily was excited and said, "Yes, let's go"! 
So, Lily and her friends went up to the roof. It was so fancy up there. They looked around and smiled. They talked and laughed and saw lots of cool things. Then they played lots of fun games. 
Lily and her friends had such a great time on the roof. When it was time to go home, they hugged each other goodbye. They promised to meet on the roof again soon. 
And they did!
