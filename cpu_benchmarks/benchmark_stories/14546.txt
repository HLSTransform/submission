Once upon a time, there was a big family that was getting ready for dinner. Everyone started to part ways to get ready. Mom put a soft blanket on the floor and put some yummy food on the table. The family sat down together for dinner. Everyone was very happy. 
The food was very delicious! Mom made macaroni and cheese that was very soft and Dad made special sandwiches that were very yummy. The kids giggled when they ate their food. 
After dinner, the family thanked Mom and Dad for the special dinner. Everyone hugged each other and the family was so happy that they partied that night, laughing and dancing! 
The end!
