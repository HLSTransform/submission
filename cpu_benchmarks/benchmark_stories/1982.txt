Once upon a time there was a marriage between two people. They owned a small home together. One day when they were at home, the man saw something outside. He got really alert, so he went outside to check it out. It was a baby rabbit! The rabbit was in their garden, so the man and his wife decided to own it and keep it safe in their home. They named it Snowy and took care of it. The rabbit was so happy to have its new home! Snowy and the couple were best friends and they were very happy together. The end!
