Once upon a time, there was a purple monster having lots of fun. The monster made big promises to the people around it, like to always be happy and to share with its friends. But the monster was not very flexible. Whenever it made plans, it would stick to them very tightly, no matter how much the people around it asked it to change its plans.
One day, the monster made a promise that it would take a group of people on a fun activity. Everyone was excited! But then they started to argue over what activity they should do. The monster heard the arguing, and it started to worry. It felt like it couldn't keep its promise if the people couldn't agree on what to do.
But then something amazing happened. The monster watched as the people kept talking. And then it saw something it had never seen before: people being flexible. They listened to each other and compromised until everyone was happy with the plan.
The monster smiled and learned an important lesson. It was okay to change plans, and it was okay to be flexible. From then on, the purple monster kept its promises, no matter what.
