Once upon a time there was a little girl who really loved waffles. She spent all of her days wishing for a special waffle to come. One day, when she was out playing in the yard, the most beautiful waffle came. It was big and round and smelled just fine. 
The little girl was so excited to see the waffle that she quickly ran over to it. She took a delicious bite and it tasted almost like heaven. She was so excited that she wanted to share her waffle with her family, so she invited them to come to her house. 
The family came over right away and had the best time together. Everyone shared in the delicious waffle and enjoyed the special treat the little girl had discovered. 
The family finished the fine waffle and started to go home. But before they left, the little girl made a wish: she hoped a special waffle would come soon, so they could all celebrate together again. 
And that's exactly what happened! A few days later, a beautiful waffle came and the family all gathered together to celebrate once more. Everyone agreed that it was just as fine as the first one and it became a family tradition for special occasions and happy days.
