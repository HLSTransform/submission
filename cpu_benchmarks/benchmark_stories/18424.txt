Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy loved cheese more than anything in the world. One day, Timmy was walking in the forest and he saw a big piece of cheese. "Wow, that cheese looks so yummy!" Timmy said.
But then he saw a big cat coming towards him. "Oh no! I need to grab that cheese before the cat gets me!" Timmy said. He ran as fast as he could and grabbed the cheese just in time.
"Hey there little mouse, that cheese looks pretty tasty. Can I have some?" the cat asked.
"I'm sorry Mr. Cat, but this cheese is only available for me. Maybe you can find some other cheese?" Timmy replied.
The cat was disappointed, but he understood. Timmy happily enjoyed his cheese and went back home. From that day on, Timmy always made sure to grab any available cheese before anyone else could get it.
