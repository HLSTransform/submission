Once upon a time there was a mom and her three year old daughter. Every night they cooked dinner together. One night they made tacos. Mom told her daughter to get the sauce out of the fridge so they could put it on the tacos. But the daughter couldn't reach. So mom said they would quit and do something else. 
The daughter had an idea. She said they should get the step ladder and then she could get the sauce. Mom thought the idea was great, so they got the step ladder. The daughter climbed all the way up and grabbed the sauce, it was tasty. She put it on the tacos and they enjoyed the dinner together. 
The daughter was so proud of herself for getting the sauce. Mom said she was brave and not to quit. So from then on, the daughter was brave and never quit.
