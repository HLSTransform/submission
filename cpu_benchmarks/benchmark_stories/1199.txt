Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very hungry and wanted to eat a yummy steak for dinner. Her mommy cooked the steak and told her to wait until it was ready. 
Finally, dinner was ready and Lily sat down to eat. She took a big bite of the steak and it tasted so good! She was very happy to receive such a delicious dinner from her mommy. 
After dinner, Lily went to bed feeling full and happy. She dreamt about the yummy steak she had just received and couldn't wait to have it again. The end.
