Once upon a time, there was a little boy named John. He was three years old and he was on an adventure with his Mom. She told him about a surprise she had for him. John was so excited!
They soon arrived at a big drum store. "This is your surprise," said Mom.
John couldn't believe it! He ran inside and lifted all the drums. He wanted to take them all home, but his mom said they could only pick one.
John chose a special drum because it had a beautiful design. His mom agreed and then asked if he was hungry.
John said yes and his mom recommended they visit the nearby diner. When they got there, John's eyes widened as he saw all sorts of delicious foods. He chose a yummy pizza with his favorite toppings. It was so delicious! 
John thanked his mom and they finished their day with smiles.
