Once there was a little girl named Sarah. She was only three years old, but she loved to jog. Every morning, she would put on her special jogging clothes and then run outside. She felt so good when she was jogging.
One day, Sarah heard a voice from the sky. It said, "Sarah, be serious. You must use your will to become stronger and better at jogging."
Sarah thought about what the voice said. She knew it was important, so she focused real hard. Even when it was hard, she kept jogging.
After a few weeks, Sarah noticed she was jogging faster and stronger. She was so happy. Sarah kept using her will and kept jogging. Every day she felt more and more serious about her jogging goals.
At the end of the summer, Sarah could jog as fast as any grown-up! She was so proud of herself and she knew that by using her will, she could do amazing things.
