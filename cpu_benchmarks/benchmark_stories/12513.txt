Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing outside in his backyard. One day, Timmy accidentally spilled grape juice on his dad's favorite shirt. His dad got very upset and Timmy felt very sad.
Timmy's dad saw how sad Timmy was and decided to forgive him. He told Timmy that it was just a shirt and that he loved him more than any shirt. Timmy felt very happy that his dad forgave him.
Timmy learned that accidents can happen and that some things are harmless. He also learned that forgiveness is important and that it makes people feel happy. From that day on, Timmy played outside in his harmless clothes and knew that his dad would always forgive him.
