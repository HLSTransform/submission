Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to swing and slide and run. But Tom wanted to try something new. He saw a big tree with a branch that was low. He said to Lily, "I want to climb that tree. It looks fun."
Lily was scared. She said, "No, Tom, don't do that. You might fall and hurt yourself. That branch is not strong. It might break."
But Tom did not listen. He ran to the tree and grabbed the branch. He pulled himself up and smiled. He said, "Look, Lily, I am high. I can see everything."
Lily shook her head. She said, "Please, Tom, come down. It is not safe."
But Tom did not hear her. He was too happy. He started to clap his hands and sing. He said, "I am a monkey, I am a monkey, I can swing and jump and clap."
But then, something bad happened. The branch cracked and broke. Tom screamed and fell to the ground. He landed on his arm and it hurt a lot. He cried and cried.
Lily ran to him. She saw his arm was bent and swollen. She said, "Oh, Tom, your arm is broken. You need help. I will call mom and dad."
She took out her phone and dialed their number. She told them what happened and where they were. She said, "Please, hurry, Tom is hurt. He broke his arm."
Mom and dad came fast. They saw Tom and Lily and the broken branch. They were sad and angry. They said, "Tom, why did you do that? You were not careful. You did not listen to Lily. You were silly."
They picked up Tom and took him to the car. They drove to the hospital. They said, "We love you, Tom, but you have to learn. You have to be safe and smart. You have to listen to your sister. She is your friend."
Tom was sorry. He said, "I am sorry, mom and dad. I am sorry, Lily. I was not smart. I was silly. I will listen to you next time. I will be careful."
Lily hugged him. She said, "It's okay, Tom. I forgive you. I love you. You are my brother."
They went to the hospital. The doctor fixed Tom's arm. He put a cast on it and gave him a sticker. He said, "You will be fine, Tom. But you have to rest your arm and not climb trees for a while. You have to be good."
Tom nodded. He said, "I will be good, doctor. Thank you."
He looked at his cast and his sticker. He smiled a little. He said, "Lily, can you clap for me? I can't clap with my broken arm."
Lily smiled too. She said, "Sure, Tom. I will clap for you. You are brave. You are my brother."
She clapped her hands and said, "Yay, Tom, yay!"
