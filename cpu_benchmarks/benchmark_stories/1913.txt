Once upon a time, there was a kind man. He was walking in the park and he saw a bird on top of a tree that was trying to make a nest. 
The man smiled and pulled out a bottle of spray from his pocket. He sprayed the tree with the spray, and the bird hopped onto a branch.
"Thank you," the bird said. "Now I can finish my nest!"
The man laughed. "You're welcome," he said.
He then reached into his bag and pulled out some money. He smiled as he handed it to the bird.
"Go buy yourself a nice meal," he said.
The bird was so happy! He chirped and hopped away with the money.
The man watched him go with a big smile. He was so kind to help the bird out!
