Molly was sad. She had found out that her friend, Sally, had been drinking something fake. Molly ran to find Sally, who was sitting on a bench.
Molly: "Why are you drinking poison?"
Sally: "My friend demanded it."
Molly was shocked. "Why would anyone do that?"
Sally shook her head sadly. "It was fake poison. I wanted to show off to my friends how brave I was."
Molly was angry. She knew that fake poison could be very dangerous. "Let's go home, Sally," she said firmly. "No more fake poison!" 
Sally agreed, and the two friends went back to Molly's house, where they could be safe.
