The sun was shining and it was a perfect day for playing. Two small children, Alice and Harry, were playing in their garden together.
Alice said, "Let's build a castle!"
Harry replied, "That's a good idea. I have some blocks that we can use."
Alice excitedly clapped her hands together. "We can use them to be creative!"
Harry smiled and nodded his head. "Yes, let's build a really big and tall castle!"
The two children then got to work, building the blocks into a castle. When they were finished, Alice said, "We should show our parents the castle so they can see what we made."
Harry agreed and the two children ran inside to show their mom and dad their creation.
Their mom and dad were amazed by the castle and said, "This is so lovely! We saw your view of being creative and it's wonderful!" 
The two were delighted and told their parents that they wanted to play in the castle. 
Their mom and dad agreed and allowed them to play in the castle, as long as they stayed safe.
Alice and Harry were very happy, they had a great view of being creative!
