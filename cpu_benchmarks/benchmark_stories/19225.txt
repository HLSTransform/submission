Once upon a time, there was a player named Jack. Jack loved to play outside in the snow. One day, Jack slipped on some icy ice and fell down. He hurt his knee and had to pause playing for a little while. 
While Jack was resting, he saw a bird flying in the sky. The bird was so pretty and Jack wanted to play with it. But he knew he had to wait until his knee felt better. 
After a few days, Jack's knee felt better and he went back outside to play. He saw the bird again and this time he ran after it. The bird flew away, but Jack had fun chasing it. And he learned to be careful of icy ice so he wouldn't get hurt again. The end.
