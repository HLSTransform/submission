Once upon a time there was a giant. He was huge and very strong. One day, the giant was walking in the forest and he saw an enormous branch. He wanted to see how strong he was, so he walked up to the branch and tried to stretch it.
The giant said, "I bet I can stretch this branch!" All of a sudden, he felt some mysterious power. He looked up and to his surprise, he saw a fairy.
The wizard said, "Only my giant powers can stretch this branch. I will give you some of my powers so you can do it too!"
The giant was so excited. He jumped up and tried to stretch the enormous branch. Amazingly, it worked!
The giant was so happy and he said, "Thank you fairy! I will never forget this magical moment".
