Lily liked to play with her lime. It was green and round and sour. She liked to roll it on the floor and smell it and lick it. She kept it in her pocket when she went to the park.
One day, a big dog came to the park. It was black and hairy and loud. It saw Lily's lime and wanted it. It ran to Lily and barked and jumped. Lily was scared and ran away. She dropped her lime on the grass.
The dog picked up the lime and bit it. It was very sour and bitter. The dog did not like it. It spat out the lime and growled. It looked for something else to eat.
Lily saw a graceful bird in the sky. It was white and soft and quiet. It flew over the park and saw the lime. It thought it was a seed. It swooped down and grabbed the lime in its beak.
Lily wanted to save her lime. She shouted and waved her arms. She tried to catch the bird. But the bird was too fast and too high. It flew away with the lime.
Lily was sad and angry. She cried and stamped her feet. She had no lime and no friend. She wished the dog and the bird would go away. She went home with her mom. She did not play with limes anymore.
