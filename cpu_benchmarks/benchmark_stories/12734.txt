Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Tom. Tom liked playing outside in the grass.
One day, he was attaching a swing to a tall tree. He was so excited, getting really high up in the air.
Suddenly he felt an itch on his nose. He scratched it, but it just got worse. 
“Mommy, it itches!” he cried.
His mom heard him and called back, “To make the itch go away, put some cream on it.”
Tom immediately ran inside and grabbed the cream. He put it on the itch and the itch went away.
Tom smiled and went back outside to finish attaching his swing.
