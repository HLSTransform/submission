Once there were two friends, Bob and Sue. It was summer, so they went to the park to play and have lots of fun. As they ran around the playground, they saw a peach tree with lots of ripe peaches. Bob was so excited he said “Sue, let’s eat the peaches!”.
Sue replied “No, Bob, that’s not fair. We need to pay for them”.
Bob was a bit disappointed but agreed.
When they went to the peach farmer he asked them “Do you have money to pay for the peaches?” Bob and Sue shook their heads sadly.
The farmer was so kind. He smiled at them and said “It’s ok. I know you kids are just being foolish. Enjoy the peaches.”
So Bob and Sue happily picked peaches off the trees, thanked the farmer, and ran back to the play park with their arms full of juicy peaches. 
They were so happy and full of energy.  They ate their peaches and had a wonderful time playing in the park all day.  They even shared the peaches with a few bird friends they had made.
