Once there was a little boy named Jack. He had a lemon tree in his backyard. One day when Jack went outside to play, he saw there was a lemon that was nice and big! It was bright yellow and looked very juicy.
Jack was so happy, he ran to pick it off the tree. But it was very hard to get the lemon off. He tried and tried, but it wouldn't come off.
Suddenly, Jack had a really good idea; he asked his mom for a pair of scissors. He ran inside and got them and ran back outside. With the scissors, he used them to carefully cut the lemon off the tree.
The lemon was so juicy that when he cut it, it made a big mess! Juice went everywhere and the lemon made a big tear in Jack's shirt. Jack was so sad. 
But then his mom suggested that he cut the lemon and make a fresh lemonade. Jack loved the idea! He squeezed the lemon and the lemonade was so delicious! Jack realized that the hard lemon had made something so yummy and he was so happy. From then on, every time Jack and his mom looked at the lemon tree, they would smile!
