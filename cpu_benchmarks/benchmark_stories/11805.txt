Holly was a 3 year old girl who wanted to paint. Her mum said it was time to paint so Holly went and found some paints. She was so excited! Her mum helped her mix the colors together and they painted big pictures with lots of colors. Holly felt proud of her work. 
After they finished painting, Holly and her mum went to the living room and turned on the TV. Holly found her favorite show to watch. She was very happy. 
It was a cold day so Holly was feeling a chill. She went and got her favorite blanket from her bedroom and put it around herself. Now she was cosy and warm again. 
Holly watched the TV for a long time. She liked seeing pictures and colors on the TV and heard lots of music. She sang along which made her mum smile. 
Holly was happy with her day of painting and watching TV. She was so proud of all the colors she painted and all the fun things she saw on the TV.
