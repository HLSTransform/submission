Tom is a big dog. He likes to run and play with his friends. But today he is not happy. He has many fleas on his fur. They bite him and make him itch. He tries to scratch them off, but they are too many and too fast.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tom barks. "Go away, fleas! You are bad and mean!"
Lily is a small cat. She lives in the same house as Tom. She sees Tom suffer and feels sorry for him. She knows how to help him. She has a new comb that can catch the fleas. She jumps on Tom's back and starts to comb his fur.
"Hey, what are you doing?" Tom asks. He is surprised to see Lily. He does not like cats very much. They are too sneaky and quiet.
"I am helping you, silly dog," Lily says. "I have a new comb that can get rid of the fleas. Hold still and let me do it."
Tom feels the comb on his fur. It tickles a little, but it also feels good. He sees the fleas fall off his fur and onto the floor. He feels less itchy and more happy.
"Wow, thank you, Lily," Tom says. "You are a good and kind cat. I am sorry I was rude to you before. Do you want to be my friend?"
Lily smiles and nods. She is happy to make a new friend. She and Tom finish combing each other's fur and then run and play together. They forget about the fleas and have fun. They are both happy.
