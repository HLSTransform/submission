Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to help his mom cook in the kitchen. One day, his mom was making soup and she asked Timmy to stir it. Timmy was happy to help and he stirred and stirred with a big spoon.
Suddenly, Timmy saw a bone in the soup. He was surprised and asked his mom, "What's this bone doing in the soup?" His mom explained that it was a chicken bone and it added flavor to the soup.
But Timmy was frustrated because he didn't like the bone in his soup. His mom told him not to worry and she would take it out for him. Timmy felt better and continued to stir the soup until it was ready to eat. And it was delicious!
