Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, Lily found a stick on the ground. It was long and brown and she picked it up. 
As she walked around with her stick, she saw a big, red apple hanging from a tree. She wanted to eat it, but it was too high up. She tried to jump and reach it, but she couldn't. 
Suddenly, a strong wind blew and the apple fell from the tree. It rolled towards Lily and she picked it up. She tried to take a bite, but the apple was too hard. She had to resist the urge to throw it away. 
After a while, she remembered that she had a toy knife in her pocket. She used it to open the apple and finally, she was able to take a big bite. It was delicious! From then on, Lily always had her stick and toy knife with her when she went to the park.
