Once upon a time, there was an ancient forest. Nobody had ever seen anything like it before. One day, a young boy named John was walking through the forest when he heard something strange.
John said "What is that?" 
Suddenly, from the shadows of the trees, a mysterious voice said "It's a mystery!" 
John was surprised and scared. He asked "What kind of mystery?" 
The voice said "An ancient mystery. It's been hidden for centuries, but now it's starting to spread." 
John was fascinated and asked "Where can I find it?" 
The voice said "You'll have to explore deeper in the forest. But be careful, there are many secrets in the shadows." 
John thanked the mysterious voice and began his journey. He explored deeper and deeper, until he finally uncovered the ancient mystery. With his newfound knowledge, he was able to spread the ancient mystery to others and make a huge impact on the world.
