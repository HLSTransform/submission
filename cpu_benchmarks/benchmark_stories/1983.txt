Once there was a bald eagle. He was very brave. He would perch high in a tree and look for his friends. One day he spotted a pattern in the sky. It was a bird. He was diving for fish. The bald eagle was so curious that he decided to try it too. He flew up high and dove straight down. He could feel the wind against his wings as he flew through the sky. When he reached the water's surface, he saw the fish and swooped down to catch it. The bald eagle was so proud of himself. He had taken a dive and caught the fish. From that day on, he liked to dive and hunt for fish whenever he could.
