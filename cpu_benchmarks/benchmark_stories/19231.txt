Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her toys and going to the park. One day, Lily went to the park with her friends. They played on the swings and slide, but Lily wanted to play soccer. 
Lily had never played soccer before, but she was excited to try. Her friends helped her and they played together. Lily's team scored a goal and they were so happy. Lily felt enormous joy and she couldn't stop smiling. 
After the game, Lily's friends told her that it didn't matter who won or lost, it was all about having fun and playing together. Lily learned that it's not about winning, but about spending time with friends and trying new things. She felt happy and grateful for her friends and their kindness.
