Max had a red box. It was big and heavy. Max knew it was special because his father said it was true. Every day, Max would take the box and look inside. He would take the lid off and peek in the box.
But, his father always told him not to open it. He said the box was too heavy for him to open. He said he had to wait until he was old enough.
So, Max kept the lid on the box. He put it back in its special place. He waited and waited and waited.
Finally, Max was old enough to open the box. He carefully opened the lid and looked inside.
It was full of amazing toys! Max cheered! He was so excited to have all these new toys. He thanked his father and they played with the red box toys all day.
What was inside the box? It was true, it was true what his father said!
