Mabel was a little girl who loved animals. She always wanted to meet a real-life gorilla. So one day, her parents decided to take her to the zoo.
When they got there, they saw a big, poofy gorilla. Mabel was so excited! She wanted to touch it, but her parents said no. Mabel was so miserable.
Suddenly, something horrible happened. A big, mean lion came and tried to destroy the gorilla. Mabel was very scared. Suddenly, Mabel heard someone shouting. It was a zoo keeper!
The zoo keeper yelled, "Go away, you nasty lion! Don't destroy the gorilla!" The lion growled and ran away.
The gorilla was safe. Mabel was so happy! The zoo keeper had saved the day. Mabel gave him a big hug and said thank you. From that day on, Mabel loved the zoo even more.
