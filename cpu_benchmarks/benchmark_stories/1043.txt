Once upon a time, four friends were at a special meeting. They looked up in the sky and saw a beautiful point. It was a star twinkling with a special sparkle! The friends were fascinated and wanted to see it up close.
So they decided to go on a special adventure. They stepped on the bus and soon they were at the star. They stepped out, and it was all so beautiful. The star seemed to shine brighter, and they looked at it with curiosity.
The star had a special message for them, which made them all smile. Then they had to say goodbye. But before they left, they decided to have a meeting again and went back home.
