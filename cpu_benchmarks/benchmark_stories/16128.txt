Once upon a time, there was a wild penny. It was so wild, it decided to rise up and have an adventure. 
So the penny rose and flew up, up, up into the sky. It rose so high that the penny could see the whole world! 
Suddenly, the penny heard a tiny voice. It was coming from a little bird who was sitting on a nearby tree. 
"What are you doing up so high, wild penny?" asked the bird.
The wild penny answered, "I'm rising up to have an adventure!" 
The bird seemed confused, but then it smiled. "That sounds like a great idea! I hope you have a wonderful adventure!" 
The wild penny thanked the bird and flew away, soaring higher and higher. The penny enjoyed its wild adventure!
