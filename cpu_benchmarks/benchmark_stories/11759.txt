Once upon a time there was a little bunny who was very shy. His friends were always very nice to him, but he still felt shy. One day, his friends were playing a game and they asked him to join in. He wanted to join in too, but he was scared.
His friends saw how scared he was, so they told him that he didn't have to join in right away. They gave him some chalk and told him that if he studied it carefully and drew with it, he would get better.
The little bunny started to study the chalk and he got better at drawing. His friends noticed how he was improving and they started to cheer for him. Soon, the little bunny was drawing pictures that were really charming. His friends cheered for him and thanked him for studying so hard.
The moral of the story is that if you work hard and study something, you can make great improvements and your friends will be so proud.
