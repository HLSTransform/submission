Once upon a time, there was a cat named Mittens. Mittens was a lazy cat who liked to rest all day long. One day, Mittens saw a ball of yarn on the floor. Mittens thought the yarn looked like a fun toy to play with.
Mittens picked up the yarn with her paws and started to play with it. Suddenly, the yarn got tangled up in Mittens' paws and she couldn't move. Mittens meowed for help.
A little girl named Lily heard Mittens' meows and came to see what was wrong. "Oh no, Mittens! You're all tangled up in the yarn. Let me help you," Lily said. She gently untangled the yarn from Mittens' paws.
"Thank you, Lily," Mittens said. "I was being lazy and got myself into trouble. I promise to rest more and be careful from now on."
Lily smiled and petted Mittens. "That's okay, Mittens. We all get lazy sometimes. Just remember to be careful with the yarn next time."
