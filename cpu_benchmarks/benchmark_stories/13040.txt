The sun was shining as Sally walked alongside her Mommy. Sally was very excited to be heading to the park. When she finally arrived, Sally ran to the swings and began to play. She kicked her feet against the ground and giggled as she sailed higher and higher in the air.
Sally's Mommy smiled and applauded as she watched her daughter's joy. Then, the two of them went for a walk by the nearby creek. It was shallow and the water sparkled in the sun. Sally was fascinated as she saw the tiny fish swimming around.
After their walk, Sally and her Mommy headed back to the swings. Although Sally was a bit nervous, she took a deep breath and tried again. This time, Sally was able to swing all the way to the top. As she came back down, her Mommy applauded her for her courage.
Sally smiled and headed off to find something else fun to do. As she scampered away, a huge grin graced her face.
