Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toy cars in his garage. One day, he found a stubborn toy car that wouldn't move. 
Timmy's mom asked him, "What's wrong, Timmy?" 
"My toy car is stuck," Timmy replied. 
His mom said, "Let's examine it together." 
They looked at the toy car and saw that a wheel was broken. Timmy's mom said, "Don't worry, we can fix it." 
Timmy was happy that his toy car was fixed and he could play with it again in his garage. The end.
