Once upon a time, there was a poor little girl named Lily. She lived in a small house with her mom and dad. One day, Lily and her dad went for a walk in the park. They found a stick on the ground and her dad picked it up.
"Daddy, what are you going to do with that stick?" asked Lily.
"I am going to raise it up high!" replied her dad.
Lily was so excited to see her dad raise the stick up high. She clapped her hands and giggled. "That's so cool!" she said.
After they finished their walk, Lily and her dad went back home. Lily's mom was happy to see them and asked, "What did you do today?"
"Daddy raised a stick up high!" said Lily.
Her mom smiled and said, "That sounds like fun. Maybe we can all go to the park next time."
