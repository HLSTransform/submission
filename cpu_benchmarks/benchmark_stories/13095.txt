Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved looking at the world around her. One day, she went out to the garden to gaze at the sky. She saw many clouds of different shapes and colours. But the most beautiful was a big pink one. She stared at it for a long time. 
Suddenly, she noticed a funny shape in the pink cloud - it was a zero! She kept gazing at the zero and wondered what it meant. Suddenly, she noticed the number ten next to it. She smiled - it was her birthday and the zero was telling her that she was now ten years old!
Lucy felt very happy and content looking at the pink cloud. She knew that she was loved and that the zero in the sky was a magical sign from someone special. From that day on, she looked up to the sky and at the pink cloud as a reminder of her special day.
