Once upon a time, there was a brilliant gate. It was so tall it seemed to reach up to the sky! Every day, lots of animals would come to the gate looking for food.
An old man lived nearby, and he knew the animals were hungry. So every day, he would come to the gate with some food. He would spread the food around so all the animals could eat.
The animals were so happy! They would flock around the old man and the gate, dance through the grass and chirp and squeak with delight when the food was put down.
The old man would watch with a smile and wave goodbye as the animals happily ate the food he provided. He was so kind to feed them each and every day. The animals were so thankful for the old man's generosity and kindness.
