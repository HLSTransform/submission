Once upon a time, there was a girl named Elsa. She was so excited because it was her birthday. She looked out the window and saw snow falling.
"Yay, it's snowing outside!" she said.
Elsa opened the door and stepped outside. It was cold and the snow was so sparkly and white. She wrapped her warmest coat around her and started to play.
Elsa made a snowman. He was big and round. Elsa opened a box with a special surprise inside. She found a big pink wrap and put it around the snowman.
Suddenly Elsa heard a noise. She looked around and saw a little bird sitting on top of the snowman. It was chirping and Elsa smiled.
"Hello bird," she said.
The bird chirped at her and they both smiled. Elsa thanked the bird and closed the wrap around the snowman once again. She ran back into the house and laughed.
It was the best birthday ever!
