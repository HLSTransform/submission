Once upon a time, there was a popular little boy named Sam. And he had a box. Sam packed his box with butter. He wanted to take the butter to school to share with his friends. 
Sam tried to carry his box, but it was too heavy. He tried to ask his mom to help him, but she was away at work. So, Sam decided to get help from his neighbor. 
He walked to his neighbor's house and knocked on the door. His neighbor opened the door and asked him what he wanted. Sam asked his neighbor to help him carry the box of butter to school. The neighbor said he would help, but only if he could have some of the butter. 
Sam was sad. He didn't want to share the butter, but he didn't have any other choice. So, he agreed to share the butter. Then, his neighbor carried the box of butter to school.
When he arrived at school, Sam realized that his neighbor had taken all of the butter. He felt so sad and angry. Sam had no butter left to share with his friends.
Sam learned never to trust someone too easily, especially when it comes to sharing his special treats.
