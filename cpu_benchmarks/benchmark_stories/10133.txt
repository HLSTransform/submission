Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to pretend they were superheroes. Lily had a red mask and Ben had a blue mask. They ran around and saved people from bad guys.
"Look, Ben, there is a cat in the tree!" Lily said. "We have to help it!"
"I will climb the tree and get the cat," Ben said. "You stay here and watch for danger."
Ben put on his blue mask and climbed the tree. He reached for the cat, but the cat was scared. It hissed and scratched Ben's hand. Ben cried out and let go of the branch. He fell to the ground.
"Lily, help me!" Ben shouted. "The cat is dangerous!"
Lily put on her red mask and ran to Ben. She saw that his hand was bleeding. She hugged him and said, "Don't worry, Ben, I will make it better. You are brave and strong. I believe in you."
She took off her mask and used it to wrap Ben's hand. She kissed his cheek and said, "There, now you are a superhero again. Let's go home and show Mom and Dad."
Ben smiled and said, "Thank you, Lily. You are the best sister ever. You are a superhero too."
They held hands and walked home. They left the cat in the tree. They decided to play something else tomorrow.
