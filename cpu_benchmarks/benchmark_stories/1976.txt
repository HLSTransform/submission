Once upon a time there lived an organized penguin named Pat. Pat loved teaching the other animals how to do fun things.
One day Pat decided to teach the other animals to dance. She said, “Let’s dance!” to her friends.
They all said, “Yes!” Pat showed them how to move their feet in different ways. She said, “Move your feet like this!”
The other animals tried their best to dance like Pat. Some had two left feet, but Pat was very encouraging. She said, “You can do it if you try!”
At the end, they all did a very good job! Pat was proud of her students, and they all had a lot of fun.
