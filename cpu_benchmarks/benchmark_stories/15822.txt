Once there was a little girl called Mary. Mary was only three years old and she loved exploring her house. One day, when Mary was playing in the living room, she heard a noise from the hallway. It sounded like a creaking door!
Mary followed the noise and when she arrived in the hallway, she saw something amazing - a bright light was coming from the door at the end of the hallway.
Mary ran to the door and knocked. “Hello?” she asked. But no one answered.
Mary was about to walk away when she heard a voice from the door. It said “Come in”.
Mary slowly opened the door and was amazed at what she saw. There, standing in the doorway, was a beautiful fairy!
The fairy smiled at Mary and said “I have been here all along waiting for you to appear. I have something special for you - a magical present!”
Mary was so excited! She thanked the fairy, accepted the present and then waved goodbye as the fairy disappeared.
