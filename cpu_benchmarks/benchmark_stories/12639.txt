Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy car that he loved to play with every day. One day, Timmy's friend, Johnny, came over to play. Johnny wanted to play with Timmy's toy car, but Timmy didn't want to share. 
Timmy and Johnny started to argue about the toy car. Timmy didn't want to give it to Johnny, but Johnny really wanted to play with it. Suddenly, Timmy started to yawn because he was tired. 
Timmy had an idea. He said, "Let's take turns playing with the car. You can play with it for one year, and then I can play with it for one year." Johnny thought this was a good idea, and they both agreed. 
Their plan was successful, and they both had fun playing with the toy car. They learned that sharing is important and it's better to work together instead of fighting. From that day on, Timmy and Johnny were the best of friends. The end.
