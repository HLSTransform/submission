Once upon a time there was an ugly earth. It was so sad and alone. One day, a magical creature appeared and said, "I can help you feel better."
The earth said, "What can you do?"
The creature said, "I can give you something to drink."
The earth said, "What can I drink?"
The creature said, "A magical drink that will make you feel better."
So the earth drank the magical drink and sure enough it felt better. The earth was so happy that it said, "Thank you for the magical drink. You made me feel better."
The creature smiled and said, "You're very welcome." And then it flew away.
From that day on, the earth was happy and not so ugly anymore.
