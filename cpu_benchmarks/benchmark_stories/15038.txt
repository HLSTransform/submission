Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jenny. She was very excited, because it was her first visit to the zoo. She was so excited to see all the animals and find out more about them. 
When they reached the zoo, the first thing Jenny saw was a big lion. She was a little scared but also kind of curious. She watched him walking around and roaring. Then, she followed him until they reached a cave. Inside the cave, it was dark and she felt a little bit confused. 
Suddenly, something zoomed past her, making Jenny jump! She squinted and realised it was a monkey. She watched him running around, and wondered what he was doing. 
The monkey led Jenny to a pond where he served some fruits to the fish. Jenny thought it was so cool and she was excited to see all the different things the animals were doing. 
That day at the zoo, Jenny learnt lots of new things about animals and she made some new friends too. She was no longer confused, and by the time she left, she was also not scared of the lion at all.
