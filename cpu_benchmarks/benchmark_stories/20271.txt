Once upon a time, there was a yellow sun who was very sad. The sun was sad because it saw a broken marriage. The husband and wife were not happy together anymore. The yellow sun wanted to help them feel better and restore their love.
The yellow sun thought of a plan. It decided to shine very brightly every day. The bright light made the husband and wife feel warm and happy. They started to talk and play together again. The yellow sun was happy to see them smile again.
After some time, the husband and wife's love grew strong. Their marriage was restored, and they were happy together once more. The yellow sun was very proud of its work. It kept shining brightly every day, making everyone feel happy and loved.
