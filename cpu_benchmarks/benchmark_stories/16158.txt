Once upon a time, there was a girl named Jenny. She had big, blue eyes, soft blonde hair and a sweet smile. One day, while walking, she noticed a poor little bird, all alone in the corner of a parking lot.
Jenny kneeled down, and the bird hopped onto her hand. Jenny said to the bird, “Hello, little one. What’s wrong?” She opened her hand and the bird looked as if it was waiting for something. 
Just then, a compassionate woman came running up to them. She asked Jenny if the bird was hurt. Jenny said, “I don’t know. It doesn’t look very happy.” 
The woman softly touched the bird and said, “It looks like its wing is caught. Let me open this window and see if I can help.”
Jenny and the woman gently opened the window, and with a few quick motions, the woman freed the bird’s wing. The bird quickly flew away, saying “tweet tweet!” The three of them stood and smiled. 
The compassionate woman thanked Jenny for her kindness, and Jenny thanked her for her help. After that, Jenny skipped home happily, thinking about the bird and the nice woman.
