Lena liked to help her mom with the house. She wanted to be a good girl and make her mom happy. One day, her mom asked her to prepare the mop for cleaning the floor. Lena was excited. She went to the kitchen and filled a bucket with water and soap. She put the mop in the bucket and squeezed it hard.
But Lena did not see that the soap was not for the mop. It was for the dishes. It made a lot of bubbles and foam. The bucket was too full and the water spilled over. Lena did not notice. She carried the bucket and the mop to the living room, where her mom was. She wanted to show her mom how well she prepared the mop.
But when she got to the living room, she tripped over a toy. The bucket flew out of her hands and the water splashed everywhere. The mop landed on the couch and made it wet and soapy. The bubbles and foam covered the floor, the table, the TV and the books. Lena's mom was very angry. She yelled at Lena and told her to go to her room. Lena was very sad. She cried and cried. She did not understand why her mom was so mad. She only wanted to help. She did not like the colorful mess she made. She wished she never prepared the mop.
