Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books. They also have a big clock on the wall. The clock tells them when it is time to eat, sleep, or go out.
One day, Sara and Ben are bored. They have played with all their toys and books. They want to do something new. They look at the clock. The clock has a long hand and a short hand. The long hand moves fast. The short hand moves slow.
"Let's play with the clock!" Sara says. "It looks fun!"
"How?" Ben asks.
"Let's hang from the long hand!" Sara says. "It will swing us around!"
"That sounds fun!" Ben says.
They climb on their bed. They reach for the clock. They grab the long hand. They hang from it. The clock makes a loud noise. The long hand breaks. Sara and Ben fall to the floor. The clock falls on them. They cry.
Mom and Dad hear the noise. They run to the room. They see Sara and Ben on the floor. They see the clock on them. They are angry and scared.
"What did you do?" Mom asks.
"We played with the clock!" Sara says.
"Why did you do that?" Dad asks.
"It looked fun!" Ben says.
Mom and Dad shake their heads. They take Sara and Ben to the doctor. The doctor says they are not healthy. They have bruises and cuts. They need bandages and medicine. They have to stay in bed for a long time. They cannot play with their toys and books. They are sad.
The end.
