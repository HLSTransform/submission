Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go on adventures with her mom and dad. One day, they decided to go on a road trip. 
As they were driving, they saw a police officer. The police officer asked her dad for his license. Her dad couldn't find it and was worried. 
Lily said, "I know the answer! It's in your wallet!" Her dad found his license and gave it to the police officer. 
After that, they continued their adventure and had lots of fun. But then, they got lost and didn't know which way to go. 
Lily said, "Let's ask for help!" They saw a man and asked him for directions. He told them which way to go and they found their way back home. It was an adventurous day for Lily and her family.
