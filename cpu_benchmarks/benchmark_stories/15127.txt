Once upon a time there lived a beetle in the forest. He was polite and liked to help other animals. One day he saw a rabbit hopping and he thought, "I should help the rabbit!" 
The beetle asked the rabbit, "Why are you hopping?" The rabbit replied, "I'm searching for a big carrot!" The beetle said, "I'll help you find it!" 
So the polite beetle went off with the rabbit to find the big carrot. After they searched and searched they finally found the big carrot! The rabbit was so pleased he thanked the beetle and said, "You helped me succeed!" 
The beetle smiled and said, "It was my pleasure to help you. I am glad we both succeeded."
