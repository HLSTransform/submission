Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big city with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily's mommy told her they needed to go somewhere important. "Let's take a taxi," said mommy. "Okay!" said Lily, excitedly.
They went outside and waited for a taxi. After a few minutes, a yellow taxi pulled up. "Are you ready to go?" asked the taxi driver. "Yes, please!" said Lily. They got in the taxi and the driver asked, "Where to?" Mommy told him the address and they were on their way.
During the ride, Lily looked out the window and saw a big park. "Mommy, can we go to the park?" she asked. "Not today, sweetie. We have to go somewhere important," mommy told her. "Okay," said Lily, understandingly.
Finally, they arrived at their destination. "We're here!" mommy said. They got out of the taxi and went inside a big building. "Mommy, where are we?" asked Lily. "We're at the doctor's office. The doctor is going to tell us how healthy you are," mommy explained. Lily smiled and said, "Okay, I'm ready!"
