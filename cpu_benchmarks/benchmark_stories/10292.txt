Ben liked to play with his toy cars. He had many cars of different colors and sizes. He liked to make them zoom and crash on the floor. He also liked to wash them with water and soap. He pretended he was a mechanic and fixed them when they broke.
One day, his mom told him to stop playing and get ready for bed. She said it was late and he had to sleep. Ben did not want to stop. He wanted to play more. He said no to his mom and ran away with his cars.
His mom was angry. She followed him and grabbed his cars. She said he was a bad boy and he had to listen. She threw his cars in the trash. She said they were dirty and broken and he did not deserve them.
Ben was sad. He cried and begged his mom to give his cars back. He said he was sorry and he loved his cars. He said he would wash them and fix them and be good. But his mom did not listen. She said he had to learn his lesson and go to bed.
Ben went to bed without his cars. He felt lonely and hurt. He wished he had his cars to hug and play with. He hated his mom for being so harsh. He did not want to see her again. He closed his eyes and dreamed of his cars. He hoped they would come back to him. But they did not. They were gone forever.
