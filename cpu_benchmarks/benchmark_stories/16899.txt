Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big slide. They want to go on the slide. But there is a problem. There is a sign that says: "Use a mask to go on the slide."
Lily has a mask in her bag. She puts it on her face. She says to Ben: "I have a mask. I can go on the slide."
Ben does not have a mask. He looks around. He sees a mask on the ground. It is dirty and torn. He picks it up. He says to Lily: "I have a mask too. I can go on the slide."
Lily looks at Ben's mask. She does not like it. She says to Ben: "No, Ben. That is a bad mask. It is dirty and broken. You cannot use that mask. It will make you sick."
Ben feels sad. He does not want to be sick. He does not want to miss the slide. He says to Lily: "But I want to go on the slide. Can I use your mask?"
Lily thinks for a moment. She likes Ben. She wants to share with him. She says to Ben: "OK, Ben. You can use my mask. But only for one time. Then you have to give it back to me."
Ben smiles. He says to Lily: "Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend." He puts on Lily's mask. He and Lily go on the slide. They have fun. They are happy.
