Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she found a small seed in the ground and decided to plant it.
Lily watered the seed every day and watched it grow. After a long time, the seed began to bloom into a beautiful flower. The sunset made the flower look even more beautiful.
Lily's mom saw the flower and said, "Wow, that's a beautiful flower! You did a great job taking care of it." Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, Mommy."
The moral of the story is that if you take care of something, it can bloom into something beautiful.
