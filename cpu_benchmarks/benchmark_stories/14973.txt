Once upon a time there lived a little boy. His name was Jack. He loved to explore the world around him.
One day, he asked his mom, “Can I go outside?” She nodded and said, “Yes, it's a beautiful day.”
Jack ran quickly out the door and into the yard. He was so happy to be outside.
He saw a new flower growing in the garden. He asked the flower, “What's your name?” The flower smiled and said, “My name is Daisy. Welcome!”
Jack was so cheerful and excited to meet Daisy. They talked for a while about the other animals in the garden.
After a while, Daisy said, “I have to go now, but it was nice to meet you!” Jack waved goodbye and said, “Bye Daisy! Come back soon!”
Jack smiled as he watched Daisy fly away. He was filled with a feeling of happiness. His heart was full of warmth and welcome.
