Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play with her toys and draw pictures with her crayons. One day, she went to her friend's house to play. Her friend had a big dog that scared Lily a little bit. But her friend said the dog was friendly and wouldn't hurt her.
After playing with the dog, they went to the kitchen to get a snack. Lily noticed her friend's mom had a very tidy kitchen. Everything was clean and organized. Lily's mom's kitchen was messy sometimes, but she still loved it.
Later, when Lily went home, she saw her cat hiding under the bed. She called her cat's name and tried to get her to come out, but the cat was scared of something. Lily looked under the bed and saw a spider. She didn't like spiders either, but she knew they were important too. She gently picked up the spider and took it outside. Her cat came out from under the bed and rubbed her face against Lily's leg, happy to see her friend again.
