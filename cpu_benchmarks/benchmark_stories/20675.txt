Every night, the ancient parent would fold up the blanket for the child. The child felt warm and safe when the blanket was folded over him. 
One night, the ancient parent put the blanket over the child but it was too big. The ancient parent folded the blanket in half, then half again, until it was just the right size. 
The ancient parent tucked the blanket around the sides of the child. The child felt so happy and couldn't believe how snug and cozy the blanket was. 
The ancient parent gave the child a soft kiss on the forehead, and the child fell asleep knowing he was safe and loved.
