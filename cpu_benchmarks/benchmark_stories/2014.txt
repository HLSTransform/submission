Andy and Jane were playing in the living room. Suddenly, Andy heard a noise coming from behind the curtain. He shouted "What is that?" Jane was scared and ran away. Andy didn't know what to do, so he decided to take a peek. He bravely opened the curtain and his heart felt hurt when he saw a mouse. He didn't know how to deal with this and he started to shout and scream. Jane, who had been hiding, came back to help him and she shouted too, which scared the mouse away. Andy and Jane hugged each other and they were relieved that there was no more conflict.
