Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to climb trees. One day, he saw a big green tree and wanted to climb it. He said to his mom, "Mommy, can I climb that big green tree?" His mom said, "No Timmy, that tree is too high and it's bad for you to climb it." Timmy was sad but he listened to his mom.
The next day, Timmy saw a smaller tree that was also green. He asked his mom, "Mommy, can I climb that small green tree?" His mom said, "Yes Timmy, that tree is not too high and it's safe for you to climb it." Timmy was happy and climbed the tree. He felt like a big adventurer.
When Timmy got to the top of the tree, he shouted down to his mom, "Mommy, I climbed the tree!" His mom smiled and said, "Good job Timmy, you are a great climber!" Timmy felt proud of himself and couldn't wait to climb more trees.
