Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy that could weigh things. He liked to weigh all his toys and see which one was the heaviest. Tim was very persistent in weighing his toys every day.
One day, Tim found a big seat outside. It was a very pretty seat with lots of colors. Tim wanted to weigh the seat, but it was too big for his toy. He tried and tried, but he could not weigh the seat. Tim was sad.
Tim's mom saw him and asked, "Why are you sad, Tim?" Tim told her about the seat and his toy. His mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, Tim. We can find another way to weigh the seat." Tim's mom helped him weigh the seat with a big scale. Tim was happy and continued to be persistent in weighing things every day.
