Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she found a red chest in the garden. She opened it and found a lot of toys inside. She was so happy!
Her friend, Timmy, came over and saw the chest. "Wow, that's a big chest! What's inside?" he asked.
Lily replied, "Toys! Let's play together!"
They played with the toys for a while, but then Timmy said, "Lily, we should discuss what we want to play next."
Lily agreed and they talked about what game to play. They decided to play hide-and-seek and had so much fun. At the end of the day, they put the toys back in the chest and said goodbye.
