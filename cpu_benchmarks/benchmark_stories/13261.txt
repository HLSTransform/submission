Once there was a little girl named Sue. She was very intelligent. She had a beautiful bow that was special to her.
One day, Sue had an idea! She decided to put her bow in her backpack and go on an adventure.
Sue's mom drove her to the port. When she arrived, Sue looked out the window and saw a big boat. She was so excited!
Sue got out of the car and waved goodbye to her mom. She then boarded the boat and was on her way!
The boat took Sue to a brand new place. She was so amazed by what she saw! There were different people, animals and plants. Sue soon realized that this was a special place where intelligent people went.
Sue explored the port and made many new friends. She said goodbye and thanked everyone for a wonderful day. Sue's bow was the same as when she arrived, but Sue felt different. She was happier and more knowledgeable now that she had seen the port.
