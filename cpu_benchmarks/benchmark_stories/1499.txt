Once upon a time, there was a nice fair princess named Rosemary. She was very friendly, and she liked to talk to everyone. One day, Rosemary was walking in the forest when she met a little boy named Jeff.
Jeff was a brave lad who was carrying a weapon. Rosemary asked him why he was carrying it and Jeff told her he found it in the forest. Rosemary thought it wasn't fair for the little boy to have it. So she kindly asked him if he was allowed to keep it.
Jeff agreed, so Rosemary talked to him about all kinds of things. She asked him if he liked playing in the forest, if he had a pet and what other things he liked to do. They talked and laughed all day until it was time to go home.
 Rosemary and Jeff said goodbye, and Jeff thanked the fair princess for being so kind. As Jeff left, he made Rosemary promise that she would come back one day and talk to him again. Rosemary smiled and said she would!
