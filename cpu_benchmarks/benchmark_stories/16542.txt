Mia loves to eat cookies. She likes the sweet taste in her mouth. But she knows she should not eat too many cookies. Mommy says cookies are only for after dinner.
One day, Mia sees a big jar of cookies on the kitchen table. She wants to have one. She looks around. Mommy is not here. She is in the living room. Mia thinks maybe she can take one cookie. Just one. She reaches for the jar.
But then she hears a voice. It is her brother Leo. He is hiding behind the sofa. He says, "Mia, what are you doing? You should not take cookies. Mommy will be angry."
Mia feels guilty. She knows Leo is right. She puts the jar back. She says, "Sorry, Leo. I was just looking. I will not take cookies."
Leo smiles. He says, "Good, Mia. You are a good sister. But you know what? I have a secret. I have two cookies in my pocket. I took them before. Do you want one?"
Mia's eyes light up. She says, "Yes, please, Leo. Thank you. You are a good brother."
Leo and Mia share the cookies. They enjoy the taste. But they also feel guilty. They hope Mommy will not find out.
