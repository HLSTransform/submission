Once upon a time, a little mouse named Mickey loved to eat cheese. He would sneak into the kitchen every night to nibble on the yummy cheese. But one day, Mickey saw a big cat in the kitchen. He felt scared and ran away.
Mickey told his friend, a kind owl named Ollie, about the cat. Ollie said, "Don't worry, I will help you. You can trust me." Ollie flew into the kitchen and saw the cat sleeping. He quietly took the cheese and brought it to Mickey.
Mickey was so happy and thanked Ollie for being a good friend. He realized that he should not be naughty and steal cheese from the kitchen anymore. From that day on, Mickey and Ollie shared the cheese and enjoyed it together.
