Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Sam. Sam was a very shy fish and liked to stay away from other fish. Every day, Sam would swim around in the ocean looking for nice things to do. 
One day, Sam was swimming around, and he found a box in the ocean! He was so excited and went to take a closer look. Inside the box was a big bowl of cereal. Sam had never seen cereal before and was so excited. 
He quickly gobbled up all the cereal in the box and then swam around looking for more cereal. Sam liked cereal so much and would always spend his days swimming around looking for more.
That's the story of Sam, the shy little fish who loved to swim around, looking for cereal!
