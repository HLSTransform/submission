Once upon a time there was a small girl. She was walking in a park with her family. As the family walked along, they heard a strange noise. It was a soft, quiet voice. 
The family stopped and looked around. Suddenly, they saw a puppy. It was laying beside a big tree and its eyes were closed. 
The little girl stepped closer. She saw that the puppy was dead. She was very sad and started to cry. Then she knelt down and hugged the puppy. She squeezed it tight and said goodbye. 
The family then left the park but the little girl will never forget that sad voice and the puppy she had to squeeze.
