Once upon a time, two friends Emma and Jack were walking through a dark stadium. Both of them were a bit scared but they decided to keep walking.
“Oh no! I cannot see anything, it’s so dark!” said Emma.
“Don’t worry Emma,” said Jack. “Let’s keep talking and it will help us find the way out”.
Suddenly, the lights started to turn on one by one. It got brighter and brighter, until they saw the exit! Emma and Jack hugged each other in excitement.
“Let’s not come back here again”, said Jack, and they ran out of the stadium together.
