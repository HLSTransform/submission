Once upon a time, there was a big, brown bear who lived in the forest. One day, he decided to sail on a big boat to see the world. He packed his body with honey and set off on his adventure.
As he sailed across the ocean, he saw many different animals like dolphins and whales. The bear was so happy to see all these new things! But then, a big storm came and the boat started to rock back and forth. The bear was scared, but he held onto the boat with his strong body.
After the storm passed, the bear finally made it to a new land. He met lots of friendly animals and had many fun adventures. And even though he missed his home in the forest, he was happy that he sailed on the big boat and saw so many amazing things.
