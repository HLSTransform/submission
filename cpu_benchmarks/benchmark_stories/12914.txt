Once there was a fat dog named Fred. He was walking through a country field. Then he saw a bee nearby and began to chase it. He got so close to the bee that he started to sneeze.
The bee said to Fred, "Stop sneezing or else you'll scare me away!"
But Fred kept sneezing and the bee flew away. Fred was very sad. He wanted to catch the bee.
He looked around and saw a cat in the field. "Can you help me find the bee?" Fred asked the cat.
The cat smiled and said, "Yes, follow me and I'll show you where it is."
So Fred followed the cat through the country field. Eventually they found the bee and Fred was so happy. He thanked the cat and then he and the bee ran off into the sunset.
