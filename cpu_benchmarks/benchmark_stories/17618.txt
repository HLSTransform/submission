Once upon a time, there was a sleepy village. Everyone there liked to take naps all day long. One day, a new family moved in. They were very nice and wanted to make friends with everyone in the village.
The mother of the new family went to the village center and said, "Hello, I'm new here. Can you introduce me to your friends?" The village center said, "Sure, I'll introduce you to everyone." And so, the mother met all the sleepy villagers.
The next day, the mother brought a big surprise for the village. She brought a playground! The kids were so happy and played on it all day long. The villagers were grateful to the new family for introducing them to something so fun. From then on, the village was no longer just a sleepy place, but a happy and lively one.
