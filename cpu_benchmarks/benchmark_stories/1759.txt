Once there was a little girl. She was only three years old, but she had a huge diary. She carried it around wherever she went. One day, the little girl wanted to turn the pages of her diary. She placed her hands on the cover and slowly turned it. She was amazed as she saw how many pages were inside. She smiled and looked around. Everyone was looking at her and smiling. But then she had a thought. She wanted to turn the pages even more! She was so excited to read what was inside the diary. So she grabbed her diary and started to turn the pages quickly. She couldn't help but smile, because the diary was so huge. She kept turning and turning the pages until she found something she liked. That day was a very special day for the little girl and her huge diary.
