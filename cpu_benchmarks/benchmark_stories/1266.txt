Bobby looked at his bedroom. He was very happy because it was his. It was messy and dirty, but he didn't mind. He started to pick up his toys, getting rid of the mess.
He moved the chairs and swept the floor. He even wiped the windows with a cloth. It was a lot of work, but he wanted it to be clean.
Bobby took a step back and smiled. His bedroom was no longer dirty. He was so proud of his work he wanted to show everyone. He opened the door for his family to come and take a look.
They were surprised at how clean it was. Bobby was beaming from ear to ear. He was happy he could make his bedroom clean and tidy. He skipped around the room, feeling proud of himself.
