Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was very stubborn. He did not like to listen to his owner, Jane. One day, Jane told Max to lie down, but Max did not want to. He wanted to play.
Jane tried to make Max lie down, but he just would not. Max ran and played all day. He did not listen to Jane. Jane was sad because Max would not do what she said.
At the end of the day, Max was very tired. He finally lay down to rest. Jane was happy that Max finally listened. Max learned that it is good to listen to his owner. The moral of the story is to listen to the ones who care for you.
