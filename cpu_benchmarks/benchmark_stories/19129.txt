Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and dress up in pretty clothes. One day, Lily's mom said, "Let's add some new dresses to your closet!" Lily was so happy and said, "Yay! I love new dresses!"
So, they went to the store and found some fair dresses with flowers and sparkles. Lily tried them on and twirled around, feeling like a princess. "I love them all!" she said.
When they got home, Lily's dad asked, "Did you get some new dresses?" Lily replied, "Yes, Mom and I added them to my closet!" Her dad smiled and said, "You look so pretty, Lily." And Lily felt happy and loved.
