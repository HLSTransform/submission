One day, Luke decided to visit his friend Max. He was a little shy, so he took a deep breath before knocking on the door. When Max opened the door, his eyes lit up with surprise.
"Hi, Max," said Luke.
"Hi, Luke! What a nice surprise," said Max.
The boys decided to play together. They took out a toy truck, but it was too heavy for Luke. He accidentally dropped it, and it broke into pieces.
Max smiled and said, "It's okay, Luke. Accidents happen."
Luke was relieved and smiled back. Max quickly grabbed another toy and they continued playing.
At the end of the day, Luke gave Max a big hug and he said goodbye. He felt much less shy and was excited to visit his friend again soon!
