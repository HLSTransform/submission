Once upon a time there was a rich comet that flew across the sky. Everyone was so excited and watched it as it sparkled across the night.
Suddenly, the comet started to make a loud noise. It roared as it flew by. All the people became scared and held each other.
Then, something amazing happened. From the comet a rainbow shot down and lit up the sky for all to see. The people cheered and clapped as the beautiful rainbow filled the night with color.
The comet flew away and everyone waved goodbye. They all knew they had seen something very special and could always look up and remember what happened that night.
