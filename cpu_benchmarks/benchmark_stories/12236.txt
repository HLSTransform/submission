Once there was a little boy called Mark. Mark was very tidy and he liked to keep his home neat and tidy. One day, Mark opened the door to reach for his ball outside. As he opened the door, a big mosquito flew in. Mark was very scared but he tried to be brave. He reached for a newspaper and he tried to swat the mosquito. After a few minutes of chasing the mosquito, Mark was finally able to swat it and the mosquito fell to the ground. Mark was very proud of himself for reaching the mosquito and tidying up his house. He closed the door and went back inside, happy and satisfied with a job well done.
