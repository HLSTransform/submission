Everyday, George and his mommy would go to the library together. George was so excited to go. The library was a fun place. He could read books and get stories.
At the library, they got to take out books. They chose ones that were fun and interesting to read. Mommy also helped George pick out songs and puzzles. He loved the library and couldn't wait to go back.
One day, Mommy told George that the library provided the town with lots of things. She said that it was cheap for the town to use the library and it was a great way to get books and other fun stuff. George thought that it was so cool and thanked mommy for showing him the library. 
When they went back home, George was so excited to read the books and puzzles that they had gotten. He was really happy to have the library provide him with so many fun things. George thanked Mommy again. He couldn't wait to go back to the library again soon!
