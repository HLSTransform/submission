One day, Bob and his parents went to the park. Bob was so excited and couldn't wait to explore. As soon as they entered the park, Bob saw a big track. He wanted to race against his parents. 
"Can I go on the track?", Bob asked. His parents smiled and nodded. 
Bob was off! He ran around the track faster and faster. He laughed and laughed while he raced. 
All of a sudden, Bob noticed something on the track. He saw a grumpy looking dog barking at him. Bob stopped running and laughed nervously. 
His parents walked over and greeted the dog's owners. Bob couldn't join in on the conversation because the grumpy dog was still staring at him. He knew he had to do something to make the dog less grumpy. 
So Bob went to the park bakery and bought the grumpy dog a donut. As soon as the dog took a bite out of it, the dog's expression changed from grumpy to happy. Now Bob and the grumpy dog were good friends. Bob and the grumpy dog laughed together as Bob raced around the track.
