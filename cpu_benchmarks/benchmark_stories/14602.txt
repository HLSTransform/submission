Once there was a boy named Sam. He was very fast and liked to hurry.
One day he was running in the park when he saw a law man. The law man was standing near a sign that said "No Hurrying!". Sam stopped running and looked at the law man.
The law man scowled and said "No Hurrying!" Sam knew that he had to obey the law, so he started to walk very fast.
He wanted to hurry, but he also knew he had to follow the law. So he walked fast and was careful not to hurry too much.
Finally, the law man was gone and Sam started to run again. He ran fast and had lots of fun. But, he promised himself to always remember the law and never hurry too much.
