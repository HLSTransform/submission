Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucy. She was walking in a park one day and suddenly the sun disappeared. Everything got dark and Lucy got nervous. She didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, she heard a voice. Lucy looked up and saw a big, friendly owl.
"Hello there!" said the owl.
"Why is it dark?" asked Lucy.
"The sun has gone away," said the owl. "But don't worry, it will be back soon. I'm here to watch over you."
Lucy felt much better after the owl had spoken to her. She knew the sun would be back soon and that she had a friend to watch over her.
The sun reappeared and Lucy waved goodbye to the owl as she continued to explore the park. She will never forget the owl that made her feel safe when the sun had disappeared.
