Once upon a time, there was a kind elephant who lived in a big theater. He loved playing all kinds of different games and making others smile. 
One day, he decided to invite all his friends to the theater. They all partied together and had a lot of fun. 
But then, something bad happened. One of the other animals decided that it wasn't fair that the elephant got to have all the fun, so they started taking the games away from him. 
The elephant was so sad and disappointed. He felt like he had done something wrong, but he had been so kind to his friends. No matter how many times he asked, they wouldn't give the games back to him.
At the end of the day, the moral of the story is that there are some people who take advantage of those who are kind to them. They don't understand that kindness should be rewarded, not taken advantage of.
