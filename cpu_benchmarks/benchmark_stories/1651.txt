Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his drum. He would bang on it all day long. One day, Timmy's friend came over to play. Timmy showed him his drum and his friend thought it was impressive. 
Suddenly, Timmy felt funny in his nose. He knew what was going to happen next. He sneezed! Achoo! His friend laughed and said, "Bless you!" Timmy wiped his nose and went back to playing his drum. 
They played together for a long time and had lots of fun. When it was time for Timmy's friend to go home, he said, "Thanks for letting me play with your impressive drum, Timmy. And don't forget to cover your mouth when you sneeze!" Timmy nodded and waved goodbye. He couldn't wait to play with his drum again tomorrow.
