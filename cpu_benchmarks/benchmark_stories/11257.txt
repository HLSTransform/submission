Once upon a time there was a little girl called Gwen. She was three years old and really liked to make things. She was playing with her back yard when she discovered an old box. Inside the box, Gwen found a pot of thick glue. Gwen was very excited to play with it and came up with an idea.
Gwen went inside her house and came back outside with some bits of paper, scissors and some other bits and pieces. She set them all out on the grass and started to assemble them. As she was doing this, Gwen's mum saw what she was making and went outside to talk to her.
Mum: "Gwen what are you making?"
Gwen: "I'm making a house!"
Mum: "That sounds like fun. Is there anything I can do to help you"
Gwen: "Yes! Can you help me to glue these pieces together?"
Mum: "Of course I can. Come here and show me what to do."
Gwen took the pot of glue and showed her mum how to carefully spread a thin layer onto each piece of paper. She then pointed to where the pieces should be placed and watched carefully as her mum put them in place. When the glue was dry, Gwen very proudly showed her mum the completed house.
Mum: "Wow! Look at your fantastic little house. Well done Gwen
