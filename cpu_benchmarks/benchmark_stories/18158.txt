Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. Sally had a toy called Mr. Rubber. Mr. Rubber was very important to Sally. She took him everywhere she went.
One day, Sally's mom said, "Sally, you must behave if you want to take Mr. Rubber to the park." Sally promised she would behave. She was very excited to show Mr. Rubber the swings and the slides.
At the park, Sally played with Mr. Rubber on the swings. She said, "Mr. Rubber, I am behaving, just like Mom said." Mr. Rubber liked that Sally was behaving. They had a fun day at the park together.
