Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there lived a big lion. The lion liked to roar very loud. He thought it was fun to scare all the little animals.
One day, a small mosquito came to the forest. The mosquito was very selfish. It wanted all the other animals to listen to it. But the lion roared louder and no one could hear the mosquito.
The mosquito felt sad and asked the lion to stop roaring. The lion saw that the mosquito was selfish, but he decided to be kind. The lion stopped roaring and the mosquito was happy. The animals in the forest learned to share and be nice to each other.
