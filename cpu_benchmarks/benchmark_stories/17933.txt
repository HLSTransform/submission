Once upon a time, there was a boy who lived by the side of a giant lake. Every day, he would take long walks around the lake and look for leaks. One day, as he was walking, he saw a funny leak! It was coming from a boat near the shore.
The boy was very curious, so he decided to get closer and have a look. He thought it looked a bit silly, and he suggested to himself that maybe he should plug the leak up.
He looked around and eventually found a thick piece of cloth. He took it, put it over the leak and tied it tightly. He did a really terrific job, because the leak stopped right away.
The boy was so proud of himself for being so clever and helping the boat. He showed all his friends and they said that he was very wise and not at all foolish. And they all lived happily ever after!
