There was a small boy called Tony. He had a red bucket and he wanted to go and play in the park. Tony told his mum, "I want to splash in the pond". His mum said, "okay Tony, take your bucket and go and splash in the pond, but don't get too crazy okay?"
Tony said, "yay!", then he ran out of the house and rushed to the park. He saw the pond and filled his bucket with water. Then, he dumped the water in the pond and it made a big splash. Tony was so excited, he jumped up and down, clapped his hands and laughed. All of a sudden, he heard someone calling his name. It was his mum!
She shouted, "Tony, come back here! We can't stay out all day, it's nearly lunchtime". Tony was sad, but he knew he had to go home so he grabbed his bucket and ran back to the house.
When Tony got back to the house, he put the bucket beside the armchair and went to the kitchen for lunch. He was thinking about his adventure in the park, and it made him smile. He was still crazy excited!
