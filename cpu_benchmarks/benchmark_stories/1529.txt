One morning, there was a white storm. The sky was cloudy, and it looked like it would be raining soon. The wind blew the trees until they were swaying.
The little girl who saw the storm looked out her window. She had never seen a storm like this before, and she was very curious. She wanted to go outside and play in it.
The girl asked her mom if she could go outside, but her mom told her "no." She said it wasn't safe to play in the storm. Instead, she let the girl watch it from the window.
The little girl watched the storm for a long time, until it finally stopped. The clouds cleared and the sun started to shine. The girl smiled, happy that she got to see the storm.
