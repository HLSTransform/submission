Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved playing basketball. She had a purple basketball that she always played with. One day, she went outside to play but couldn't find her basketball. She looked everywhere but it was nowhere to be seen.
Suddenly, her big brother appeared with a big smile on his face. He had her basketball and he had painted it purple, just like Lily's favorite color! She was so happy and thanked her brother for being so kind. They played basketball together until it was time for dinner.
From that day on, Lily always kept her basketball in a safe place so it wouldn't disappear again. She loved playing with her purple basketball and was grateful for her brother's surprise.
