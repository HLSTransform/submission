Bob and Sarah were best friends. They liked to do lots of fun things together. One day, the two were playing with Bob's new model airplane. They played for a while but then realized that some pieces were missing. Bob was feeling frustrated and Sarah offered to help. 
The two friends discussed how to fix the plane. Sarah had an idea. She said, "We could use some glue!" Bob agreed and the two went off looking for glue. 
They found some in the shed. The two then carefully glued the pieces onto the plane. When they finished, the model airplane looked just like new. Bob and Sarah were so proud of their work. 
Bob and Sarah hugged and high-fived each other. They couldn't believe how their teamwork had saved the model airplane! They were sure their friendship would last forever.
