One day, two friends were walking in the forest, when they heard a loud noise. One of them asked, "What was that noise?". The other one said, "I don't know".
Suddenly, a tall man came into view. He had a long cane in his hands and he had a very angry look on his face. He said in a loud voice, "Who's been making all this noise?".
The two friends didn't know what to say, so the tall man got even angrier. He shouted, "I said, who's been making all this noise?!"
One of the friends bravely stepped forward and said, "It was me". The tall man raised his cane high in the air and said, "I warned you once, now I'll have to strike you!"
The other friend quickly said, "Wait, I can explain!" He went on to explain what had happened in a clear and calm way. He explained how he and his friend were taking a walk in the forest and had heard a loud noise. 
The tall man paused and looked at the two friends. After a moment, he smiled and said, "Well, it seems like a misunderstanding. You can go now and be sure to be more careful next time!" 
The two friends were so relieved and thanked the tall man before running off. They were lucky that the tall man had been so understanding.
