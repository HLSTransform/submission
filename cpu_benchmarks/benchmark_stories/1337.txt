Once upon a time, there was an ordinary clown. She was so happy and liked to make people giggle. Everywhere she went, people stopped to listen.
One day, the clown was walking down the street when she heard a very sad voice coming from behind a bush. She stopped and listened. It was a little mouse! He was crying so she asked what was wrong.
The mouse told her that he had lost his way home. The clown was so kind. She dried the mouse's tears with her big yellow handkerchief and told him that she would help him find his way home. 
So the clown and the mouse went on a journey and they looked in the gardens, in the fields and on the bridges. At last, the clown helped the mouse find his home.
The mouse was so thankful and so was the clown. She gave the mouse a big hug and a kind smile and then she went on her way, bringing happy giggles everywhere she went.
