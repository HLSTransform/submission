Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the rain and jump in puddles. One day, her mom asked her to clean her messy room. Lily didn't want to clean her room, she wanted to play outside. 
Her mom said, "Lily, you need to clean your room before you can go outside and play." 
Lily replied, "But mom, cleaning is boring." 
Her mom said, "Cleaning is important. It's like a magic word that makes everything better. If you don't clean, your room will be a big mess." 
Lily thought about what her mom said and decided to clean her room. She soaked her dirty clothes in a bucket of water and started to put away her toys. It took a while, but when she was done, her room was clean and tidy. 
Lily learned that cleaning may not be fun, but it's important to keep things tidy. She also learned that sometimes you have to do things you don't like to do.
