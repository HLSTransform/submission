Once upon a time, there was a black axe. It lay in a field, still and quiet. Everyone was staring at it, wondering who owned it and why it was there.
Suddenly, an old man walked up to the axe. He grabbed hold of the handle and held it tight. He let out a loud grunt and chopped the air with the axe. Everyone kept staring, not sure what the old man was doing.
The old man looked around the field and found a big tree stump. He put the axe over the top and slammed it down. The axe gave out a big 'thump' and the old man smiled. He took the axe, put it over his shoulder, and walked away.
The old man had used the axe to make something special. Everyone was staring to see what he had created. To their surprise, the old man had used the axe to make a beautiful wooden toy car, with four black wheels! 
The old man smiled and handed the toy car to a little child. The child's eyes lit up and the old man winked. Everyone in the field smiled and stared at the little car.
