Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a little girl named Mia. She had a big hope to see the distant hills she could see from her window. One day, Mia asked her mom, "Can we go to the distant hills, please?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, Mia. We can go to the hills tomorrow." Mia was very happy and went to bed early that night.
The next day, Mia and her mom walked a long way to the distant hills. When they reached the top, they could see the whole town. Mia said, "Wow, our town is so pretty!" They sat and enjoyed the view before going back home. Mia's hope came true, and she was very happy.
