Once upon a time, there was a little square. The square had four tight sides. It lived in a big box with many other shapes. One day, the square saw a big ball join the box. The ball was very round and could roll fast. The square wanted to play with the ball but it couldn't roll like the ball.
The square thought and thought about how it could join the ball. It tried to roll, but its tight sides made it hard. Then, the square had a great idea. It saw a big hill outside the box. The square knew that if it could get to the top of the hill, it could slide down and join the ball.
The square climbed up the big hill with all its might. At the top, it looked down and saw the ball waiting at the bottom. The square took a deep breath and slid down the hill as fast as it could. As it slid, it went faster and faster. At the bottom, the square finally joined the ball. They laughed and played together all day long. The square was very happy that it found a way to join its new friend, the ball.
