Once upon a time there was a mommy and a daddy who had a very funny little girl. She was always laughing and joking around with her parents. 
One day, the mommy and daddy decided to make some yummy food for the little girl. They put lots of pepper in the food so it was spicy and made her laugh and giggle.
After eating the food, the daddy suggested a fun game to play. The game was very competitive and the little girl really wanted to win. She was laughing and smiling as she tried to do her best. 
In the end, she came out on top and laugh with pride. Mommy and Daddy were very happy for her and gave her lots of hugs and kisses. After that, the little girl went to bed, happy and content.
