Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. He had a guitar. He loved to play it every day. Tim also liked to joke and be a little naughty.
One day, Tim saw a cat. The cat was naughty too. Tim thought, "Maybe the cat wants to joke with me." So, he played his guitar to make the cat laugh. The cat liked the music but did not laugh yet.
Tim played the guitar louder and made a funny face. The cat laughed! They joked and played together. The cat was not naughty anymore. Tim and the cat became good friends. And they lived happily ever after.
