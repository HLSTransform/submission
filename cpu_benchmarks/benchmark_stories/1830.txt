Grandpa was sitting in the old armchair. He looked deep in thought as he mentioned something to himself. A cloud of smoke rose from the pipe he was holding in his hands.
Grandpa was up to something, but little Jack couldn't quite work out what it was. He decided to wait and see.
The next day, Grandpa took Jack on an adventurous hike. Everything sparkled before their eyes as they explored the magical woods. Grandpa stopped and pointed at something that Jack could not see. 
Grandpa smiled and said: "Look there, smoke! It was what I mentioned yesterday." Jack couldn't believe it! In the distant sky, up in the clouds, a hot air balloon was slowly floating. He had never seen anything so beautiful.
Grandpa had set up a surprise adventure that Jack will never forget.
