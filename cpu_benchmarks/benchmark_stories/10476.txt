Once upon a time, there were two friends who went to a restaurant. Their names were Tommy and Jenny. They decided to have lunch together. They looked at all of the food on the menu and then chose something to eat. 
Tommy wanted something sour, so he chose a sour drink and some sour candy. Jenny wanted something sweet, so she chose a sweet drink and some sweet candy. 
They were so excited for their snacks. When their food arrived, Jenny noticed that the waiter had separated her sweet and sour snacks onto two separate plates. She was very confused. 
Jenny asked the waiter, “Why did you separate our snacks?” The waiter smiled and said, “I thought you wanted your snacks to be separate.” 
Jenny felt sad that her snacks were not together and she wanted to be with her friend’s snacks. But, no matter how much Jenny asked, the waiter would not put them back together. 
So, Tommy and Jenny left the restaurant, and their snacks were still separated. They were both very sad, and they never went back to the restaurant again.
