Once there was a gray dolphin. He loved to swim in the ocean and feel the water on his skin. Every day he would swim around and explore the beautiful world he lived in.
One day the dolphin wanted to play a game. He invited all the other animals in the ocean to join him. Everyone was so excited and raced to join the game. But when they got close, the dolphin said that there was no more room!
The dolphin saw how sad everyone was and felt really bad. So, he asked if they wanted to join him on a second game. Everyone cried out with joy, and so the dolphin let the other animals join him the second time.
The dolphin taught the other animals an important lesson; always be kind and share with those around us. And this is why we should always be generous and be kind to those around us, because sharing brings happiness to everyone.
