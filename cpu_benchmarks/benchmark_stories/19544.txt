One day, a little boy named Tommy went to the park with his mommy. It was a sunny day and there were lots of birds chirping and trees to explore. Tommy was so excited to be there, he ran around and climbed on the jungle gym.
Finally, Tommy's mommy helped him find a nice seat to sit down on. She told him to be careful and sit very still. As Tommy sat there he noticed a fizzy fountain with white cream on the top. He saw his mommy smiling and he knew he could have some. It looked so good and he wanted to try it.
Tommy's mommy got him a cup and Tommy carefully tried the cream. It was so delicious - it tasted like small sweet rainbows in his mouth. Tommy smiled, it was so good! He continued to sit there, eating the creamy treat and looking at the birds and trees around him. What a fun day at the park!
