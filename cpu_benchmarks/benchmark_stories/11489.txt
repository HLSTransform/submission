One day, a little girl named Mia went to the park with her mom. Mia wore her favorite jacket. It was red and very different from her other clothes. Mia loved her jacket very much. In the park, she saw a boy named Tom. Tom was playing with a ball.
"Hi, Tom! I like your ball," said Mia. "Can I play with you?"
"Sure, Mia!" said Tom. "Let's play catch!"
Mia and Tom played catch with the ball. They laughed and had lots of fun. Mia took off her jacket because she was hot from playing. She put it on the bench.
Suddenly, a little dog came to the park. The dog saw Mia's jacket and thought it was a toy. The dog took the jacket and ran away.
Mia and Tom saw the dog and ran after it. They clapped their hands to make the dog stop. The dog stopped and dropped the jacket. Mia was happy to get her jacket back. She thanked Tom and the dog.
From that day, Mia, Tom, and the little dog became best friends. They played together in the park every day.
