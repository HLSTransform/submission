Once upon a time, there was a strong girl. She liked playing with her squash.
One day, she decided to take a break from playing and go to the store. She bought a big, yellow squash, and brought it home.
She was so happy to have her very own squash, and she hugged it tight.
But then, her mom said it was time to return to the store. She was sad, but she knew it was the right thing to do.
So the strong girl returned the squash to the store, but she made a promise to come back soon and find a new one. 
And when she did, she was the happiest girl in the world to have her squash back.
