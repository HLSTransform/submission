Once upon a time, there was a tall giraffe named Jerry. Jerry liked to jump and play in the jungle. One day, he found a wallet on the ground. Jerry looked inside the wallet and saw that it belonged to a monkey named Max.
Jerry knew it was the right thing to do, so he brought the wallet to Max. Max was very happy and thanked Jerry for being honest. Jerry felt good inside because he did the right thing.
The moral of the story is that it is always important to be honest and do the right thing, even if it is hard.
