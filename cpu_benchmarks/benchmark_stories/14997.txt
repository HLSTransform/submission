Once upon a time, there was a very adventurous penny. It was shiny, just like all of the other pennies. One day, the adventurous penny decided to take a journey. He bounced and hopped away. Along the way, he met a puddle. The penny said to the puddle, “Where will you take me?” 
The puddle answered, “Jump in and you’ll find out!” 
The adventurous penny thought this was a great idea and jumped into the puddle. Instantly, the penny started to melt! But the penny was not sad, he was as happy as can be! The puddle told the penny that he was going to take him somewhere special. That’s when the penny noticed that the melting was taking him to a bright, orange and yellow sunset!  
The penny had never seen anything so beautiful. The sun was setting and night was coming, but the penny was so happy and content. He thanked the puddle for taking him on this magical journey and melted away into the magical sunset.
