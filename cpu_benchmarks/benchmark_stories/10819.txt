Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, her mommy gave her a delicate dress to wear to a party. The dress was so pretty and had lots of thread sewn onto it. Lily loved it so much that she couldn't wait to wear it.
As she was getting ready for the party, Lily noticed that the zipper on the back of the dress was stuck. She tried to pull it up, but it wouldn't budge. Her mommy tried to help, but it still wouldn't zip.
Lily was sad because she really wanted to wear her pretty dress. But then her mommy had an idea. She took some thread and sewed a little loop onto the zipper. Lily pulled on the loop and the zipper zipped right up! Lily was so happy and excited to wear her dress to the party. And everyone at the party thought she looked beautiful in her delicate dress.
