Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cally. She was 3 years old and had just learned how to fish. One day, she took a sack and went to the pond. She was very excited to see what kind of fish she could catch.
When she arrived at the pond, she was confused. She saw frogs, ducks and other animals, but no fish. She looked around and noticed that there were many weeds in the water. She became frustrated and decided to try something else.
Cally dumped the sack in the pond and watched as the weeds were swept away. She was amazed to see a school of fish appear from the depths. She used her net to catch as many as she could.
Cally was so proud of her accomplishment. She went back home and showed her parents the many fish she had caught. They were amazed at her success and gave her a big hug. From then on, Cally went back to the pond every weekend to fish.
