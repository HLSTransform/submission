Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play pretend. Today, they pretend to be pirates. They wear hats and scarves and have swords made of sticks.
"Arrr, matey, I am the captain of this ship!" Ben says. He points his sword at Anna.
"No, you are not! I am the captain!" Anna says. She swings her sword at Ben.
They fight with their swords. They make loud noises. They have fun.
But then, Ben hits Anna's arm with his sword. It hurts. Anna cries.
"Ow, ow, ow! You hurt me, Ben!" Anna says. She rubs her arm.
"I'm sorry, Anna. I didn't mean to hurt you. Are you okay?" Ben says. He drops his sword. He feels bad.
Anna stops crying. She looks at her arm. It has a red mark. She feels sour.
"No, I'm not okay. You are a bad pirate. You are a bad friend. I don't want to play with you anymore." Anna says. She turns away from Ben.
Ben is sad. He wants to play with Anna. He wants to be her friend. He thinks of what to do.
He remembers what his mom told him. When you hurt someone, you should say sorry and do something nice.
He picks up a flower. He walks to Anna. He gives her the flower.
"Anna, I'm really sorry. I didn't want to hurt you. I want to be your friend. Please, take this flower. It is pretty, like you." Ben says. He smiles.
Anna looks at the flower. She looks at Ben. She sees that he is sorry. She feels less sour.
"Thank you, Ben. That is very nice of you. I'm sorry, too. I was angry. You are not a bad pirate. You are not a bad friend. You are a good friend." Anna says. She smiles.
She takes the flower. She hugs Ben.
They are friends again. They play pretend. They are happy.
The moral of the story is: When you hurt someone, you should say sorry and do something nice. When someone hurts you, you should forgive them and be kind. That is how you keep your friends.
