Lila and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big bush with red berries. They run to the bush and pick some berries.
"Look, Lila, these berries are so sweet and juicy!" Ben says. He puts a berry in his mouth and smiles.
"Can I have one, Ben?" Lila asks. She reaches for a berry, but Ben stops her.
"Wait, Lila, these berries are not for you. They are for me. I found them first." Ben says. He is greedy and careless. He does not want to share with Lila.
Lila feels sad and angry. She does not like Ben's words. She says, "That is not nice, Ben. You are not a good friend. You should share with me. We can have some berries together."
But Ben does not listen to Lila. He says, "No, Lila, these are my berries. Go away and find your own." He turns his back to Lila and eats more berries.
Lila is very upset. She runs away from Ben and the bush. She cries and looks for another friend. She sees a girl with a yellow dress and a big smile. She is sitting on a bench with a book. Lila goes to the girl and says, "Hello, I am Lila. What is your name?"
The girl looks at Lila and says, "Hello, Lila. I am Mia. Do you want to read with me?"
Lila nods and smiles. She sits next to Mia and opens the book. They read and talk and laugh. They become friends.
Lila is happy. She forgets about Ben and the berries. She thinks, "Mia is a good friend. She is kind and generous. She likes to share with me. I am glad I met her."
