Once upon a time, there was a bear called Tom. Tom wanted to hurry and go to the park. He wanted to see the monsters that lived there. He asked his mom if he could go. 
Mom said, "Yes, but you have to hurry. You only have 15 minutes before it gets dark".
Tom knew he had to hurry, so he got ready quickly. He put on his shoes and then ran out the door. 
He ran to the park and quickly found a monster. It was big and green and had a cheap hat on. 
Tom thought it was cool, so he poked it. He kept poking it until it suddenly woke up! 
The monster was mad and started to chase Tom. Tom was scared and started to run. He ran faster and faster until he was safe at home. 
Tom looked back and saw the monster had gone. He was so relieved and very happy he had hurried.
