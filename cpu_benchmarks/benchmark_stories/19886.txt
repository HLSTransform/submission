Once upon a time, there was a big, heavy bear named Benny. Benny loved to sleep in the morning and always forgot to wake up on time. One day, his friend rabbit came to remind him to wake up early. 
Benny got up and went outside to play with his friend. They played hide and seek and had so much fun. Benny was happy that his friend reminded him to wake up early. 
After playing for a while, Benny got tired and went back to his cave to take a nap. He slept for a long time and when he woke up, it was already evening. Benny realized that he had slept for too long and missed the whole day. 
From that day on, Benny made sure to set his alarm clock so he wouldn't forget to wake up in the morning. He was grateful to his friend rabbit for reminding him to wake up early.
