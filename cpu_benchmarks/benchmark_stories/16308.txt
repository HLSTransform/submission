Once upon a time, there was a crane named Bob. Bob was a big bird with a long neck and he lived near a big lake. One day, Bob was flying over the lake when he saw a little fish swimming in the water. The fish looked very sad and miserable.
Bob felt bad for the fish and decided to help him. He swooped down and picked up the fish in his beak. Bob flew over the lake and carried the fish to the other side. When they arrived, the fish was very happy and thanked Bob for his help.
The day had a happy end and Bob felt proud of himself for helping the little fish. He knew that helping others was important and made the world a better place.
