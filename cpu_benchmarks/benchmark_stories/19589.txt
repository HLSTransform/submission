John was a very stubborn 3 year old. He wanted to play games all day, and he would never listen to his mom. One day, his mom asked him to clean his closet. But he didn't want to do it. He said no with a stomp of his foot.
He mom tried to explain again why it was important to clean his closet, but John wouldn't listen. He still said no. Finally, his mom thought of a plan. She said, "If you finish cleaning your closet, I'll clap for you!".
John thought about it and decided he wanted to hear clapping. So he went to his closet and started cleaning. As he cleaned, he sang a little song. After a few minutes, he finished and waited for his mom to clap. And when she did, John smiled with joy.
John learned his lesson that day; listening to his parents was important. From then on, he was more cooperative and didn't give his mom any trouble. And every time he did something good, she clapped in happiness.
