Once there was a cop who was on her way to work. She was very impressive with her shiny badge, tall hat and uniform. On her way, she called out in a loud voice. She ordered a hotdog. 
The hotdog seller saw the cop and ran over to her. He quickly prepared the food and served it to her. The cop took a big bite, and said it was very delicious. 
The hotdog seller was so impressed that he offered to give the cop a free hotdog every day. She agreed and thanked the seller for his kind offer. 
The cop ate the hotdog happily and went off to start her day. She was so impressed with the hotdog seller's kindness.
