Once there was a little boy who had a very special stick. He carried it around with him wherever he went. One day, he was walking along and he decided to poke the stick at the knot in a nearby tree. He poked and poked, but nothing happened.
The little boy asked his mom, "Why won't the knot come out?" His mom smiled and said, "Well, honey, it takes patience and hard work to untie knots. You must be slow and gentle in order to make it happen."
The little boy thought and thought, then he tried again. Slowly and carefully, he poked the stick at the knot and after a while, it finally moved a little. The little boy smiled and kept trying slowly and gently. Eventually, the knot loosened enough that the little boy pulled it out.
The little boy learnt a valuable lesson that day: if you're patient and you work hard, you can do anything!
