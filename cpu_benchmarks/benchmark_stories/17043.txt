Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy skeleton named Mr. Bones. Tim and Mr. Bones were best friends. They played together every day.
One icy day, Tim and Mr. Bones went outside to play. They could hear the wind blowing in the trees. Mr. Bones said, "Brrr, it's cold!" Tim laughed and said, "Yes, it is! Let's play a game to stay warm."
So, Tim and Mr. Bones played hide-and-seek. Tim closed his eyes and counted. Mr. Bones went to hide. Tim looked and looked for Mr. Bones, but he could not find him. Then, Tim heard a sound. It was Mr. Bones! He found him hiding behind a big tree.
Tim and Mr. Bones played all day in the icy cold. When they were tired, they went inside to get warm. They had hot cocoa and talked about their fun day. Tim and Mr. Bones were very happy.
