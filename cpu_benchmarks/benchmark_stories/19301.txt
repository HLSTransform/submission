One day, a family went on a popular safari. They saw lots of interesting animals. They looked at elephants, zebras, and giraffes. They were so excited!
At the end of the day, they had to leave the safari. The whole family was sad. They packed up their things and went home.
They all said goodbye to the animals and waved as they drove away. It had been a fun day. Maybe they would come back to the popular safari someday soon!
