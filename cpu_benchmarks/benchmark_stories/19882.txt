Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she found a pretty flower in the garden. She picked it up and smelled it, but her mommy told her not to eat it because it was poison.
Lily asked, "Why can't I eat it, Mommy?"
Her mommy replied, "Because it's not nice for your tummy. It can make you sick."
Lily understood and said, "Okay, Mommy. I won't eat it. But can I keep it?"
Her mommy permitted her to keep the flower, but reminded her not to eat it. Lily was happy and thanked her mommy for being so nice. They continued to play outside and enjoyed the rest of their day together.
