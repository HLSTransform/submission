Lily was a little girl who loved to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Anna. Anna had a big dress, big eyes and big hair. Lily liked to brush Anna's hair and make her talk.
One day, Lily's dad came home from work. He was a big man who loved Lily very much. He gave Lily a hug and a kiss and asked her, "How was your day, sweetie?"
Lily smiled and said, "It was good, daddy. I played with Anna. She is my best friend."
Dad looked at Anna and said, "She is very pretty, just like you. Do you want to show me what you and Anna did today?"
Lily nodded and took dad's hand. She led him to her room, where she had set up a tea party for Anna and her other dolls. She said, "This is Anna, and this is Lucy, and this is Ben. They are my guests. We had tea and cookies and cake. Do you want some, daddy?"
Dad smiled and said, "Sure, I would love some. Thank you for inviting me, Lily. You are a very good hostess."
Lily poured some tea for dad and gave him a cookie. She said, "You are welcome, daddy. I love you."
Dad hugged Lily and said, "I love you too, Lily. You are my best girl."
