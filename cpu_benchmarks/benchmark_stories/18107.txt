Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read her novel every night before she went to bed. One night, Lily felt very sleepy but she wanted to finish her book. She tried to keep her eyes open but she couldn't. 
The next morning, Lily woke up and found that she had fallen asleep with her book open. She was sad because she didn't get to finish it. Lily learned that it's important to rest when you're feeling sleepy, otherwise you might miss out on things you enjoy. 
From that day on, Lily made sure to finish reading her book before she got too sleepy. She felt happy knowing that she could enjoy her book without feeling tired. The moral of the story is that it's important to take care of yourself and get enough rest.
