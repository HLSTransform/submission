Once upon a time there was a nosy girl called Ruby. She always wanted to know what was going on around her. One day she heard a poem recited in the park.
"That poem was beautiful!" she said out loud.
The park ranger heard her and said, "It sure was! Come clean our park with me and you can learn it too."
Ruby smiled and agreed to help the ranger. They worked together cleaning the park for an entire day. It was hard work, but it was worth it! 
When they were done, the ranger asked Ruby to recite the poem again. Ruby was so happy and began reciting it. But at the same time, the nosy girl noticed that the ranger had picked up her mother's necklace and put it in his pocket. 
Ruby was about to tell her mom when the ranger suddenly turned around and yelled, "You can't tell anyone about this! If you do then I'll have to take away your poem!"
Ruby was sad and scared. She knew she had to keep her mouth shut, so she hung her head and said nothing.
The ranger kept the necklace and never taught Ruby the poem. Ruby was sad and alone, and never saw the park ranger again.
