Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big task to do. Her mom asked her to clean up her toys. Lily was scared to do it because she thought it was too hard. But her mom said she could do it and gave her a hug. 
Lily started to pick up her toys. She felt happy when she finished. She ran to her mom and waved her hands in the air. Her mom was proud of her. 
From that day on, Lily wasn't fearful of doing tasks anymore. She knew she could do it if she tried. She loved to wave to her mom every time she finished a task.
