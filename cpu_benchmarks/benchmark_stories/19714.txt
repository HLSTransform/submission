Once upon a time, there was an ancient wet place. People used to attach big logs and rocks to the walls to keep the water away.
One day, a little boy named Bob went to explore the wet place. He was so curious about it that he ran to the edge of the water.
Bob saw lots of things floating in the water, so he wanted to attach something to the wall. He carefully picked a small rock from the ground and attached it to the wall.
When he was finished, Bob smiled. He had just attached something to the ancient wet place!
