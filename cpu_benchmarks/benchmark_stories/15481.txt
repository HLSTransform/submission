Once there were two friends, Jack and Susie. They were excited because they were going on a safari! 
Jack asked Susie, "Where should we go first?" Susie replied, "Let's go to the river and look for animals!" Jack thought this was a brilliant idea. 
When they got to the river, they saw lots of birds, a monkey, and even a wild elephant! They were so excited, they took lots of pictures. 
The two friends spent the whole day exploring the safari. At the end of the day, they both replied, "This was the best safari ever!"
