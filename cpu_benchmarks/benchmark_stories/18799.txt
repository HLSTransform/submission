Anna and Ben were friends who liked to play together. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big box. They could use the box to make a house, a car, a boat, or anything they wanted. They always had fun with the box.
One day, Anna and Ben saw a new girl in the park. She had a shiny bike, a doll, and a ball. She looked rich and happy. Anna and Ben wanted to play with her, but they were shy. They wondered if she would like their box.
"Hi, I'm Lily," the new girl said, riding her bike to them. "Can I play with you?"
Anna and Ben smiled and nodded. They showed her their box and told her what they liked to do with it.
"That sounds fun," Lily said. "Can I join you?"
"Sure," Anna and Ben said. "We can include you in our game. What do you want to make with the box today?"
Lily thought for a moment. Then she said, "How about a rocket? We can go to the moon and see the stars."
Anna and Ben liked the idea. They helped Lily decorate the box with stickers and crayons. They made helmets out of paper and pretended to be astronauts. They had a blast with their rocket.
They played until it was time to go home. They said goodbye and hugged each other.
"Thank you for including me in your game," Lily said. "You are very nice and creative. I had a lot of fun with you and your box."
"Thank you for playing with us," Anna and Ben said. "You are very kind and generous. We had a lot of fun with you and your bike, doll, and ball."
They agreed to play again the next day. They learned that it didn't matter if they were rich or poor, as long as they had friends and imagination. They were happy.
