Once upon a time, there was a monkey named Max who loved to swing on vines. Max found a thick vine and started to swing on it. Suddenly, Max heard a loud noise and saw a zipper on the ground.
Max picked up the zipper and asked his friend, a bird named Blue, "What is this?" Blue replied, "That's a zipper, Max. You use it to close your jacket." Max was confused and asked, "Why do I need to close my jacket?"
Blue explained, "So you can stay warm when it's cold outside." Max smiled and said, "Oh, I understand now. Thanks, Blue!" Max then zipped up his jacket and continued swinging on the vine, feeling warm and happy.
