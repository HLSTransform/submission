Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends decided to play hide and seek. Lily was very good at hiding and she found a long stick to help her hide even better. 
After a while, it was Lily's turn to seek. She searched high and low for her friends. She looked under bushes, behind trees, and even in a jar that was sitting on the ground. But she couldn't find them anywhere! 
Just when Lily was about to give up, she heard a giggle coming from behind a big rock. She ran over and found all her friends hiding there together. They had been trying to be very quiet so she couldn't find them. Lily was so happy that she had finally found them and they all laughed and played together until it was time to go home.
