One day, a little boy named Tim found a box. The box was full of stuff. There were toys, books, and other fun things. Tim was very happy. He played with the stuff all day long.
One day, Tim's friend Sue came over to play. Sue saw the box and thought it was boring. She did not want to play with the stuff. Instead, she wanted to play outside. Tim was sad. He liked the stuff in the box.
Tim had an idea. He began to shout, "Let's play with the stuff outside!" Sue liked the idea. They took the stuff outside and played together. They had a lot of fun. The stuff was not boring anymore.
