Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her toy cars. One day, she was playing with her red car when she realized it was out of fuel. She asked her mom if she could have more fuel for her car.
Mom said, "Sure, let's go get some fuel at the gas station." When they got there, they saw a man with a thin mustache who was having trouble with his car. Lily's mom asked if they could help him solve his problem.
The man was very grateful, and they all worked together to fix his car. After they were done, the man said, "Thank you so much for helping me solve my car problem. You guys are the best!" Lily was happy that they could help and she went back to playing with her toy cars, now with a full tank of fuel.
