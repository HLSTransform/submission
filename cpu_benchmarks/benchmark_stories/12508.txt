Once upon a time, there was a big, hairy dog named Max. Max liked to run and play in the park with his owner, Tim. One day, while they were playing, Max heard a bell ringing. He looked around and saw a little bird sitting on a branch, ringing the bell with its beak.
Max thought it was funny and ran over to the bird. But the bird didn't like Max getting too close and started to chirp angrily. Max didn't understand why the bird was upset, but he didn't want to make the bird feel scared or sad. So, he decided to surrender and walk away.
Tim was proud of Max for being so kind and understanding. They continued to play in the park, but Max always made sure to stay away from the bird and its bell so as not to upset it again.
