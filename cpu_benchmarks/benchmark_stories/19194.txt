Once upon a time, there was a big crane. The crane was very tall and had a long neck. One day, a little boy saw the crane in a field. The boy was very excited to see the crane. 
The boy wanted to wear his new shoes to show the crane. But his shoes were dirty from playing in the mud. So, he went to wash his shoes in the river. 
When he returned to the field, the crane was still there. The boy showed the crane his new shoes. The crane looked at the boy and then flew away. The boy was sad but happy he got to see the crane.
