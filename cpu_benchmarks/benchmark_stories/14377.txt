Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who lived in a big house on top of a hill. One day, she went for a walk in the valley and she saw a little bird that looked very helpless. 
Lily asked the bird, "What's wrong?" 
The bird said, "I lost my way home and I don't know how to get back." 
Lily felt sad for the bird and said, "Don't worry, I'll help you find your way home." 
So, Lily and the bird went on a journey to find the bird's home. They walked through the valley, over the hills, and through the forest. Finally, they found the bird's home and the bird was very happy. 
The bird said, "Thank you so much for helping me, Lily. You are my hero!" 
Lily smiled and said, "You're welcome, little bird. I'm glad I could help you." And they both lived happily ever after.
