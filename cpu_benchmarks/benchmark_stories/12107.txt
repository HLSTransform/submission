Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing in the park with her friends. One day, she found a green leaf on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her friends.
Her friends said, "Wow! That leaf is so pretty!" But Lily wanted to keep it all to herself. She put it in her pocket and forgot about it. When she got home, she remembered the leaf and took it out of her pocket. But she saw that it had spoiled and turned brown.
Lily was sad that her pretty green leaf had turned brown. Her mom told her that sometimes things spoil if we don't take care of them. Lily learned her lesson and promised to take better care of things in the future.
