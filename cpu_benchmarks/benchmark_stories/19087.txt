Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big imagination and loved to play pretend. One day, she found a white microphone in her toy box. She picked it up and started singing into it, pretending she was a famous singer on stage.
Lily's mom heard her singing and came into the room. She was so impressed with Lily's singing that she decided to take her to a real concert. Lily was so excited! She couldn't imagine anything more fun than singing on stage in front of lots of people.
At the concert, Lily got to meet the real singer and even got to sing a song with her using the white microphone. It was the best day ever! From that day on, Lily imagined herself as a famous singer whenever she played with her white microphone.
