Once upon a time there was a little girl called Anna. She was three years old and loved playing in the garden. She had a spade which her mommy and daddy had provided for her. 
One day, Anna was digging in the garden with her spade. She was having a great time, until the spade slipped from her hand and scratched her arm. It really hurt! 
Anna started to cry, and her mommy came over to see what was wrong. Mommy hugged her and helped her to her feet, then went to get a band-aid to provide some comfort. After that, Anna felt much better. 
The next day, Anna saw the spade in the garden and she wasn't scared anymore. She got out her spade and started to have lots of fun again. 
The end.
