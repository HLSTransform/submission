Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. One day, Lily's mommy recommended that she wear a hat to keep the heat off her face. Lily was patient as her mommy helped her put on the hat.
Lily played for a while, but then she got thirsty. Her mommy recommended that she drink some water to stay hydrated in the heat. Lily was happy to drink the water and felt much better.
Later, Lily's mommy made some cookies. They smelled so good and Lily was very patient as she waited for them to cool down. Finally, they were cool enough to eat and Lily enjoyed them very much.
