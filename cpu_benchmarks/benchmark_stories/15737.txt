Once upon a time there were two friends, Jack and Sally. They liked to play together on the playground. One day, Jack asked Sally, "What would make us happy?"
Sally thought for a moment and said, "I know! Let's build a table!"
So Jack and Sally started finding things to provide for the table. They found a big, strong box for the top and four wooden sticks for the legs.
Once the table was built, Jack and Sally shared some of their favorite treats on it.
Then Sally said, "Let's make the table wise."
So Jack thought of a wise idea: they could put some books on the table! So they went to the library and found some great books.
When they finished, they had a wise table with delicious treats. From then on, Jack and Sally sat at the wise table and shared stories and snacks. They were always very happy!
