Once upon a time, there was a brave lion. He was walking through the jungle and came across an alligator. The lion was frightened, and he backed away quickly.
The alligator spoke in a deep voice: "Don't be scared! I'm just an alligator. I need your help to complete my mission. Can you help me?" he asked.
The brave lion thought for a moment and then said: "Yes, I can help. What do you need me to do?"
The alligator thanked the lion and explained his mission. He needed the lion to help him catch a nearby fish. The lion agreed and eagerly ran off to catch the fish.
After a few minutes, the lion returned with a plump fish. The alligator was very happy and thanked the lion. The mission was complete!
The brave lion felt proud of himself. He had helped the alligator and wasn't scared anymore. The alligator thanked the lion one more time and walked back into the jungle.
The brave lion was no longer frightened, and he continued walking through the jungle with a big smile on his face.
