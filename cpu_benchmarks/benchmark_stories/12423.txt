Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Molly. She loved to explore, and she found a twig on the ground. She picked it up and started playing with it. Suddenly, a bird flew down and perched on the twig. Molly was very excited, and she and the bird talked to each other. 
"Hello!" said Molly. "What's your name?" 
"I'm Tweet," said the bird. "I saw you picking this twig, and I thought it would make a great place for me to rest." 
Molly was happy to help Tweet gain a comfortable place to sit. She put the twig up in a nearby tree for the bird. Then she said goodbye and went on her way. 
From then on, Molly and Tweet were good friends. Every time Molly went to explore, Tweet was always there to greet her. And Molly was glad to help Tweet gain a comfortable place to rest.
