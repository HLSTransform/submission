Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to ride her bike with her friends. One day, she saw a ball of yarn on the ground. She picked it up and asked her friend, "What can we do with this yarn?"
Her friend replied, "Let's make a bracelet with it!"
Lily was so excited to make a bracelet with her friend. They were both so busy making the bracelet that they didn't even notice the time passing by. When they finished, they admired their creation and Lily said, "Let's ride our bikes with our new bracelets on!" 
They both put on their bracelets and rode their bikes around the park, feeling happy and proud of their busy work.
