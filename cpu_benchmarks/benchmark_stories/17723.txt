Once upon a time, there was a True who was very ugly. All the other Trues were happy, but this one was sad. He wanted to show everyone how very True he was.
One day, it was spring. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the flowers were blooming. The True saw all the beauty around him and he felt happy. He felt something inside him, like something was going to happen.
Suddenly he felt like he was growing and stretching taller and taller. He felt one big push and he began to bounce, higher and higher and higher. He was springing, round and round in the sunshine.
The other Trues were amazed! They never knew he could do that. The ugly True had become the most beautiful True in spring. He was happy and so were the other Trues.
