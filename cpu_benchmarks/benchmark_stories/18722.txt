Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read her books every day. One day, her friend came over to play with her. They played with dolls and blocks, but then Lily's friend said, "Let's throw the ball!" 
Lily got excited and said, "Okay, but we have to be careful not to break anything." They threw the ball back and forth, but then Lily accidentally threw the ball too hard and it hit her bookshelf. 
"Oh no!" Lily cried. "My books fell down!" 
Her friend said, "Don't worry, we can help you pick them up." They carefully picked up all the books and put them back on the shelf. Lily was happy that her friend was so kind and helpful.
