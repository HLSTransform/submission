Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved her cat, Mittens, very much. One day, Mittens climbed up a high tree and couldn't come down. Lily was very worried and didn't know what to do. 
She asked her mom for help, but her mom couldn't climb the tree either. Then, Lily had an idea. She would have to go get her dad, who was very tall and strong. 
Lily ran to her dad and told him that Mittens was stuck in a high tree. Her dad quickly came to help and climbed up to rescue Mittens. Finally, Mittens was safe and sound in Lily's arms again. She was so happy to have her cat back.
