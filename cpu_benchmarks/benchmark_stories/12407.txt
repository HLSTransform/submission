Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was walking in the park one day and suddenly she heard a loud caw. Lucy stopped and looked around, trying to find the source of the noise.
Suddenly, a great black raven flew down from the sky and landed right beside her. Startled, Lucy screamed and started to panic.
"What's wrong, Lucy?" asked the raven.
"I feel dizzy," replied Lucy.
The raven thought for a moment. "I have an idea!" the raven said. "Let's go for a ride!"
Lucy grabbed the raven's feathers and, with a powerful flap of its wings, the raven soared off into the sky. As they swirled round and round in the air, Lucy felt a wonderful wind on her face and she was no longer dizzy.
At last, the raven landed back in the park and Lucy thanked it for the ride. The raven smiled back. "Don't be scared next time," it said.
And Lucy was never scared of ravens again!
