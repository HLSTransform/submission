Once upon a time, there was a wealthy boy named Tim. He had many toys and books. One day, while playing in his room, he saw a book on the floor. He picked it up and started to read.
Tim's little sister, Sue, came in and said, "That's my book! Give it back!" Tim did not want to give the book back. He wanted to keep reading. Sue tried to grab the book, but Tim held on tight.
Sue began to cry. Tim felt bad and decided to give the book back. As he handed it to her, he slipped on a toy car. Tim and Sue both laughed. They agreed to share the book and read it together.
