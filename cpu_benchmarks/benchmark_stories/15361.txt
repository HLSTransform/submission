One day, a boy was walking through a park. Suddenly, he saw a big bunch of grapes. He was so excited! The grapes were so big, and looked so delicious. He started to eat them quickly, one after the other.
He ate the grapes so fast that he got a tummy ache! He looked around, and saw a duck. The duck had a very big beak and was eating upside down. The boy watched the duck eating and wanted to do the same! 
He tried and tried, but he couldnâ€™t do it! The duck laughed at him. It was so funny! The boy laughed too. He ate some more grapes, but this time slowly. Then, he went back home.
