Once there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to play outside. One day, she went to the park. She saw a slide and it looked so fun. She went closer and saw something exciting. There was a rabbit! It was a grey bunny and it was very friendly.
Lucy was excited to meet the bunny. She said hello and the bunny said hi back. They talked and played together. Lucy would go down the slide and the bunny would watch. They were having a lot of fun.
The day was very peaceful. All Lucy could hear was the wind and birds chirping in the trees. She and the rabbit played for hours. Soon, it was time to go home. Lucy was sad but said goodbye and thanked the rabbit for the fun day. She waved to the bunny as she left.
Lucy was so happy she had the chance to meet the friendly bunny and have a peaceful time at the park.
