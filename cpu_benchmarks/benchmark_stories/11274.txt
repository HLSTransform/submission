Mama went to the garden. She found a bird with a wet feather. Mama was worried. She asked the bird, "Little bird, why is your feather wet?" The bird looked sad. He said, "My eye is dry. I can't make it wet. I did something bad and now I'm feeling guilty." Mama was kind. She said, "Don't worry little bird. Let me help." She picked up a cup and filled it with water from the nearby pond. The bird was excited. He put his eye in the cup and got it wet. When he was done, he said thank you to Mama and flew away. Mama watched as the bird flew away happy. She knew the bird felt much better.
