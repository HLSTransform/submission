Once upon a time, there was a big river. It was a nice day and the sun was very hot. The river was not easy to cross because it was very wide.
One day, a little boy named Tim wanted to cross the river. He saw a big pile of snow near the river. Tim had an idea. He thought the snow could help him get across the river.
Tim started to push the snow into the river. But the hot sun made the snow melt. The snow became water and joined the river. Tim was sad, but he learned that snow melts in the sun. He knew he had to find another way to cross the river.
