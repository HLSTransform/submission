Once upon a time there was a little girl called Tina. She liked to go for walks and she enjoyed the peaceful quietness of the woods.
One day Tina was on her walk and she heard a loud noise coming from the valley below. She wondered what it was and decided to go and take a look.
As she carefully made her way down the hill she noticed that the noise was getting louder and louder. Tina was curious and wanted to find out what was making the noise.
When she got to the valley she saw that the noise was coming from a noisy waterfall. Tina smiled and watched the waterfall for a while. It was so beautiful to watch and the quietness of the surrounding woods made it even more special. 
When it was time for Tina to go home she waved goodbye to the waterfall and went back up the hill. It had been such an exciting day and she was glad she had taken the time to explore. Tina smiled and continued walking happily back home.
