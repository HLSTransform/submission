Tom and Sam were best friends. They liked to play in the park and look for treasure. One day, they found a big box under a tree. It was shiny and had a lock on it.
"Wow, maybe this is treasure!" Tom said. "Let's open it and see what's inside."
Sam nodded. He saw a rock nearby and picked it up. He wanted to smash the lock with the rock. But Tom stopped him.
"Wait, Sam. Maybe this is not our box. Maybe someone else left it here. Maybe they will be sad if we break it. We should be kind and leave it alone."
Sam did not listen. He was too curious and excited. He said, "No, Tom. This is our box. We found it first. I want to see the treasure. Move away or I will hit you with the rock."
Tom was scared and sad. He did not want to fight with Sam. He did not want to hurt him or the box. He tried to talk to Sam, but Sam did not listen. He raised the rock and swung it at the lock.
But he missed. The rock hit the box and made a loud noise. The noise was like a beep. The box was not a box. It was a bomb. It was a bad bomb that someone left in the park. The bomb was ready to explode.
Tom and Sam did not know. They did not have time to run or hide. They did not have time to say sorry or hug. The bomb went off and made a big boom. The boom was very loud and very hot. It hurt Tom and Sam and the tree and the park. It was a very bad ending.
