One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park. It was a quiet day, and the sun was shining. Lily liked to catch things, like bugs and leaves. Today, she wanted to catch something new.
Lily saw a butterfly. It was very pretty, with many colors on its wings. She wanted to catch the butterfly and keep its image in her mind. She ran after it, trying to be quiet so she would not scare it away.
The butterfly flew away, but Lily did not give up. She followed it until it landed on a flower. Lily reached out and caught the butterfly. She looked at its beautiful image and smiled. Then, she let it go, so it could fly and be free.
