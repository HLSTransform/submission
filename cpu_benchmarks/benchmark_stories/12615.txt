Once upon a time, there was a big, good dog named Max. Max loved to run and play outside. One day, he saw a squirrel and started to run really fast. He wanted to catch the squirrel, but it was too speedy for him.
As Max was running, he tripped and fell. He hit his tooth on a rock and it hurt a lot. His owner came outside and saw that Max was hurt. She took him to the vet, who said that Max would be okay.
After a few days, Max's tooth felt better and he was back to his speedy self. He was happy to be outside again, playing and having fun. And he learned to be more careful so he wouldn't hurt his tooth again. The end.
