Once there was a boy named Peter. He wanted to see a fireworks show very badly. So one day, he decided to go by himself. On his way, he saw a powerful firework. He wanted it, so he tried to pick it up. But as soon as he touched it, he slipped and the firework exploded! He was so scared that he started crying.
His mom heard his cries and came running over. She asked him what had happened, and so he told her the whole story. His mom said that that was a very powerful firework, and he should never have tried to pick it up. But she also said that even though it was a scary experience, it was a good lesson for him to learn.
From that day on, Peter was much more careful about picking up things he didn't know about. He always asked an adult first and when it came to fireworks, he left them for the firework show so he could enjoy them with his family!
