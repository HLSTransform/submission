Once upon a time, there was a big, wild lion who lived in the jungle. He loved to walk on the trail and look for his lunch. One day, he saw a monkey and wanted to catch him. The monkey was scared and ran away. The lion chased him and finally caught him. He wanted to slap the monkey, but the monkey said sorry and promised to never come back again. The lion let him go and continued walking on the trail, looking for his lunch.
