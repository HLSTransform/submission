Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jake. Jake loved to read books and look at the pictures. One day, when Jake was reading outside, it started to rain. Jake was sad that he couldn't read outside anymore. Then he looked up and saw something very special - a lovely rainbow! 
The rainbow was so bright and colourful and it was so lovely. He just had to go and see it up close. So he ran out from under his tree and started to run towards the rainbow. But it was so far away and he was only a little boy! 
Thankfully, the rainbow came down from the sky and it flew around the little boy! He laughed and jumped and smiled, taking in the beauty of the rainbow. He was so happy that he said: "Hello rainbow, I love you." 
He waved goodbye sadly when the rainbow flew away. But Jake knew he'd never forget his beautiful rainbow or the feelings of love and joy it gave him. Jake decided he would always remember the lovely rainbow.
