Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Jack. He had a big farm with lots of different animals. Every day he had to load up the animals so they could go to the market. 
One day, Jack's neighbor wanted to borrow Jack's donkey. He asked Jack to lend him the donkey, but Jack said no. His neighbor was getting very mad!
"You are being very selfish!" the neighbor exclaimed. "Suddenly, I understand why people call you 'Selfish Jack'."
Jack started to feel very sad. He knew he should share his animals with his neighbor, but he wanted to keep them all to himself. 
That night Jack had a dream. In his dream, all the farm animals went to the market together, loaded on the same wagon. He could see his neighbor next to him, and they were both smiling. 
Jack woke up and knew that he had to do the right thing. He loaded up his donkey and let his neighbor borrow it. From then on, Jack was no longer known as Selfish Jack - he was Friend Jack!
