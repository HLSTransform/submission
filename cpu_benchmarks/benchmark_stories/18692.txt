Once upon a time, there was a kind princess. She had a silver crown that she loved very much. One day, a greedy king came and took her crown without asking. The princess was very sad and cried a lot.
Her friends tried to help her find the crown, but they couldn't. Then, a wise old man came and said he could help. He had a test for the greedy king. The test was to see if the king was generous or not.
The king failed the test and gave back the silver crown to the princess. She was very happy and thanked the wise old man. From then on, the princess always wore her silver crown and was very careful to not let anyone take it away again.
