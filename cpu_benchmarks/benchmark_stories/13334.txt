Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a toy bear named Mr. Bear. Lucy loved Mr. Bear so much. They played together every day.
One day, Lucy's mom said, "Lucy, it's time to do your own laundry. You are a big girl now." Lucy wanted to be fair and help her mom. So, she took her clothes and Mr. Bear's clothes to the laundry room.
Lucy looked at Mr. Bear and said, "Mr. Bear, let's wash our clothes together. It will be fun!" Mr. Bear nodded his head. They put the clothes in the machine and watched them spin around. They laughed and clapped their hands.
When the laundry was done, Lucy and Mr. Bear took the clothes out. They smelled so good and clean. Lucy said, "We did it, Mr. Bear! We did our own laundry!" Mr. Bear smiled and gave Lucy a big hug. They went back to play, happy that they had been fair and helped with the laundry.
