Once upon a time there was a hungry little girl. She was looking for something to eat. So she walked and walked until she met a nice lady. 
The nice lady was going to the west. She told the little girl that she was going to a special place. It was called the 'Delicious West'. The lady said she would take the little girl if she wanted to go.
The little girl was so excited! She followed the nice lady to the west. When they arrived there, the little girl saw lots of yummy treats. Cake, ice cream, fruits, and more! Everything tasted so delicious. 
The little girl and the nice lady ate together. They laughed and chatted, and the little girl had lots of fun. She saw that the Delicious West was the best place to be! 
When the sun went down, the little girl said goodbye to the nice lady. She thanked her for taking her to the Delicious West. Then, the little girl went home with her tummy full and a big smile!
