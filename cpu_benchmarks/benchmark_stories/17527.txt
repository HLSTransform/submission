Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big pole with a bell on top. They want to ring the bell.
"Can you reach the bell?" Anna asks Ben.
"No, it is too high. We need something to stand on," Ben says.
They look around and see a big box. They push the box to the pole. They climb on the box.
"Now I can reach the bell!" Anna says. She pulls the rope and the bell rings loud.
"Ding dong! Ding dong!" the bell says.
Anna and Ben laugh and clap. They ring the bell again and again.
"Hey, what are you doing?" a voice says.
They turn and see a man. He is wearing a blue shirt and a hat. He is holding a big bag.
He is the mailman. He comes to the park every day to deliver letters. He uses the bell to let people know he is here.
"This is my bell. It is not a toy. You should not ring it so much. You might scare the birds and the dogs," the mailman says.
He is not angry, but he is not happy either.
"Sorry, mister. We did not know. We just wanted to have fun," Anna says.
"We like your bell. It is not ordinary. It is special," Ben says.
The mailman smiles. He puts his bag down and climbs on the box.
"OK, I will show you how to ring the bell properly. You have to do it gently and slowly. Like this," he says.
He pulls the rope and the bell rings soft.
"Ding dong! Ding dong!" the bell says.
Anna and Ben listen and watch. They learn how to ring the bell like the mailman.
"Thank you, mister. You are very nice. Can we ring the bell with you?" Anna asks.
"Sure, why not? But only for a little while. Then I have to go and deliver the letters," the mailman says.
He gives them each a turn to ring the bell. They take turns and ring the bell together.
"Ding dong! Ding dong!" the bell says.
Anna and Ben are happy. They make a new friend. They like the mailman and his bell. They think he is not ordinary. He is special.
