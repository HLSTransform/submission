One day, Mama and Papa took Jack to the park. Jack was so excited to go play. He saw the perfect patch of green grass and ran right over. He plopped down and started to spread out his arms and legs. 
Suddenly, he felt an itch erupting on him. He quickly jumped up, and tried to scratch the place that itched. Mama saw this, and asked, "What's wrong, Jack?"
Jack looked sadly at Mama and said, "I have an itch! It's spreading fast!"
Mama nodded and said, "Let's go find something perfect to make it feel better." Papa and Jack started walking, looking for the perfect thing.
After a few minutes, they found it: a huge tree with a great big trunk - perfect for scratched itches. Jack laughed and rubbed his arm against the trunk, feeling all the itches disappear. He was so happy to find such a perfect thing for his itchy skin!
