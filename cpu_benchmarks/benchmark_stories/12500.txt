Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a small house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily's mommy got a letter in the mail. It was in a special envelope with a pretty stamp on it. 
Lily's mommy was very happy to get the letter, but she looked sad too. "What's wrong mommy?" asked Lily. "Oh, nothing dear," said her mommy. 
Later that day, Lily and her mommy went for a walk in the park. They saw a bird's nest in a tree. "Look Lily, the bird discovered a new home," said her mommy. 
As they walked back home, Lily saw a poor man sitting on the sidewalk. "Mommy, why is that man sitting there?" she asked. "He doesn't have a home like we do," said her mommy. 
When they got home, Lily's mommy opened the special envelope and read the letter. It was from her friend who needed help. Lily's mommy knew just what to do. She got some food and clothes and went to give them to the poor man. "Mommy, you discovered a way to help him!" said Lily. Her mommy smiled and gave her a big hug.
