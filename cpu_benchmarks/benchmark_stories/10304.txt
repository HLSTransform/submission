Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park with their toys. One day, Lily brought a new toy to the park. It was a shiny car that made noises. Ben wanted to play with it, but Lily said no. She said it was her toy and she did not want to share.
Ben felt sad and angry. He thought Lily was not nice. He waited until Lily was not looking and took the car from her bag. He put it in his pocket and ran away. He thought he was clever and happy.
But when he got home, he felt bad. He looked at the car and did not want to play with it. He knew he did something wrong. He knew he hurt Lily's feelings. He wished he did not take the car. He wished he said sorry to Lily. He regretted being mean to his friend.
The next day, he went to the park with the car. He saw Lily sitting on a bench. She looked sad and lonely. She did not have any toys. Ben felt sorry for her. He walked up to her and took the car out of his pocket. He said, "Lily, I am sorry. I took your car yesterday. It was not nice of me. I want to give it back to you. Can we be friends again?"
Lily looked at Ben and the car. She was surprised and happy. She said, "Ben, thank you. I am sorry too. I should have shared my car with you. It is more fun to play together. Yes, we can be friends again."
They hugged and smiled. They played with the car and their other toys. They learned to be kind and share. They did not regret being friends.
