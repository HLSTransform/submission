Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and eat candy. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean up his toys. Timmy didn't want to clean up his toys because he wanted to play more. But then his mom said, "If you don't clean up your toys, you will get in trouble." Timmy didn't want to get in trouble, so he started to clean up his toys. 
After a while, Timmy got stuck and didn't know how to put away a big toy. He felt helpless and didn't know what to do. Then his mom came to help him. She showed him how to put away the toy and Timmy understood what to do. He was happy that he didn't get in trouble and was able to clean up his toys. The end.
