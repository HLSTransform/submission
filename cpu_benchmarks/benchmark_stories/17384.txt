Ben and Lily liked to play near the pond. The pond had many fish and frogs and ducks. The fish and frogs and ducks were friendly. They liked to swim and jump and quack.
One day, Ben and Lily found a big bucket near the pond. They decided to fill the bucket with water from the pond. They wanted to make a small pond for themselves. They took turns to carry the bucket to a grassy spot. They poured the water on the grass. They made a small puddle.
"Look, we have our own pond!" Ben said.
"Let's find some fish and frogs and ducks for our pond!" Lily said.
They ran back to the pond. They tried to catch some fish and frogs and ducks with their hands. But the fish and frogs and ducks were too fast and slippery. They could not catch any.
"Maybe they don't want to leave their pond," Ben said.
"Maybe they are happy here," Lily said.
They looked at the pond. They saw the fish and frogs and ducks swimming and jumping and quacking. They looked at their puddle. They saw the water getting smaller and smaller. The sun was making the water dry.
"Maybe we should leave our puddle," Ben said.
"Maybe we should go back to the pond," Lily said.
They picked up their bucket. They ran back to the pond. They put the bucket down. They joined the fish and frogs and ducks. They splashed and laughed and had fun. They were friendly. They were happy.
