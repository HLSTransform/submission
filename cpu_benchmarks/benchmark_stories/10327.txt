Lily loves her dog Max. He is big and brown and soft. He likes to play with Lily and make her laugh. Sometimes he barks at the birds or the mailman, but he is a good dog.
One day, Lily and Max go to the park with Mom. There are many other dogs and people there. Lily sees a slide and wants to try it. She asks Mom if she can go. Mom says yes, but she tells Lily to release Max's leash. She says Max can run and play with the other dogs.
Lily does what Mom says. She releases Max's leash and runs to the slide. She climbs up the steps and sits on the top. She feels excited and scared. She looks for Max, but she can't see him. There are too many dogs and people. She feels alone and sad.
She slides down and runs to Mom. She tells Mom she wants Max. She says she is sorry she released his leash. She says she misses him. Mom hugs Lily and tells her it's okay. She says Max is fine. She says they will find him soon.
They walk around the park and call Max's name. Lily sees a big tree with a bench under it. She sees Max lying on the bench. He looks comfortable and happy. He sees Lily and Mom and wags his tail. He jumps off the bench and runs to them. He licks Lily's face and makes her laugh. Lily hugs Max and tells him she loves him. She says she is glad they found him. Mom smiles and says they are a good team. They go back to the car and drive home. Lily and Max are comfortable and happy. They are best friends.
