Once upon a time, in a calm little town, there lived a boy named Tim. Tim liked to play with his toys and eat yummy food. One day, his mom gave him a snack and a napkin to clean his hands.
While he was eating, Tim saw a sharp rock on the ground. He was curious and wanted to touch it. But his mom said, "Be careful, Tim! The rock is sharp and can hurt you."
Tim listened to his mom and did not touch the sharp rock. Instead, he used his napkin to clean his hands and went back to playing with his toys. Tim was very happy and safe, and his mom was proud of him. They had a great day together in their calm little town.
