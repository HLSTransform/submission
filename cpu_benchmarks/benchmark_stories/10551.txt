Once upon a time, there was a boy named Sam. Sam was very proud today, because he felt like he could do anything. He had a plan to go outside and play in the sunshine.
"Ready?" Sam's mom asked. "Yup!" Sam said.
Sam had a great time playing outside. His mom watched him with a big smile on her face. She was very proud of him.
When it was time to go inside again, Sam's mom gave him a big kiss on the cheek. "I am so proud of you today," she said. Sam smiled and wiped the kiss away. He was very happy.
The end.
