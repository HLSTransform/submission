Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big tree with red fruits on it. They were cherries, and they looked yummy.
"Let's pick some cherries and eat them," Tom said.
"OK, but be careful. Mom said not to climb too high," Lily said.
They ran to the tree and started to pick the cherries. They ate some and put some in a basket. They were sweet and juicy.
"Look, there is a big cherry up there. I want it," Tom said. He pointed to a branch that was very high.
"No, Tom, don't go there. It's too high and dangerous. You might fall," Lily said.
But Tom did not listen. He wanted the big cherry. He climbed higher and higher, until he reached the branch. He stretched his hand to grab the cherry.
"Got it!" he shouted.
But then, the branch broke. Tom lost his balance and fell to the ground. He hit his head on a rock and did not move.
"Tom! Tom!" Lily screamed. She ran to him and shook him. But he did not wake up. He did not repeat her name. He did not open his eyes. He was gone.
Lily cried and cried. She wished she could have the little cherry back and give it to Tom. She wished he would wake up and play with her again. But it was too late. She was alone.
