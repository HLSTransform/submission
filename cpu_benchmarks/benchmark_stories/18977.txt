Once upon a time, there was a lonely little dog named Spot. Spot had no friends to play with, so he would sit on the couch all day. He felt very sad.
One day, Spot saw a big group of kids playing outside. They were laughing and having fun. Spot wanted to join them, so he went outside and gathered all his toys. He brought them to the kids and said, "Can I play with you?"
The kids looked at Spot and his toys, then they said, "No, you can't play with us. You are just a little dog." Spot felt even more lonely and sad than before.
Spot went back to his couch and sat down with his toys. He wished he could find some friends to play with, but the kids did not want him. Spot stayed on the couch, feeling very lonely and sad, and his wish never came true.
