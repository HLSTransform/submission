Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big pond with many ducks. Sara and Tom run to the pond and gaze at the ducks. They see white ducks, brown ducks, and black ducks. They see ducks with green heads and ducks with red bills.
"Look, Tom, look!" Sara says. "That duck has a baby duck! It is so small and cute!"
Tom looks at the baby duck. He sees its yellow feathers and its black eye. He smiles and says, "Yes, Sara, it is very cute. Do you think it can swim?"
Sara nods and says, "I think so. Let's watch it."
They watch the baby duck follow its mother in the water. They see it splash and dive and flap its wings. They see its clear eye shine in the sun. They feel happy and clap their hands.
The mother duck hears them and quacks. She swims to the edge of the pond and looks at Sara and Tom. She wags her tail and nods her head. She seems to say, "Thank you for being nice to my baby."
Sara and Tom say, "You're welcome, duck. We like your baby. It is very pretty and brave."
They wave to the duck and the baby duck. They say, "Bye-bye, duck. Bye-bye, baby duck. Have a good day."
They hold hands and walk back to the park. They are still gazing at the pond and the ducks. They are still smiling and talking. They are still friends.
