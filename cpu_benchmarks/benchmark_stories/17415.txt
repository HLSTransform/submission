Tom and Anna are twins. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a big stick on the ground. Tom picks it up and says, "This is my stick. I can use it as a sword or a wand."
Anna wants the stick too. She says, "No, it is my stick. I saw it first. I can use it as a flute or a telescope."
Tom and Anna start to pull the stick from each other. They shout and cry. They do not want to share.
A lady who works in the park sees them. She walks over and says, "What is going on here? Why are you fighting over a stick?"
Tom and Anna stop pulling. They look at the lady. They say, "It is our stick. We both want it."
The lady says, "That is not a nice way to play. You are being spoiled. A stick is not a toy. It can hurt you or someone else. You should put it back where you found it and find something else to play with."
Tom and Anna feel ashamed. They say, "We are sorry, lady. You are right. We should not fight over a stick. We should share and be kind."
They put the stick back on the ground. They hug each other and say, "We love you, brother/sister. Let's go and play on the swings."
The lady smiles and says, "That's better. I'm glad you made up. Have fun and be careful." She walks away.
Tom and Anna run to the swings. They take turns and push each other. They laugh and have fun. They are happy.
