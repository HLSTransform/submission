Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to carry her teddy bear everywhere she went. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a telephone to play with. Lily was so happy and talked to her teddy bear on the phone for hours. 
But one day, Lily's friend came over and asked to play with the telephone. Lily didn't want to share because she was being selfish. Her friend felt sad and left to go play somewhere else. 
Lily realized she was wrong and felt bad. She decided to share her telephone with her friend and they had so much fun talking on the phone together. From that day on, Lily learned to be less selfish and always share with her friends.
