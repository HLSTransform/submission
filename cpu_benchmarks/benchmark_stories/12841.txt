Once upon a time, there was a healthy ship sailing on a peaceful day. On the deck of the ship stood a group of three year old friends. They decided to go for a swim in the sea. As the friends chatted together, one of them said, "Let's go for a swim! It will be fun".
So the friends jumped into the sea and started splashing around. Suddenly one of them spotted a pink dolphin swimming in their direction! The children began to talk excitedly as the dolphin approached them.
The dolphin said, "Hi children! Would you like to come on a journey with me?" The children replied, "Yes! Let's go for an adventure together!"
So the healthy little ship followed the pink dolphin and the children enjoyed the ride. They talked to the dolphin and asked questions about the sea. After a while, the dolphin came to take them back to the ship and the children happily said goodbye to their new friend.
The children went back to the deck of their healthy ship and talked and laughed about their marvelous adventure. Who would ever have thought they would have a chance to ride with a pink dolphin?
