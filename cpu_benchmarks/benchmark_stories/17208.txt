Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to ride his bike. One day, Timmy was riding his bike down the street when he saw a cop car. The cop waved at Timmy and said, "Hey there, little guy! That's a perfect bike you have there." Timmy smiled and said, "Thank you, Mr. Cop!" 
The cop asked Timmy where he was going, and Timmy said he was just riding around the neighborhood. The cop said, "Well, be careful and make sure you wear your helmet." Timmy nodded and rode off, feeling happy that the cop liked his bike. 
As Timmy rode down the street, he saw his friend Billy playing in his yard. Billy said, "Hey Timmy, can I ride your bike?" Timmy said, "Sure, but be careful!" Billy hopped on the bike and rode around, feeling the wind in his hair. When he was done, he said, "Thanks Timmy, that was so much fun!" Timmy smiled and said, "I know, riding bikes is the best!"
