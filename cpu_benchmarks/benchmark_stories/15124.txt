Once upon a time there was a flower who grew in a garden. She was a happy flower and enjoyed the sunshine and the rain. One day, she noticed that the other flowers in the garden were growing very quickly. She was worried because she couldn't grow like all the other flowers. She felt very naughty and tried her best.
But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't grow. She was feeling very low and started to get very nervous. Finally, a butterfly came and flew near her.
 
The butterfly said, "Don't worry, don't be bothered. You don't need to grow fast like everyone else. Take your time and enjoy life."
The flower listened to the butterfly, and slowly, but surely, she started to grow and thrive. She realized that the butterflies words were wise and she wasn't the only one having troubles.
The flower happily grew in the garden and realized that a little patience goes a long way. She also learned that it's okay to take your time and enjoy life!
