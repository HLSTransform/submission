Once upon a time, there was a cool dog named Spot. Spot liked to play and run. One day, he found a gate in the park. The gate was big and red. Spot wanted to go through the gate and see what was on the other side.
Spot pushed the gate open and walked in. Inside, he found a big space where he could create things. Spot decided to create a big ball to play with. He made the ball yellow and bouncy.
Spot played with the ball all day long. He was very happy that he found the gate. At the end of the day, Spot went back through the gate and went home. He couldn't wait to come back and create more fun things to play with.
