Once upon a time, there was a little chicken named Chirpy. Chirpy was a chubby chicken who loved to eat eggs. One day, Chirpy found a big egg. The egg was too big for Chirpy to sit on. Chirpy tried to sit on the egg, but it didn't fit. 
Chirpy asked her friends if they could help her. Her friends tried to sit on the egg too, but it still didn't fit. Chirpy was sad because she really wanted to hatch the egg. 
Suddenly, Chirpy had an idea. She asked her friends to push the egg into her nest. They all pushed and pushed until finally, the egg fit in Chirpy's nest. Chirpy was so happy and she sat on the egg until it hatched into a cute little chick.
