Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved kittens. She wanted a kitten of her own, but her mom said she had to wait until she was older. One day, Lily's mom said they were going to visit her grandma's house. Lily was excited because she loved her grandma's house. 
On the way to grandma's house, Lily saw a little kitten on the side of the road. The kitten was all alone and looked scared. Lily asked her mom if they could take the kitten home, but her mom said they couldn't because they weren't ready for a pet yet.
Finally, they arrived at grandma's house. Lily was happy to see her grandma, but she was still sad about the kitten. Suddenly, her grandma said she had a surprise for her. She brought out a little kitten from behind her back! Lily was so happy and hugged the kitten tight. She was so happy that she forgot about the kitten on the side of the road.
