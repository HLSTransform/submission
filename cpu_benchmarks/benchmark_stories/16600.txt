Tim and Mia like to race their boats in the pond. They make their boats from paper and sticks. They give their boats names. Tim's boat is Red Rocket. Mia's boat is Blue Bird.
One day, it rains a lot. The pond becomes very big and fast. Tim and Mia want to race their boats in the flood. They think it will be fun and exciting.
"Let's go, Red Rocket!" Tim says. He puts his boat in the water and pushes it. "You can beat Blue Bird!"
"Blue Bird is faster!" Mia says. She puts her boat in the water and blows on it. "You can't catch me, Red Rocket!"
But the flood is too strong. It takes their boats away. Tim and Mia run after them, but they can't reach them. They see their boats crash into rocks and trees. They are sad and scared.
"Tim, Mia, come back!" their mom calls. She sees them near the edge of the pond. She is worried. "The flood is dangerous! You have to be careful!"
Tim and Mia run back to their mom. They hug her and say sorry. They tell her they lost their boats. Their mom says it's okay. She says she is glad they are safe. She says they can make new boats another day. She says they can race them when the pond is calm and slow. Tim and Mia agree. They say they will be more careful next time. They go home with their mom. They are wet and cold, but they are happy.
