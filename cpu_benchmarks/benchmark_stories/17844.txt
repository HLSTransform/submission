One day, a little mouse wanted to climb up a tree. He pushed his feet against the bark, and soon he was at the top. He looked out over the world and it was so beautiful.
The mouse was happy until suddenly he heard a noise! It was a harmless butterfly flying by. The mouse got scared and scrambled down the tree as fast as he could. He quickly ran off to find a place to hide. 
He found an old log and scurried in. It was nice and cozy inside and the mouse felt safe. He stayed there all day, until finally it was nighttime. 
The mouse peeked outside and saw it was dark. He was no longer scared, so he climbed out of the log and skipped away, off on an adventure!
