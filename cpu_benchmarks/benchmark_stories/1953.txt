Jill was a yoga master. She was very wise and knew lots of different poses. Every day, she would go to a special place and practice her yoga moves.
One day, while she was doing her yoga, an ignorant man came and tried to pull her away. He shouted at her that she should stop doing silly poses. Jill was very angry and used her yoga moves to show him a lesson.
She jumped up in the air and did a handstand. She stretched her legs out until they were super strong. Jill then popped back up and glared at the man. He had no idea how to react, so he ran away.
Jill smiled and kept practicing her yogas. She was happy to teach the ignorant man a lesson.
