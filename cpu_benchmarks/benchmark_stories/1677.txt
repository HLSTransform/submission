Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to run and play in the park. One day, she found a yellow ball on the ground. She picked it up and started to play with it.
Suddenly, a boy came over and said, "That's my ball! Give it back!" Lily didn't want to give it back, but she also didn't want to make the boy sad. So, she said, "I can share the ball with you. We can play together."
The boy smiled and said, "Okay, let's play catch!" Lily threw the ball to the boy, but he missed and it went flying into a tree. The boy started to cry. Lily felt bad and said, "Don't worry, I'll support you. We can get the ball down together." They both put their palms on the tree and pushed until the ball fell down. The boy was happy again and they continued to play together.
