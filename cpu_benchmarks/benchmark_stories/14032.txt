Once upon a time, there was a bear named Bob. Bob was big and loved to eat honey. One day, he went to the woods to find some honey. He saw a bee flying around and decided to follow it.
The bee led Bob to an icy cave. Bob was a little scared, but he wanted the honey. So, he took a deep breath and entered the cave. Inside, he found a big jar of honey. Bob was so happy and started to eat the honey.
But, the icy cave was not safe. The ice on the walls started to break and fall. Bob was scared and tried to run away. But, he was too late. The ice fell on him and he could not move. The honey was not worth it.
