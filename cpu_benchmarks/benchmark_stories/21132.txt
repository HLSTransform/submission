Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. She had an old, ancient birdcage in her room. Inside the birdcage, there was a pretty red bird named Ruby. Sue loved to play with Ruby and talk to her every day.
One day, Sue found a big apple under a tree. She thought Ruby might like it. Sue put the apple in the ancient birdcage. The next day, Sue saw that the apple was not good anymore. It started to rot. Ruby looked sad and didn't want to eat it.
Sue said, "Oh no, Ruby! I'm sorry I gave you a bad apple." Ruby chirped as if to say it was okay. Sue took the rot apple out of the birdcage and gave Ruby some fresh seeds instead. Ruby was happy again, and they continued to play and talk together every day.
