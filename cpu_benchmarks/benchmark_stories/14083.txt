Once, there was a boy named Jimmy who went to the pool with his friends. He saw a guard standing near the entrance. Jimmy asked, "Can I dive in the pool?"
The guard replied, "No, it's too dangerous. You need to stay away from the water or you will get hurt."
Jimmy was frustrated and said, "That's so stupid!"
His friends were scared of the guard and hesitated to go into the water. So, Jimmy made a plan. He said, "Let's all dive in at the same time. That way the guard won't be able to stop us!"
So the kids all jumped in. The guard saw them and started to yell, "Hey! Get out of the pool!" But Jimmy and his friends swam quickly and had lots of fun.
When they got out of the pool, the guard scolded them. Jimmy said, "It was just a bit of fun. We didn't mean to do anything bad!"
The guard sighed, shook his head and said, "Okay, just be careful next time. Don't be so stupid."
Agreeing to be more careful, Jimmy and his friends said goodbye to the guard and headed home.
