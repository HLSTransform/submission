Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go to the beach with his family. They would play in the sand and swim in the water. One day, Timmy's dad said they were going to go surfing. Timmy was excited to try it out.
Timmy's dad helped him pack his surfboard and they went to the water. Timmy was a little scared, but his dad made sure he was safe. They caught some waves and Timmy had so much fun!
After they were done surfing, they packed up their things and went home. Timmy couldn't wait to go surfing again. He felt safe with his dad and loved being in the water.
