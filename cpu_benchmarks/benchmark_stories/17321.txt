Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty pink purse that she loved to carry around with her everywhere she went. One day, Lily saw a poor man sitting on the street corner. 
She went up to him and said, "Hi, what's your name?" The man replied, "My name is Tom." Lily asked him, "Why are you sitting here?" Tom said, "I don't have a home to go to." 
Lily felt sad for Tom and decided to talk to her mom about it. She asked her mom if they could give Tom some food and a place to stay. Her mom agreed and they brought Tom to their house. 
Lily gave Tom some toys to play with and they talked about their favorite colors. Tom was grateful for Lily's kindness and thanked her for her help. From that day on, Lily and Tom became good friends and Lily always carried her pretty pink purse with her when they went on adventures together.
