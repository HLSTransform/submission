Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with blocks and dolls. One day, they notice a big map on the wall. The map has many colors and shapes.
"What is that?" Lily asks.
"That is a map," Ben says. "It shows different places in the world."
"Wow, that is cool," Lily says. "What are those big shapes?"
"Those are nations," Ben says. "Nations are places where many people live. They have names and flags and languages."
"Can we go to a different nation?" Lily asks.
"Maybe someday," Ben says. "But we live in a regular nation. It is called Canada. It is big and nice and has a red and white flag."
"I like Canada," Lily says. "But I also want to see other nations. They look fun and different."
"Me too," Ben says. "Maybe we can learn more about them. We can ask our teacher or our parents or look at books."
"Okay," Lily says. "Let's do that. But first, let's play some more with our blocks and dolls."
