Once upon a time, in a regular house, there lived a little girl named Lucy. Lucy loved to play with her toys, eat ice cream, and gain new friends. One sunny day, Lucy went outside to play in her yard.
As she played, she saw a new boy next door. The boy looked sad and lonely. Lucy wanted to make him feel better, so she walked up to him with a big smile on her face. She said, "Hi! I'm Lucy. Do you want to play with me?"
The boy's face lit up, and he smiled back at Lucy. His name was Tom. They played all day long, having so much fun together. They played with balls, dolls, and even made a fort. Lucy and Tom became best friends.
From that day on, Lucy and Tom played together every day. They shared many smiles and laughs. And Lucy was so happy that she could gain a new friend just by sharing her smile.
