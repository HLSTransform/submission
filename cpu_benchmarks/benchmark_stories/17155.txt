Once upon a time, there was a little bunny. The bunny liked to hop and play in the grass. One day, the bunny found a big squash. It was so big that the bunny could not carry it. The bunny felt helpless and did not know what to do.
Then, a kind farmer came by and saw the bunny. The farmer let the bunny know that he could help. The farmer picked up the squash and gave it to the bunny. The bunny was so happy and grateful for the farmer's help.
From that day on, the bunny and the farmer became good friends. They would play and have fun in the grass together. And whenever the bunny found a big squash, the farmer would always be there to help.
