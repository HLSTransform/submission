Once upon a time, there was a fancy princess named Lily. She had a shiny sword that she loved to play with. One day, she decided to run through the castle gardens with her sword in hand. As she ran, she pretended to be a brave knight on a mission to save the kingdom. 
Suddenly, she heard a loud noise coming from the nearby forest. It was a scary dragon! Princess Lily knew she had to be brave and fight the dragon with her sword. She ran towards the forest, her sword at the ready. 
When she found the dragon, she swung her sword with all her might. The dragon was no match for her fancy sword and soon ran away. Princess Lily was very proud of herself for being so brave and saving the kingdom from danger. From that day on, she knew that she could do anything she set her mind to.
