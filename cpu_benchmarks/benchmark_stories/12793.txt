Once upon a time there was a cute little girl. Her name was Daisy and she was three years old. Daisy loved animals and they always made her happy.
One day, Daisy went outside and found an adorable little puppy lying on the grass. She was so excited and wanted to take the puppy home.
Daisy went to her mom and said, "Mommy, please can I bring the puppy home?" Her mom said, "Yes, of course you can, sweetheart." 
Daisy's mom took Daisy and the puppy to the pet shop. She got Daisy a collar, leash and an alarm. Daisy hugged her mom and said, "Thank you, Mommy!"
They came home, and Daisy put the collar on the puppy. Then, she unlocked the alarm. The puppy ran around the yard, jumping and playing. Daisy laughed and smiled as she watched him. 
Daisy was so happy to have her very own adorable puppy. She laughed and hugged her puppy and they were best friends forever. 
The end.
