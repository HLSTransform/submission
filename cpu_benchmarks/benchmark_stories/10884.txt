Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted a motorcycle. He asked his mom to buy him one, but she said it was too expensive. So, the boy decided to make his own motorcycle. He used some old parts and put them together. It was not very good, but it was cheap.
One day, the boy went for a ride on his motorcycle. He was very happy, but then he saw some other boys with their big and shiny motorcycles. They laughed at the boy and said his motorcycle was ugly and slow. The boy felt sad and angry. He wanted to show them that his motorcycle was good too.
So, the boy tried to go faster and faster, but his motorcycle was not strong enough. Suddenly, it broke and the boy fell off. He hurt himself and his motorcycle was ruined. The other boys laughed even more and the boy felt very embarrassed. From that day on, he never wanted to ride a motorcycle again.
