Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Nola. She loved to explore the hidden parts of the world. One day, she told her mom, “I want to go on a safari!”
Her mom smiled and said, “Now, Nola, safaris can be dangerous. Promise me you won’t leave my sight, okay?”
Nola promised. So, her mom took her to the safari and they looked at the hidden animals. Nola wanted to get closer and she started to walk away from her mom.
Her mom called, “Nola, hold on… don’t leave me!”
Nola listened and remembered her promise. She came back and held onto her mom’s hand.
The moral of the story is to listen to your parents and always stay near them. No matter how excited you are or how much you want to explore, remember that safety comes first!
