One day, a shoe appeared in the garden. It was bright and colourful. The shoe was very exciting, and made the children feel enthusiastic. 
The children looked around the garden to see if they could find the shoe's owner. After looking for a while, they still couldn't find anyone. 
The children took the shoe in the house and talked about what could have happened. They wondered if the shoe belonged to a giant, a fairy or even a unicorn! 
Just then, an enthusiastic little girl appeared at the door. She had been looking for her lost shoe. The children were so excited to give it back to her. 
The little girl said thank you and put on the shoe. She was now ready to go on her grand adventure!
