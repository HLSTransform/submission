Sara and Ben are hungry. They want to eat pasta for lunch. Mom is cooking pasta in a big pot. She says, "Pasta will be ready soon. You can help me set the table."
Sara and Ben run to the kitchen. They get plates, forks, spoons, and napkins. They put them on the table. They are happy. They love pasta.
Mom says, "Pasta is done. Be careful, it is hot. Let me serve you some." She puts pasta on their plates. She adds cheese and sauce. She says, "Enjoy your lunch."
Sara and Ben start to eat. They say, "Mmm, this is yummy. Thank you, Mom." They eat fast. They are very hungry.
Mom eats slow. She says, "I'm glad you like it. But don't eat too fast. You might get a tummy ache."
Sara and Ben say, "OK, Mom. We will eat slow." But they don't. They eat fast. They want to end their lunch. They want to play outside. They finish their pasta. They say, "We are done. Can we go outside now?"
Mom says, "Yes, you can. But first, clear your plates and wash your hands." She smiles. She says, "You are good helpers. I love you."
Sara and Ben say, "We love you too, Mom." They clear their plates and wash their hands. They run outside. They play with their ball. They are happy. They had a good lunch.
