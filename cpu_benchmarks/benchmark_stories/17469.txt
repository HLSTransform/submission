Lily liked to skip. She skipped in the park, she skipped in the school, she skipped in her home. She skipped with her friends, she skipped with her toys, she skipped with her dog. She was happy when she skipped.
One day, Lily went to a new place with her mom. It was a big place with many people and many things. Lily saw books, clothes, food, and toys. She wanted to skip and see everything. But her mom said, "No, Lily, you have to stay with me. This place is not for skipping. It is for shopping."
Lily felt uncomfortable. She did not like shopping. She did not like the noise, the smell, and the crowd. She wanted to skip and have fun. She saw a big space in the middle of the place. It looked like a good place to skip. She said to her mom, "Mom, can I skip there? Please, please, please?"
Her mom looked at the space. She saw that it was a fountain. It had water and lights and coins. She said, "No, Lily, you cannot skip there. That is not a place for skipping. That is a place for wishing. People throw coins and make wishes. It is not safe to skip there. You might fall or get wet or lose your shoes."
Lily felt sad. She did not understand why she could not skip there. She thought it looked like a fun place to skip. She said, "But mom, I wish I could skip there. Can I make a wish and skip there?"
Her mom smiled. She said, "Lily, you are a very clever girl. But you have to listen to me. You can make a wish, but you cannot skip there. How about we make a wish together and then we go to another place where you can skip?"
Lily nodded. She liked that idea. She said, "Okay, mom, let's make a wish. What do you wish for?"
Her mom said, "I wish for you to be happy and healthy and smart. What do you wish for?"
Lily said, "I wish for the same. And I wish for a place to skip."
They held hands and threw coins into the fountain. They watched the water and the lights and the coins. They smiled and hugged. Then they left the place and went to a park. There, Lily skipped and skipped and skipped. She was happy again.
