Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a black cat named Mittens. Mittens was very friendly and loved to play with Timmy. One day, Timmy and Mittens were playing in the yard when Mittens saw a bird. Mittens chased the bird and accidentally broke a flower pot. 
Timmy's mommy saw the broken pot and asked Timmy what happened. Timmy felt guilty and told his mommy that Mittens broke it. His mommy was very upset and sighed. She told Timmy that he needed to take better care of his things and his cat. 
Later that day, Timmy and Mittens were playing in the street when a car came by. Mittens ran after the car and got hit. Timmy was very sad and cried. He knew he should have taken better care of Mittens. In the end, Timmy learned a valuable lesson about taking care of his things and his pets.
