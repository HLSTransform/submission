Once there was a little girl named Sarah who was very lucky. One day, Sarah was outside playing when a big and magical grape appeared in the sky. It grew and grew until it became as big as a house! All the kids on the block were amazed and wanted to take a closer look. 
So Sarah decided to take the brave step and climb the big grape. When she made it to the top, Sarah discovered that the grape was filled with lots and lots of magical candies! She was so surprised and excited, she quickly started eating them. 
The other kids were left behind and watched on as Sarah appeared to them as a lucky girl! From then on, Sarah always brought her friends over to share in her special luck. They laughed and snacked on the magical candies from the giant grape and shared in all the wonderful surprises it brought them.
