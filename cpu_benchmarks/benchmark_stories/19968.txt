Tim and Lily are friends. They like to play with toys and books. They have a meeting every day after lunch. They speak about what they did and what they want to do.
One day, Tim and Lily have a meeting in Tim's room. Tim's room is very tidy. He puts his toys and books in the right places. He does not like mess. Lily's room is not tidy. She leaves her toys and books everywhere. She does not care about mess.
Tim and Lily speak about their toys and books. Tim shows Lily his new car. He says, "This is my new car. It is red and fast. Do you like it?" Lily says, "Yes, I like it. Can I play with it?" Tim says, "No, you cannot. It is mine. You have to ask me first." Lily says, "But I am your friend. Friends share." Tim says, "No, they do not. This is my room and my car. You have to do what I say."
Lily gets angry. She does not like Tim's words. She grabs the car from Tim's hand. She says, "I want to play with it. You are mean." Tim gets angry too. He tries to get the car back. He says, "Give it back. You are rude." They pull and push. They shout and cry.
The car breaks. It falls on the floor. It makes a loud noise. Tim and Lily stop. They look at the car. It is broken. They cannot play with it. They are sad. They are sorry.
Tim's mom hears the noise. She comes to Tim's room. She sees the mess. She sees the broken car. She sees Tim and Lily. She is not happy. She says, "What happened here? Who broke the car? Why are you making so much noise?" Tim and Lily do not speak. They are afraid. They are in trouble. They have a bad ending.
