Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Poppy. Poppy was very curious and loved to explore the world around her. One day she went to the beach. She looked around and saw an amazing rock formation. Poppy was eager to explore the rocks, but they were very heavy. She tried her very best to move them, but she was too tiny and weak. She said to herself, "There must be an easier way."
Then she had a brilliant idea â€“ she decided to weigh the rocks. She grabbed a bucket and filled it with water before carefully placing some rocks in it. She soon realized that the rocks were heavier than she thought.
Just then, her mom came to the beach. She saw the determination on Poppy's face and asked what she was doing. Poppy explained her idea to her mom. Her mom thought it was amazing and smiled. 
The moral of the story is that if you have an idea and put in enough effort, no matter how small you may be, you can succeed.
