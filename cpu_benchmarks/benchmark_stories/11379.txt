Once upon a time, there was a good boy named Jack who lived in a big, tall house in the forest. One day, he went for a walk in the woods with his mom. 
As they walked, they heard a loud noise. "Oh no!" Jack's mom shouted. "It sounds like a wolf!" 
Jack was scared, so he hid behind his mom. The wolf came running through the trees and saw the two of them. 
"Please don't be scared!" Jack's mom said in a soft voice. "I'll protect you". She held out her hands and shouted at the wolf. "Go away!"
The wolf heard her and ran away. Jack and his mom cheered. "You did it!" said Jack.
Then Jack smiled. He felt so good. He had faced the wolf and he was no longer scared. From that day on, Jack would always remember to be brave!
