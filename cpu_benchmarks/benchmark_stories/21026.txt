Carly was a young girl. She was three years old. She had a pale dress and wanted to go outside.
So she went outside and found a big pile of mud. She was so excited. She squished her fingers in the mud and smiled.
Carly's mom came outside and saw what she was doing. She said, "Carly, that muddy dress is not good. We have to cover it with something else."
Carly said, "Do I have to wear something else today? Can't I just wear this?"
Carly's mom smiled and said, "Sometimes it's important to cover up in the right way. Let's get something else for you to wear today."
So Carly put on a nice, pale dress. She twirled around and said, "This dress is perfect!"
Carly's mom nodded and said, "Yes, that looks great. Now you're all covered up!"
