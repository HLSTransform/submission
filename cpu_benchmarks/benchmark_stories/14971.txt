Joe was very excited. He had been waiting for the day to come for such a long time. His birthday had finally arrived!
His mommy said, "Let's unpack the birthday presents!" Joe jumped out of bed and raced to the room with the presents.
Joe saw one particularly large present. He couldn't believe what was inside! It was an adventurous toy!
Joe said, "Wow, mommy! What is it?"
Mommy smiled and said, "It's a word building game. You can go on all sorts of amazing adventures while you put the words together."
Joe clapped his hands and said, "Thank you mommy! I can't wait to unpack it and start playing!"
Joe and mommy unpacked the game and started playing. Joe had so much fun putting the words together and going on all sorts of adventurous adventures.
When the sun went down and it was time for bed, Joe was so excited for the next day. He couldn't wait to start playing the word building game again!
