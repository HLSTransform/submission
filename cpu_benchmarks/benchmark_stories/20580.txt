Once upon a time there was a girl called Lilia. She knew the loveliest things. One day she went out in her garden and she saw a string. It was so long and sparkly! She felt so dizzy when she looked at it.
She wanted to pick it up, so she bent down and took it in her hands. She knew that was special. She kept it in her pocket and ran back inside.
Later she decided to make a pretty kite with it. She asked her mom for some paper, wood and other things to make it. Her mom helped her and soon enough she had the most beautiful kite.
She ran back out in her garden and knew that the string would be perfect for it. Together with her mom she put it on and the kite started flying high in the sky. Lilia was so happy that she knew the loveliest things.
