Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Bun-Bun. Bun-Bun loved to hop around and play with his friends. One day, Bun-Bun's mommy told him they had to hurry to get to the carrot patch before all the yummy carrots were gone.
Bun-Bun was so excited to eat the carrots that he started to feel anxious. He didn't want to miss out on the delicious carrots. As they were hopping along, Bun-Bun accidentally bumped his lip on a rock. Ouch!
But Bun-Bun didn't let his lip stop him from hurrying to the carrot patch. He kept hopping and finally, they made it just in time. Bun-Bun and his mommy enjoyed the tasty carrots together, and Bun-Bun forgot all about his sore lip. The end.
