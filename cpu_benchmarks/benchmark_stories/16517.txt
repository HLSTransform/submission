Once upon a time, there was a mouse named Mickey. Mickey loved cheese very much. One day, he saw a big piece of cheese on the table. He wanted to eat it, but it was too high for him to reach. 
Mickey asked his friend, a cat named Tom, if he could help. Tom was feeling generous and said, "Sure, I'll help you get the cheese." Tom picked up Mickey and put him on the table. 
Mickey was so happy to finally get the cheese. He took a big bite and smiled. But then, he saw Tom frown. "Uh oh," said Tom. "I think I hear the owner coming." 
Mickey quickly ate as much cheese as he could, but it was too late. The owner caught them and was very angry. Tom ran away, but Mickey was too slow. The owner caught him and put him outside. Mickey was sad and wished he had never tried to get the cheese.
