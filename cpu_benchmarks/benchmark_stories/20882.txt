Once upon a time there was a big bossy monster. He was mean and he always wanted to be in charge. Every day he would make everyone perform silly jobs. Everyone was scared of him.
One day a small monster came to visit. He was nice and very brave. He offered to help with the jobs. He didn't even want the bossy monster to tell him what to do. He just wanted to help out of the love in his heart.
The bossy monster didn't like this at all. He was mad that someone wasn't scared of him. He was even madder that someone was being so nice. The bossy monster got so angry that he chased the small monster away and nobody ever saw him again. 
The end.
