Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big hill with many trees. They want to climb the hill and see what is on the other side. They find a long stick on the ground. They use the stick to help them walk up the hill.
They reach the top of the hill and see a pond. The pond has many ducks and fish. Lily and Ben are happy. They want to feed the ducks and fish. They break the long stick into two pieces. They use the pieces to poke the water and make ripples.
The ducks and fish come closer to see what is making the ripples. Lily and Ben throw some bread crumbs into the water. The ducks and fish eat the bread crumbs. Lily and Ben laugh and clap. They enjoy watching the ducks and fish.
But then, a big frog jumps out of the water. The frog lands on the long stick that Lily is holding. Lily is scared. She drops the stick and screams. The frog croaks and hops away. Ben picks up the stick and chases the frog. He wants to catch the frog and make it his pet.
Lily and Ben have fun playing with the stick, the pond, and the frog. They forget about the time. They hear their mom calling them. They run back to their mom. They tell her about their adventure. Their mom smiles and hugs them. She is glad they had fun. She takes them home for a snack and a nap.
