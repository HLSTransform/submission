Anna liked to play doctor with her toys. She had a white coat, a stethoscope, and a big book of pictures. She also had a pink x-ray machine that made funny noises. She pretended to check her toys for broken bones and give them bandages.
One day, she asked her brother Ben to join her game. Ben was older and liked to play with cars and robots. He said no, he was too busy. Anna felt sad. She wanted to show him her x-ray machine and how it worked. She thought maybe he would like it if he saw it.
She had an idea. She waited until Ben left his room to get a snack. She sneaked in and took his favorite robot. She ran back to her room and put it in her x-ray machine. She turned it on and waited for the picture to come out.
But something went wrong. The x-ray machine made a loud beep and a flash. Smoke came out of it. Anna was scared. She took out the robot and saw that it was melted and black. She had broken it. She knew Ben would be very angry.
She heard Ben coming back. She hid the robot under her bed and pretended to read her book. Ben came in and looked for his robot. He asked Anna if she had seen it. Anna said no, she did not. She hoped he would not find it. She felt very bad. She wished she had not taken his robot. She wished she had asked him nicely to join her game. She wished she had a different x-ray machine. A pink one.
