Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and hang his clothes on the hanger. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean his room. Timmy didn't want to clean his room, so he decided to play with his toys instead.
While playing, Timmy accidentally knocked over a lamp and it fell on his clothes. The lamp was hot and it started to burn Timmy's favorite shirt. Timmy was sad because he loved that shirt. He tried to put out the fire, but it was too late. The shirt was ruined.
Timmy's mom came in and saw what had happened. She was upset because Timmy didn't clean his room and now his shirt was burned. She told Timmy that he needed to start cleaning up his room and stop playing with his toys. Timmy felt disgusting because he knew he made a mistake. From that day on, Timmy learned to clean up after himself and be more careful with his toys.
