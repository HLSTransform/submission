Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, Lily went to the top of a hill to fly her kite. The wind was cool and perfect for flying her kite.
Suddenly, Lily saw a boy running up the hill. He looked sad. "What's wrong?" Lily asked. "I lost my toy car," the boy said. "I can help you find it," Lily said with a smile.
They searched and searched, but they couldn't find the toy car. "I'm sorry we couldn't find it," Lily said. "It's okay," the boy said. "Thank you for trying to help me." Lily smiled and said, "No problem. Friends always help each other. Now let's go shut down our kites and go home." 
The moral of the story is that it's important to help others and be a good friend.
