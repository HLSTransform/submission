Once upon a time, in a small garden, there lived a little ant. The ant liked to gather food for his family. Every day, he went out to find tasty things to eat.
One day, the ant found a big, dull rock. He thought it was food, but it was not. He tried to gather the rock, but it was too heavy. The ant felt sad.
Then, a friendly bug came to help. Together, they pushed the dull rock away. They found yummy food under the rock. The ant and the bug gathered the food and took it to their families. They were very happy.
