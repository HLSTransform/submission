Ben and Lily are twins. They like to play with their toys in the living room. One day, they find a big box in the corner. They wonder what is inside.
"Let's open it!" Ben says. He tries to lift the box, but it is too heavy. He grunts and drops it.
"Ow! That hurt!" Lily says. The box landed on her foot. She starts to cry.
"Sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to hurt you." Ben says. He hugs his sister.
"Maybe we can open it together." Lily says. She wipes her tears. "We can each hold one side and pull."
"OK, let's try." Ben says. They decide to work as a team. They each grab one side of the box and pull hard. The box moves a little bit.
"Yay! We did it!" Ben and Lily say. They are happy. They pull the box some more until they can see what is inside.
"It's a teddy bear!" Lily says. She sees a big, fluffy teddy bear in the box. She loves teddy bears.
"It's a truck!" Ben says. He sees a shiny, red truck in the box. He loves trucks.
"Wow! These are for us!" Ben and Lily say. They are excited. They thank their mom and dad for the surprise. They take out their new toys and play with them. They share and have fun. They are glad they decided to open the box together.
