Once upon a time there was a little girl. She had an uncle who was very special. He was always so colorful and made her smile.
One day, uncle came to visit the little girl. He had a surprise. He told her he was going to replace her old toy with a new one! The little girl was very excited.
Uncle showed her the new toy. It was even more colorful than the old one. He showed her how it worked, and soon she was playing with it. 
The little girl was so happy. She thanked her uncle for the new toy. She knew that it was a special gift from him and it would make her smile for many years to come.
