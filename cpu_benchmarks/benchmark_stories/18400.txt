Once upon a time, there was a frog named Hoppy. Hoppy lived in a big pond with his friends. The pond was very wide and had lots of lily pads.
One day, Hoppy and his friends decided to have a race. They all lined up on a big lily pad and said, "Ready, set, go!" Hoppy hopped as fast as he could and he won the race! "I won, I won!" he shouted happily.
Later that day, Hoppy was sitting on a lily pad when he saw a butterfly flying by. "Wow, you're so pretty!" he said to the butterfly. "Thank you," replied the butterfly. "Do you want to play with me?" asked Hoppy. "Sure, let's play tag!" said the butterfly.
Hoppy and the butterfly played tag in the wide pond until it was time for the butterfly to go home. "Thanks for playing with me," said Hoppy. "You're welcome," said the butterfly. "Let's play again soon!" And with that, the butterfly flew away, leaving Hoppy feeling very happy.
