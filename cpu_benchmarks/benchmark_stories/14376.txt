Once upon a time, there was a happy boy named Tim. Tim loved to eat jam on his toast every morning. One day, Tim's mom made him a special breakfast and displayed it on the table. Tim was so excited to see his favorite jam there. He ate his toast and felt very calm and happy. From that day on, Tim knew that his mom loved him very much. The end.
