Once upon a time, there was a big elephant. He had huge ears that he liked to wiggle. One day, he decided to make a cake. He got all the ingredients and mixed them up. He put the cake in the oven and waited patiently. When the cake was done, he shared it with all his animal friends. They loved it so much that they asked him to make another one soon. The elephant was happy to make more cakes for his friends.
