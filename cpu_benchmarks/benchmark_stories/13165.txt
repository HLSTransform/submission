Once there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was very creative. He liked to use his imagination and come up with interesting things. One day Tom got very worried because he had lost his towel. He searched high and low, but couldn't seem to find it. He was so worried and tried not to cry.
Suddenly Tom had a creative idea. He decided he could make a new one. He went to the kitchen and got a cloth. He called his mom for help and together they cut out the cloth into the shape of a towel. They added some paint, buttons and other decorations to make it even more creative.
Tom was so happy when his mom was finished. Now he had a special, brand new towel! He was no longer worried and he was so proud of his creation. He never forgot how he solved his problem with his own creativity.
