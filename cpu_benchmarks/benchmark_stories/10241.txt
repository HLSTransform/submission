Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She liked to play outside in her garden. One day, while she was playing, she saw a butterfly. She tried to catch it, but it flew away. 
Lily's mom came outside and asked her why she looked sad. Lily said she wanted to catch the butterfly, but it flew away. Her mom told her not to be frightened and that she would help her catch it. 
So, they both went to the garden and looked for the butterfly. Suddenly, the butterfly landed on Lily's mom's blouse. Lily was so happy and caught the butterfly gently in her hands. She was so excited and showed it to her mom. Her mom was proud of her for catching the butterfly. From that day on, Lily loved catching butterflies in her garden.
