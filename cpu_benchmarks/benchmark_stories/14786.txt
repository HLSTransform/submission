Tom and Sue are twins. They like to play in the yard. One day, they see a fire in the woods. They want to go and see it.
"Fire is pretty," Tom says. "Let's go and look."
"No, Tom," Sue says. "Fire is hot and bad. It can hurt us. We should stay away."
But Tom does not listen. He runs to the fire. Sue follows him. She is scared.
They get close to the fire. The fire is big and loud. It makes smoke and sparks. Tom and Sue feel hot and scared. They want to go back.
"Help, help!" Tom cries. "The fire is too big!"
Sue sees a gentle dog. The dog is brown and white. It has a red collar. The dog barks at them. It wants to help.
"Come, come!" the dog says. "Follow me!"
The dog shows them a way out. It is a small hole under a fence. Tom and Sue crawl under the fence. They are safe.
"Thank you, thank you!" Tom and Sue say to the dog. "You are a good dog. You saved us."
The dog wags its tail. It is happy.
Tom and Sue hug the dog. They learn a lesson. They should not play with fire. They should listen to Sue. They should be careful and smart.
