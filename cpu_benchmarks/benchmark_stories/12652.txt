Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Mickey. Mickey loved to eat cheese, but one day he accidentally broke his favorite cheese plate. He was sad and didn't know what to do.
Mickey's friend, a kind rabbit named Rosie, saw him looking sad and asked him what was wrong. Mickey told her what happened and Rosie said, "Don't worry, I can help you repair it!"
Rosie took the broken cheese plate and used some glue to fix it. Mickey was so happy and grateful. He said, "Thank you so much, Rosie! You're the best friend ever!" 
Suddenly, a big, mean cat appeared and wanted to harm Mickey. But Rosie quickly stepped in and blocked the cat. The cat tried to attack, but Rosie was too strong and harmless. The cat finally gave up and ran away. Mickey was safe and sound, and he knew he had the best friend in the world.
