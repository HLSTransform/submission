Once upon a time, there was a small bird who loved to fly high in the sky. One day, the bird saw a big cage with a door that was not locked. The bird flew inside and started to play with the toys. But then, the door closed and the bird was trapped inside.
The bird was sad and scared. It tried to fly out, but the cage was too small. The bird remembered the history of its family, who had been trapped before. Suddenly, the bird saw a person coming to release it from the cage. The bird was so happy and flew away into the sky.
From then on, the bird never forgot about the history of its family and always made sure to check for open doors before flying inside.
