Once there was a girl named Lucy. She was playing in the park when she saw a bird. She was so excited and ran to it. She wanted to make it fly. 
Suddenly, a boy came along and started to tease her. "You can't make that bird fly!" he said. That made Lucy worry. She didn't know what to do.
But then, Lucy's mom came to help. She showed the boy a fast way to make the bird fly. They both made the bird flap its wings and it flew up high in the sky. 
Lucy was no longer worried. She was happy to see the bird fly so fast. She and the boy waved goodbye as the bird flew away in the sky.
