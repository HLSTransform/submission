Once upon a time there were two friends, John and Sarah. They were very happy together. 
One day they decided to visit a special place. 
They arrived at a place with a big microphone. 
Sarah was very excited, but John was sad and didn't want to go near the microphone. 
John told Sarah, 'I am scared of the microphone.'
Sarah put her arm around him and said, 'It's ok, let's visit the microphone together.' 
John smiled, and the two of them held hands and visited the microphone. 
Suddenly the microphone was making lots of noise and it made John very happy. 
John and Sarah left the place with big smiles on their faces. 
John was no longer sad and he thanked Sarah for helping him face his fears. 
They said goodbye, but promised to visit the microphone again soon.
