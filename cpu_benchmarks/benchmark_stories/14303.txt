Once upon a time there were two friends, Chloe and Thomas. On this day they went shopping together in the city. Chloe wanted to buy wine and Thomas wanted to help her find the perfect one. Chloe looked around and found some expensive wine and asked Thomas, "Do you think this wine is good?" 
Thomas said, "I think this wine is too expensive. Why don't we go look for something else?" So they went and looked around for some cheaper wine to buy. 
Chloe found a bottle of wine that she liked, but it was too cluttered on the shelves and hard to find the price of it. She said to Thomas, "Let's organize this shelf so we can find the price of this wine. Can you help me?" 
Thomas agreed and together, they organized the shelf. As they looked for the price, Chloe found the wine she wanted, but it was also expensive. She said sadly, "I guess I won't be able to buy this wine today".
Thomas smiled and said, "It's ok, we can always come back tomorrow and keep looking." Chloe was happy that Thomas helped her organize the shelf and they both agreed to come back the next day and continue their search.
