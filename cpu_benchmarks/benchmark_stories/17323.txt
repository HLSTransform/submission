Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mommy. At the park, she saw a big balloon. "Wow, that's impressive!" she said.
Suddenly, a man came and blew up the balloon with gas. "Look, mommy! The man is blowing up the balloon with gas," Lily said. 
The man saw Lily and waved at her. "Hi there, little one!" he said. 
Lily smiled and waved back. "Hi!" she said. 
After the man finished blowing up the balloon, he gave it to Lily. "Here you go, little one. Enjoy the balloon!" he said. 
Lily was so happy and she held the balloon tightly as she walked around the park with her mommy. It was a wonderful day.
