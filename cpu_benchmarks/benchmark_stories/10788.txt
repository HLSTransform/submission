Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite plastic toy, a small blue bird, that she loved to hold. She took her toy bird with her everywhere she went.
One day, Lily took her toy bird to the park. She played on the swings, and she was very patient, waiting for her turn. When it was finally her turn, she held her toy bird tightly and swung high up into the sky. The toy bird seemed to be flying, and Lily was so happy.
After playing at the park, Lily went home with her mom. She held her plastic toy bird all the way back, and she knew that they would have many more fun days together. And from that day on, Lily and her toy bird were always patient and kind to others, sharing their joy with everyone they met.
