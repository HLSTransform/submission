Once upon a time, there was a cool spider. She had made a cobweb in the garden. One day, she saw a little boy playing outside. She scuttled over and quietly said "Hello." The boy smiled and said "Hi" back. Then, he asked if he could hug the spider. She was so surprised and said, "Yes". So the little boy gave her a big squishy hug. She felt very happy, so she ran around the garden making cobwebs. Whenever the little boy came outside to play, she would scuttle to him and he would give her a big hug. They became best friends.
