Once upon a time, there was a lovely little girl named Lily. She had a pet cat named Olive. Lily loved to play with Olive and follow her around the house. Olive was always so soft and cuddly, and Lily loved to pet her.
One day, Lily and Olive went outside to play in the garden. Lily decided to play a game of follow the leader. She would lead and Olive would follow. Lily ran around the garden and Olive chased after her. They had so much fun playing together.
As the sun began to set, Lily picked up Olive and carried her back inside. She gave Olive a big hug and said, "You're my best friend, Olive. I love you." Olive purred and snuggled up to Lily. They both fell asleep, dreaming of all the fun they would have together the next day.
