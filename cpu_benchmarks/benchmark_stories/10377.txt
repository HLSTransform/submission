Lily was a wealthy girl who lived in a big house with many toys. She liked to play with her dolls and dress them in pretty clothes. One day, she decided to have a tea party with her dolls in the living room. She brought a tray with cups and plates and cookies from the kitchen.
She saw a big armchair near the window that looked very cozy. She wanted to sit there with her dolls and have tea. But the armchair was too heavy for her to move. She tried to push it and pull it, but it did not budge. She felt sad and frustrated.
She went to find her daddy, who was working in his office. She knocked on the door and said, "Daddy, can you help me? I want to move the armchair to the window, but it is too heavy for me."
Her daddy smiled and put down his papers. He followed her to the living room and saw the armchair and the tray. He said, "You want to have a tea party with your dolls? That sounds like fun. I can help you move the armchair, but you have to help me too."
He lifted one side of the armchair and asked Lily to lift the other side. Lily put her hands under the armchair and tried to lift it. It was still heavy, but with her daddy's help, she could lift it a little bit. Together, they moved the armchair to the window and placed it gently on the floor.
Lily was very happy and thanked her daddy. She arranged her dolls on the armchair and gave them cups and plates and cookies. She invited her daddy to join her tea party. He said, "Thank you, Lily. You are very kind and strong. I'm proud of you."
They sat on the armchair and had a lovely tea party. They talked and laughed and enjoyed the cookies. Lily felt very happy and loved. She hugged her daddy and said, "I love you, daddy. You are the best."
The end.
