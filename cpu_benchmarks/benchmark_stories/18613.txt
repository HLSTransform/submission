Once upon a time, there was a little duck. The duck lived near a stream. Every day, the duck would go for a swim in the stream. One day, the duck saw a fish struggling in the stream. The duck wanted to help the fish, but it was too hard. The duck tried and tried, but couldn't help the fish.
As the duck was resting, a nosy rabbit came by. The rabbit saw the duck and asked, "What's wrong?" The duck told the rabbit about the fish struggling in the stream. The rabbit said, "I can help!" The rabbit hopped into the stream and was able to help the fish. The duck and the rabbit became friends and went on many adventures together.
