Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her colorful toys and watch aeroplanes fly in the sky.
One day, Lily and her mom went to the park. While they were playing, Lily saw a bird with a broken wing. She felt sad and asked her mom, "Mommy, can we help the bird?" Her mom replied, "Of course, we can take the bird to the animal doctor."
As they were walking to the animal doctor, Lily saw a man flying a colorful kite. She said, "Look mommy, the kite is flying high like an aeroplane!" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, it is."
When they arrived at the animal doctor, he fixed the bird's wing. Lily was happy that the bird could fly again. Her mom said, "Lily, you cared for the bird and helped it. That was very kind of you." Lily smiled and felt proud of herself.
