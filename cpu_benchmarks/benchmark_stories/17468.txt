Lila and Tom are playing in the kitchen. They see a big knife on the table. It is shiny and has a long blade.
"Look, a knife!" Tom says. "I want to touch it."
"No, Tom, don't!" Lila says. "The knife is sharp. It can hurt you."
But Tom does not listen. He reaches for the knife and grabs it. He feels a pain in his finger. He drops the knife and cries.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tom says. "My finger is bleeding!"
Lila runs to him and hugs him. She sees a box of salt on the shelf. She remembers what her mom told her.
"Salt can help your finger," Lila says. "It can stop the blood and make it clean. Salt is useful."
She takes some salt and sprinkles it on Tom's finger. Tom winces, but then he feels better.
"Thank you, Lila," Tom says. "You are a good sister. And you are smart."
Lila smiles and kisses his cheek. She helps him wrap his finger with a bandage. They put the knife away and go to play with their toys. They are careful not to touch anything sharp again.
