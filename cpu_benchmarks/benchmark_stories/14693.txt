Mommy was very busy packing. She was getting ready for a big operation. She wanted to make sure everything was ready.
She packed a bag full of clothes and toys. She put a special blanket inside too. She packed a book and a special snack. 
Daddy helped her. He was very independent and knew how to do things all by himself. He put the bag by the front door so Mommy would remember it. 
Mommy and Daddy said goodbye. Mommy hugged him and gave him lots of kisses. Then it was time for her to go on her operation. 
Mommy was very brave and independent. Daddy was very proud of her. He knew she was strong enough to get through it.
