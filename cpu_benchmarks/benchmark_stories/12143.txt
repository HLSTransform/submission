Once there was a tiny little boy who loved to whistle. He would whistle to the birds as they flew in the sky and he would whistle when he was happy.
One day the little boy decided to go on an adventure. He went to the woods and whistled as he strolled along the path. 
Soon, he stumbled upon a waist-high river. He wanted to cross the river but he wasn't sure how he would do it. But then he remembered his whistle. 
He took a deep breath and started to whistle. The sound was loud and dependable. To his surprise, a tiny boat came floating in the river. He hopped in and the boat took him across the river. 
He arrived safely on the other side and whistled with joy. He had made it across the river with his trusty whistle!
