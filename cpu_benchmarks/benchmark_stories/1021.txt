Once upon a time there was a small boy named Tom. Tom was a very strong boy, but he did not know how to use his feet. He tried to use them to run and jump, but he kept falling over.
One day, Tom asked his mom to help him learn how to use his feet. His mom was so proud of him and taught him how to use his feet.
First, she showed him how to stand on his own two feet. Then she showed him how to walk. Tom practiced and practiced until he could walk without falling over. 
Next, Tom learned how to jump. He practiced and practiced until he could jump high and move his feet quickly. He was so happy and proud of himself!
Tom was so strong and he knew how to use his feet. Now he could run and jump and have so much fun playing with his friends. Everyone was amazed at how much Tom had learned!
