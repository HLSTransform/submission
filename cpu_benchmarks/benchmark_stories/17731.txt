Jill was walking through the park with her mom. It was a sunny day and they enjoyed the birds singing and the leaves rustling in the wind. As they walked, Jill noticed a bright pink butterfly flying nearby. She gazed at the beautiful creature as it fluttered around.
Her mom smiled at Jill and asked her a quiz. "What kind of butterfly is that, Jill?" Jill thought for a minute and then proudly declared that it was a monarch butterfly.
They continued walking, but then Jill spied something else. It was a turtle, sunning itself on a rock. Jill had never seen one before and she was so excited. She ran over and kneeled down beside the little reptile, being careful not to wake him. Jill gazed in wonder at the reptile's shell, marveling at its patterns and textures.
Suddenly, her mom shouted a warning. She had noticed a careless pet owner walking close by with their dog off the leash. Seeing the danger, Jill quickly leapt up and hurried away from the turtle before anything bad could happen. 
As they left the park, Jill smiled to herself. She had seen so many new and wonderful things. She was already looking forward to their next adventure.
