Once upon a time there was an enormous cartoon. This cartoon was so big that it was difficult to load into a truck. Every day a team of workers tried to load the cartoon into the truck but they just couldn't do it. One day, a little three year old offered to help. 
The team of workers thought this was impossible but the little three year old said she knew how. She tugged and pulled on the enormous cartoon until it finally fit in the truck. Everyone cheered and thanked the little three year old. She beamed with pride that she had been able to help. The little three year old was now an official member of the team!
