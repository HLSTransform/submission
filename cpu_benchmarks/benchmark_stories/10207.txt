Once upon a time, there was a noisy bird named Bobo. Bobo lived in a big tree with his family. They loved to sing and play all day long. Bobo's tree was near a patch of pretty flowers. The flowers were red, blue, and yellow.
One day, Bobo decided to fly to the patch of flowers. He wanted to find a nice flower for his mom. Bobo looked at all the pretty flowers. He saw a big red flower, a small blue flower, and a bright yellow flower. Bobo thought very hard about which flower to pick.
Finally, Bobo decided to pick the bright yellow flower. He knew his mom would love it. He flew back to the big tree with the flower in his beak. When Bobo gave the flower to his mom, she was very happy. They all sang and played together in their noisy, happy tree.
