Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very sad because she wanted to go to the market, but her mom said she couldn't go. She felt miserable.
Lily looked at her mom with sad eyes and said, "But mommy, why?" Her mom put her arm around Lily and said, "Sweetie, the market is too crowded right now. You might get lost."
Lily was so sad that she started to cry. Suddenly, her mom leaned in and said, "Wait, I know what will make you feel better."
She leaned in and gave Lily a big, warm kiss. Lily smiled through her tears and felt a little bit better.
Her mom said, "There, now you feel happy again, don't you?"
Lily nodded her head and said, "Yes, now I do!"
