Once upon a time there was a young girl, just 3 years old, who wanted something exciting to do. She saw a chalk, sitting on the ground outside her house, and she had an idea. She decided to enter the chalk and explore what it had to offer.
Inside the chalk was a whole new world with places to explore. She saw a mountain, some bushes, and a river with fish swimming in it. She was amazed and couldn't stop exploring. She spent her days walking around, jumping and flying over things, finding new and exciting things everywhere she went.
Eventually, the day came to an end, and the young girl had to leave the chalk. She felt sad and wished she could stay in the chalk forever. But, she knew she had to go home, even though she was sad.
The little girl gathered the chalk in her hands and slowly walked home. She'll always remember the days she got to enter the chalk and explore.
