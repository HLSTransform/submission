Sam and Sally were friends. They went to the park to play together. It was a sunny day and they wanted to have a snack. Sam had an expensive lunchbox with a lot of snacks inside. Sally had a snack too - it was a piece of apple. 
They had a lot of fun playing together and munching on their snacks. Sam saw that Sally's piece of apple was gone and asked if she wanted some of his snacks. Sally nodded and opened Sam's lunchbox. She was amazed that it had so many snacks. 
Sam was very nice and he cared about Sally. He gave her some of the snacks from his lunchbox. Sally was very grateful to Sam. They ate their snacks together and enjoyed the sunny day.
