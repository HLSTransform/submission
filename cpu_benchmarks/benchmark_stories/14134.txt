Once there was a pink bird who lived on a lake. Every day, the powerful bird would splash in the water and have fun. One day, the bird flew too close to the lake and fell in. She flapped her wings, but she was too scared to get out.
Suddenly, the bird saw a hand reaching out from the lake. It was her best friend, a powerful frog. He hopped over to the bird and said, “Don’t worry. You can jump on my back and I can help you get out.”
The bird jumped on the frog’s back. The frog was so powerful, he swam and splashed until the bird was back on dry land. The bird thanked her best friend, and they both happily went on their way.
