Once upon a time there was a girl called Lucy. She had a broken soap and wanted to fix it. First, she had to part the soap into two pieces. Then she washed each piece with warm water and a cloth. After that, she put the two pieces back together again. With some glue and a hammer, she made the soap whole again.
Finally the soap was ready. Lucy was so happy and she could use the soap to wash her hands again. She thanked her mum for helping her fix the broken soap.
The end.
