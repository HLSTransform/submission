Once upon a time, there was a boy named Toby who was very intelligent. He asked his mom if he could take a special vehicle for a ride. His mom said yes, so he jumped in the vehicle and started to explore. 
He drove all around the town, looking for interesting places to go. He wanted to find out everything there was to know. But soon, he realized he was lost and didn't know where to go. 
He decided to ask a neighbour for help. The neighbour said they could help him get back home, so they spent the day driving around until they found his house. 
When they arrived, Toby thanked the neighbour for their help and went in to tell his mom all about his adventure. His mom was so proud of Toby and of how intelligent he was. 
From then on, Toby never took the vehicle out to explore again - but he always made sure to ask his mom first!
