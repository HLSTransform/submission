Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big pumpkin in their neighbor's yard. It was orange and round and had a funny face carved on it.
"Let's go see the pumpkin!" Tim said.
"OK, but be careful. Mom said not to touch anything that is not ours," Sam said.
They ran across the street and looked at the pumpkin. It was cold and hard. There was some white stuff on it. It was icy.
"Wow, this pumpkin is icy!" Tim said. "I wonder what it feels like."
He reached out his hand and touched the pumpkin. It was very cold and slippery. He tried to pick it up, but it was too heavy. He pushed it instead.
"Hey, stop that! You might break it!" Sam said.
But Tim did not listen. He pushed the pumpkin harder and harder. He wanted to see what was inside. He thought it would be fun.
But then, something bad happened. The pumpkin rolled off the porch and hit the ground. It cracked and split in half. The seeds and the pulp spilled out. The pumpkin was destroyed.
"Oh no! Look what you did!" Sam said.
They heard a loud voice behind them. It was their neighbor, Mr. Brown. He was angry.
"What are you doing with my pumpkin? You destroyed it! You ruined my Halloween decoration!" he shouted.
Tim and Sam were scared. They ran back to their house. They knew they were in trouble. They wished they had listened to Sam and not touched the pumpkin. They learned a lesson that day.
