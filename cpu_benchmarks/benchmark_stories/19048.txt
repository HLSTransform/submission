Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play outside in the sun with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends saw a butterfly flying by. They decided to follow it and see where it went. 
As they were following the butterfly, Lily's friend Tommy said, "I'm tired, can we stop and rest?" Lily replied, "Sure, let's sit on the side of the road and rest for a bit." 
As they were resting, Lily's mom walked by and saw them. She said, "Lily, I'm so proud of you for being a good friend and taking care of your friends." Lily smiled and said, "Thanks, Mom!" 
After resting, they continued to follow the butterfly until it flew away. Even though they didn't catch the butterfly, Lily was still proud of herself for having fun with her friends and being a good friend to Tommy.
