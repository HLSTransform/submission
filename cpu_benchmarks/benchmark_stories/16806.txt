Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and cuddle with her cushion. One day, Lily's mom brought her a new cushion that she had designed herself. 
Lily was so happy and she hugged her new cushion tightly. "Mommy, this cushion is so pretty! Did you design it?" she asked. 
"Yes, I did! I'm glad you like it," her mom replied with a smile. 
Later that day, Lily and her mom went outside to play in the snow. The ground was icy and slippery, but they had fun making snowmen and having snowball fights. When they got back inside, Lily snuggled up with her new cushion and said, "I'm so glad we have a warm and cozy home to come back to after playing in the icy snow." 
Her mom smiled and said, "Me too, Lily. And I'm glad you love your new cushion."
