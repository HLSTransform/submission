One day, a little boy and his mommy were walking down the street. The little boy was wearing a black shirt and was holding onto his mommy's hand. Suddenly, the little boy let go and ran away.
The mommy yelled, "Don't forget to come back for dinner!" But the little boy didn't hear her, he kept running and eventually, he was out of sight.
The mommy and the little boy's daddy looked everywhere, but they couldn't find the little boy. Then, they asked a doctor if he could help.
The doctor said, "I can help, but it won't be easy. The little boy could be anywhere. We need to keep searching."
So, the mommy and daddy kept searching, but they couldn't find the little boy. They had forgotten to look in the alleyway and that's where the little boy was. The little boy was sleeping soundly, but he was gone forever. The little boy had been bitten by a snake and taken away. 
The mommy and daddy were so sad. They had forgotten to look in the alleyway and that's why they couldn't find the little boy. They had lost him forever.
