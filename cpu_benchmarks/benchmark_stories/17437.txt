Lily liked to mark her books with stickers. She had many stickers of animals, flowers and stars. She put them on the pages of her favorite stories. She wanted to make them more pretty and fun.
One day, she found a new book on the shelf. It was a big book with many pictures. She opened it and saw a story about a princess and a dragon. She was very enthusiastic. She wanted to read it and mark it with her stickers.
She took the book and her stickers to the sofa. She sat down and started to read. She liked the story very much. She put a sticker of a crown on the princess, a sticker of a fire on the dragon, and a sticker of a castle on the last page.
She was so happy that she did not hear her mom come in. Her mom saw her with the book and the stickers. She was not happy. She said, "Lily, what are you doing? That is not your book. That is my book. You cannot mark it with your stickers. You have to take them off."
Lily was surprised and sad. She did not know that it was her mom's book. She thought it was a book for everyone. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I like the story. I wanted to make it more pretty and fun. I did not want to make you angry."
Her mom saw that Lily was sorry. She was not angry anymore. She said, "It's okay, Lily. I understand. You like stories and stickers. But you have to ask before you mark someone else's book. Maybe we can find another book that you can mark with your stickers. Do you want to do that?"
Lily nodded. She said, "Yes, mom. Thank you. Can we read the story together first?"
Her mom smiled. She said, "Of course, Lily. I like the story too. Let's read it together." She hugged Lily and they read the story. They were both enthusiastic.
