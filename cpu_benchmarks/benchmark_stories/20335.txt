Sara and Tom were twins who liked to eat a lot. They always wanted more food than their parents gave them. They did not like to share with each other or with their friends. They did not say thank you or please. They were not modest.
One day, their mom made a big cake for their birthday. She put candles on top and said, "Happy birthday, Sara and Tom! You can each have one slice of cake, but first you have to blow out the candles and make a wish."
Sara and Tom did not listen to their mom. They did not blow out the candles or make a wish. They grabbed the whole cake and ran to their room. They locked the door and started to chew the cake as fast as they could. They did not enjoy the taste or the smell. They just wanted to eat more and more.
Soon, they felt sick. Their stomachs hurt and they felt dizzy. They wanted to stop eating, but they could not. They had eaten too much cake. They started to cry and call for their mom.
Their mom heard them and knocked on the door. She said, "Sara and Tom, what is wrong? Why did you lock the door? Why did you take the whole cake?"
Sara and Tom opened the door and said, "We are sorry, mom. We were greedy and rude. We ate too much cake and now we feel bad. We did not share or say thank you. We did not make a wish. We were not modest."
Their mom hugged them and said, "I forgive you, Sara and Tom. But you have to learn to be modest and grateful. You have to share and be polite. You have to chew your food slowly and enjoy it. You have to make a wish and hope for good things. That is how you can be happy and healthy."
Sara and Tom nodded and said, "We understand, mom. We will try to be modest and grateful. We will share and be polite. We will chew our food slowly and enjoy it. We will make a wish and hope for good things. Thank you, mom. We love you."
Their mom smiled and said, "I love you too, Sara and Tom. Happy birthday. Now, let's go and see if there is any cake left for your friends."
