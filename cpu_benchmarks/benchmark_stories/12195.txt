Once upon a time, there was a young boy who really liked to make noise. He had a drum that he especially loved to bang on and he was amazing at it! Every day after school he would grab his drum and make all kinds of music with it. One day the boy heard a different kind of music coming from the forest. He grabbed his drum and hurried to find the source.
When he arrived, he saw a group of old people gathered around in a circle. They were singing in a language he couldn't understand and moving their arms up and down in a stirring way. The boy watched in amazement as the old people played their music and stirred the air with their song. 
He was so intrigued that he quietly stepped into the circle and began to bang his drum. The old people stopped their music and stared at the young boy in shock. 
The boy's eyes grew wider and he prepared to run, but then suddenly the old people smiled and started to play their music again. They played together and every time the boy hit his drum, they smiled and stirred the air with a greater rhythm.
The boy realized that sometimes a single little drum can make an amazing and powerful sound when others join in. He also learned to listen and appreciate the music of others, even if the language was unfamiliar. This was the most wonderful sound the boy had ever heard.
