Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play with their toys. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big tank that could move and make noises. They took turns to drive the tank and pretend to be soldiers.
One day, they wanted to play with the tank at the same time. Tom said, "It is my turn to drive the tank. I want to go to the park and explore." Lily said, "No, it is my turn to drive the tank. I want to go to the garden and see the flowers." They disagree and start to pull the tank from each other.
The tank was not strong enough to be pulled so hard. It broke into two pieces and stopped moving and making noises. Tom and Lily were very sad and angry. They blamed each other for being careless and breaking the tank. They stopped talking and playing with each other.
Their mom saw what happened and came to talk to them. She said, "I know you both love the tank, but you should not fight over it. You should share and take turns. You should also be careful and gentle with your toys. They are not alive, but they can still get hurt. And most importantly, you should love and respect each other. You are twins and you are lucky to have each other as friends. The tank can be fixed, but your friendship is more precious."
Tom and Lily realized that their mom was right. They felt sorry for being careless and mean to each other. They hugged and said, "We are sorry, mom. We are sorry, twin. We love you and we love the tank. Can we play with it together?" Their mom smiled and said, "Of course you can. But first, let me help you fix the tank. Then you can go to the park and the garden and have fun."
The moral of the story is: We should share and take turns with our toys and friends. We should also be careful and gentle with our things and people. We should love and respect each other and value our friendship.
