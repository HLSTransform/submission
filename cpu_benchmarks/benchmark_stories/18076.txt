Once upon a time, there was a clever fox. He had a card that he liked to show to his friends. The card had a picture of a tree on it. One day, the fox decided to travel to the forest to find that tree. He walked and walked until he saw the tree. It was very big and had lots of leaves. The fox was very happy and showed his card to the tree. The tree didn't say anything, but the fox knew it was impressed. From that day on, the fox and the tree became good friends and would travel together around the forest.
