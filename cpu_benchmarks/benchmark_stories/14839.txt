Sara liked to pick flowers in the garden. She liked the red ones, the yellow ones, and the purple ones. She liked to make them into a crown for her head. She felt like a princess.
One day, she saw a new flower in the garden. It was white and shiny, and it had a little bell inside. It made a tinkling sound when the wind blew. Sara thought it was the most attractive flower she had ever seen. She wanted to pick it and add it to her crown.
She reached out her hand to the flower, but before she could touch it, she heard a voice.
"Stop! Don't pick that flower!" the voice said. It was a fairy, sitting on a leaf. She had wings like a butterfly and a dress like a petal. She looked angry.
"Why not?" Sara asked. She was curious and surprised.
"Because that flower is mine!" the fairy said. "It is my home and my friend. If you pick it, you will hurt it and me. Please leave it alone."
Sara felt sorry for the fairy. She did not want to hurt her or her flower. She said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know. It is a very attractive flower. Can I look at it?"
The fairy smiled. She said, "Yes, you can look at it, but don't touch it. It is a magic flower. It can grant wishes, but only to fairies. If you are nice to it, maybe it will let you hear its bell."
Sara nodded. She looked at the flower and listened to its bell. She thought it was the most beautiful sound she had ever heard. She said, "Thank you, fairy. You are very kind. Can I be your friend?"
The fairy said, "Yes, you can be my friend. But you have to promise me something. You have to promise me that you will never pick any flower in the garden without asking first. Some of them are homes and friends for other fairies. Do you promise?"
Sara said, "I promise. I will never pick any flower without asking first. I will respect the fairies and their flowers."
The fairy said, "Good. Then you are my friend. And I will give you a gift. I will make your flower crown last forever. It will never wilt or fade. It will always be bright and pretty. Do you like that?"
Sara said, "I like that very much. Thank you, fairy. You are the best friend ever."
The fairy said, "You're welcome, Sara. You are a good girl. Now, let's play together in the garden."
And they did. They played and laughed and sang. And the flower with the bell watched them and smiled.
