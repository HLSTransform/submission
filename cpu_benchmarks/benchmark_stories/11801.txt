Once upon a time there was a helpful fox who lived in the forest. He was always ready to offer his help to his animal friends in the forest.
One day the fox was going for a walk when he saw a rabbit. The rabbit was crying and looked very sad.
The fox asked the rabbit, "What is wrong?". The rabbit answered, "I lost my way home".
The fox offered to help the rabbit find his way home. So he led the rabbit out of the forest until they could see the rabbit's home.
The rabbit thanked the fox for being so helpful and the fox smiled. He was happy that he could offer help to his animal friend.
