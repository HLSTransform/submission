Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, she saw a butterfly flying in the sky. It was so pretty and colorful. Lily wanted to catch it and perform a dance with it.
She ran after the butterfly, but it was too fast. Suddenly, the butterfly landed on a clear flower. Lily was so happy! She gently held the butterfly and performed her dance. The butterfly flapped its wings and flew away.
Lily was sad that the butterfly left, but she was happy that she got to perform with it. She knew that she would see more butterflies in the future.
