Once upon a time, there was an honest octopus named Ollie. He lived in the deep blue sea with his fish friends. Ollie loved to play games and share his toys with everyone.
One sunny day, Ollie and his friends found a big ice block. They had never seen one before. They touched it and felt how cold it was. Ollie said, "Let's play with the ice block and see what happens."
As they played, the ice block began to melt in the warm sun. Ollie and his friends were amazed. "Look, the ice is turning into water!" said Ollie's friend, Fin the fish. They splashed and played in the water until the ice block was all gone.
Ollie and his friends learned something new that day. They had lots of fun playing with the ice block and watching it melt. They couldn't wait to tell their other friends about their adventure. And from that day on, they always looked for new things to learn and play with in their beautiful sea home.
