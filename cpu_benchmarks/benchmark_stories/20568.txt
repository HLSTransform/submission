Once there was a naughty boy called Joe. He loved to create things. He wanted to make something special, so he decided to build a mailbox.
He went outside to the garden and found some wood. He took it to the shed and created a mailbox. He painted it blue and added a flag on top. Joe was very proud of his creation.
One day, he walked outside and there was a surprise waiting for him. What was it? A letter! It was for Joe and it was in his mailbox.
He was so excited that he had created a mailbox, and now it was being used! Joe was very happy and ran inside to tell his parents the good news. From then on, he loved checking his mailbox every day to see if he got any new mail.
