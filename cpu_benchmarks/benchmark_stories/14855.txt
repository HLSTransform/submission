Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a nice farm. He had many animals like cows, pigs, and chickens. Every day, he would wake up early and feed them. He loved his animals very much.
One day, the farmer decided to raise more chickens. He went to the store and bought many eggs. He put them in a warm place and waited patiently. After a few weeks, the eggs hatched and many baby chicks were born. They were so cute and fluffy!
The farmer was very happy to have more animals on his farm. He took good care of them and watched them grow. The chicks became big and strong, and soon they were laying eggs too. The farmer was grateful for his nice farm and all of the animals that lived there.
