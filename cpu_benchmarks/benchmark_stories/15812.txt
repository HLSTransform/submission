Once upon a time there was a little poppy called Toby. He was very noisy and loved to stretch his legs.
One day Toby was on the playground when a big stretchy rope appeared. Toby couldn't believe his eyes and he excitedly grabbed the rope in his hands. He was even more amazed when he found out the rope could stretch!
Toby stretched the rope as far as he could. He was having so much fun until he noticed the rope getting tangled up. He just couldn't get it out of the knot.
Just then an older poppy came by. Toby asked for help, "Please help me, I can't get the rope untangled."
The older poppy smiled and said, "Sure, let me help you."  He untangled the rope and then asked Toby, "Do you want to stretch together?"
Toby smiled and nodded. He grabbed the rope and together they both started stretching it. Toby giggled happily. He was enjoying stretching with another poppy.
