Lila was a little girl who liked to ride in her dad's big car. She felt safe and happy when she sat in her seat and heard the buckle click. Her dad was a wealthy man who worked hard and bought nice things for Lila and her mom.
One day, her dad said they were going to visit a new friend. He said the friend was very kind and generous and had a big house with a lot of toys. Lila was excited and curious. She wondered what the friend looked like and what toys he had.
They drove for a long time and reached a big gate. Her dad pressed a button and the gate opened. They drove up a long driveway and saw a huge house with many windows and a fountain. Lila gasped. She had never seen such a big house before.
They parked the car and got out. Her dad held her hand and walked to the door. He rang the bell and waited. Lila heard a loud bark and saw a big dog run to the door. She felt scared and hid behind her dad. The dog looked angry and fierce.
The door opened and a man came out. He smiled and said, "Welcome, welcome, my friends! I'm so glad you're here!" He bent down and petted the dog. He said, "Don't worry, this is Rufus. He's very friendly and loves children. He just wants to say hello."
He picked up Lila and hugged her. He said, "You must be Lila. You're so pretty and sweet. I have a surprise for you. Come, let me show you." He carried her inside and showed her a big room full of toys. There were dolls, cars, books, puzzles, and more. Lila felt happy and amazed. She said, "Wow, thank you, thank you! You're so nice!"
The man said, "You're very welcome, Lila. I'm your grandpa. I've been looking for you and your dad for a long time. I'm so happy to finally meet you. You're my family and I love you very much." He kissed her cheek and hugged her again.
Lila smiled and hugged him back. She said, "I love you too, grandpa. You're my family too. Can I play with Rufus and the toys?"
Grandpa said, "Of course, you can. You can play with anything you want. This is your home too, Lila. You're always welcome here." He put her down and watched her run to Rufus and the toys. He felt a tear in his eye and thanked his son for bringing Lila to him. He said, "This is the best day of my life."
