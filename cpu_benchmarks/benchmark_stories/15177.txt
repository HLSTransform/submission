Once upon a time there was a little girl named Alice. It was her birthday and she was wearing a very pretty dress. After she finished getting ready, she went outside to see her friends.
Her friends had a surprise for her. They had made her a big welcome sign with lots of colors that said, “Welcome Alice!” Alice was so excited!
Alice and her friends had a great time playing in the park. After a while, they started to get a bit dirty. Alice's mom saw them and called out, “Alice, you need to stay clean!”
Alice thought about what her mom said and realized that it was very important. She put an end to the playing and went home to get cleaned up.
Alice learned an important lesson that day: it is important to stay clean and welcome the things that will make you happy.
