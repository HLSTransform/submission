Today, Tracey had a special job. She was collecting heavy lungs. Her mom whispered, "Be careful, Tracey!" So Tracey was very careful when she picked up the heavy lungs and put them into her bucket. 
The heavy lungs were so big that it was hard to carry them all. But Tracey carefully found a way to hold them all and she started walking home. On the way she saw some birds, who were singing in the trees. 
Tracey started singing too. But then she remembered she had to be careful with the heavy lungs. So she kept singing to herself but quietly so she wouldn't drop them! 
Finally, Tracey arrived home. She opened the door and saw her mom, who was very happy to see all the heavy lungs Tracey had collected. She said, "Well done, Tracey! I am so proud of you!" and gave Tracey a big hug.
