Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily's mom told her that it was important to wear a helmet when riding her bike. "It will keep you safe," her mom said.
Lily's friend, Jack, came over to play. He didn't have a helmet on. Lily said, "I recommend you wear a helmet like me. It's safe and fine." Jack listened to Lily and went home to get his helmet.
Later that day, Lily and Jack rode their bikes together. They both wore their helmets and had a fun time playing outside. Lily was happy that she could recommend something that kept her friend safe.
