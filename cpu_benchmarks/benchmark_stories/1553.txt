Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max liked to eat bones and play fetch with his owner. One day, Max's owner put a leash on him and they went for a walk. Max was a good dog and walked nicely on the leash. 
As they walked, they saw a big tree with lots of apples on it. Max's owner picked an apple and gave it to Max to eat. Max was happy and ate the apple. 
After they finished their walk, Max and his owner went home. Max was a modest dog and didn't brag about how good he was on the leash. He just wagged his tail and went to take a nap.
