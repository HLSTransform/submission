Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Aumana. She loved to jump and was always so eager to do it. 
One day, Aumana decided to go to the park. She was so excited when she saw the big slide. She jumped and jumped for hours! 
Even more exciting was that the park had a yummy muffin stand. Aumana had never seen such big muffins before. As Aumana reached out to get one, she heard a funny noise. It sounded like a funny voice! 
"Hey there! Don't forget to share your muffin," the voice said. Aumana turned around and saw a funny looking rabbit. She laughed. 
"Oh Hello. Of course, I will share my muffin," Aumana smiled and the rabbit hopped away.
Aumana ate her muffin with a huge smile on her face and continued jumping around the park the entire day.
