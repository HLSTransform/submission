Once there was a tall clumsy girl who loved to run. Everywhere she went, a shadow followed her. When she ran, it ran with her.
One day, the girl decided to give her shadow a gift. She looked everywhere, but could not find the perfect present. Finally, she spotted a shiny butterfly. She reached out, grabbed it gently and gave it to her shadow.
The shadow smiled and thanked her. Then it flew away with the butterfly, never to be seen again. 
The girl smiled. Giving away the butterfly made her happy. She had made her shadow happy too.
