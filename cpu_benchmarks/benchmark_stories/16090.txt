Once there was a little girl named Sue. She was a three year old who loved to talk to her friends in the park. One day, as Sue was playing, she sprained her arm while running. 
It hurt a lot, so Sue started to cry. All her friends came to help her. They asked her why her arm was hurting and she couldn't explain. Sue felt ashamed because she didn't know what happened.
Fortunately her friends were very kind and they all held hands while they walked to Sue's house. Her mom saw that Sue was crying and she asked what happened.
Sue told her mom about the accident and she showed her arm. Her mom gave her a big hug and said it was going to be ok. Then, Sue's mom took her to the doctors to make sure her arm was alright. 
After the visit, Sue was a lot less scared and she was very happy to finally be able to talk about what happened.
