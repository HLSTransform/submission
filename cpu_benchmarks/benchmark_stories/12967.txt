Once upon a time there was a little girl named Clarissa. She loved to explore the world around her.
Today, Clarissa was very excited because she wanted to go fishing with her dad. They were going to the big lake close to their house.
When they arrived at the lake, Clarissa's dad put a bait on the hook, and then he said to Clarissa, "Look at that beautiful water. Do you think that we can print some fishes for dinner?"
Clarissa was so excited and she said, "Yes, I believe we can print fish today!"
They both casted their line in the lake and waited patiently for a fish to take the bait. Soon enough, a fish was available. Clarissa and her dad cheered with joy! They spent the whole day printing fish and finally, they had enough for a delicious dinner. 
At the end of the day, Clarissa was very happy with all the new experiences she had while fishing. This was a memory that will last forever!
