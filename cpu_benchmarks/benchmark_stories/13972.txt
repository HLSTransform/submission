Once upon a time there was a girl named Lily. She loved to run and play outside. One day, she saw a butterfly and wanted to catch it. She ran after it, but it was too fast and flew away.
Lily's mom had a bottle of perfume that smelled really good. Lily loved to smell it and put some on her wrists. She ran around the house, showing everyone how good she smelled.
Later that day, Lily's dad played music really loud. Lily danced and sang along. She loved how the music made her feel happy and energetic. It was a fun day for Lily, full of running, smelling good, and dancing to loud music.
