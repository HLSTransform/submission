Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to walk in the park with her mom. One day, they saw a pale duck in the pond. "Look, Mommy! The duck is so pale!" said Lily. "Yes, it is," replied her mom.
Later that day, they went home and turned on the TV. They watched a show about animals. "I love animals," said Lily. "Me too," said her mom. They talked about all the animals they had seen that day.
Before bedtime, Lily asked her mom, "Can we walk in the park again tomorrow?" "Of course, we can," said her mom. Lily went to bed happy, dreaming about all the animals she would see on her walk tomorrow.
