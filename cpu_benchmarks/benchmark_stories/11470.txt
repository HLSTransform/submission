Windy was excited. She was going to pick tomatoes from the garden. She ran to the garden and grabbed a basket. She saw the reddest tomatoes and started picking them.
Windy asked her mom, "How thick should I make the tomato sandwiches?"
Her mom replied, "Make them thick enough for both of us to enjoy".
Windy smiled and started making the sandwiches. After Windy finished making the sandwiches, her mom put them in the refrigerator.
The next morning, Windy heard loud crashing noises. She ran to the kitchen and saw that the refrigerator had broken. Her mom sighed and said, "We can't restore it anymore. Our precious tomatoes have all spoiled! We won't be able to have tomato sandwiches anymore." 
Windy felt sad. All the effort she had gone to was in vain. She sadly looked at the wasted tomatoes. Her dream of eating thick tomato sandwiches was over.
