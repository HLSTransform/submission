Once upon a time there lived a little bear named Sam. Sam was a very curious creature and he liked to explore his neighbourhood. One day, he decided to explore a place he had never been to before. He came across a strange-looking cable. He was very excited and he walked closer, wanting to know where the cable went. 
Suddenly, the cable broke and electricity surged through it, which gave Sam an electric shock. He screamed in pain and he was very anxious. He felt like he had been hurt very badly and he started to cry. 
Sam's family was very worried and they quickly called an ambulance. They rushed him to the hospital where the doctors were able to help. They gave Sam medicine and special care, and he gradually started to feel better. 
Through his courage and endurance, Sam was able to overcome his suffering. He soon went back to exploring his neighbourhood and he was careful not to get too close to any cables.
