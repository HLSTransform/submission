Lily was sick. She had a bad cough and a hot head. Mommy said she had to take medicine to get better. But Lily did not like medicine. It was bitter and yucky. She did not want to drink it.
"No, no, no!" Lily said, pushing away the spoon. "I don't want medicine!"
Mommy sighed. She tried to be patient. "Lily, you have to take your medicine. It will help you feel better. It will prevent you from getting sicker. Do you want to play with your friends again?"
Lily nodded. She missed her friends. She wanted to go to the park and swing and slide. But she still did not want to drink the medicine.
"Please, Lily, just one sip. It's not that bad. Look, I have a sticker for you. It's a unicorn. It's very impressive. You can have it if you take your medicine."
Lily looked at the sticker. It was shiny and colorful. It had a horn and a tail. It was very impressive. She liked unicorns. She wanted the sticker.
"Okay, okay," Lily said. "I will take one sip. But only one!"
Mommy smiled. She gave Lily the spoon. Lily closed her eyes and opened her mouth. She drank the medicine. It was bitter and yucky. She made a face. But she did it.
"Good girl!" Mommy said. "You did it! You took your medicine. I'm so proud of you. Here is your sticker. You can put it on your shirt."
Lily smiled. She took the sticker. She put it on her shirt. It was shiny and colorful. It was very impressive. She felt a little better. She hugged Mommy.
"Thank you, Mommy," Lily said. "I love you. And I love unicorns."
