One day, Sophie was feeling a bit anxious. She looked around the room until she saw the fan. She thought it would be fun to drop it. So Sophie gave it a push and it dropped to the floor. She jumped back and looked at her Mom. Her Mom said, "Sophie, you need to be careful. We don't drop things like that." Sophie nodded and said sorry. She was happy to know she had been careful.
The next day, Sophie felt an anxious feeling again. She looked around the room and there was the fan again. This time she didn't drop it. Instead she asked her Mom if she could help clean it. Her Mom said yes.
Sophie grabbed her little rag and got to work. She wiped down each blade carefully with the rag. She was so happy to be helpful and she felt much better knowing she was careful with the fan. From then on, she was careful with it every time.
