Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play all day long and never wanted to take a nap. Her mom would always tell her how important it was to take a nap every day, but Lily didn't listen.
One day, Lily's mom promised her that if she took a nap every day, she would get a special treat. Lily was excited and agreed to take a nap every day.
At first, it was hard for Lily to take a nap regularly, but she kept her promise and soon it became a regular part of her day. She felt better and had more energy to play and have fun.
Lily learned that keeping promises and taking care of herself was important. She was happy that she listened to her mom and took her regular naps.
