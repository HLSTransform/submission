Once upon a time there was a small class. The class had lots of fun things to do. Every day a teacher came to teach them.
The teacher was very kind, and helped the small class learn about lots of different things. They learned about numbers and animals and colours. 
The teacher also taught them how to read, write and draw. The class was so excited! Every day they loved learning something new.
At the end of each day the teacher gave each student a big hug and said goodbye. 
The small class and the teacher had lots of fun teaching and learning together!
