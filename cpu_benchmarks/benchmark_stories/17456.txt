Ben was a big boy who liked to help his mom. One day, his mom was sick and had to go to the hospital. Ben wanted to go with her, but his mom said he had to stay with his grandma. Ben was sad, but he was obedient and did what his mom said.
At grandma's house, Ben saw a big bag of toys. He wanted to play with them, but grandma said they were for the children at the hospital. Ben asked if he could carry the bag to the hospital and give the toys to the children. Grandma said yes, but he had to be careful and hold her hand.
Ben and grandma walked to the hospital with the bag of toys. Ben was very strong and carried the bag all the way. He saw many children who were sick and sad. He gave them the toys and made them smile. He also saw his mom, who was feeling better. She hugged him and thanked him for being so kind and helpful.
Ben was happy. He learned that being obedient and caring for others can make him and others happy. He also learned that the hospital is not a scary place, but a place where people can get better and help each other. He was proud of himself and his mom.
