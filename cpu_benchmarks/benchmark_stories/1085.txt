Cora was a very curious little girl. Every day she would explore the garden in her neighborhood. One day, she wandered too far and saw something very interesting. It was a colorful lizard! She had never seen a lizard before.
Cora saw the lizard wearing many things. It had a hat that looked like a flower, a necklace made of shiny stones, and a bracelet made of colorful beads. She was so amazed by the sight that she couldn't believe her eyes.
The lizard looked at Cora and gave her a friendly nod. It was as if he wanted to say hello. Cora smiled and waved back at the lizard. They soon became friends.
Every day Cora would play with her colorful, new friend in the garden. The lizard wore different things each day, so Cora always had something new to discover. It was the best day of Cora's life.
