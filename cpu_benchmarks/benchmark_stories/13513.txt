Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going on adventures with her family. One day, they decided to go to the zoo. Lily was so excited to see all the animals. 
When they arrived, her parents bought a ticket for everyone to get in. Lily held onto her ticket tightly. She loved how it felt in her hand. 
As they walked around the zoo, Lily started to yawn. She was getting tired from all the walking. Her mom suggested they take a break and sit down. Lily looked around and saw a group of kids drawing pictures. She wanted to join them. 
Lily grabbed her crayons and paper and got creative. She drew a picture of her favorite animal, the giraffe. She was so proud of her picture and showed it to her parents. They were impressed with her artistic skills. After her little break, Lily was ready to see more animals and continue her adventure at the zoo.
