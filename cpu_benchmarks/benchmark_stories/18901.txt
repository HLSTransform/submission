Ben and Lily like to play in the snow. They make snowballs and snowmen and snow forts. They have fun with their dog, Spot, who runs and jumps in the snow.
One day, they see a big pond near their house. The pond is frozen and icy. They want to see what is under the ice. They go to their garage and find a net. They bring the net to the pond.
They make a hole in the ice with a stick. They put the net in the hole and pull it up. They see some fish and frogs in the net. They are very cold and still. Ben and Lily feel sorry for them.
They put the fish and frogs in a bucket with some water. They bring the bucket to their house. They put the bucket near the fireplace. They hope the fish and frogs will get warm and wake up.
They watch the bucket for a long time. They see the fish and frogs start to move and swim. They are happy. They give them some food and water. They decide to keep them as pets. They name them Snowy, Frosty, Sparky and Hoppy. They love their new friends.
