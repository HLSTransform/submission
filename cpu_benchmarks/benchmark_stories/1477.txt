Tina was so excited for her first meeting. She put on her warm coat and shoes and went downstairs. She couldn't believe it - the meeting was actually taking place in her living room.
She saw Mommy, Daddy, and Grandma all sitting there smiling. Tina knew that it was time to take her seat. She sat on the couch and looked around. Everyone in the room was so warm and happy.
Tina was a little bit nervous at first, but the smiles on her family's faces helped her feel better. She couldn't believe that this meeting was taking place at her own house.
They talked and talked until it was time to say good-bye. Tina was sad but also a little bit delighted. She had just taken part in her first meeting and it had been so special. She couldn't wait for her next one.
