Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to play with his glow toy at night. He would run around the house, making the toy glow in the dark. One day, Tim's mom told him to be careful while playing with his toy.
One night, Tim was playing with his glow toy near the stairs. He was not careful and fell down. Tim felt hurt and cried. His mom and dad heard him cry and came to help. They saw that he was hurt and needed to go to the hospital.
At the hospital, the doctor looked at Tim and said he was sorry. The doctor tried to help Tim, but his leg was too hurt. Tim could not play with his glow toy anymore. He was very sad and wished he had been careful when his mom told him to be.
