Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. One day, Amy went outside to play. She wanted to find her toy car. She looked under the tree, but it was not there. She looked behind the bush, but it was not there either. Amy felt a little bit silly because she could not find her toy car.
Amy saw her friend Tim playing in the snow. "Tim, have you seen my toy car?" she asked. Tim shook his head and said, "No, Amy, I have not seen your toy car. But let's look for it together!" So, Amy and Tim searched for the toy car in the cold snow.
Finally, they found the toy car near the slide. "Look, Amy! We found it!" Tim shouted. Amy was so happy and thanked Tim for his help. They both laughed and played with the toy car in the cold snow. They had a lot of fun and thought it was silly that the toy car was hiding by the slide all along.
