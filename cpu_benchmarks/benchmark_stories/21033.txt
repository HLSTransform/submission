Once upon a time, there was an enormous tail poking out from beneath a rock. Every day, a little rabbit would come and seat himself beside it. 
One day, when the rabbit came and tried to seat himself, he noticed that the tail was easily four times bigger than usual. What could it be? He wondered, excited to see what was hiding beneath the rock.
The rabbit hopped closer and closer to the tail, until he was able to peek beneath. When he finally did, his eyes widened in amazement. There was a huge, enormous bear beneath the rock!
The bear welcomed the rabbit warmly, and before he knew it, the rabbit was seated atop the bear's back. The bear gave the rabbit a ride all around the forest, which delighted the little bunny so much that it made his tail swell with joy. 
The rabbit was so happy that he returned to the bear every single day afterwards. He couldn't wait to seat himself atop the bear's back to explore the world with his newfound friend.
