Once upon a time, there was an old man who wanted to win a crystal. He was very serious about his goal.
One day, he went to a nearby mountain to look for it. He searched for a long time but couldn't find it. He was about to leave when he heard a voice from above.
"I know where you can find a crystal!"
He looked up and saw a fairy hovering above him. She looked serious. "Follow me," she said, "and you will find the crystal you are looking for."
The old man followed the fairy and soon they found the crystal. The old man was so happy, he let out a cry of joy.
"Thank you so much!" he said to the fairy.
She smiled. "You're welcome," she said. "Now you have won your crystal." And with that, she flew away.
