Lily and Anna were best friends. They liked to play with dolls and dress up. One day, they found a big purse in the closet. It was black and shiny, with many pockets and zippers. It looked mysterious.
"Wow, look at this purse!" Lily said. "It's so pretty and cool. Can we play with it?"
"I don't know," Anna said. "Maybe it belongs to someone. We should ask Mom first."
But Lily was too curious. She opened the purse and saw many things inside. There were keys, a wallet, a phone, a lipstick, and a necklace. Lily wanted to try them on.
"Come on, Anna, let's decorate ourselves with these things," Lily said. "We can pretend to be grown-ups. It will be fun."
Anna was not sure. She felt that it was wrong to take things that were not theirs. But she did not want to upset Lily. So she followed her to the bathroom. There, they put on the lipstick, the necklace, and the keys. They looked at themselves in the mirror and giggled.
They did not hear Mom coming home. She saw the purse on the floor and went to the bathroom. She was shocked to see Lily and Anna with her things.
"Lily! Anna! What are you doing?" Mom asked. "This is my purse. You can't touch it without my permission. You could have lost or broken something. And you made a mess with the lipstick. How could you?"
Lily and Anna felt ashamed. They realized that they had done something bad. They took off the things and gave them back to Mom. They said they were sorry.
Mom was angry, but she also loved them. She hugged them and said, "I forgive you, but you have to learn to respect other people's things. You can't just take them and play with them. You have to ask first. And you have to be careful with them. Do you understand?"
Lily and Anna nodded. They said they understood. They promised to never do it again. They helped Mom clean the bathroom and the purse. They learned their lesson. They decided to decorate their own purses with stickers and ribbons instead. They had more fun that way.
