Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big case with all her toys inside. One day, Lily's mom told her to clean up her room. So, Lily started to pick up all her toys and put them in the case. She wanted to make sure they all fit inside. 
As she was cleaning, she found a toy car that was very dirty. It had mud all over it. Lily wanted to play with it, but she knew it needed to be cleaned first. So, she took a cloth and wiped it clean. It looked much better now! 
Finally, Lily finished cleaning her room and all her toys were in the case. She was happy because now she could find her toys easily. Her mom was proud of her for doing a good job. From that day on, Lily made sure to clean up her toys every day.
