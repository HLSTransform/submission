Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play outside in the sunshine with her dog. One day, while they were playing, Lily discovered a pretty rock. She picked it up and showed it to her dog. 
Later that day, Lily's mom showed her an image of a butterfly in a book. Lily thought it was very beautiful and wanted to see a real butterfly. So, she went outside to look for one. After a while, she saw a butterfly flying around in the garden. She was very happy to have discovered it.
Lily was a very compassionate girl. When she saw her friend crying, she gave her a hug and told her everything would be okay. Her friend felt much better after that. Lily learned that being kind and caring can make others feel better.
