Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color. One day, she wanted to make a special present for her mommy's birthday. So, she got some paper and markers and started to draw.
Lily drew a picture of a flower and then she cut it out. She wanted to wrap it up like a present, so she got some colorful paper and turned it into a pretty wrapping. She was very creative and added some stickers and ribbons too.
When Lily's mommy opened her present, she was so happy and said it was the best present ever! Lily felt very proud of herself for being creative and making her mommy smile. From that day on, Lily knew that making presents was something she loved to do.
