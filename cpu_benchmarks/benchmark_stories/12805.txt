Once upon a time, there was a frog who was scared of taking risks. One day, the frog saw some other frogs jumping into the pond and having so much fun. He wanted to join them, but he felt so nervous.
Then, a voice came to him. It was his mama. She told the frog, “It’s okay to be scared of taking risks. But you have to take risks in order to experience the joy of life. So dive into the pond, my brave little frog!”
The frog felt brave and curious. As the sun set, he took a deep breath and jumped into the pond. He felt the cool water on his skin. He was so happy to be part of this amazing adventure.
From that day on, the frog kept on taking risks and enjoying every part of his life. Every evening, he watched the sunset, feeling grateful and content. The frog had learned an important lesson - that taking risks is part of life.
