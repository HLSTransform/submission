John and his mum were getting ready for the day. His mum started to prepare breakfast. She chopped up some apples and put them in a bowl. John looked around for something to do. Suddenly he saw the TV. He ran over and pressed the button to turn it on.
John's mum called him over. She told him to help her get the table ready. John was lazy and wanted to watch TV. His mum was getting a bit bossy, so he decided to help.
John and his mum worked together to get the table ready. When it was finished, John was very pleased with himself. His mum was proud of him for helping. 
Now the table was ready, it was time for breakfast!
