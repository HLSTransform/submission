Once upon a time, there was a flexible statue. Every day, it would slide around the park, bouncing off the trees and dancing around the flowers. 
One day, a little girl saw the flexible statue. She was so excited and decided to follow it. She slowly walked behind it, watching it slide around. 
The girl saw the statue go around the trees, then through a ball pit, and then around a slide. It was having so much fun! The girl felt like she was playing with it. 
The little girl kept following the statue, and eventually they both got tired. So they stopped near a bench and plopped down next to each other. 
The flexible statue had been such a great friend to the little girl, so she promised to come back and play with the statue every day. And that's exactly what she did. 
Every day, the girl would come to the park and slide around with her flexible statue friend. 
The End.
