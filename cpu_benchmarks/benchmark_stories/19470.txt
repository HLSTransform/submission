Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Jess. Jess loved to spend time in her bedroom, which was filled with cool things. On her wall she had a cool mirror. She loved to stand in front of the mirror and look at herself. She would smile and make funny faces at its reflection. 
Jess spent so much time in front of the mirror, that it almost seemed like the mirror was her best friend. She liked to look at her beautiful dresses and pretend she was at a special party. Jess also liked to talk to the mirror, and it always seemed like the mirror was listening.
When Jess was tired, she liked to look into the mirror and tell herself a story. She would make up adventures and tell the mirror all about them. Jess loved spending time in front of the cool mirror. She knew it was her special friend.
