Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy truck that she loved to play with. One day, her friend Jack came over to play. Jack asked if he could play with the truck, but Lily didn't want to share. Jack said, "Lily, you can trust me. I will handle the truck with care." 
Lily thought about it and finally agreed. Jack played with the truck for a little while, but then he accidentally broke it. Lily was very sad and said, "You did a bad thing, Jack. You broke my truck." Jack felt bad and said he was sorry, but Lily was still upset. 
From then on, Lily didn't want to share her toys with Jack anymore. She didn't trust him to play with them nicely. Jack felt sad that he had lost his friend's trust and wished he could make things right. But sadly, Lily didn't want to play with him anymore.
