Once upon a time there was a helpful little boy. His name was Tyler. He liked to pretend. Every day, Tyler would go to the hedge near his house and pretend it was a castle. He liked to be a knight and defend it.
On one day, Tyler decided to be extra brave. He pretended a monster was coming to attack the hedge! He ran around the hedge like a knight, pretending to fight off the monster. 
But when Tyler went around the hedge he noticed something he'd never seen before. It was a secret door! He opened the door and saw a magical land. There were trees, and streams, and animals! 
Tyler was so happy. He was sure the hedge had been hiding this special place from him. He thanked the hedge for being so helpful, and he vowed to come back and explore the magical land again.
