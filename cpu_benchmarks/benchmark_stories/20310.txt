Sam liked to play with his toy cars. He had many cars of different colors and sizes. He liked to make them go fast and make loud noises. He also liked to pretend they were real cars and park them in his garage.
One day, he found a big ashtray on the table. He did not know what it was, but he thought it looked like a big bowl. He decided to use it as a garage for his cars. He put some cars inside the ashtray and some outside. He was very happy with his new garage.
But then, his mom came and saw the ashtray. She was very angry. She said the ashtray was not for playing, but for smoking. She said smoking was bad and made people sick. She said Sam had to take his cars out of the ashtray and put it back on the table.
Sam did not understand why his mom was angry. He thought the ashtray was a fair garage for his cars. He did not want to take his cars out. He tried to reverse his cars and drive them away from his mom. But his mom was faster. She grabbed the ashtray and took it away from Sam.
Sam was very sad. He cried and said he wanted his garage back. His mom felt sorry for him. She said she was sorry for yelling, but he had to be careful with the ashtray. She said she would find him a better garage for his cars. She gave him a hug and a kiss and took him to his room. There, she found an old shoebox and cut some holes in it. She said this was his new garage. She helped him put his cars inside and outside the shoebox. Sam liked his new garage. He smiled and said thank you to his mom. He said he loved her and his cars. His mom said she loved him too. They played together with his cars and had fun.
