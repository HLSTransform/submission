Anna and Ben love to decorate their room with things from nature. They like to find leaves, flowers, pine cones, and shells when they go outside. They think nature is very pretty and makes their room happy.
One day, they find a big branch that fell from a tree. It has many small branches and some green needles. They think it is perfect for their room. They ask their mom if they can take it home. She says yes, but they have to be careful and not make a mess.
They carry the branch to their room and put it on the floor. They get some string, scissors, and tape from their craft box. They cut the string into pieces and tie them to the small branches. Then they tape the other ends of the string to the wall. They make a big web of string and branch on the wall.
They look at their web and smile. They think it is very smart and cool. They get some of their nature things and hang them on the web. They hang leaves, flowers, pine cones, and shells. They make their web colorful and beautiful.
They are very proud of their decoration. They show it to their mom and dad. They say it is very smart and creative. They hug Anna and Ben and tell them they did a great job. Anna and Ben are very happy. They love to decorate their room with things from nature.
