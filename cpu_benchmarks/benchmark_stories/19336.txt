Once upon a time, there was a fast puddle. It was always racing from one place to the next. One day, it came to a stop in front of two rocks. The fast puddle smiled and married the rocks. Now they were a family. The puddle and the rocks were so happy they could sing and dance together. They lived together forever and ever, just like one big happy family. The end.
