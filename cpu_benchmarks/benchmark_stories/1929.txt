Once there was a little girl who was very tidy. She was playing in her room when she heard something very loud outside. She opened the window to see what it was and she saw a big whale. She was surprised and ran outside. The whale was very friendly and opened its mouth so the little girl could take a look inside. The little girl was so amazed at the whale's tidy mouth. She counted four rows of teeth and saw lots of little fish swimming around inside. Then the whale started to swim away. The little girl waved goodbye as the whale went off on its journey. The little girl never forgot her adventure with the tidy whale.
