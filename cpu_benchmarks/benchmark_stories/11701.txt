Once upon a time there was a big ocean. One day a foolish star wanted to see what the ocean was like. The star decided that the best way to see the ocean was from above so it flew up into the sky and started to shine down.
But no matter how hard the star shone, it couldn't see the ocean. The star was sad but it kept shining.
Suddenly the star felt something wet on its face. It looked down and saw the ocean! The star was so happy and had learned its lesson - you cannot see the ocean from up high, no matter how hard you shine. 
The star was excited and knew that it had learned an important lesson - sometimes, you must look down in order to truly see.
