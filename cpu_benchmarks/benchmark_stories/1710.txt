Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, her mommy gave her an envelope to give to their neighbor. Lily was excited to help her mommy. She walked to their neighbor's house and knocked on the door. 
The neighbor opened the door and said, "Hello, Lily! How can I help you?" 
Lily handed her the envelope and said, "My mommy said to give this to you." 
The neighbor smiled and said, "Thank you, Lily. You are such a helpful girl. Is there anything you need help with?" 
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I'm uncomfortable because my shoes are too tight." 
The neighbor said, "I care about you, Lily. Let's go inside and find you some more comfortable shoes." 
Lily was so happy that her neighbor cared about her. They went inside and found some soft and cozy slippers for Lily to wear. From that day on, Lily knew that she could always count on her neighbor to care for her.
