Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, while playing, she saw a police officer walking by. She was a bit scared at first, but the police officer smiled at her and said hello. Lily was happy to meet the police officer and learn about how they help keep people safe.
Later that day, Lily and her friends decided to have a race. They all ran as fast as they could, but Lily fell down and hurt her knee. Her friends helped her up and took her to the nearby fair. There, they rode on the ferris wheel and ate cotton candy. Lily forgot all about her hurt knee and had a great time with her friends.
As the sun began to set, Lily and her friends said goodbye to each other and went home. Lily couldn't wait to tell her mom about meeting the nice police officer and all the fun she had at the fair. She went to bed with a smile on her face, dreaming of her next adventure with her friends.
