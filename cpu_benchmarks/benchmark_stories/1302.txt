Once upon a time there was a lonely leopard. He stepped through the long grass, looking for a friend. He saw a rabbit and stepped quickly, but the rabbit hopped away. He stepped on a snake, but the snake slithered away.
The leopard kept stepping until he came to a big, dark cave. He stepped inside and saw four tiny mice, curled up against the wall. He stepped closer and the mice squeaked and scurried away. The leopard sighed, feeling very lonely.
Just then, he heard a deep purr and stepped around the corner. To his surprise, there was a beautiful, striped tiger, curled up in a way ball. The leopard stepped closer, and the tiger opened his golden eyes. The leopard and the tiger had become friends!
