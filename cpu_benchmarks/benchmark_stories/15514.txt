Grace was a modest girl. She always dressed nicely and she loved to cover herself up. One day, Grace's mom took her shopping and bought her a blue dress with a white line down the middle. Grace was so excited to put it on and cover herself. She put it on and spun around, feeling very pretty in her new dress.
The next morning, Grace wanted to wear her dress again. This time, she added a white cardigan to cover her shoulders and arms. How modest she looked! She looked even prettier with her cardigan, and she felt very cozy with her dress and sweater.
When Grace left the house, she saw a field of flowers. She ran down the path, picking pink and yellow ones, and then she thought of a way to cover them all. She made a long line of the flowers and covered the field from one side all the way to the other. What a modest and wonderful sight! Grace was very pleased with her work.
