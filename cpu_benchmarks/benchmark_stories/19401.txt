Once upon a time, there was a delicate flower. The flower grew in a small garden, with no one but the sun to support it. It was very sad, until one day when something exciting happened. 
A journal had fallen from the sky, out of the clouds. The flower was very curious. It carefully opened the journal to read it. 
The journal said that it was here to support the flower. It said that it believed in the flower and would help it become strong and beautiful. The flower was so happy to have someone to support it, and to have someone to tell its story. 
The flower started to grow and blossomed. Each day was an adventure, with the journal finding more ways to support the flower. Together, the flower and the journal made the garden into a beautiful place. 
The End.
