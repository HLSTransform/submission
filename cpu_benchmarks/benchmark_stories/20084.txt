Once upon a time, there was a man who had a colorful pipe. He loved to smoke his pipe while he sat outside and watched the birds. One day, a little girl walked by and saw the man with his pipe. She smiled at him and he nodded back. 
The man offered the little girl a piece of candy and she happily accepted. She sat down next to him and they talked about the pretty flowers in the garden. The man took a puff of his pipe and blew out a big cloud of smoke. The little girl giggled and said it looked like a dragon. 
Before the little girl left, the man gave her a colorful balloon. She thanked him and ran off with her new toy. The man sat back and smiled, happy to have made a new friend. From that day on, whenever the little girl walked by, she would wave and he would nod.
