Once upon a time, there was a duck named Ducky who lived by a big lake. Ducky was very bored because there was nothing to do. One day, Ducky went for a walk and met a frog named Froggy.
"Hi, Froggy. What are you doing?" asked Ducky.
"I'm trying to catch a fly," replied Froggy.
"That sounds dull. Do you want to play with me?" asked Ducky.
"Sure! What do you want to play?" asked Froggy.
"I know! Let's play snap the twig!" said Ducky.
They played snap the twig for a while, but then Ducky got thirsty. "I'm thirsty. Let's go get a drink from the lake," said Ducky.
"Okay, but be careful not to fall in," warned Froggy.
Ducky and Froggy went to the lake to get a drink. Suddenly, Ducky's foot slipped and he fell in the lake! Froggy quickly jumped in and helped Ducky out.
"Thanks for saving me, Froggy," said Ducky.
"No problem. Are you okay?" asked Froggy.
"Yes, I'm okay. Let's go play snap the twig again!" said Ducky.
And they played snap the twig until it was time to go home.
