Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to read books. He would read books all day and all night. His favorite place to read was in the garage.
One day, Tim found a small, weak cat in the garage. The cat was hungry and cold. Tim felt sad for the cat, so he gave it some food and a warm blanket. The cat was very happy.
Tim and the weak cat became best friends. They would play and read books together in the garage. The cat got stronger and happier with Tim's help. They had so much fun, and they lived happily ever after.
