Tom was sick. He felt hot and tired. He did not want to play with his toys or watch TV. He lay in his bed and coughed.
Mom came to his room. She had a thermometer in her hand. She said, "Tom, I need to check your temperature. Open your mouth and let me put this under your tongue. It will tell me how hot you are."
Tom did what Mom said. He opened his mouth and Mom put the thermometer under his tongue. He waited for a beep. Mom looked at the thermometer and frowned. She said, "Tom, you have a fever. You need to drink some water and take some medicine. I will bring you some soup later."
Tom nodded. He felt thirsty and hungry. He said, "Mom, I don't like being sick. I want to be healthy and play with my friends."
Mom kissed his forehead. She said, "I know, Tom. I don't like it either. But you will get better soon. You just need to rest and take care of yourself. I love you, Tom."
Tom smiled. He said, "I love you too, Mom. Thank you for bringing me the thermometer and the medicine. You are the best mom ever."
