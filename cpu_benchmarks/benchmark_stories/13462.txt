Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her toys, but she was bored today. She sat on the floor and looked at her dolls. "This is boring," she said.
Suddenly, her mom walked in the room with a surprise. "Look, Lily!" she said, holding up a shiny bracelet. "I got this for you!"
Lily's eyes lit up with excitement. "Wow! It's so pretty!" she said, putting the bracelet on her wrist.
"Can we go show Daddy?" Lily asked.
"Of course!" her mom replied.
They walked downstairs and found Lily's dad. "Look, Daddy! I got a bracelet!" Lily exclaimed.
Her dad smiled. "That's so cool! It looks great on you, Lily," he said.
Lily felt so happy and excited to show off her new bracelet to everyone she saw. She knew she would never be bored again with her new treasure.
