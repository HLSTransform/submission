Once upon a time there was a bus. It was a brilliant bus and it could bounce. Every day, the bus would bounce around the town. All the people loved it! They would laugh and yell as the bus bounced by.
Soon all the people in the town knew about the bouncing bus. Everyone wanted to be on it, so they began riding it every day. It was fun to be on the bus and bounce around!
Each day, the bus would get more and more crowded. One day, there were so many people on the bus, it couldn't bounce anymore. But the bus driver had an idea. He said to the people, "If everyone stands up, we can still bounce!"
Everyone when the driver said "Bounce!" and everyone on the bus jumped up. The bus began bouncing again! Everyone on the bus cheered and laughed, and everyone had lots of fun. The bus bounced around the town until every person was happy and had enough fun.
