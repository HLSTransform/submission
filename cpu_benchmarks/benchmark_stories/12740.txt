Once there was a clever little girl named Sally. One day it was her birthday and she was so excited! She quickly got dressed for the day, put on her shoes and ran outside to explore. 
On her way, she came across a big, red door. She thought to herself, "What could be behind this door?" Sally reached her hand out to open it, but it was shut tight. Suddenly, a voice called out behind her.
"Wait!" said the voice. Sally turned around to see a small fairy. "I can help you open the door! Close your eyes and count to ten - when you open them, the door will be open!"
Sally did as the fairy said. She counted to ten and when she opened her eyes, the big red door was wide open! Sally could not believe it, she was so clever! She stepped inside the door and saw the most magical sight - there was a birthday cake with all her favorite colors and flavors. She had the best birthday ever.
