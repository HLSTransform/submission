Once upon a time, there was a big jungle with lots of wild animals. One day, a monkey named Timmy wanted to look pretty like his friends. He asked his mommy for some makeup, but she didn't have any. 
Timmy felt sad and left the jungle to find some makeup. He walked and walked until he found a store that sold makeup. He went inside and asked the lady if she could supply him with some makeup. 
But the lady said no because she didn't think monkeys should wear makeup. Timmy felt angry and sad at the same time. He went back to the jungle and told his friends about what happened. They all agreed that Timmy should be allowed to wear makeup if he wanted to. The next day, they surprised Timmy with a big basket full of makeup. Timmy was so happy and felt very pretty. From that day on, he always wore his makeup proudly in the jungle.
