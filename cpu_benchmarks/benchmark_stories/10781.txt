One day, a sweet dog named Max was playing in his yard. He liked to run, jump, and fetch his ball. Max had a lot of fun playing outside.
Max's friend, a little boy named Tim, came to play with him. Tim brought a video to watch with Max. They sat inside and watched the video together. It was a funny video with cats and dogs playing. Max and Tim laughed a lot.
While they were watching the video, Max started to sneeze. He sneezed so much that his nose tickled. Tim helped Max by giving him a tissue. They both laughed and went back to watching the video. Max felt happy to have such a good friend like Tim.
