Once upon a time there were two friends, one was called Sam and the other was called Grace. Sam and Grace were playing happily in the garden. Then, suddenly, a brilliant light started to fill the sky. It was so big and bright that it made Sam and Grace glow. 
"Look!", said Grace. "A tornado!"
The tornado moved swiftly across the sky and seemed to follow them as they ran around playing. Grace laughed and clapped her hands but Sam was scared. He thought that the tornado was too close and he started to cry. 
Grace felt sorry for Sam and dropped down next to him. She put her arms around him and said, "It's okay, Sam. The tornado won't hurt us, I promise."
Sam felt much better after that and soon the two were back to playing again. The tornado had gone and everything was peaceful once more. Sam and Grace hugged each other goodbye and headed off to their homes to get a good night's sleep.
