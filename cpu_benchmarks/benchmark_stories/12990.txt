Once upon a time, there was a girl who was very hungry. She asked her mom what she could have to eat, and her mom suggested a photo. So the girl picked up her camera and went outside to take some pictures.
She looked around and saw a bird, so she took a picture of it. Then she saw a flower, and she got a picture of it too. She kept going and soon she had lots of photos.
When the girl got back home, she was still hungry. Her mom looked at the photos and suggested that the girl could turn them into something to eat. So the girl used the photos to make a collage, and then she colored the collage with markers.
When she finished, she hung the collage on the wall. Then, she went and had a snack. She was so happy that her mom had suggested the photo. She wasn't hungry anymore!
