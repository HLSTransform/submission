Tom and Sue like to play with paper and crayons. They print many pictures of animals and flowers. They are happy and proud of their work. They want to show their mom and dad.
But mom and dad are busy. They are cleaning the house. They have a big mop and a bucket of water. They say they have no time to look at the pictures. They tell Tom and Sue to go to their room and be quiet.
Tom and Sue are sad and angry. They think mom and dad do not love them. They think their pictures are not good. They want to make mom and dad sorry. They have a bad idea.
They take the mop and the bucket of water. They go to the living room. They see the big sofa and the nice rug. They think they are perfect. They want to ruin them. They dip the mop in the water and splash it on the sofa and the rug. They make a big mess. They laugh and shout.
Mom and dad hear the noise. They run to the living room. They see the water and the dirt. They see the sofa and the rug. They are not perfect anymore. They are wet and stained. They see Tom and Sue with the mop and the bucket. They are very angry. They yell at Tom and Sue. They say they are naughty and mean. They say they have to go to bed without dinner. They say they have to throw away their pictures.
Tom and Sue are scared and sorry. They cry and say they are sorry. They say they love mom and dad. They say they love their pictures. But mom and dad do not listen. They take Tom and Sue to their room. They lock the door. They leave them alone.
Tom and Sue hug each other. They are hungry and cold. They have no pictures to look at. They have no mom and dad to hug them. They have a bad ending.
