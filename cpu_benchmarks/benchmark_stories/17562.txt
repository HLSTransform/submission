Anna likes to play in the garden. She likes to look at the flowers and the birds. She likes to find bugs and watch them. She thinks bugs are pretty and fun.
One day, she sees a big bug on a leaf. It has many legs and a shiny back. It looks like a little jewel. Anna wants to touch it. She reaches out her hand slowly.
"Anna, no!" Mommy says. She runs to Anna and pulls her hand away. "That is a bad bug. It can hurt you. It can bite you and make you sick. You have to leave it alone."
Anna frowns. She does not understand. Why is the bug bad? It is pretty and shiny. She wants to see it closer. She wants to be its friend.
"Mommy, why?" Anna asks. She looks at Mommy with big eyes.
Mommy hugs Anna. She tries to explain. "Some bugs are good, some bugs are bad. Good bugs help the flowers and the plants. Bad bugs hurt the flowers and the plants. And they can hurt us too. We have to be careful with bugs. We have to respect them and their space. Do you understand?"
Anna nods. She understands a little. She still thinks the bug is pretty, but she does not want to touch it anymore. She wants to be safe and healthy. She wants Mommy to be happy.
"Okay, Mommy. I will be careful. Can we look at other bugs?" Anna asks.
Mommy smiles. She is proud of Anna. She loves her very much. "Yes, we can. But only from a distance. And only the good bugs. Come, let's go find some." She takes Anna's hand and they walk to another part of the garden. They see a butterfly, a ladybug, and a bee. Anna likes them. She thinks they are pretty and fun too.
