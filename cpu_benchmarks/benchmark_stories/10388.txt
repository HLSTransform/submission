Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big rope hanging from a tree. They want to swing on it.
"Can I go first?" Lily asks.
"OK, but be careful," Ben says.
Lily runs to the rope and grabs it. She swings high and low. She feels happy and free.
"Wow, you are good at swinging!" Ben says.
"Thank you. Your turn now," Lily says.
She lets go of the rope and lands on the grass. She gives the rope to Ben.
Ben swings on the rope too. He tries to go higher than Lily. He laughs and shouts.
Lily watches him and smiles. She sees a big bush near the tree. She has an idea.
"I'm going to hide. You have to find me," she says.
She runs to the bush and crawls inside. She thinks Ben will not see her.
Ben stops swinging and looks around. He does not see Lily.
"Where are you, Lily?" he calls.
He hears a giggle from the bush. He knows where she is.
He runs to the bush and tries to get in. But the bush is too small for him. He does not fit.
"Lily, come out. I found you," he says.
Lily comes out of the bush. She is proud of her hiding spot.
"You are good at hiding," Ben says.
"Thank you. You are good at swinging," Lily says.
They hug and smile. They are happy. They play some more.
