Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She loved to help her mom in the kitchen. Every day, she helped fold the laundry and set the table.
One day, when Sarah was in the kitchen, her mom asked her to get the sauce from the refrigerator. Sarah opened the door and grabbed the jar. When she opened it, to her surprise, it was very spicy. She didn't like spicy food.
"Mom, this sauce is too spicy," Sarah said.
"That's okay sweetheart," her mother replied. "You can put a little at a time and mix it with something else."
Sarah took her mom's advice and added a tiny bit of the spicy sauce to her food. It made the bland food tastier. From then on, Sarah realized that a little bit of something spicy can make all the difference.
The moral of the story is that a little bit of spice can help make something better.
