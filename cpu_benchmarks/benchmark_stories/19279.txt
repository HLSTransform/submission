Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lizzie. She had a bad day at school. Lizzie was very sad.
She walked out of the school and saw her favorite staff. It made her feel better. She ran to it, but the door was closed. She felt terrible!
Lizzie looked around and saw the janitor. She asked him to please open the door. He smiled and said "Yes". He opened the door and Lizzie ran in. She hugged her staff and played with it.
Finally, Lizzie was happy again. She waved goodbye to the janitor and went home smiling. Everything was good in the end.
