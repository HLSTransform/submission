Molly was skipping in her garden when she heard a strange buzzing sound. She looked up and saw a mosquito flying around. She scampered away, trying to get away from the mosquito.
Molly's mum was nearby, watching her in the garden. She said to Molly, "I know you are scared of the mosquito darling, but don't worry, if you rest it will go away."
Molly felt a bit better but was still scared. Then she remembered there was some sweet cake in the kitchen. She quickly went inside to get some.
When she came back to the garden, the mosquito was still there. Molly got angry and yelled, "Go away!" But the mosquito did not seem to care. Molly tried to chase it away but it kept flying around.
Finally, after a few minutes, the mosquito was still there and Molly was too tired to keep chasing it. In the end, she had to go back inside her house, leaving the mosquito to rest in the garden.
