Once upon a time, there was a small duck. The duck liked to play in the pond with his friends. One day, the duck saw some oil on the water. The oil made it hard for the duck to swim and play. 
The duck tried to move away from the oil, but it was everywhere. Then, the duck saw a big rock. The duck had an idea! The duck pushed the rock into the oil. The rock made a big wave and pushed the oil away. 
The duck was happy! The pond was clean again and the duck could play with his friends. The duck learned that sometimes, when there is a problem, you can push something to make it better.
