Once upon a time there lived a little girl called Lucy who made a mistake. She felt very ashamed of herself and did not understand why she had done it.
One day her mum called her over. "Lucy, do you know why I work so hard?" she asked.
"No, mum," Lucy replied.
"My job is to look after our family," her mum said. "It's my job to make sure we are all safe and happy. Do you understand?"
Lucy nodded. "Yes, mum."
Suddenly Lucy felt a lot less ashamed and hugged her mum. She realised that it was important to always be good and do her best, so she could help her mum with her job.
The End.
