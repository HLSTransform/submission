Once there was a little boy named John. He was only three years old and loved tomatoes. One day, John set out in search of a juicy red tomato. He went to the store, but couldn't find the important tomato he was looking for.
He felt a bit discouraged, but continued his journey. Suddenly, he spotted a big garden in the distance. He ran towards the garden and there he saw lots of tomatoes settling on the ground!
John ran to the garden and picked up the juiciest tomato he could find. He hugged the tomato and was so happy he had found what he was looking for. John went home with a big smile on his face. He had settled for the perfect tomato!
