Once upon a time, there was a kind dog named Spot. Spot liked to play with his friends in the park. One day, Spot saw a little bird who was sad. Spot asked the bird why he was sad. The bird said he lost his family and didn't know where to go. Spot was compassionate and wanted to help the bird.
Spot asked his friends if they knew where the bird's family was. One friend said he saw a bird family in the tree by the pond. Spot and the bird went to the tree, but the family was gone. The bird was sad again.
Spot said, "Don't worry, I will support you and we will find a new family for you." They searched and searched, but no family was found. The bird was still sad and missed his family. Spot said, "Let's go back to the park, maybe we will find your family there tomorrow."
The next day, the bird was gone. Spot and his friends searched for the bird, but he was nowhere to be found. Spot said, "I'm sad we couldn't find his family. It's okay though, we will remember him and his history of being a part of our park."
