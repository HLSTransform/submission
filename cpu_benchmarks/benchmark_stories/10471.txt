Once upon a time, there was a famous fly. He was so famous that everyone knew his name. He could fly high above the clouds and explore the world. 
One day, he saw a big balloon. He wanted to fly in it and he pushed it with all his might. Eventually, he was able to push it so far that it went higher and higher until it was above the clouds. 
Once he was up there, he looked around and saw some beautiful colours. He flew around and around, feeling so free and happy in the clouds. 
Eventually, the famous fly got tired and he pushed the balloon down to the ground. He landed safely and said goodbye to the colourful world above the clouds.
