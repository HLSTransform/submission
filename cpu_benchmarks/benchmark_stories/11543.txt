Once upon a time, there was a nice musician. He liked to play songs on his guitar. People loved to hear him play.
One day, the musician went to the beach. He saw a big blue sea. He wanted to go swimming. So, he took a deep breath and dive into the water. The water was cool and fun.
After swimming, the musician sat on the sand. He played his guitar and sang a song about his dive. Everyone clapped and danced to his music. They all had a great day at the beach.
