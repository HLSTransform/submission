Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She was three years old and liked to explore outside. One day Sarah decided to go to the beach. When she got there she saw a lot of shrimp. She had never seen shrimp before so she was very excited. 
Sarah bent down and tried to pinch one of the shrimp. Suddenly, a bad crab crept out from underneath the sand and pinched Sarah's finger. She yelped in pain. 
"Why did the crab pinch me?" Sarah asked.
The crab scuttled away and called back, "I pinched you because I wanted the shrimp!" 
Sarah ran away quickly, then she found a bucket. She put some water in it and filled it with all the shrimp. Sarah decided to take the shrimp home and have a delicious shrimp dinner.
