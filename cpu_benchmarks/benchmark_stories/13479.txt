Once upon a time, there was a kind bear who lived in a cabin in the woods. Every day, he would wash his fur in the nearby river. One day, while he was washing, he heard a noise coming from the bushes. He went to investigate and found a lost rabbit. The bear was so kind that he offered to help the rabbit find his way home. They searched and searched until they finally found the rabbit's family. The rabbit was so happy to be reunited with his family and thanked the kind bear for helping him. From that day on, the bear and the rabbit became best friends and would often wash themselves together in the river.
