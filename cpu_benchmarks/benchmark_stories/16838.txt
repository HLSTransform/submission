Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to eat healthy food like carrots and broccoli. One day, Benny found a big squash in the garden. He wanted to eat it, but it was too big for him to eat alone. So, he asked his friends to help him sort it out.
Benny's friends helped him cut the squash into small pieces. They all sat down to eat the squash together. But, Benny had eaten too much squash and he started to feel sick. His friends tried to help him feel better, but it was too late. Benny had eaten too much and he got very sick.
In the end, Benny learned that even though squash is healthy, he needed to eat it in moderation. Benny's friends were sad that he got sick, but they knew that Benny would be okay. They promised to always help him sort his food and eat it in a healthy way.
