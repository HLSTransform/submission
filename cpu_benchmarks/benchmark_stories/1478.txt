Once upon a time there was a girl named Emily. Emily had a heavy shirt. She loved to play with it. Every day her mum would encourage her to put on her shirt. Emily was very happy to have it on because it made her look special and beautiful.
One day Emily decided to take her shirt outside and play with it in the garden. She loved to run around in her heavy shirt. It made her feel like a princess. Her mum watched Emily from the kitchen window and always made sure to encourage her.
One day, Emily found a little bird in the garden and wanted to be his friend. The little bird was very scared at first, but Emily gently encouraged the little bird to come to her. Soon enough, the little bird was hopping all around Emily's heavy shirt.
Emily and the little bird became best friends. From that day on, Emily would always encourage the little bird whenever it was scared. Emily was very happy to have a special friend and have her heavy shirt to play in.
