Once upon a time, there was a naughty bear called Steve. He lived in a big house and one of the rooms had a tall bookcase. Every day, Steve would demand the bookcase to move, but nothing ever happened.
One night, Steve heard a noise coming from the bookcase. He went to investigate, and found a little mouse called Pete. Pete was standing inside the bookcase looking very scared.
"Will you make the bookcase move?" said Steve. Pete was so afraid he said nothing.
So Steve tried a different approach. He asked politely. "Please, will you make the bookcase move?" he said.
Pete smiled and ran around the back of the bookcase. All of the sudden, there was a loud creaking noise and the bookcase moved. Steve was so happy that he hugged Pete.
From that day on, Steve was never naughty again. He never demanded the bookcase to move, instead he always asked Pete politely - and the bookcase always moved.
