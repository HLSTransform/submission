Once upon a time, there was a cute little bunny named Fluffy. Fluffy had a very unique style of hopping, which made him stand out from other bunnies. One day, Fluffy met a friendly squirrel named Sammy. Sammy was so adorable that Fluffy wanted to be friends with him.
Fluffy and Sammy played together all day long, but as the sun started to set, Fluffy realized he was lost. He didn't know how to get back home. Fluffy started to shout for help, but no one came to his rescue.
Suddenly, Sammy remembered that he had seen Fluffy's home earlier that day. He showed Fluffy the way, and Fluffy was so happy that he hopped in his unique style all the way home. From that day on, Fluffy and Sammy were the best of friends and played together every day.
