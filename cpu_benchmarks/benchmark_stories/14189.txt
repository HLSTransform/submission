Once upon a time, there was a boy named Mike who loved to test everything. One day, he decided to test the smoothness of his mom's lips. He couldn't resist. He ran up to her, puckered his lips, and planted a big kiss on her cheek!
Mom was a bit surprised. She asked, "What do you think you're doing, Mike?!"
Mike smiled, pointing to his lips. "I wanted to test how nice and smooth your lips were!"
Mom couldn't help but laugh. She said, "This isn't something you should be testing, my little man. Now, if you want to test something, why don't we go find a smoothie together? That's something you can test!"
Mike looked up at his mom and smiled. He knew that she was only trying to set him up for something special. Little did he know, but his mom had been planning a big surprise for him the whole time â€“ a special smoothie that he would never forget!
