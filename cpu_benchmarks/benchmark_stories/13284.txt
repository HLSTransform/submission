Peter was an eager boy. He loved to explore the world around him.
Today, Peter was at the park. He pointed at the birds in the sky, asking his mom what they were called. She said they were seagulls.
Peter started to run around the park. He pointed at a little river and asked "What is that?" His mom said it was a stream.
Peter wanted to jump in, but his mom said no. She told him he couldn't jump in because it was too cold.
So instead, Peter decided to go on a hunt. He pointed at the trees and bushes and asked his mom if there were any animals hiding. She said no, not yet. But later they might find some! 
Peter was so eager to find animals that he kept looking and looking as they walked. Soon, they might spot one!
