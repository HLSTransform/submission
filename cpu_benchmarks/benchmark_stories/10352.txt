Anna loves to read books. She likes to look at the pictures and the words on the pages. She has many books in her room, but her favorite one is about a princess and a dragon.
One day, Anna wants to read her favorite book to her little brother, Ben. She finds the book on her shelf and sits on the floor with Ben. She opens the book and starts to read.
"Once upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a castle. She was very kind and brave, but she was also very stubborn. She always wanted to do things her way."
Ben listens to Anna for a while, but he gets bored. He does not like the princess. He likes the dragon. He wants to see the dragon. He grabs the book from Anna and flips the pages.
"Stop it, Ben!" Anna says. "You are ruining the book! You have to read it from the beginning!"
"No, I don't!" Ben says. "I want to see the dragon! The dragon is cool! The princess is boring!"
Anna and Ben start to fight over the book. They pull and tug and shout. The book rips in half. The pages fly everywhere. Anna and Ben stop fighting. They look at the book. They feel sad.
"I'm sorry, Anna," Ben says. "I didn't mean to rip your book."
"I'm sorry, too, Ben," Anna says. "I should have let you see the dragon."
They hug each other. They pick up the pages and try to put them back together. They decide to share the book and take turns reading. They learn that the princess and the dragon become friends at the end. They smile and say, "We love this book!"
