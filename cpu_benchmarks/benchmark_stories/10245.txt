Once upon a time, there was a man who had a small taxi. The taxi was not very big, but it was very modest. One day, the man went for a ride in his taxi. He drove around the town and saw many things. He saw a big park, a tall building and many people walking on the street.
After some time, the man decided to release a bird that he had in a cage. The bird was very happy to be free and flew away. The man felt happy too because he knew the bird was now free to fly wherever it wanted. The man then drove his taxi back home and went to sleep. The end.
