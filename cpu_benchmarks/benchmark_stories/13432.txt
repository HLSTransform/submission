Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She wanted to buy a long candy cane from the store. She asked her mommy if they could go to the store to buy it. Her mommy said yes and they went to the store.
At the store, Lily saw a big brain on a shelf. She asked her mommy what it was. Her mommy told her it was a toy brain for learning. Lily thought it was cool and wanted to buy it too.
Finally, they found the candy canes. Lily picked a long one and was so happy. She held the candy cane in one hand and the toy brain in the other. She couldn't wait to play and learn with her new toy brain.
