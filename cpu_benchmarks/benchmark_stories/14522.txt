Once there was a tough cable. It was so tough that it could shine even in the darkest places. One day it decided to go on an adventure. It travelled down steep hills, over valleys and up high mountains.
As it travelled, it shone brightly. Everywhere it went people stopped and looked. They were amazed at how it could brighten up the world.
Finally, the tough cable reached the top of the highest mountain. It shone so brightly that its light reached the stars in the sky. It was so happy. It was proud of its journey and the places it had seen.
The brave cable stayed there, shining with courage and happiness forever.
