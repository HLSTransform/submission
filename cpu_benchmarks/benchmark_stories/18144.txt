Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little stone. This stone was very popular. All the kids liked to play with it. They would smile when they saw the stone. One day, the stone went missing. The kids were sad and did not smile.
A little girl named Lucy went looking for the stone. She asked her friends if they saw the stone. No one knew where it was. Lucy felt sad but did not give up. She thought she would find the stone soon.
One sunny day, Lucy found the stone under a big tree. She was so happy and smiled big. Lucy showed the stone to her friends. They all smiled too. The popular stone was back, and the kids could play with it again. From that day on, they took care of the stone so it would not get lost again.
