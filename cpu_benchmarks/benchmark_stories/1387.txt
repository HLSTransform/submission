Once there was a little boy named Joe. He was a very shy boy and never wanted to talk to anyone. One day, his mommy had a great idea! She told him he should go outside and play with some of the other kids. Joe was scared, but he wanted to have fun.
So, he bravely stepped outside and saw some of his school friends. They waved to him and asked him to come play with them. Joe was very shy, but he was also curious. He slowly started walking towards them.
Suddenly, Joe tripped and fell to the ground. He was embarrassed and wanted to hide. But then the other kids started laughing and it made him feel better. Now they were all playing together and Joe was having so much fun. 
The idea of having fun outside made Joe feel much more brave. He wasn't so shy anymore and was even suggesting ideas to the group. It was a wonderful day and Joe was so glad that he had gone outside.
