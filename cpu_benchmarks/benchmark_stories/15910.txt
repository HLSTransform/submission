Once there was a boy called Tim. He was only three years old and he liked spending time with his dad. One day Tim asked his dad if they could go to the river and fish. His dad smiled and said yes because it was a really good day. 
They got to the river and Tim's dad took out his fishing rod and a big spear.Tim watched carefully as his dad put the spear in the water. Tim wanted to try it too so his dad taught him how to hold it and cast it out. 
It was very hard work, but Tim spent a long time trying to get the spear in the right spot. Suddenly, there was a big splash and Tim shouted, "I got one daddy!" Sure enough, there was a nice fish on the end of the spear. 
Tim and his dad laughed together. They took the fish home and cooked it up for a good lunch. Tim and his dad enjoyed the fish, and Tim was very proud of catching it with his spear. It was a very good day.
