Henry and Susie were playing together. They saw some colourful strips on the ground. Henry thought it was impressive and wanted to cover it all up. So he began to cover the ground with the strips. Susie wanted to help, and soon they were both covering the ground.
They worked and worked until they had used up all the strips they could find. It looked great! Henry was so proud of their work, so they both danced around the amazing and impressive pattern they had made.
The friends knew they wouldn't be able to cover the same ground again, so they treated it very carefully and slowly walked off back home.
