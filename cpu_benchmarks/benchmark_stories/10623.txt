Once upon a time there was a little girl named Daisy. She was only three years old and she liked to explore. One day she was exploring her backyard when she found a bottle. She picked it up and was just about to open it when she heard a voice.
"Daisy, don't open that!" It was Daisy's mom.
Daisy put the bottle down and said, "Why mommy?"
"Because that bottle is dirty," her mom said.
So Daisy's mom grabbed a cloth and wet it with water. Then she set it to the bottle and cleaned it until it was sparkly and clean. 
"Now it's much better," her mom said.
Daisy smiled and thanked her mom. Then she set the bottle on the ground and watched as butterflies came to drink the water in it. She was very happy to see the butterflies settle in her bottle. 
The end.
