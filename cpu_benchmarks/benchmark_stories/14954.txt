Once there was a little girl named Abigail. She always wanted to sail away in a boat. One day she asked her parents if she could take the boat for a sail. They said yes, but to be careful.
Abigail was so excited! She wrapped up a few snacks, then she hopped into the boat. She sailed fast and far away, until she couldn't see her parents anymore.
Abigail loved her adventure. But then the wind got stronger and the boat tipped over. Abigail was scared and began to cry. She grabbed onto a wrap, then hung on as tight as she could.
After a long time, Abigail was finally rescued and brought back to shore. Her parents were relieved, but Abigail was sad. She never got to sail away in her boat again.
