Anna and Ben were friends who liked to play outside. One day, they went to the ocean with their parents. They saw the big blue water and the white waves. They wanted to swim and have fun.
"Look, there is a boat!" Ben said. He pointed to a small boat that was near the shore. "Let's go and see it!"
Anna nodded. She liked boats. They ran to the boat and climbed inside. They pretended to be sailors and pirates. They laughed and shouted.
But they did not see that the boat was not tied to anything. The waves pushed the boat away from the shore. Soon, they were in the middle of the ocean. They were scared and cold. They cried for help.
"Help! Help!" they screamed. But no one heard them. The boat was too small and too far.
Then, they saw a big fish. It was gray and had a fin on its back. It was a shark. It swam fast and came closer to the boat. It opened its mouth and showed its teeth. It wanted to eat them.
"Help! Help!" they screamed louder. They were very scared.
But then, they heard another sound. It was a horn. It was a big boat. It was a rescue boat. The people on the boat saw them and came to help. They threw a rope and pulled them in. They were safe.
"Are you okay?" one of the people asked. He was a man with a hat and a badge. He was a coast guard.
"Yes, we are okay," Anna and Ben said. They were happy and relieved.
"What were you doing in that boat?" the man asked. He was not happy. He was angry.
"We wanted to play," Anna and Ben said. They were sorry and ashamed.
"That was very foolish and dangerous," the man said. "You should never go into a boat without permission and supervision. The ocean is not a playground. It can be very dangerous. There are waves and currents and sharks and other things that can hurt you. You are lucky that we found you in time. You could have drowned or been eaten."
Anna and Ben nodded. They understood. They were very foolish and dangerous.
"We are sorry," they said. "We will never do that again."
"Good," the man said. "Now, let me take you back to your parents. They must be very worried."
He drove the boat back to the shore. Anna and Ben saw their parents. They ran to them and hugged them. They told them what happened. They apologized and promised to be more careful.
Their parents were angry and scared. But they were also happy and grateful. They thanked the coast guard and the rescue boat. They hugged Anna and Ben and took them home.
Anna and Ben learned a lesson. They learned to respect the ocean and to listen to their parents. They learned to be more careful and responsible. They learned that playing is fun, but safety is important.
The moral of the story is: Do not go into a boat without permission and supervision. The ocean is not a playground. It can be very dangerous. Be careful and responsible. Listen to your parents and the coast guard. They know what is best for you and they want to keep you safe.
