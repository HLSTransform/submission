Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved waffles more than anything in the world. Every morning, her mommy made her waffles for breakfast. They were so yummy!
One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. She saw a little boy playing with a toy car. The boy looked sad because he had lost his toy. Lily knew how that felt because once she lost her favorite doll. She went up to the boy and asked if the toy car belonged to him. The boy nodded and smiled.
Lily felt happy that she helped the boy find his toy. She went back to her mommy and ate her waffles. She felt tight and warm inside knowing she did something nice for someone else. From that day on, Lily knew that helping others made her feel good too.
