Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play hide-and-seek with her friends. One day, while playing in the park, Lily's friend Emily hid behind a big tree. Lily searched and searched but she couldn't find Emily. She felt sad because she had lost her friend.
But then, Lily heard a giggle coming from behind the tree. She peeked around the corner and saw Emily's big smile. "You found me!" Emily said. Lily was happy again because she had found her friend.
Later that day, Lily's mom asked her if she knew what the word "ignorant" meant. Lily didn't know, so her mom explained that it meant not knowing something. Lily thought about it and realized that she had been ignorant when she couldn't find Emily. But now she knew where Emily was hiding and she felt proud of herself for finding her friend.
