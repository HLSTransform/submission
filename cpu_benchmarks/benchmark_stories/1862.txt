Once upon a time there was a beetle that liked to go out and play in the rain. Little did the beetle know that the rain would hurt it and so it ended up getting drenched.
The beetle wanted to find some shelter but there was none in sight. It was scared and started to shiver. But then it overheard a little girl talking.
"Mommy, why is the beetle so wet?" asked the little girl.
"Because it's raining," said her mom.
The beetle was relieved and quickly ran towards their porch. 
The little girl and her mom opened the door and allowed the little beetle to come in. 
The beetle was so happy that it thanked the little girl and her mom as it quickly scurried away and found a nice dry spot to rest.
