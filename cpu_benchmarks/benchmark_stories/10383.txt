Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play together. One day, they saw a big box in the living room. They wondered what was inside. They asked their mom, but she said it was a surprise.
"Can we open it, please?" Tom begged.
"No, you have to wait until dad comes home. He has some news for you," mom said.
Tom and Lily were curious. They wanted to know the news. They hoped it was something amazing, like a new toy or a trip to the zoo. They decided to sneak a peek at the box while mom was busy in the kitchen.
They lifted the lid and saw a lot of fur and a wet nose. It was a puppy! They were so happy. They hugged the puppy and gave it a name. They called it Spot.
"Look, mom, look! We found a puppy in the box! He is so cute and soft! Can we keep him?" Lily shouted.
Mom came running to the living room. She looked shocked and angry. She took the puppy from their arms and put it back in the box.
"No, you can't keep him! He is not yours! He is a gift for your cousin Jake, who is sick in the hospital. You were not supposed to open the box! You ruined the surprise!" mom scolded.
Tom and Lily felt sad and sorry. They started to cry. They wanted to keep the puppy. They did not like their cousin Jake. He was mean and bossy. He always complained when they visited him.
"Why do we have to give him the puppy? He does not deserve it! He will not take good care of him! He will make him unhappy!" Tom protested.
"Stop it, Tom! You are being selfish and rude! Jake needs the puppy more than you. He has no friends and he is very lonely. The puppy will cheer him up and make him feel better. You should be happy for him, not jealous. Now go to your room and think about what you did. You are both grounded for a week. No TV, no games, no snacks. And no more puppies!" mom said.
Tom and Lily went to their room, sobbing. They hated their mom. They hated their cousin Jake. They hated the news. They wished they never opened the box. They wished they had the puppy. They wished they had an amazing surprise. But they had none. They had nothing.
