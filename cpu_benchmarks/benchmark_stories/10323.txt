Sara and Ben are at the park with Mom. They see a big truck with a picture of ice cream on it. They run to the truck and ask Mom for some ice cream.
"Can we have ice cream, Mom? Please, please, please!" they say.
Mom smiles and says, "OK, but only one cone each. What flavor do you want?"
Sara wants chocolate and Ben wants vanilla. The ice cream man scoops the ice cream and puts it on the cones. He gives Sara and Ben their cones and says, "Here you go, kids. Enjoy your ice cream."
Sara and Ben say, "Thank you, ice cream man!" and lick their cones. They are very happy and yummy.
But then, a big black dog comes to the park. He sees the ice cream and he wants some too. He runs to Sara and Ben and barks loudly. He tries to grab their cones with his mouth.
"Hey, stop it, dog! This is our ice cream!" Sara and Ben shout.
Mom sees the dog and says, "Shoo, shoo, go away, dog! You can't have their ice cream. It's not good for you."
The dog does not listen. He jumps on Sara and Ben and knocks them down. Their cones fall to the ground and the ice cream melts.
Sara and Ben cry. They are sad and mad. The dog licks the ice cream and wags his tail. He is happy and full.
The ice cream man sees what happened and says, "Oh, no, I'm sorry, kids. That was a bad dog. He shouldn't have done that. Here, I'll give you new cones. What flavor do you want?"
Sara and Ben wipe their tears and say, "Thank you, ice cream man. You are very nice. We want the same flavors as before."
The ice cream man scoops the ice cream and puts it on the cones. He gives Sara and Ben their cones and says, "Here you go, kids. Enjoy your ice cream. And be careful of the dog. He is very big and he weighs a lot. He can hurt you if he jumps on you."
Sara and Ben say, "Thank you, ice cream man. We will be careful. And we will share our ice cream with you if you want."
The ice cream man smiles and says, "No, thank you, kids. I have enough ice cream. But I appreciate your offer. You are very sweet."
Sara and Ben lick their cones and smile. They are happy and yummy again. They hug Mom and say, "We love you, Mom. And we love ice cream."
Mom hugs them back and says, "I love you too, Sara and Ben. And I love ice cream too. But not as much as I love you."
