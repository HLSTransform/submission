Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden. One day, she found a pebble on the ground. It was so pretty and shiny. She picked it up and showed it to her mom. 
"Look, Mommy! I found a pretty pebble!" said Lily. 
Her mom smiled and said, "That's so nice, Lily. But be careful, don't break it." 
Lily nodded and put the pebble in her pocket. She played for a while and then went back inside. But when she took the pebble out of her pocket, she saw that it was broken! 
"Oh no! My pretty pebble is broken!" cried Lily. 
Her mom came over and saw what had happened. "Oh dear, what happened?" 
"I don't know. Maybe I was naughty and broke it," said Lily sadly. 
"Don't worry, Lily. We can find another pretty pebble. But remember, we must be careful and not break it," said her mom. 
Lily nodded and smiled. She knew she had learned an important lesson.
