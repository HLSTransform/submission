Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweetie. Tweetie lived in a nest high up in a tree. She was glad because the nest was cozy and warm.
One day, Tweetie saw a big, scary cat walking towards her tree. She knew she had to fly away fast. But Tweetie had never flown far before. She decided to jog around the tree to practice her wings.
The next day, the cat came back. Tweetie was ready. She flapped her wings and flew away from the nest, just in time to escape the cat's claws. From that day on, Tweetie was always ready to fly away and she was glad she had practiced jogging.
