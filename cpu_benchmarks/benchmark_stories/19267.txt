Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy. She was three years old and loved to whistle as she walked. 
One day, Lucy heard a high-pitched whistling coming from a nearby hill. Intrigued, she decided to investigate. 
When Lucy reached the top of the hill, she was amazed to see a treasure chest! And it was still whistling. Lucy opened the chest carefully and discovered a carelessly hidden message.
The message said that this treasure was only for brave adventurers who could solve a secret puzzle. Lucy was determined to unlock the puzzle and find the treasure. 
After a few days of contemplation, Lucy hit upon the solution. She opened the chest and was thrilled to find enough treasure to last her a lifetime.
Lucy smiled at her good luck, and then quickly made her way back home whistling all the way.
