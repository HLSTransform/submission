Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she found a mysterious box in her backyard. She opened it and saw a piece of chalk inside. She didn't know what to do with it, so she asked her mom.
"What is this, Mommy?" Lily asked.
"It's chalk," her mom replied.
Lily didn't believe her, so she decided to draw on the sidewalk with it. As she drew, she noticed that the chalk was magical. It made her drawings come to life!
Lily was so happy and amazed. She couldn't wait to draw more with her mysterious chalk. From that day on, she believed in magic and knew that anything was possible.
