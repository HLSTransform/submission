Once there was a large kite. Every day it flew high in the sky and waved in the wind. Everyone loved to watch the kite.
One day a small boy saw the kite flying in the sky. He was so excited he started to clap his hands. He kept clapping until the kite flew down from the sky.
The little boy ran to the kite and held it. He was so happy. He petted it and held it and clapped his hands.
Soon the little boy started running with the kite. He ran in circles, clapping his hands and laughing. The large kite flew higher and higher in the sky. All the people who saw this felt so happy. They too clapped their hands! 
The little boy and the large kite played together until it was time to go home. He thanked the kite for the wonderful time, hugged it and ran off. He knew he would be back to play with his large kite again soon.
