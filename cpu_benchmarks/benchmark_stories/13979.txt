Once upon a time, there was a big bear who lived in the forest. The bear was very fierce and had a loud roar. One day, it started to rain and the bear needed a shelter to stay dry. It looked around and found a cave where it could hide. 
As the bear was sitting in the cave, it saw a little bird flying by. The bear wanted to play a joke on the bird, so it pretended to be asleep. The bird saw the bear and thought it was really sleeping. The bird then flew into the cave and started singing loudly. The bear suddenly jumped up and scared the bird. 
The bird flew away quickly and the bear laughed at the joke it played. It was happy to have a shelter from the rain and a fun time playing jokes. The end.
