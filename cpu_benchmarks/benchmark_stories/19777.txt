Ben was very happy. He had a powerful bike - bigger than all the other kids. But last week it had broken and he couldn't ride it.
Ben was sad, until a kind man stopped to say hello. The man said his name was Larry and he had a post that he could lend Ben. Ben was excited and said thank you.
Larry helped Ben fix his bike with the post. It was now even more powerful than before. Ben jumped on the bike and went for a ride.
He waved goodbye to Larry and promised to return the post as soon as he could. Larry waved back and said it was no problem.
From that day on, Ben made sure to always be kind to others, just like Larry.
