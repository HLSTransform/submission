Jim was in the garden with his Grandma. He liked spending time with her there. They looked at the flowers and the trees. Jim saw a big prune tree. He loved seeing the trees in the garden.
Jim asked if he could pick one of the prunes. Grandma said yes, so Jim carefully climbed the tree. He looked at all the prunes and found the biggest one. He carefully picked it and climbed back down.
Jim was feeling very proud of himself. Grandma looked at him with a smile and gave him a big hug. It felt so calm and peaceful just being in the garden with Grandma. They spent the rest of the morning talking and enjoying being in the sunshine.
