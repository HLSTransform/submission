Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Lucy. She loved to explore the world around her.
One day, Lucy saw a zigzag in a field. She carefully leaned down and touched it. She thought it was so cool!
Next, Lucy decided to follow the zigzag. She leaned this way and that way and explored all the shapes that the zigzag made. She was so thoughtful and curious as she explored.
Finally, Lucy came to the end of the zigzag and smiled. She was so happy with the journey she had taken. She leaned down and gave the zigzag a thank-you hug before she ran off to explore more of her world.
