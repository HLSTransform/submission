John wanted to explore the world around him. He looked out of his window and noticed a pond. He paused to take it all in. "I'm going to go explore the pond," said John.
He got dressed in his warm coat and hat, then grabbed his bucket and set off. When he got to the pond, he smiled widely. He could see so many things. He put his bucket down and ventured into the pond.
He saw dragonflies and frogs, and several tiny fish swimming all around. He even found a rock, which he took home with him. 
On his way back home, he noticed a big, strong horse. The horse seemed kind and quite reliable. John was very excited to meet the horse. He petted the horse and after a while they both felt a connection. 
Since then, he visits the horse and pond regularly and always takes his bucket with him. The pond and the horse have both become very reliable friends!
