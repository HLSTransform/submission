Once upon a time, there was a nurse. She lived in a big house with a bell that would ring when anyone arrived. One day, the bell began to ring, and the nurse went to answer it. When she opened the door, there was a tall man wearing a red coat. He was carrying a big bag of spicy food. He handed the nurse the bag with a big smile. 
The nurse was so happy with the man's surprise that she wanted to share it with everyone. She quickly took some of the spicy food and rang a bell to call everyone in the house. All of the kids rushed to the kitchen to find the nurse with the spicy food. 
Everyone cheered when they saw it, and they all started to eat the spicy food. They loved it and said it was the best food they have ever tasted! The nurse also loved it, and she thanked the man for his kind gift. From that day on, the nurse had a big smile on her face whenever she heard the bell ring. 
The end.
