Once upon a time, there was a clumsy bear named Bob. Bob loved to take pictures of the flowers in the forest. One day, Bob saw a butterfly and tried to take its picture, but he was too clumsy and fell down. 
Suddenly, a fox appeared and wanted to take Bob's camera. Bob was scared, but he knew he had to be brave. He decided to surrender his camera to the fox. 
The fox took the camera and ran away. Bob was sad, but he knew he still had the memories of the flowers he had taken pictures of. From that day on, Bob learned to be more careful and never let go of his camera again. The end.
