Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the store with her mommy. One day, they went to the store to buy some yummy fruits. While they were there, they saw a rude man who was shouting at the cashier. 
Lily's mommy told her that it's not nice to be rude to others. She said that we should always care about how we treat people. Lily agreed and smiled at the cashier to show that she cared. 
After they left the store, Lily's mommy told her how proud she was of her for being kind. Lily felt happy and proud too. From that day on, Lily always made sure to be kind to others and to care about their feelings.
