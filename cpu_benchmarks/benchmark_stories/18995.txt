Once upon a time, there was a big, brown dog named Max. Max loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Max's toy got stuck in a hole in the ground. Max tried and tried to get it out, but he couldn't. 
Max's owner, Sarah, took him to the office where her dad worked. There was a man there who could repair things. He looked at Max's toy and said, "I can fix this!" 
While they waited for the toy to be repaired, Max explored the office. He found a disgusting old sandwich on the floor and tried to eat it, but Sarah stopped him. Finally, the man came back with Max's toy. It was as good as new! Max was so happy that he wagged his tail and licked the man's face. From that day on, Max knew that if anything needed to be repaired, he could go to the office and find help.
