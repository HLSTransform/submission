Once there was a clown who didn't make people laugh. He was very dull and never smiled. He felt sad, but no one knew why.
One day, he went to the park where he met some children. He tried to make them laugh but they just weren't amused. They thought he was too dull.
Suddenly, one of the children stood up and started to applaud. All the other children followed her and they applauded too. The clown was so happy. He saw that they appreciated him after all and he smiled so much.
The children thought he was the funniest clown they had ever seen and they kept on applauding until he went away. The clown was so happy because he had made the children laugh.
