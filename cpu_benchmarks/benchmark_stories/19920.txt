Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play sports, but her ball was very dull. One day, she went to her friend's house to play. Her friend asked her, "Why is your ball so dull?" Lily replied, "I don't know, but I still love to play with it."
As they were playing, they heard a noise. Lily's friend said, "Let's peek through the window and see what it is." They saw a group of children playing with shiny, new balls. Lily's friend said, "Wow, those balls look so cool! I wish we had one."
Lily thought for a moment and said, "Even though our ball is dull, we still have fun playing with it. We don't need a shiny, new ball to have fun." Her friend smiled and said, "You're right, Lily. Our ball may be dull, but it's still a great sport to play. Let's keep playing and have fun together!" From that day on, they played with their dull ball and had just as much fun as the other children with their shiny, new balls. The moral of the story is that it's not what you have, but how you use it that counts.
