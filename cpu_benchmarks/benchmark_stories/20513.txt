Once there was a little girl called Louise who liked to dress up in funny clothes. Every day she would take out a different set of clothes from her wardrobe and act like she was a funny fashion show model. She would put the clothes on and strike funny poses in front of the mirror.
One day, Louise wanted to do something extra special with her fashion and get ready for a special occasion. She took out her favourite dress and put it on, along with a pretty ribbon. In her closet she found her mum's hat and put it on top, too. Louise felt like a real grown-up with all that fashion on.
She had finished getting ready and was so excited. Louise started to do her funny poses, but then she heard the doorbell ring. It was her grandpa who had come over to give her a surprise. Grandpa was amazed when he saw Louise dressed up in all that fashion. He said she looked beautiful and gave her a big hug.
Louise was very happy and proud that she had acted like a real fashionista. She couldn't wait to show her mum her ready outfit!
