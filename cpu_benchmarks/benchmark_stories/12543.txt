Lily likes to pick flowers. She likes to pick yellow flowers best. They are bright and pretty. She has a basket to put them in. She wants to give them to her mom.
One day, she goes to the park with her dad. She sees many yellow flowers there. She runs to pick them. She does not see the sign that says "Do not pick the flowers". She does not see the animal that lives in the flowers.
The animal is a bee. It is yellow and black. It does not like Lily picking its flowers. It gets angry. It flies out of the flower and stings Lily on her hand. Lily cries out loud. It hurts a lot.
Her dad hears her cry and runs to her. He sees the bee and the flowers. He sees the sign. He is not happy. He picks up Lily and takes her to the car. He says they have to go home. He says Lily was bad. He says she has to say sorry to the bee and the flowers.
Lily feels sad and sorry. She does not want to pick flowers anymore. She wants to hug her mom and make her hand feel better. She learns a lesson. She will not pick flowers that are not hers. She will be careful of animals that can hurt her. She will listen to signs and her dad. The end.
