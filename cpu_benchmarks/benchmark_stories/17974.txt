Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max was very popular in his home. He had many friends who loved to play with him. Max was a happy dog.
One day, Max saw a big ball stuck in a tree. He wanted to get the ball for his friends. Max tried to jump, but he could not reach the ball. Then, Max had an idea. He said to his friend, "Let's work together to get the ball."
Max and his friend jumped and jumped. They did not give up. At last, they succeed! They got the ball down from the tree. Max and his friend were very happy. They took the ball back to their home and played with it all day long.
