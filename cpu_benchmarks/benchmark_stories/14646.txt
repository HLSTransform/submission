Once upon a time there was a boy who loved to explore. He liked to go on adventures to find new and exciting things. He decided to go and explore the park one day.
The boy walked through the playground and when he reached the far corner he discovered a new model of car. It was shiny and colorful. He stroked the car with his hands and looked inside.
The boy was so excited he had found this model of car that he wanted to show it to all his friends. He ran to the nearby pond and made a bridge out of stones so he could cross it with the car.
When all his friends arrived, the boy proudly presented them with the model of the car he had just discovered. All of his friends were amazed and wanted to know where he had found it. The boy explained he had discovered the car in the corner of the playground.
The boy was so proud of have found the model of car and he was sure he was going to make more discoveries in the playground in the future.
