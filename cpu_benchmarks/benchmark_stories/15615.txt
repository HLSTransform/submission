Tom and Lily were playing in the kitchen. They liked to pretend they were cooks and make food with the pots and pans. Tom found a big pot and put it on his head. He said, "Look, I am a pot-head!"
Lily laughed and said, "No, you are not a pot-head. You are a silly boy. Give me the pot. I need it for my soup."
Tom did not want to give the pot. He said, "No, it is my pot. I found it first. You can use another pot."
Lily was angry. She said, "No, you are mean. I want that pot. It is the best pot. Give it to me now!"
Tom and Lily started to pull the pot from each other. They did not speak nicely. They shouted and cried. They made a lot of noise.
Mom heard the noise and came to the kitchen. She saw Tom and Lily fighting over the pot. She was angry too. She said, "Stop it, both of you! What are you doing? Why are you fighting over a pot?"
Tom and Lily stopped and looked at Mom. They felt sorry. They said, "We are sorry, Mom. We were playing and we wanted the same pot."
Mom said, "Playing is good, but fighting is bad. You have to share and speak kindly. There are many pots and pans in the kitchen. You can use any of them. But first, you have to say sorry to each other and give each other a hug."
Tom and Lily said sorry to each other and gave each other a hug. They said, "We love you, Mom. We love you, too."
Mom smiled and said, "I love you, too. Now, let's clean up the kitchen and then we can have some real soup."
