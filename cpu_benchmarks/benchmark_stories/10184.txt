Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very impatient because she wanted to go to the park to play with her friends. But her mom said she had to wait until after lunch.
Lily was so bored that she started playing with her dad's razor. She didn't know it was dangerous. She accidentally pinched her finger and it hurt a lot. She learned her lesson and promised to never touch sharp things again.
Finally, it was time to go to the park. Lily was so happy to see her friends and play on the swings. She forgot all about her impatience and enjoyed her day in the sun.
