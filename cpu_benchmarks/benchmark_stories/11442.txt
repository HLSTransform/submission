It was a sunny day and the sun was shining brightly on the town. High in the sky was a purple dinosaur, who was flying and singing. "I'm so happy in the sky! Look at me shine!"
Down in the town a young girl named Ella looked up and was amazed. She shouted up to the dinosaur, “Come down and play with me!” The dinosaur agreed and flew towards Ella in a spin, leaving a bright rainbow trail.
As the dinosaur swooped closer, Ella was filled with excitement and anticipation. When it finally landed and started to roar, she was so happy her eyes twinkled and she jumped up to hug it. 
The purple dinosaur felt so loved and they laughed and played together until the sun set. They jumped, spun and rolled around until they were both so tired they couldn't move.
The dinosaur gave Ella one last cuddle, then soared high above into the night sky and said “Look at me shine!” Ella waved goodbye, with a big smile on her face, moments after the sun lit up the sky around the dinosaur with a beautiful dazzling light.
