Lila and Ben are playing with clay in the garden. They make balls and snakes and stars with the clay. They are happy and laugh a lot.
"Look, I made a big ball!" Lila says, holding up her clay ball. "Can you catch it?"
She throws the ball to Ben, who tries to catch it with his hands. But the ball is too big and heavy, and it falls on the ground. It breaks into pieces and makes a mess.
"Oh no, your ball is broken!" Ben says, feeling sorry for Lila. "I'm sorry, I couldn't catch it."
Lila is sad and looks at her broken ball. She starts to cry.
"Don't cry, Lila. We can make another ball. Or something else. What do you want to make?" Ben says, trying to cheer her up.
Lila thinks for a moment. She wipes her tears and smiles.
"I want to make a hat. A clay hat. For you!" She says, picking up some clay.
"A hat? For me? Thank you, Lila. That's very nice of you." Ben says, feeling happy again.
Lila makes a hat with the clay. She shapes it like a cone and puts some flowers on it. She gives it to Ben.
"Here, try it on. Does it fit?" She says, hoping he likes it.
Ben puts the hat on his head. It is a bit big and wobbly, but he doesn't mind. He thinks it is a beautiful hat.
"It fits! It fits perfectly! Thank you, Lila. You are a great friend." He says, hugging her.
They both laugh and play with their clay hats. They are happy and have fun.
