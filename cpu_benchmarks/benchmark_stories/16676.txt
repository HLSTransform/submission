Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside with her toys. One day, she saw a big vehicle driving down the street. It was so loud that it disturbed her playtime. 
Lily went to her mom and said, "Mommy, the big car is making too much noise. It's disturbing me." 
Her mom replied, "I know, sweetie. Sometimes big vehicles can be loud and nervous for little kids like you. But don't worry, it will pass by soon and everything will be okay." 
Lily felt better after talking to her mom. She went back outside and continued playing with her toys. The vehicle passed by, but Lily wasn't nervous anymore. She was happy to be outside and having fun.
