Tom and Sam were brothers. They liked to play in the kitchen. They found a big pan on the stove. Tom wanted to bang the pan with a spoon. Sam wanted to wear the pan as a hat.
"Give me the pan!" Tom said. "I want to make noise!"
"No, give me the pan!" Sam said. "I want to be a king!"
They pulled the pan from each other. The pan was heavy and slippery. It fell on the floor with a loud clang. The noise made their mom come to the kitchen.
"What are you doing?" Mom asked. "Why are you fighting over the pan?"
Tom and Sam looked at each other. They felt sorry. They did not want to make mom angry.
"We were playing," Tom said.
"We were having fun," Sam said.
Mom smiled. She picked up the pan and hugged the boys.
"I'm glad you were playing and having fun," Mom said. "But the pan does not belong to you. It belongs to me. I use it to cook yummy food for you. Do you want to help me cook?"
Tom and Sam nodded. They liked to help mom cook. They followed her to the counter. Mom gave them each a bowl and a spoon. She showed them how to mix flour and eggs and milk. They made a batter for pancakes.
"Good job, boys!" Mom said. "You are very successful cooks!"
Tom and Sam smiled. They were happy. They did not need the pan to play. They had mom and each other. They belonged to a family.
