Once upon a time, in a tiny cell, there lived a gentle little bug. This bug loved to dance more than anything else. Every day, it would dance and dance, making its cell a very happy place.
One day, the gentle bug met a new friend. This friend was a tiny ant who also loved to dance. They danced together all day long, and their cell became even happier.
As they danced, more and more friends came to join them. Soon, their cell was filled with gentle bugs and ants, all dancing together. And they all lived happily ever after, dancing in their happy little cell.
