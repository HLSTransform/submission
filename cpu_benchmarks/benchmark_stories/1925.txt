Ryan and his Dad were in the car. Ryan was asking lots of questions.
“Daddy, where are we going?”
“We’re driving to the hospital. Remember, you have to go for an x-ray.”
“Can we drive fast?” asked Ryan.
“No, not today. We have to go slow because you are feeling sleepy.”
They drove for another 30 minutes until they reached their destination.
When they arrived, Ryan and his Dad went inside the hospital to get the x-ray. After they had finished, they got back into the car and drove home. 
On the way, Ryan was feeling much more awake, and he asked his Dad if they could drive faster.
“Sure, we can go faster now,” Dad replied with a smile. 
And so Dad quickly drove home and the two of them had the best ride ever!
