Bob and Sandy loved to go on tours. They were excited to go to the beach. They loved to be creative, so they had an idea to make a sandcastle. They worked together using their creative ideas and their hands.
Finally, the sandcastle was finished! It was the most beautiful sandcastle Bob and Sandy had ever seen. They decided to name it “The Golden Castle”.
Then, Bob and Sandy had a plan. They decided to release some turtles into the ocean near their sandcastle. Sandy gently placed the turtles on the sand and gently gave them a push towards the water. The turtles slowly swam away, free. It was a wonderful sight!
Bob and Sandy were very happy and felt great joy from giving the turtles their freedom. They watched as their golden sandcastle and the turtles seemed to be dancing under the sun. A happy day indeed!
