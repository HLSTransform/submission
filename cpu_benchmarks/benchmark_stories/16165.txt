Once upon a time, there were two best friends named Bob and Amy. They were walking together in the forest and one day, they heard a loud roar. Amy was scared but Bob said, "Don't worry, that's just a tiger. Let's go and say hello." 
So, Bob and Amy slowly went towards the tiger. It was a big, stripey tiger and Bob said, "Welcome tiger. We're Bob and Amy and we don't mean any harm." 
The tiger blinked and said, "Hello. I'm Tiger. Would you like to be my friends?" 
Amy said, "Yes please!" She was very brave. 
They all smiled and Tiger said, "Let's play together. We could play hide and seek. It's easy!" 
Bob, Amy and Tiger all laughed and had fun playing hide and seek in the forest. They were the best of friends and had so much fun together.
