One day, Ben and Lily went to the park with Mom. They saw a big round thing with many colors. It was a balloon. Mom said, "That is a balloon. It is for a party. Do you want to see?"
Ben and Lily nodded. They liked balloons. They followed Mom to the balloon. There were many people there. They wore funny hats and clothes. They sang and danced. They looked weird.
Ben and Lily saw a man with a big drum. He hit the drum hard. Boom, boom, boom. He said, "Come on, everyone. Let's march around the balloon. Follow me." He started to walk fast. He hit the drum louder. Boom, boom, boom.
Some people followed him. They marched around the balloon. They lifted their feet high. They made noise. They looked happy.
Ben and Lily wanted to join. They liked to march. They asked Mom, "Can we march, Mom? Please?"
Mom smiled. She said, "Sure, you can march. But stay close to me. Don't get lost." She held their hands. They marched around the balloon. They had fun. They felt like they were in a parade.
