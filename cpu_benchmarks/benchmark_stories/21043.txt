Ben and Lily were playing in their room. They had many toys, but they wanted more fun. They saw a big bag of clothes on the floor. It was mom's bag. She was going to give the clothes to other people who needed them.
Ben and Lily opened the bag. They saw many pretty and colorful clothes. They wanted to try them on. They took out the clothes and put them on. They laughed and danced. They did not care if the clothes were too big or too small. They felt like grown-ups.
But they made a big mess. The clothes were everywhere. Some clothes were torn or dirty. Some clothes had buttons or zippers that they could not close. They did not think about mom. They did not think about the other people.
Mom came home. She saw the mess. She saw the clothes. She was very angry. She screamed at Ben and Lily. She asked them why they did that. She told them they were naughty and selfish. She told them they had to give back the clothes. She told them they had to say sorry.
Ben and Lily felt guilty. They knew they did something bad. They cried and said sorry. But mom did not forgive them. She took away their toys. She sent them to bed. She did not hug or kiss them. Ben and Lily felt sad and lonely. They wished they had not played with the clothes. They wished they had listened to mom. They wished they had more fun.
