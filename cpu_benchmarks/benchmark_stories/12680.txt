Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the hall with her mommy. They were going to a party. Lily saw lots of people in the hall. She felt scared because it was not normal for her to see so many people in one place.
Her mommy noticed Lily was scared and asked, "Do you need me to support you, Lily?" Lily nodded her head and her mommy lifted her up. Lily felt safe and happy in her mommy's arms. 
After a while, Lily saw her friends from school. They were also at the party. Lily felt excited and wanted to play with them. She asked her mommy if she could go play with her friends. Her mommy said yes and told her to be careful. 
Lily ran to her friends and they played together. They had lots of fun and Lily forgot about her fear. When it was time to go home, Lily hugged her mommy and said, "Thank you for supporting me, mommy." Her mommy smiled and said, "You're welcome, sweetie. I will always support you."
