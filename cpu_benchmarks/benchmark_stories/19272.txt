Once, there was a bear and a bee. The bee wanted to keep his sweet honey, but the bear wanted to try it. The bee flew high in the sky, so the bear couldn't reach him. The bear decided to shoot at the bee with a bow and arrow. The arrow flew so fast and so bright that the bee scurried away.
The bear found the bee's honey and it shined so brightly. He scooped it up and licked it off his paws. It was sweet and sticky, exactly what the bear wanted! But then the bee came back. He was not happy that the bear was eating his honey! He buzzed at the bear, trying to make him leave.
The bear didn't listen, so the bee decided to shoot at him with a pea shooter. The pea shot at the bear so quickly and so brightly that he was scared and ran away. The bear never returned for the honey and the bee kept it safe and sound.
