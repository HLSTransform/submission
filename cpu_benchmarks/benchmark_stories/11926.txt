Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she was running around and she fell down. She felt very clumsy and hurt her knee. 
Her mom came over and asked, "Are you okay, Lily?" 
Lily replied, "No, my knee hurts. I wonder when it will feel better." 
Her mom picked her up and carried her home. They put a bandage on her knee and Lily felt a little better. Her mom said, "It's okay to feel clumsy sometimes, Lily. You just need to be careful and try again." 
Lily smiled and said, "Okay, Mom. I will be careful next time." From that day on, Lily was more careful when she played outside and she never fell down again.
