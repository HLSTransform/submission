Lily and Max were playing with their toy boats in the bathtub. They pretended they were pirates and sailors, and had fun making waves and noises. Lily had a big boat with a shiny anchor, and Max had a small boat with a flag.
"Look at my boat, it's so fast and strong!" Max said, zooming his boat around the tub. "Your boat is slow and heavy, because of your anchor!"
Lily felt sad and angry. She liked her anchor, it was her favorite part of her boat. She thought Max was being mean and rude. She grabbed his boat and threw it out of the tub.
"Hey, that's not fair!" Max shouted, jumping out of the tub to get his boat. "You can't do that, give me back my boat!"
Lily crossed her arms and stuck out her tongue. "No, I won't! You hurt my feelings, and you don't deserve your boat!"
Max felt hurt and mad. He liked his boat, it was his favorite toy. He thought Lily was being selfish and mean. He grabbed her boat and threw it in the toilet.
"Ha, take that!" Max said, flushing the toilet. "Now your boat is gone, and you can't get it back!"
Lily gasped and cried. She couldn't believe what Max did. She loved her boat, it was her special gift. She thought Max was being cruel and nasty. She ran out of the bathroom, sobbing.
Mom heard the commotion and came to see what was wrong. She saw the wet floor, the empty tub, and the flushed toilet. She asked Lily and Max what happened, and they both told her their side of the story.
Mom shook her head and sighed. She was disappointed and upset. She thought Lily and Max were being unkind and foolish. She told them to sit on the couch and think about what they did.
Lily and Max sat on the couch, feeling ashamed and sorry. They realized they had made a big mistake, and they had hurt each other and their toys. They wished they could take back what they did, and have their boats back.
They looked at each other, and felt sorry for each other. They remembered how much they liked playing together, and how much they cared for each other. They decided to say sorry, and to forgive each other.
Lily hugged Max and said, "I'm sorry, Max. I shouldn't have thrown your boat out of the tub. That was mean of me. I forgive you for throwing my boat in the toilet. That was mean of you."
Max hugged Lily and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I shouldn't have thrown your boat in the toilet. That was cruel of me. I forgive you for grabbing my boat and throwing it out of the tub. That was rude of you."
Mom heard them and smiled. She was proud and happy. She thought Lily and Max were being kind and wise. She told them she was glad they apologized and forgave each other. She said she had a surprise for them.
She brought them two new boats, one for Lily and one for Max. They were bigger and better than their old boats, and they had both an anchor and a flag. Lily and Max were overjoyed and grateful. They thanked Mom and hugged her.
They went back to the bathroom, and filled the tub with water. They put their new boats in the tub, and played with them together. They pretended they were pirates and sailors, and had fun making waves and noises. They shared their boats, and complimented each other's boats. They were happy and friendly.
The moral of the story is: Don't be mean or rude to your friends, or you might lose them and your toys. Be kind and forgiving to your friends, and you might gain them and new toys.
