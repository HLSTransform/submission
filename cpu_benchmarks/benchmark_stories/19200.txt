Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy who loved to sail on his toy boat. He would sail it in the bathtub and in the park's pond. One day, Timmy decided to sail his boat in the big lake. He felt excited and happy.
As he sailed his boat, he saw a big duck swimming towards him. Timmy was scared and didn't know what to do. The duck quacked loudly and Timmy felt embarrassed because people were watching him. He thought he should leave the lake and go home.
But then, Timmy remembered his dad telling him that ducks are friendly and like to play. So, Timmy threw a piece of bread to the duck and they became friends. Timmy felt happy again and continued to sail his boat with his new friend. From that day on, Timmy learned that sometimes things that seem scary can turn out to be fun.
