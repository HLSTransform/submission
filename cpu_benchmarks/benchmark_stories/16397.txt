Mia loves waffles. She likes to eat them with honey and berries. But today, she has a problem. She cannot find her waffle maker. She looks in the kitchen, in the living room, in the bedroom, but no waffle maker. She is very sad.
She asks her mom, "Where is my waffle maker?" Her mom says, "I don't know, Mia. Maybe you left it at grandma's house." Mia remembers that she went to grandma's house yesterday. She had a lot of fun with grandma. They played with dolls, read books, and made waffles. Maybe she forgot to bring her waffle maker back.
Mia says, "Can we go to grandma's house and get my waffle maker?" Her mom says, "Not today, Mia. Grandma is busy. She has a fancy party to go to. She is wearing a fancy dress and a fancy hat. She will look very pretty."
Mia thinks for a moment. She has an idea. She says, "Can I make waffles without my waffle maker?" Her mom says, "How will you do that, Mia?" Mia says, "I can use a pan and a spatula. I can mix flour, eggs, milk, and sugar. I can pour the batter in the pan and flip it with the spatula. I can make waffles with my own hands."
Her mom smiles. She says, "That sounds like a good idea, Mia. You are very smart and creative. Do you want to try it?" Mia says, "Yes, please. Can you help me?" Her mom says, "Of course, I will help you. Let's go to the kitchen and make some waffles."
Mia and her mom go to the kitchen. They get the ingredients and the tools. They work together to make the batter and cook the waffles. They smell very good. They put honey and berries on top. They sit at the table and eat the waffles. They are very yummy.
Mia is very happy. She says, "I did it, mom. I made waffles without my waffle maker. I managed to make waffles with my own hands." Her mom says, "You did, Mia. You did a great job. I am very proud of you. You are a wonderful waffle maker." They hug and smile. They enjoy their waffles. They have a lot of fun.
