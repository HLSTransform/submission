Once upon a time, there was a fisherman named Tom. Tom liked to catch fish in the big blue sea. One day, he took his boat and went to the sea to get some fish for dinner.
Tom was a bit confused because he could not find any fish. He tried and tried, but no fish came. Then, he saw a big rock in the water. He thought, "Maybe the fish are hiding behind the rock!" So, he went to the rock and tried to catch the fish again.
This time, Tom caught many fish! He was very happy. But when he looked at his net, he saw that it was broken. He needed to replace the net so he could catch more fish next time. Tom went back to the shore and bought a new net. Now he was ready to catch more fish and have a yummy dinner.
