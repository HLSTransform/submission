One day, a young girl named Sally went for a walk in the park. She saw an elderly lady sitting on a park bench and couldn't help but stare. Sally gazed at the elderly woman for a few moments, until the woman saw her.
Sally smiled and the Elderly lady smiled back, then gestured for Sally to come closer. Sally walked over to the bench and sat down, wondering what the lady wanted.
The elderly lady then handed Sally a fork. Sally took it and examined the fork. It was shiny, like silver. She looked up at the lady with a confused expression.
The elderly lady explained that the fork was a gift. She said that Sally should use the fork to remember her, because she was going away soon.
Sally nodded and gave the elderly woman a big hug. She said goodbye and thanked her for the present as she walked away. Sally gripped the fork tightly, feeling happy that she had been given such a special gift.
