Once upon a time, there was a monkey named Max who lived in the jungle. Max loved to swing from tree to tree and eat bananas. One day, Max met a bird named Bella. Bella wanted to play with Max, but Max disagreed. He wanted to play alone.
Later that day, Max found a cave that was open. He went inside and saw a big treasure chest. Max was so excited! But then, Bella came along and wanted to share the treasure with Max. Max still disagreed. He wanted to keep the treasure all for himself.
But as Max looked around the cave, he realized that he was scared. It was dark and he was all alone. So, he called out to Bella and asked her to come back. Together, they explored the cave and found even more treasure. Max was happy he had a friend to share it with. From that day on, Max and Bella played together every day in the jungle.
