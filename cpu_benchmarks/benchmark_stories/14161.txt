Andy wanted to go out and play, but he didn't have any shoes. He asked his mom where his shoes were, but she didn't know. She suggested they go to his grandma's house and borrow a pair.
When they arrived, grandma had an available shoe. It was a bit big but would do. Andy quickly put them on and was ready to go.
On the way out, Andy asked his mom why they didn't have any shoes. His mom explained they had to borrow them because they weren't available. Andy smiled and raced off to play.
