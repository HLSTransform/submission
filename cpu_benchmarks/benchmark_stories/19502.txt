Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Marie. She was three years old. Every day, her mom gave her pocket money to pay for treats. She loved when she got to go to the store and pay for things. 
One day, Marie had a bright idea. She decided to enter a contest to win a prize! All she had to do was get some help from her mom and fill out a form. After, she sent it in and waited.
After a few days, Marie got an email that said she had won! She was very excited and couldn't believe it. Her prize was a modest toy that she loved. She had won a prize and was very proud of herself! She showed all of her friends and family the prize and they all said that she was very brave and smart.
After that, Marie always remembered that with hard work and a little luck, anything can happen! She may not always win, but that didn't matter. What mattered was that she tried and paid attention to small details. Most of all, she learned that sometimes, being modest pays off in more ways than one.
