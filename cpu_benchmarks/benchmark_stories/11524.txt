Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man named Tom. Tom had a big house with many toys. He loved to play with toy models of cars, planes, and boats. One day, Tom wanted to make a new model. He needed to measure the size of the model to make it perfect.
Tom asked his friend, Sam, to help him. Sam came to Tom's house and said, "Let's measure the model together!" They started to measure the model with a small ruler. They measured the length, width, and height of the model. They wanted the model to be the best one ever.
As they worked, they talked about how fun it would be to play with the new model. They knew it would be their favorite toy. After they finished measuring, they built the model. It was a beautiful boat. Tom and Sam played with the boat in the pool. They had lots of fun and knew that measuring the model was worth it. The end.
