Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys every day. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the toy store. Timmy saw many objects that he liked, but he didn't have enough money to buy them all.
Timmy's mom said, "You can only spend your money on one object today, Timmy."
Timmy looked around the store and saw a clever toy that he really liked. He said to his mom, "I want to spend my money on the clever toy, please."
Timmy's mom bought him the clever toy and they went home. Timmy was so happy with his new toy. He played with it every day and it made him very happy. Timmy learned that sometimes it's better to spend your money on one clever object that you really like, instead of buying many objects that you don't really need.
