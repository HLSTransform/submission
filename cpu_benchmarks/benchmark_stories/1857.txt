Once upon a time there was a little boy. His name was Billy and he had big plans for the future. He wanted to learn to play music. Billy had a safe and comfortable home, so he knew he could do it.
One day, Billy's mom bought him a little guitar. She wanted him to feel safe and confident as he endeavoured to learn. Billy was so happy he couldn't stop jumping up and down.
Billy practised every day. He put all his energy into learning to make lovely music. Finally, he had learned enough. It was time for his first big show.
Billy was nervous as he walked onto the stage. When he started to play, however, all his nerves went away. He played the guitar so well that the audience cheered. He had succeeded in making beautiful music! Billy was so proud of himself. 
From that day on, Billy always kept safety and music close to his heart. His dream had become a reality!
