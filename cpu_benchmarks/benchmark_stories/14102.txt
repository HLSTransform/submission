Once upon a time, there was a brave little fish. She loved to go on adventures and explore the ocean. One day, she decided to go on the biggest adventure of her life and go out on a sail. She was so excited!
But when she was out in the open sea, she ran into a huge storm. The waves were so big and the winds so strong that it was hard for the brave little fish to make it through. She kept swimming for hours and hours, but in the end, she could not make it through the storm. She suffered and lost her strength and courage.
Finally, when the storm was over, the brave little fish had fallen asleep. When the sun shone through, she was no longer brave and the sea was silent. Her adventure was over and the brave little fish had been taken away by the storm. She would never set sail again.
