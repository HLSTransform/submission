Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a task to clean his smelly room. He did not want to clean it. Instead, he wanted to nap. His mom said, "Tim, you need to clean your room before you nap."
Tim did not listen. He lay down and took a nap. When he woke up, his room was still smelly. His mom came in and said, "Tim, if you clean your room, it will not be smelly anymore."
Tim listened to his mom. He cleaned his room and it was not smelly anymore. Tim learned that if he does his tasks, things will be better. And then, he took a nice nap in his clean room.
