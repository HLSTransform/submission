Once upon a time, there was a kind and compassionate girl. She was always thinking of ways to help people and make them smile. One day, she was out in the park when she saw a little bird with a broken wing. She gave it a gentle pat on its head and felt a special connection.
The bird fluttered its wings and blinked its eyes at the girl. She understood it was trying to tell her something. With a kind smile the girl said the bird was going to be ok, then it flew away. She thought the bird had sent her a message.
The girl was moved by the bird's courage and loving gesture. It had showed such compassion for her. She felt special, like there was a connection between them. She smiled to herself and blinked back at the bird, grateful for the message it had sent her.
