One day, a little girl named Lucy went to the beach with her mom. Lucy loved the beach because she could play in the sand and swim in the water. While she was playing, she saw a confused jellyfish on the sand. The jellyfish looked sad and lost.
Lucy wanted to help the jellyfish, so she called her mom. "Mom, look! A jellyfish needs help!" she said. Her mom came and looked at the jellyfish. "You're right, Lucy. Let's pick it up and put it back in the water," her mom said.
They carefully picked up the jellyfish and carried it to the water. When the jellyfish touched the water, it started to swim away. It was happy to be back in the water. Lucy and her mom smiled and waved goodbye to the jellyfish. They felt good because they had helped a new friend.
