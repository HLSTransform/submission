Once, there was a little girl named Ruth. Ruth was three years old and she loved to play. One day, Ruth went to the park with her mommy. At the park, there was a big drum. It was round and soft.
Ruth's mommy said, "Ruth, can you understand what the drum is for?"
Ruth smiled and said, "Yes! I can understand the drum. I can bang it!"
So Ruth and her mommy played with the drum. Ruth banged it softly with her hands, and her mommy tapped it with her feet. They made lots of happy music together. 
Ruth had fun at the park. She was very happy to understand how to play the drum.
