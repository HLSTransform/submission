Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, Timmy found a big, bright rock in his backyard. 
"Mommy, look what I found!" said Timmy, holding up the bright rock. 
"That's very pretty, Timmy," said Mommy. "But be careful, it might be sharp." 
Timmy wanted to keep the bright rock, but his little sister, Lily, also wanted it. They started to argue about who should have it. 
Just then, Daddy came outside and said, "I have an idea. Let's play a game. We'll hide the rock and whoever finds it first will get to keep it." 
Timmy and Lily agreed and started to search for the bright rock. After a few minutes, Timmy found it first and revealed it to everyone. 
"I won!" said Timmy, holding up the rock. 
Lily was sad, but Daddy said, "Don't worry, Lily. You'll find something even better one day." 
Timmy was happy to have won the bright rock and they all went inside for some ice cream.
