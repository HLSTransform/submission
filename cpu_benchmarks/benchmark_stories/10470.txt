Once upon a time there was a little puppy. He was very cute and loves to play, but he didn't have a name.
One day a boy found the puppy and decided to keep him as a pet. The little boy was very excited and he wanted to give the puppy a name. He looked for ideas and finally decided to call the puppy "Healthy".
He took good care of the puppy, feeding him healthy food and playing with him every day. He was always very happy and he loved his new name.
The boy taught his puppy to do tricks like sit and stay. Every time Healthy followed the boy's command, he was given a treat as a reward.
But as the puppy grew bigger, the boy noticed that Healthy was not as energetic as he thought. He no longer responded to commands and his coat seemed dull.
The boy realized that he had not been taking proper care of Healthy and decided to make a change. He started to feed and play with him more often and changed his diet to give him the nutrition he needed. His coat was soon shining and he was the most active puppy in the park.
The boy was happy to see a healthy change in his puppy. He realized that with a little love and care, anything can change for the better. He felt very lucky to have such a special puppy and often thought about the importance of taking good care of everyone and everything.
