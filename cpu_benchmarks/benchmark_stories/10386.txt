Tim and Lily were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they found a big bottle under a tree. It had a cork and a paper inside. Tim opened the bottle and took out the paper.
"Look, Lily, it's a message!" he said. "Maybe it's from a pirate or a fairy."
Lily looked at the paper. It had many words and pictures on it. She could not read the words, but she saw a map and a cross.
"Maybe it's a treasure map!" she said. "Maybe it shows us where to find gold and jewels."
Tim and Lily decided to follow the map. They walked and ran and jumped until they came to a big house with a fence and a gate. The map said the treasure was under a flower pot near the door.
"Wow, this is a wealthy house!" Tim said. "Maybe the people who live here are pirates or fairies."
Lily nodded. She saw a flower pot near the door. She lifted it and saw a hole in the ground. She reached inside and felt something hard and shiny.
"Tim, I found it! I found the treasure!" she said. She pulled out a necklace with a big red stone. It sparkled in the sun.
Tim was happy for Lily. He looked at the necklace and smiled.
"That's a beautiful necklace, Lily," he said. "You should keep it. It's yours."
Lily hugged Tim and thanked him. She put the necklace around her neck and felt very special.
"Thank you, Tim. You are a good friend," she said. "But I don't want to keep the treasure all to myself. I want to share it with you. Here, you can have this ring. It has a blue stone. It matches your eyes."
Tim was surprised and touched. He took the ring and put it on his finger. It fit perfectly.
"Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend, too," he said. "But we should not stay here too long. The people who live here might come back and get angry. Let's go back to the park and play with our treasure."
Tim and Lily agreed. They put the flower pot back and ran away from the house. They went back to the park and played with their treasure. They felt very happy and lucky. They did not know that the message in the bottle was a joke from a naughty boy who lived in the house. He had put his old toys in the hole and made the map for fun. He did not care about the treasure. He only wanted to make someone laugh. He did not know that he had made Tim and Lily very happy. He did not know that they had found something more valuable than gold and jewels. They had found friendship.
