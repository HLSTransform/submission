Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around in the park. One day, she saw a man selling ice cream. She was very enthusiastic and ran over to him.
"Can I have some ice cream, please?" Lily asked.
"Sure thing, little girl. What flavor do you want?" the man replied.
Lily chose her favorite flavor and the man handed her the ice cream. She was so happy and started eating it while running around. But then, she didn't notice a rock on the ground and fell down. Her motion hurt her and she started crying.
The man tried to help her up, but she was crying too much. Her parents came over and saw what happened. They were very angry at the man for not watching Lily better. They told him they would never buy anything from him again. The man felt very sad and went home with no money.
