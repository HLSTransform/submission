Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play in the yard. They have a swing, a slide and a sandbox. Anna likes to swing high and fast. Ben likes to slide down and make sandcastles.
One day, Anna wants to try the slide. She climbs up the ladder. She is a little scared. She looks at Ben. Ben is in the sandbox. He sees Anna.
"Anna, you can do it!" Ben says. "I will support you!"
Anna smiles. She feels brave. She slides down. She laughs. She likes the slide.
"Thank you, Ben!" Anna says. "You are a good brother!"
Ben smiles. He is happy. He likes to help Anna.
"Anna, you are welcome!" Ben says. "You are a good sister!"
Anna and Ben hug. They are independent. They can try new things. They are also supportive. They can help each other. They love to play in the yard. They are happy.
