Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat cereal for breakfast every morning. One day, her mom gave her a bowl of cereal that tasted very harsh. Lily didn't like it at all, but she didn't want to hurt her mom's feelings, so she ate it all up.
After breakfast, Lily went to play in the park with her friends. They ran around and played tag, but Lily started to feel tired. She sat down on a bench and tried to relax. Suddenly, she remembered the harsh cereal and felt sick. Her friends noticed she wasn't feeling well and asked if she wanted to go home.
Lily nodded and her friends helped her walk back home. When she got there, her mom asked her how she was feeling. Lily told her about the harsh cereal and her mom apologized. She gave Lily a new bowl of cereal that tasted much better and helped her relax on the couch until she felt better. From then on, Lily always made sure to tell her mom if she didn't like something, so she wouldn't have to eat anything harsh again.
