Once upon a time, there was a house which had a fire. The house was very hot and the family were very worried. They didn't know what to do, until the fire brigade came. Everyone was happy!
The fire brigade worked really hard to put out the fire, and eventually it was finished. Everyone cheered and hugged each other - the fire was out! The family were all very lucky that the fire brigade had come in time. They were so happy that nobody was hurt.
The fire was gone, and nobody had to worry anymore. Everyone hugged each other and thanked the fire brigade. After that, the family got back to their normal life.
