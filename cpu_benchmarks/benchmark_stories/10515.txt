Once upon a time there was a folder filled with nice things. The folder was happy and peaceful.
But one day, a strong wind came and scattered all the things from the folder. It blew everything around the room.
The folder was upset and started to look for the things that had been blown away. It searched high and low.
Suddenly, the folder heard a special sound. It was the sound of laughter! The folder looked up and saw a group of children playing happily with all the things that had been blown away.
The folder was happy again. It smiled and thought of how happy and peaceful it was to watch the children playing.
