Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sue. Sue was nice and she liked to help people.
One day, Sue saw a man with a nail in his hand. He was trying to steal something from the store. Sue was sad and she wanted to stop him.
She ran up and grabbed the nail from the man's hand. Then she threw it very far away. The man couldn't get it and he had to run away.
Sue was happy she stopped the man from stealing. She knew it was the right thing to do. She was very proud of herself.
From that day on, Sue was known as a helper. Whenever she saw something bad, she knew she could help. Sue was nice and she always tried to make the world a better place.
