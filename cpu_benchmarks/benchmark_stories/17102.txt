Once upon a time, there was a dog named Spot. Spot loved to play in the pool with his friends. One day, while Spot was swimming, his ears perked up and he became alert. He heard a phone ring! 
Spot quickly got out of the pool and ran to the phone. It was his owner calling to say she was on her way home. Spot was so happy that he ran back to the pool and jumped in. His friends were happy too and they all splashed around together. 
As they were playing, Spot's owner arrived home. She saw Spot and his friends having fun in the pool and was happy too. She rang the doorbell to let them know she was there. Spot heard the doorbell ring and knew it was his owner. He got out of the pool and ran to greet her with a wagging tail. They were all happy to be together again. The end.
