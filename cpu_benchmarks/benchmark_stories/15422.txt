Once upon a time, there was a bunny. He wanted to dance, so he hopped out of his burrow. He felt so happy and excited. 
But then, he saw an empty operation room. He was very scared and wanted to go back home. He didn't want to dance anymore.
But then, he saw a magical bunny that was wearing a pretty dress and dancing in the middle of the room. The magical bunny smiled at him and said, "Come join me!"
So the bunny hopped closer and soon he was dancing too. They danced together for hours and hours. The bunny's fear was gone and he smiled from ear to ear. 
When it was time to go, the magical bunny waved goodbye. The bunny smiled and waved back. From that day on, the bunny danced happily. He never felt afraid or empty.
