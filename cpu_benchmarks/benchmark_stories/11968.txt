Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her hoop in the park. One day, Lily's hoop broke and she was very sad. She looked for another hoop to play with, but they were all different and not like her original hoop. 
Lily missed her old hoop so much that she cried. Her mommy saw her crying and asked what was wrong. Lily told her mommy about her hoop and how she missed it. Her mommy hugged her and said they could go to the store to find a new hoop. 
At the store, Lily found a hoop that was almost like her original one. She was happy again and played with her new hoop in the park. But then, another little girl came and wanted to play with Lily's hoop. Lily didn't want to share her new hoop, but her mommy reminded her that sharing is kind. So, Lily shared her hoop and they both had fun playing together.
