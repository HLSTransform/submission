Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big cart with many toys on it. The cart was red and shiny, and it had wheels and a handle. Lily and Ben wanted to play with the toys, so they ran to the cart.
"Look, Ben, there is a doll and a truck and a ball and a book!" Lily said. She gazed at the toys with wide eyes. She reached for the doll, but Ben grabbed it first.
"No, Lily, this is mine!" Ben said. He held the doll close to his chest. He gazed at the truck and wanted it too. He tried to take it from the cart, but Lily stopped him.
"No, Ben, this is mine!" Lily said. She pulled the truck from his hand. She gazed at the ball and wanted it too. She tried to take it from the cart, but Ben stopped her.
They both wanted all the toys, and they started to fight. They pulled and pushed and shouted. They were very upset.
"Hey, hey, stop that!" a voice said. It was the man who owned the cart. He came out of his house and saw the twins fighting over his toys. He was not happy. He gazed at them with a frown.
"These are not your toys, these are mine!" the man said. "I was going to sell them at the market, but you ruined them. Look, the doll is torn and the truck is broken and the ball is dirty and the book is wet. You are very naughty!"
Lily and Ben felt sorry. They did not mean to ruin the toys. They gazed at the man with sad eyes.
"We are sorry, mister," they said. "We just wanted to play. Can we help you fix the toys?"
The man sighed. He gazed at the twins with a soft smile.
"Well, you are sorry, and that is good," he said. "But you should not take things that are not yours. You should ask first. And you should share with each other. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They understood. They helped the man fix the toys. They also learned to share with each other. They gazed at the toys with happy eyes. They thanked the man and went home. They were not upset anymore. They were friends.
