Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and jump on the furniture. One day, her mom bought a new sofa that was very big and comfy. Lily wanted to jump on it, but her mom said no. She told Lily that the sofa was new and she didn't want it to break. 
Lily promised to protect the sofa and not jump on it. She sat on the sofa and it was a perfect fit for her. She loved how soft it was and how it made her feel cozy. From that day on, Lily made sure to protect the furniture in her house and not jump on it. She wanted it to last a long time so she could sit and play on it for many years to come.
