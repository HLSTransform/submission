Once upon a time there was a girl called Rose. She was very special because she glowed! All around Rose a bright green light shone. Everywhere she went, the green light glowed.
One day, Rose went to the woods and saw a magical animal. It was the size of a rabbit but was bright yellow and had big sparkly wings.
The magical animal spoke to Rose but she couldn't hear it because she was deaf. But the magical animal had a way to help Rose. She glowed brighter and brighter until Rose could hear the magic animal's voice.
Rose listened to the magical animal, and it told her to go on an adventure. Rose smiled and ran off into the woods, her green light glowing behind her.
