Once upon a time there was a little boy. He was so excited to see the sunrise. Every morning he woke up just in time to watch it peek over the horizon. 
One day, while he was watching the sunrise, the boy started to ask questions. "What makes the sun come up?" he asked. He was curious about how the sky turned from dark to light so quickly. 
Suddenly he heard a soft voice. It was the sun! It said, "I just wake up and shine." The boy smiled and said, "Thank you."
The sun smiled back and said, "No problem. I love to watch the sunrise and make the world a little brighter each day. "
The boy smiled back and said, "Me too." Then he waved goodbye to the sun and ran back inside to tell his mommy all about his conversation with the sun.
