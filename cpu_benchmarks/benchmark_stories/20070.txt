Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny lived in a big forest with his friends. One day, Benny went on a walk and found a pretty flower. He wanted to bring the flower to his friend, but he got lost in the forest. Benny started to feel anxious because he didn't know how to get back home.
Suddenly, he saw a big snake with a bottle of poison. Benny knew he had to be careful and not go near the snake. But then he had an idea! He thought that if he brought the snake the flower, maybe the snake would help him find his way back home. So, Benny brought the flower to the snake and asked for help. The snake agreed and showed Benny the way back home. Benny was very happy and grateful for the snake's help.
