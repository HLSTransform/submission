Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Fin. Fin loved to swim in the big sea. One day, Fin saw a fancy shell on the sea floor. He wanted to show it to his friends. But, he could not pick up the shell. He needed help.
Fin saw a big wave coming. He asked the wave for help. "Wave, I need help to pick up this fancy shell," said Fin. The wave was kind and helped Fin. The wave pushed the fancy shell up to Fin's friends.
Fin's friends loved the fancy shell. They thanked the wave and Fin. They all learned that it is good to ask for help when you need it. And they lived happily ever after.
