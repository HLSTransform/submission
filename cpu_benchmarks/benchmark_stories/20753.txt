Once upon a time there was a Mama bear and a Baby bear. Mama bear was very busy in the kitchen, she was preparing a yummy dinner for the two of them. Baby bear was sitting on the floor watching her and he couldn't wait to see what she was making.
Mama bear peeled potatoes, cut vegetables and poured sauce. Then she put it all in a big pot and stirred it. Baby bear smiled and watched with his big eyes. 
Finally the dinner was ready and Mama bear served it up. Baby bear clapped with delight and said "Yummy! This looks so good!" 
Mama bear smiled at Baby bear and they both ate their dinner. And they were happy and full after their yummy dinner. The end.
