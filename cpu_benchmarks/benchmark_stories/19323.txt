One day, mommy heard a loud noise outside. She ran out to the garden and saw that the hose was going backwards! She was so surprised so she looked around. She noticed Dad was there and he was pushing a button to reverse the hose. 
Mommy asked what he was doing and Dad said he was cleaning up the garden. The hose had gotten too messy so Dad reversed it to move it along. 
Mommy smiled and watched as Dad continued to reverse the hose to get the garden clean. She was so proud of him for finding a clever way to clean up. 
When Dad was finished, everyone clapped. He had done such a great job and the garden looked beautiful and neat. 
The End
