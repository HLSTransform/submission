Once upon a time there were two friends, Matt and Lily. Lily wanted to go on an adventure and so they made a plan. Matt wanted to go to the top of a big hill and Lily wanted to go through the long, dark pass. 
Matt was scared but he didn't want to let Lily down so he agreed. They started walking together but soon they were at the top of the hill and Lily thought it was time to go in the pass. She wanted to surrender her fear and do it! Matt was feeling worried and he asked Lily if she was sure, but she said yes.
They started to walk down the path but it was dark and hurt. Lily felt scared and Matt wanted to turn back, but Lily said she was ready to go on. They continued walking for what felt like hours until they reached the end of the pass. Lily was so happy that she had not surrendered and kept going. Matt was proud of his friend and they hugged.
At the end of the day, both Matt and Lily had learned that surrendering was not always the answer. Even when things were hurt and scary, they could find strength together.
