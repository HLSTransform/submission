Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cute puppy named Max. One day, while they were playing in the park, Max ran too fast and bumped into a tree. Lily saw that Max was hurt and started to cry. A kind mechanic saw what had happened and came to help.
"Stop crying, little girl. I can fix your cute puppy," said the mechanic.
Lily was happy to hear that Max could be fixed. The mechanic took Max to his workshop and fixed him up. Max was as good as new and Lily was very grateful.
"Thank you, Mr. Mechanic. You are very kind," said Lily.
The mechanic smiled and said, "No problem, little girl. I'm glad I could help."
