Once upon a time there was a mighty coin. Every day it sat in the same spot, never moving. It was so shiny, yet so dry.
One day a little girl spotted it while walking through the park. She was so excited and couldn't believe it. She quickly ran over to collect it.
As she picked it up, the coin glowed and sparkled in the sun. She was amazed and held it tightly in her hand. She placed the coin in her pocket, so made sure it wouldn't run away.
The little girl ran home with the mighty coin, feeling so proud and happy. When she got home, she showed her family the coin and explained her dry adventure in the park.
