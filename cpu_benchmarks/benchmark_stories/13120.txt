Once there was a boy named Ben. Ben was very persistent. Every day he would run in the park. He wanted to win the race! 
One day Ben was running and he almost won the race - but he was so close! He tried again the next day and he ran as fast as he could. He kept trying, even when he didn't win.
Finally on the third day, Ben was running and he won! He was so excited! He was happy he was so persistent and didn't give up. Everyone cheered for Ben!
From that day on, Ben kept running and trying his best. He kept being persistent and kept learning his lessons from winning the race. And he was always happy!
