One day, Tom went for a walk in the park. He saw a large lumber appear from far away. It was very flexible and Tom wanted to explore it. He touched the lumber and it moved left and right. He had so much fun! He ran around it, jumped over it, and crawled under it. He spent the whole day playing with the flexible lumber. After a while, Tom's mother called him over for dinner. But the next day, when Tom came back, the lumber had disappeared.
