Once upon a time, there was a player who loved to play outside. The player wanted to run and play even when it rains. He had an idea! His idea was to find something to put over his head to keep him dry. One day, he found a nice healthy umbrella. It kept him dry while he played all afternoon.
The player was so thankful! He had so much fun playing in the rain without getting wet. He also loved that he was able to stay healthy and fit while he played.
The player had lots of fun with his new umbrella and often used it even when it wasn't raining. It was his best friend.
The player was so thankful for his cool healthy umbrella. It made sure he stayed dry and had lots of fun!
