Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweetie. One day, Tweetie decided to go on an adventure. She flew and flew until she saw an interesting oasis. Tweetie started to fly towards it, but she got very tired. 
When she finally arrived at the oasis, she saw a big, scary snake. The snake started to chase her, and Tweetie tried to fly away as fast as she could. But the snake was too fast, and he caught Tweetie in his mouth. 
The end.
