Mum and Dad had a very special daughter. She was so special that she was given a wide garden to play in. She was so excited and ran around like a silly goose! One day she was running around and accidentally fell. She tumbled and rolled and laughed a lot. Mum and Dad saw her and ran over. They were so worried but she was ok. They hugged her tight and wiped away her tears.
Mum and Dad made sure the garden was even wider so their daughter could play and explore safely. They showed her where she should go and what she should do. She felt so safe and happy.
Every day she played in her wide garden and made lots of new friends. She laughed and sang and had a wonderful time.
Mum and Dad watched their daughter grow and fall in love with the wide garden she was so lucky to have.
