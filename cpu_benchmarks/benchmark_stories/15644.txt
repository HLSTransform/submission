Once upon a time there was a rat named Sam. He was a very shy rat, and he wanted to make some friends.
One day he saw a fake mouse in the room. He thought it looked like fun, so he decided to try and record it.
He scurried over and grabbed the mouse. The fake mouse said, “Stop!”
Sam was so startled he dropped the mouse and ran away.
The fake mouse laughed, “You don’t have to be scared, I won’t hurt you. You were just trying to record me, weren’t you?”
Sam was embarrassed, but he nodded his head.
The fake mouse said, “Why don’t you come back and record me? I think we could be friends.”
Sam was so happy and he raced back to get the mouse. They had a great time recording each other, and soon enough, Sam had made a new friend. 
The end.
