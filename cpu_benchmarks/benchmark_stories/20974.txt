Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Chloe. She was only three years old but always very curious. One day she asked her mom, "Where's jail?". Her mom replied, "It's far away.”
Chloe was not satisfied with that answer and she asked again, “Where's jail?” Her dad said, “Jail is a place with thick walls and people cannot get out. It is a very bad place to be.”
Chloe didn't understand, so her dad explained again, “Jail is a bad place and people who do bad things have to go there. When people go to jail, they stay in a prison with thick walls. They cannot get out.”
Chloe became really scared and said, "Please don't ever go to jail, Daddy!" Her dad laughed and said, “Don't worry, I won't go.” They hugged each other and Chloe felt safe again.
