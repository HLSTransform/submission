Once upon a time, there was a young dragon. He liked to crawl around the mountains because that's what dragons do. One day, he decided to go even higher. He crawled up the mountain until he reached the top. He was so proud, but he was also very tired.
He lay down on the grass and rested his head on his front leg. The sky was filled with stars. He felt so cosy and happy! The dragon got up and decided to crawl back down the mountain. He looked forward to dinner and bed.
He couldn't wait to tell all his dragon friends what he had done. Soon enough he was back home safe and sound. He curled up to take a nap, content in his fun and daring exploration.
