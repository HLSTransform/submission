Once there was a little princess who loved rainbows. Every morning she would look out of her window hoping to see a beautiful rainbow but it was always cloudy outside. One day, the little princess had a good idea. She decided to have a yummy picnic! She collected some of her favorite treats and headed outside. But as soon as she stepped outside, the sky turned grey and rain started to fall. The little princess was very upset because the rain kept preventing her from seeing the rainbow. 
Suddenly, she saw a flash of light in the sky. When she squinted her eyes, she could see a rainbow! The little princess smiled happily and ran around trying to catch the rainbow. She smiled as the rainbow came closer and closer. But just as she was about to catch it, the rain started pouring again. The little princess sighed as the rainbow disappeared, but she knew that she could try again the next day. She ran back inside, happy and content.
