One day, a brown dog came to the beach. He saw the sand and he wanted to explore. He saw a bird and a big tree, and then he saw the most exciting thing of all. There was a big pile of salt on the ground! He wanted to find out what it was. He sniffed it and he realized it was salty. He was so excited! He didn't know why the salt was there, but he was happy he found it.
He started to bark happily and he jumped around in the sand. He was having so much fun that he didn't notice the waves coming in. Soon enough, the waves were getting closer and closer to the pile of salt. The dog knew he had to do something, so he used his paws and he started to dig a hole. He worked really hard and eventually the waves were coming too close to the salt. So he grabbed the pile of salt in his mouth and carried it to higher ground.
Once the salt was safe, the dog stopped and looked back at the beach. He was proud of himself for protecting the salt and he woofed loudly to let everyone know. The beach was safe again and the brown dog was happy to have helped.
