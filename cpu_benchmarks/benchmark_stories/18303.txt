Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her friends. One day, she was playing with her toy car when her dad came in and said, "Lily, we need to go fuel up the car."
Lily didn't know what that meant, so she asked her dad. He explained that the car needed a special juice called fuel to run. Lily was excited to learn something new.
As they drove to the gas station, the road was very bumpy and rough. "Why is the road so rough, Daddy?" Lily asked. Her dad explained that sometimes the road gets bumpy and we have to be careful.
After they fueled up the car, they continued their journey. Suddenly, they hit a big bump in the road! But because Lily had learned about rough roads earlier, she held on tight and wasn't scared. She was proud of herself for learning something new and being brave.
