One day, a little girl named Lucy was in the park with her mom. Lucy was so excited! She saw a big bush with bright red berries she hadn't seen before. She asked her mom what they were and her mom said they were treats.
Lucy's mom said that she could take one, so she carefully plucked one from the bush and put it in her pocket. Lucy was so happy and ran off to play.
When she came back, she saw that her mom had marked the bush with a sign so everyone could know it was a treat bush. She watched her mom work hard to make it, nailing the sign to the bush with a hammer.
But, Lucy noticed that some birds were eating the treats too. She watched as they plucked the berries one by one and flew away. Lucy smiled and knew that she was not the only one who was happy to find the treat bush!
