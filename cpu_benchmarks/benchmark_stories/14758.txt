Ben and Mia are friends. They like to play with cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They make races with their cars on the floor.
One day, Ben finds a new car in his toy box. It is red and shiny. It has a button on the side. Ben pushes the button and the car makes a loud noise. It can speed very fast. Ben is happy. He wants to show Mia his new car.
He goes to Mia's house with his new car. He knocks on the door. Mia opens the door and sees Ben's car. She likes it too. She asks Ben if she can play with it. Ben says no. He says it is his car and he does not want to share. Mia is sad. She thinks Ben is not nice.
She goes to her room and looks for her own car. She finds a green car. It is old and dirty. It has a sticker on the side. It says poison. Mia does not know what poison means. She thinks it is a cool word. She decides to play a trick on Ben.
She goes back to Ben and says she is sorry. She says she has a car for him. She gives him the green car. Ben thinks Mia is nice. He takes the green car and thanks her. He pushes the sticker and the car makes a hissing noise. It sprays a bad smell. Ben coughs and drops the car. He feels sick. He cries.
Mia laughs. She thinks she is funny. She takes the red car and runs away. She says it is her car now. She speeds away with the red car. Ben is angry. He thinks Mia is mean. He wants his car back. He chases after her. They fight over the car. They are not friends anymore.
