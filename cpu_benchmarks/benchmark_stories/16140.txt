Mum and Dad took baby Tim to the park. Tim got very excited when he saw the swing. He jumped out of Dad's lap and ran to it.
"Daddy, Daddy, can I swing?" asked Tim.
Dad smiled and said, "Of course, Timmy. Here, let me help you." He lifted Tim up into the swing and gently pushed him back and forth.
Tim smiled and said, "I like this swing! It makes my brain feel so sweet."
Mum and Dad laughed.
"Yes, it is very sweet to swing," Mum said. She and Dad watched as Tim swung higher and higher. He laughed and waved to them.
Soon, it was time to go home.
But before they left, Tim said, "I hope I can come back soon! I like swinging." 
Mum and Dad smiled and said, "Yes, we like it, too."
