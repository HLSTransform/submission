Once there was a boy named Bob. He was three years old. Bob enjoyed looking out of the window.
Every day he would look out of the window and observe the birds in the trees and the people passing by.
One day, while Bob was observing as usual, he saw something in the neighbor's garden. It was a white fridge! Bob was so surprised that he immediately wanted to go and take a closer look.
Bob ran over to the neighbor's garden and when he arrived, the white fridge seemed even bigger! Bob touched it and felt the cold metal. He was so excited about his discovery that he started to run and tell his family.
Bob's family was amazed and they all went outside to observe the white fridge together. Soon after, Bob's dad opened the white fridge and they all had a lovely picnic in the garden!
