John was an anxious little boy. He wanted to gain something special, but he wasn't sure what. So one day he decided to explore the woods near his house. As he was walking, he came across a small cabin. He walked up to it, his heart beating fast with anticipation. He opened the door and saw a big surprise. Inside the cabin were many toys — dolls and cars and stuffed animals. John was so excited that he immediately began to play. He gained new friends and spent hours making them feel at home. In the end, he gained the most special thing of all — happiness.
