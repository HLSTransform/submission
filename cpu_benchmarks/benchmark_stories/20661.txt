Once upon a time there was a black place. Every day the sun would disappear over the horizon. It was so dark that it made everyone feel scared, but it also made them feel curious.
One day, a brave little girl decided to go explore the black place. She went there all alone, but she wasnâ€™t scared. She took a deep breath, and then she started walking.
When she got there, the sun was about to disappear. She looked around and noticed that everything was so different and quiet. She was so intrigued and felt like she was the only one in the world.
Then suddenly, the sun disappeared and everything went dark. The little girl started to feel scared, so she ran back home as fast as she could. She stayed safe and never went back to the black place again.
