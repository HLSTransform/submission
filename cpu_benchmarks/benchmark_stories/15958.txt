Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the circus with his family. He would always laugh and clap when the clowns came out. But one day, Timmy saw a clown that he didn't like. This clown was very big and loud, and Timmy felt scared.
Timmy told his mom that he hated the mighty clown. His mom hugged him and said it was okay to be scared sometimes. They decided to go see the animals instead. Timmy loved the lions and the elephants. He forgot all about the clown and had a great time.
From that day on, Timmy knew that it was okay to not like something or someone. But he also knew that there were always other things to enjoy, like the animals at the circus.
