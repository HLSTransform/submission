Once upon a time there was a bee called Sarah. She lived in a hive in the ground. One day, Sarah wanted to go explore the world outside her hive. She waved at her mum and dad and flew off into the big, wide world.
But Sarah found the world outside very cold. She shivered and huddled up. But she was brave and kept flying. Then she arrived at a park! There were lots of children playing, but they didn't notice Sarah.
But then one of the children noticed Sarah and pointed at her. He shouted to the other children, "Look a bee! Can I catch it?" The other children shouted back yes, and they all chased after Sarah. 
Sarah felt embarrassed that they were all chasing her, so she flew up higher and higher! The children soon gave up and ran away. 
Sarah was relieved and flew back to her hive, happy and tired. 
The End.
