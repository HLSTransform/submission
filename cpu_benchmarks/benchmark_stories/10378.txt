Lily liked to play with her tap. She had a big tub of water and some cups and spoons. She liked to fill the cups with water and pour them out. She liked to make bubbles and splashes. She liked to hear the tap go drip-drip-drip.
One day, Ben came to play with Lily. He saw her tap and wanted to play with it too. He asked Lily if he could borrow her tap. Lily said no. She did not want to share her tap. She liked her tap too much. Ben was sad and angry. He wanted to play with the tap.
Ben waited until Lily was not looking. He ran to the tub and grabbed the tap. He pulled it hard. He wanted to make the water come out faster. But he pulled too hard. The tap came off the tub. Water sprayed everywhere. The tap was broken. Lily saw what Ben did. She screamed and cried. She was very upset. She loved her tap.
Lily's mom heard the noise. She came to see what was wrong. She saw the water and the broken tap. She saw Lily crying and Ben looking sorry. She was not happy. She told Ben to say sorry to Lily. She told Lily to calm down. She told them both to play nicely. She took the broken tap and the tub away. She gave them some books and toys instead. She hoped they would learn to share and be careful.
