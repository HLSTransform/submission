One day, Sarah was walking in the park when she saw a large tree. It was so tall she could barely see the top! She wondered what it would be like to climb it.
As Sarah got closer to the tree, she noticed something shining in the leaves. When she looked closely, she could see that it was a big, juicy apple! She couldn't wait to taste it.
She picked the apple off the tree and brushed off some dirt. Then she took it home with her to wash it. After she washed the apple, she took a big bite. It was delicious!
Sarah was so happy with the delicious apple that she decided the next time she visits the park, she will wash any apples she finds before she eats them.
