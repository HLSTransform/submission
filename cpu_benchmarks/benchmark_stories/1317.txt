Once upon a time there was a family who lived in a small house. The family had two children who were obedient and loved to play together. 
The older child had a favorite toy - a basketball. She always wanted to play with it. Every morning she asked her parents if she could go outside and play basketball.
One day the younger child asked if he could play basketball too. The older child was excited and said yes! They went outside together and started to play and had a lot of fun.
The family saw the children playing and they were happy. They thought that it was nice to see the children playing together and being obedient.
The next day the older child remembered how much fun they had and decided to serve the little one. She said to him, “You can play with the basketball when I'm done. I want to serve you.” The little one was so happy!
From then on the children always played basketball together. The older child was obedient and served the younger one, and in return the little one was so grateful. They were a happy family and played together every day.
