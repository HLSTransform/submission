One day, a shy little girl named Lily went for a walk. She saw a ladder to help her get up a very tall tree. She wanted to climb the tree very badly, so she asked her mom for help. 
Her mom smiled, and brought a delivery man to their house. The delivery man was very kind. He brought a ladder and set it up for Lily.
Lily was scared to climb the ladder, but she was very brave. With help from her mom, she slowly but surely climbed up the ladder. 
When she reached the top, Lily was so excited. She stayed up on the branches for a long time until it was too dark to continue.
Lily had a great day, thanks to the kind delivery man who delivered the ladder.
