Once upon a time, there was an old black bird. He liked to fly around in the sky for fun. He flew so high in the sky, sometimes he couldn't see the ground below. One day, the old black bird was flying over a big mountain. He liked to fly around the mountain, so he flew around it again and again. But then something strange happened. As the old black bird flew higher and higher around the mountain, the air began to feel different. Suddenly, it felt like he was flying in a wind tunnel. Flying became easier and easier, and the old black bird flew higher and higher. He kept going until he couldn't see the mountain any more. He had discovered he could fly so high that he could look down from way up in the sky! The old black bird was so happy, he flew all around until nighttime came. He flew back home, ready to fly even higher the next day.
