Emma was walking through the woods by herself one day when she noticed something bright in the bushes. She walked closer and saw that it was a clay pot. She reached and picked it up. It felt cold and made her shiver.
The pot was filthy and Emma was sure that there must be something special inside. She used her hands to scrape away the dirt and mud and quickly discovered that it was full of coins.
Excited, she carefully looked through the coins, but she couldn't help her hands from shaking and she dropped some of them in the dirt. She quickly put the coins away and shivered. She knew that she couldn't keep the coins, so she carefully put them back in the clay pot and placed the pot back in the bushes.
She smiled and skipped away, happy to have made such a wonderful, yet filthy, discovery.
