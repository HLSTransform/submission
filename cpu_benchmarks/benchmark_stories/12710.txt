Today was a happy day for Tom. Tom was a little boy and he liked to play outside. He saw a butterfly fluttering around his garden and he was so excited. He reached out to touch it but he was too slow.
Tom kept looking for the butterfly and he eventually spotted it again. This time, he was faster and he managed to catch it with his hands. He smiled and gently rubbed its wings with his fingers. The butterfly was so soft and beautiful.
Then, Tom heard a noise behind him and he was scared. He saw a big dog coming towards him. The dog barked and Tom was scared. Tom ran away, but the dog followed him.
The dog stepped closer and closer. Tom was very scared and he started crying. He didn’t know what to do. He closed his eyes and wished it would go away. Suddenly, he felt something soft and warm on his hand. The butterfly had come back and was rubbing against Tom’s fingers.
Tom stopped crying and opened his eyes. The dog had gone away and the butterfly was still there. Tom smiled and kept rubbing its wings gently. He thanked the butterfly for coming back and saving him. From then on, whenever Tom was scared, he remembered the butterfly and knew that everything would be OK.
