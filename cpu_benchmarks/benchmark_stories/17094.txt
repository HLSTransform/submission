Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to school and playing with her friends in the classroom. One day, Lily's teacher asked the class to share their toys with each other. But one boy named Max was being selfish and didn't want to share his toys.
Lily said to Max, "It's not nice to be selfish. We should share our toys with our friends." Max didn't listen and continued to play with his toys alone. Suddenly, one of Max's toys split in half and he was sad.
Lily saw that Max was upset and decided to share her toys with him. Max was happy again and they played together in the classroom. From that day on, Max learned that sharing is important and he was no longer selfish. The end.
