Once upon a time, there were two friends, Tanya and Tommy. They were playing in Tommy's backyard, when Tommy asked Tanya a question.
"Do you want to play with my new toy?" Tommy asked.
Tanya was so excited. She said, "Yes!" 
They started to play with Tommy's new toy. It was an ancient toy with lots of buttons and dials. Every time they pushed a button something amazing happened. 
"Wow!" Tanya and Tommy said in astonishment.
Suddenly, an old man appeared in the garden. He asked the two friends what they were doing. 
"We're playing with Tommy's toy," Tanya said. The old man smiled and asked if he could join in. 
The three friends played with Tommy's toy until the sun started to set. As the ancient toy sparkled in the twilight sky, Tanya and Tommy thanked the old man for joining them. 
The old man just smiled and said, "It was my pleasure!"
