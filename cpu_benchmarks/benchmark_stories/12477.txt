Anna and Ben are playing in the snow. They make a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They give him a carrot nose and two coal eyes. They are very happy.
"Let's sing a song for our snowman!" Anna says. "Maybe he will come alive!"
"Okay!" Ben says. "What song do you know?"
Anna thinks for a moment. She remembers a song her mommy taught her. She starts to sing:
"Frosty the snowman, was a jolly happy soul,
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made of coal.
Frosty the snowman, is a fairy tale they say,
He was made of snow but the children know, how he came to life one day."
Ben joins in the song. They sing louder and louder. They hope their snowman will hear them.
Suddenly, they hear a voice behind them. It is deep and friendly.
"Hello, children!" the voice says. "Thank you for singing that lovely song!"
Anna and Ben turn around. They can't believe their eyes. Their snowman is smiling at them. He has come alive!
"Wow!" Anna says. "You can talk!"
"Of course I can!" the snowman says. "You gave me life with your song and your love. My name is Frosty. What are yours?"
"I'm Anna and this is Ben!" Anna says. "We are so happy to meet you, Frosty!"
"Me too!" Frosty says. "Do you want to play with me?"
"Yes, yes, yes!" Anna and Ben say. They hug Frosty and laugh.
They have a lot of fun playing in the icy snow. They reveal their secrets and their dreams to Frosty. He tells them stories and jokes. They are the best of friends.
