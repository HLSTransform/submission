The adventure began when the oxygen welcomed them. Two little girls were excited at the thought of their adventurous day. They packed quickly and set off on an expedition.
Their destination was the top of the mountain that rose over the horizon. The girls climbed steadily and admired the view below them.
When they arrived at the peak, they were amazed at the amount of oxygen rushing past them. They shared an adventurous hug and felt the wind lift them up as if they were flying.
For a moment, they felt as if they were the kings and queens of the mountain. But soon enough, it was time to head back down.
The girls waved goodbye to the oxygen as it welcomed them on their way down. They both laughed with joy as the adventure came to an end.
