It was summertime and Mommy and Daddy were planning a vacation. Mommy was very excited, but Daddy was worried. He wanted to take a long trip, but wasn't sure how flexible it would be.
So, Mommy and Daddy sat down and wrote out a plan. They wrote down the places they wanted to visit, the dates they wanted to go, and all their expenses. After they finished their plan, they both felt much better!
Soon it was time to go on their vacation. Mommy and Daddy packed up their car and drove off. They had a fantastic time exploring all the places on their list.
When it was time to go home, they packed up their car again and drove back. They had had an amazing time and were so glad they had taken the time to write out their plan. They knew it had been the right thing to do!
