Tom and Amy are youth. They like to play with toys and books. They go to school every day. But today, school is delay. There is snow on the road. The bus cannot come. Tom and Amy are happy. They can stay at home and play more.
They put on their coats and boots. They go outside. They make a snowman. They give him a hat and a scarf. They make snowballs. They throw them at each other. They laugh and have fun.
But then, they hear a voice. It is Mom. She says, "Tom, Amy, come inside. It is time for lunch. You can play more later." Tom and Amy are sad. They want to play more. They say, "Mom, please, can we play more? Just a little more?"
Mom says, "No, you have to come inside. It is cold outside. You need to eat and warm up. The snow is mild today. It will not melt soon. You can play more after lunch. Come on, I made your favorite soup."
Tom and Amy listen to Mom. They say goodbye to their snowman. They promise to come back. They go inside. They take off their coats and boots. They wash their hands. They sit at the table. They eat their soup. They say, "Thank you, Mom. The soup is yummy."
Mom says, "You are welcome, Tom and Amy. I am glad you had fun. But remember, school is not delay tomorrow. You have to go to bed early tonight. OK?"
Tom and Amy say, "OK, Mom. We will go to bed early. But can we play more after lunch?"
Mom says, "Yes, you can play more after lunch. But only for a little while. Then you have to do your homework and read a book. OK?"
Tom and Amy say, "OK, Mom. We will do our homework and read a book. But we also want to play more. We love the snow."
Mom says, "I know, Tom and Amy. I love the snow too. But we have to do other things too. Now, finish your soup and let's go play."
