Once there was a boy who was only three. His mom and dad said to him, "We dare you to go outside the house". The young boy was a bit scared because he had never seen the outside world before. But he was brave and accepted the dare. He grabbed his mom's hand and cautiously opened the door.
When the boy looked out, he saw a huge world. There were so many humans walking around and all the buildings were towering into the sky. He saw a small park nearby and it looked so inviting. Without thinking twice, he ran towards it.
When he reached the park, the boy saw dirt, sticks, and leaves scattered everywhere. He was so excited to start playing in the huge pile of dirt, but then his mom warned him. "Don't touch the dirt, it is filthy". The boy had never heard that word before and he asked his mother what it means. She explained that things that are filthy are not clean and can make us sick.
Disappointed, the young boy reluctantly stepped away from the dirt and started playing with the leaves instead. He had so much fun that he didn't even realize it had gotten dark outside. Finally, his mom called him back inside and they both had a good laugh at the adventure they had gone through.
