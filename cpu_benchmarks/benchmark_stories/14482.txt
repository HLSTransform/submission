Once upon a time, there was an otter who loved to celebrate. She was so soft and fluffy, she wanted to share her joy with the world. Everywhere she went, she danced and sang and clapped her hands. 
One day, she and her friends decided to have a big celebration. They made the prettiest decorations they could find and filled the river with colorful balloons and streamers. 
The otter and her friends began to dance and sing. It was so much fun! As they frolicked about, they felt so much joy that it seemed like the river was glowing with happiness. 
At the end of the celebration, the otter was so happy that she wanted to do it again the next day. To this day, the otter and her friends continue to celebrate whenever they can.
