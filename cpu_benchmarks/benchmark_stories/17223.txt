Once upon a time, there was a friendly crab named Crabby. He lived in a big ocean with his friends, the fish and the seahorses. One day, Crabby wanted to go for a walk on the beach. He asked his friend Fishy to come with him.
Fishy said, "I can't walk on the beach, I will get stuck in the sand."
Crabby said, "Don't worry, I will help you. We can wait for the tide to come in and then we can walk on the wet sand."
Fishy said, "Okay, let's try it."
They waited for the tide to come in and when it did, they succeeded in walking on the wet sand. They had a lot of fun and Crabby was very happy that he could help his friend Fishy.
