Once upon a time, there was a little kitten named Mittens. Mittens was very creative and loved to play with toys. One day, Mittens was playing with her favorite toy mouse when she saw a big dog coming towards her. The dog was growling and looked very scary.
Mittens was scared and didn't know what to do. She tried to run away, but the dog was too fast. Suddenly, Mittens had an idea. She blinked her eyes and pretended to be asleep. The dog sniffed around her and thought she was just a sleeping kitten.
Mittens was so happy that her creative idea worked. She knew she had to be careful around big dogs, but she was proud of herself for being so clever. From that day on, Mittens always remembered to blink when she was in trouble.
