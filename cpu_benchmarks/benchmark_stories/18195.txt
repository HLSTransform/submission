Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a small house with her mom and her cat, Daisy. Every day, Lily and Daisy would go for a walk down a path near their house. They loved to see the flowers, trees, and birds.
One sunny day, Lily and Daisy met a new friend on the path. It was a tiny ant. The ant said, "Hello, I am Andy the Ant. Can you please help me? I need some water for my family." Lily wanted to be useful, so she said, "Yes, I can help you, Andy."
Lily found a small cup and poured some water from a nearby stream. She carried the cup back to Andy and his family. The ants were very happy and thanked Lily for her help. From that day on, Lily, Daisy, and Andy the Ant became best friends and had many fun adventures together on the path.
