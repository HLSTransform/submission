Once upon a time there was a little girl who wanted to draw. She looked around for something to draw with, but she didn't have anything.
Suddenly, something shiny caught her eye. It was a pencil! She picked it up and showed it to her mom. Her mom smiled and said, "Let me introduce you to a pencil! It can help you draw pictures."
The little girl was very excited. She took the pencil and started drawing. Sometimes she made mistakes, but she was very persistent. She kept trying and eventually she drew a beautiful picture.
The little girl was so happy with her picture that she showed it to her mom. Her mom was very proud of her hard work and her persistence. She gave her a big hug and said, "You did it! Now you know how to use a pencil."
The little girl smiled and said, "I like pencils!" From then on, she used the pencil to draw lots of pictures and show them to her friends and family.
