Once upon a time, there was a wise old man who had two eyes. He used his eyes to watch the world and he knew a lot of things.
One day, he gave a very important advice to his friend. He said "Hurry, don't be so foolish!". His friend thanked him and ran away.
The wise old man soon noticed that his friend had gone too fast and he became worried. He closed his eyes and thought deeply. Then he got an idea.
He took off his shoes and ran after his friend as fast as he could. He ran and ran and ran, until he was able to catch his friend. He was very relieved!
The wise old man told his friend, "You must always remember to be careful. Hurry but don't be foolish!" His friend thanked him again and they both went home.
