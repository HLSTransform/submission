Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to walk in the park with her mommy and daddy. One day, they decided to cross the street to get to the ice cream truck. Lily was so excited because she knew the ice cream was delicious. As they walked, she held her mommy's hand tightly and looked both ways before crossing the street. When they finally made it to the ice cream truck, Lily chose her favorite flavor and it was indeed delicious. She was so happy and couldn't wait to come back to the park again.
