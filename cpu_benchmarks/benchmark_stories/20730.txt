Once upon a time, there was an enormous dolphin. It loved swimming around in the blue, blue ocean and seeing all the amazing things around it. 
One day, the dolphin wanted to do something special. So it decided to decorate its home by the sea with lots of colourful things. 
The dolphin swam around and collected shells and pebbles to make a beautiful pattern. It even managed to find some bright seaweed and brighten its wall. 
When it was finished, the dolphin looked at the decorations with a lot of pride. It was amazed by its own efforts. 
Now, the dolphin swims around its home every day with a big smile on its face. It is happy that it was able to make its home look so beautiful.
