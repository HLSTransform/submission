One day, the little boy went to the beach with his parents on a holiday. He saw the waves rolling in and out and was so excited. He ran up to his dad and said, "Happy!"
His dad smiled and said, "Yes, we are very happy. We're on a holiday together."
The little boy asked, "What's a holiday?"
His dad replied, "A holiday is a day where we can relax, have fun and enjoy being together."
So the little boy and his family spent the day at the beach. They splashed in the waves, hugged each other in the sand and laughed. They made a big sand castle and had a successful day. Then the little boy said, "Let's do it again!"
His dad smiled and said, "Yes, let's make a holiday a regular thing. We can come back here and repeat this special day as often as we like." 
The little boy was so happy. He hugged his dad and said, "Yes, let's repeat the holiday!"
