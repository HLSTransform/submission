Mimi looked around her room. Everything was organized and neat. She wanted to pick something to do. She spotted a box of crayons and picked one out. She picked the blue crayon and grabbed a piece of paper from her desk. She started drawing a picture of her favorite dog. She picked a pink for the tongue and a yellow for the fur. She was so proud of her drawing and it made her happy. 
Next, Mimi decided to pick her favorite toy. She picked her teddy bear that was a gift from her grandmother. She hugged it tight and sat down in her rocking chair. She looked around the room and felt content. 
Suddenly, something caught her eye. It was a lovely flower in her garden. She picked it up, smelled it and placed it in a vase. She was so proud of her work. Now, the room was even more organized and beautiful. Mimi smiled at her work and went to bed, happy with the day.
