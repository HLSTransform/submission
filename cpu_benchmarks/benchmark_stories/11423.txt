John was feeling very miserable. He saw a carrot in the garden and decided to pick it up. He was so excited to eat it that he started running towards his house.
Suddenly, his friend Maria called out to him. "John, where are you going so fast?" she asked. John stopped and pointed at the carrot.
Maria shook her head. "That's not your carrot," she said. "It's my dad's carrot. He grew it for dinner tonight."
John was horrified. How could he have taken someone else's carrot? He felt even more miserable than before.
Maria smiled. "Don't worry," she said. "I have more carrots in my house. I can get you one if you want."
John felt relieved. He smiled and nodded eagerly. Together, they went to Maria's house and picked a fresh carrot for John. He was so happy that he almost forgot he had been so miserable before.
