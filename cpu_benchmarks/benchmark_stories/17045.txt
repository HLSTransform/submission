Once upon a time, there was a big cat named Tom. Tom was a naughty cat who liked to play tricks on others. One day, he saw a shiny diamond on the ground. He wanted to take it for himself, but it belonged to his friend, a little dog named Max.
Tom decided to step on Max's tail to make him run away, so he could take the diamond. Max cried out and ran, but he did not know why Tom did that. Max was very sad and did not understand why his friend would hurt him.
Tom took the diamond, but he soon felt bad for what he did. He went to Max and said sorry. He gave the diamond back to Max, and they were friends again. The moral of the story is that it is not nice to be naughty and take things that do not belong to you. It is better to be kind and share with your friends.
