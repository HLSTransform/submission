Once upon a time there was a little squirrel. He was very scared. One day he started to feel brave. So he decided to explore. He ran around in circles and jumped on logs. He had so much fun!
But then he heard a noise and he was very frightened again. He looked up and saw a big dog. The dog started to bark and run after the little squirrel. The squirrel was so scared!
He started running and he ran faster than he ever had before. He ran up a tree and stayed there, not daring to come down. But then the dog stopped barking and went away.
The little squirrel was so happy. He was safe! From then on, he stayed away from big dogs but he still had lots of fun exploring.
