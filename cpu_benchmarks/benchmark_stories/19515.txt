Once there was a boy named Tim. He was very stubborn and he loved to play with his rod. Tim enjoyed spending time outside, but he often felt like he didn't belong.
One day, Tim was playing with his rod when he saw a little bird flying high in the sky. He wished he could fly like the bird, so he started jumping with his rod and tried to pretend he had wings.
Tim jumped so high that he felt like he really did belong in the sky. The bird flew down and landed on his rod. Tim was so happy! The bird stayed with Tim all day and played with him.
When it was time for the bird to go, Tim was a little sad. But the bird made him a promise that it would come back to see him soon. Tim was stubborn, but he was also very nice and he smiled and waved goodbye to his new friend.
