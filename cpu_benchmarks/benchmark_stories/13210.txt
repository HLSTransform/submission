Once upon a time, there was a famous beetle. He was so famous that everyone wanted to meet him. One day, the beetle was sleeping in the grass, when he suddenly woke up! He didn't know why he had woken up, but he soon found out. A kind boy had come to see him. The boy said, "Hello, famous beetle! I heard you were the best beetle around and I wanted to see you for myself." The beetle and the boy became the best of friends. They played and laughed until the sun went down. The beetle was so happy that he hadn't stayed asleep. He was glad he woke up to meet his new friend.
