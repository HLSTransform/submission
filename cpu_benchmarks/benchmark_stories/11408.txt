Once upon a time, there was a thief. He was very naughty and did not behave. He sneaked around and took things that did not belong to him.
One night, the thief saw a nice house with a very shiny window. Though the window was expensive, the thief did not care. He broke the window with a stone and reached his hand in.
Just then, a big dog saw the thief and started to bark. The thief ran away as fast as he could. He did not even bother to take the cheap things inside the house.
The neighbours heard the dog barking and called the police. They arrived soon afterwards and caught the thief. The police were very mad at the thief and told him off for not behaving.
Moral of the story: Be good and behave. Donâ€™t be a thief!
