Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy boats in the bathtub. One day, his mommy bought him a new boat. It was a big boat that looked like a yacht. Timmy thought it was very cool.
But then, Timmy accidentally dropped the boat and it broke. He was sad. His mommy said she would buy him a new one, but it was very expensive. Timmy waited and waited for his new boat to come.
Finally, the new boat arrived. Timmy was so excited. He carefully held it and played with it in the bathtub. When it was time to go to bed, Timmy didn't want to let go of his new boat. But he knew he had to release it and go to sleep. He went to bed happy, dreaming of sailing on his new yacht.
