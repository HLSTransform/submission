Once upon a time, there was a small dragon. His name was Bob. Bob lived in a magical forest. One day, he had to go on a special mission.
Bob had to deliver something very important. But he was scared. He didn't know where to go or what to do. But then he remembered his friend, the owl.
Bob asked the owl where he should go. The owl said, "Go to the big castle. You need to deliver something to the king!"
So Bob flew away, through the forest and over the mountains. He was so scared. But he kept flying until he reached the castle. 
He knocked on the door and the king answered. Bob told the king what he had to deliver. And finally, Bob sent his very important mission. 
The king thanked Bob and said he was brave. Bob flew back to his home, feeling proud. He couldn't believe he had done it!
