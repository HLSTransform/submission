Once there was a little girl named Jo. Jo was three years old and she liked to play with her toys.
One day, Jo went to the bathroom and closed the door. She wanted to discuss something but she was too shy to let anyone else join.
Suddenly, her brother came to the door and asked if he could come in. Jo said no and did not want to share. She was feeling very selfish.
Jo did not want her brother to hear what she was discussing. So, she stayed inside the bathroom for a long time. 
Eventually, Jo's brother went away and she was able to come out and finish her discussion. Jo learned that being selfish was not the right thing to do.
