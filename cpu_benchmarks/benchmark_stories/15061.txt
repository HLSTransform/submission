Once upon a time there was a wise girl named Jenny. She wanted to buy a piece of bark from the store to make something very special. So she asked her mom to take her to the store.
At the store, Jenny found the perfect piece of bark and asked her mom for it. Her mom said, "Jenny, I'm sorry, it's too expensive. We can't buy it." Jenny was heartbroken and she sadly said, "Okay."
But her mom said, "Wait, I have something else for you that might be even better." Jenny said, "What is it?" Her mom pointed to a very special piece of bark and said, "Maybe this piece will help you make something even better than what you're planning."
Jenny thought and then said, "Yes!" Her mom smiled and said, "I knew a wise girl like you would know what to do!" 
So Jenny took the special piece of bark home and made something amazing with it. Everyone was so impressed with what she had made out of that wise piece of bark!
