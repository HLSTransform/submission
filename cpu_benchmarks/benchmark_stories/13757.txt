Tom and Ann are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big dog. The dog is thin and hungry. It has no collar and no home.
"Can we pet the dog?" Tom questions Ann.
"I don't know. Maybe it is not nice. Maybe it bites," Ann says.
But Tom likes dogs. He goes near the dog. He says, "Hello, dog. Do you want to be my friend?"
The dog growls. It shows its teeth. It does not want to be Tom's friend. It wants to eat Tom. It jumps on Tom and bites his arm. Tom screams.
Ann runs to help Tom. She picks up a stick and hits the dog. The dog lets go of Tom and runs away. Tom is bleeding. He is hurt.
Ann cries. She says, "I'm sorry, Tom. I told you not to pet the dog. Why didn't you listen to me?"
Tom cries too. He says, "I'm sorry, Ann. I was wrong. The dog was not nice. It was mean. It wanted beef. It wanted me."
They hug each other. They wait for help. They are scared and sad. The end.
