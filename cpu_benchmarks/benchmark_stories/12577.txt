Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with boats. They have many boats. Some are big, some are small. Some are red, some are blue. Some are fast, some are slow.
One day, they go to the harbor. The harbor is a place with water and many boats. They see a big boat. It is shiny and white. It has a flag and a horn. Tom and Sam want to play with the big boat.
They run to the big boat. They climb on the big boat. They pretend to be captains. They wave the flag and blow the horn. They have fun.
But then, a man comes. He is angry. He is the owner of the big boat. He yells at Tom and Sam.
"Hey, you! Get off my boat! You are making it dirty! I just polish it! It is my boat, not yours!"
Tom and Sam are scared. They say sorry to the man. They get off the boat. They run away.
They are sad. They do not want to play with boats anymore. They think the man is tough and mean. They wish they had their own big boat. They go home.
