Once there was a happy little girl named Mary. She was three years old and loved to explore the outdoors.
One day, Mary went out to play with her friends in the forest. She was so excited to see all the colourful flowers and trees.
When they reached a clearing, Mary spotted a large block of ice. She had never seen ice before and was amazed by it.
"What is that?" Mary asked her friends.
"It's an ice cube," her friend replied.
Mary's eyes widened as she recognized the ice. She touched it with her small finger and felt how cold and smooth it was.
Just then, Mary saw something else in the ice.
"Look! A fish!" she shouted.
Mary's friends were amazed, too. But when they tried to get the fish out of the ice, one of her friends became very selfish and tried to take the fish for himself.
Mary felt sad for the fish, so she grabbed a large stick and started to break the ice block apart.
Once the ice had melted, the fish was free and swam away.
Mary's friends clapped and cheered for her. She had saved the fish and become a hero!
