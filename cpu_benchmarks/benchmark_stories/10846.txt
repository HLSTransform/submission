Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mommy. They played on the swings and slide, but then Lily saw a big tap on the ground. She went to look at it and touched it with her hand. Suddenly, she felt dizzy and fell down.
Her mommy rushed over and asked, "Lily, are you okay?"
Lily said, "I don't feel good. My head hurts."
They went home, but on the way, Lily started to feel worse. She said, "Mommy, I feel sick. I think we need to go to the doctor."
They arrived at the doctor's office, but it was too late. Lily had touched a poisonous tap and had gotten very sick. Sadly, Lily didn't make it and went to heaven to be with the angels.
