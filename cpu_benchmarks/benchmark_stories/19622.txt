Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jim. He was really small and only three years old. Every day he would wake up and go to school. 
At school his teacher would teach him all sorts of new words. He loved learning new things, and the teacher made it fun. But the teacher would also use big words that Jim didn't understand. Jim did not like this.
One day, Jim was feeling bored in class. He asked his teacher if they could play a game. His teacher agreed, and said they would play a game with fake words. Jim had never heard of that before, so he was very excited.
The teacher said it was a game where she would make up fake words and Jim had to guess what they meant. They played for an hour and Jim learned all sorts of new words. He was so proud of himself for learning a bunch of new words.
Jim went home that night feeling happy and excited. He was so glad that his teacher was teaching him fun things! From then on, Jim was always excited to go to school every day.
