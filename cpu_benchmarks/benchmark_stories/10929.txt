Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mommy were getting ready for bed. Mommy said, "Lily, it's time to put on your bathrobe and get ready for your bath."
Lily said, "I don't want to take a bath, mommy. I want to sing a song."
Mommy smiled and said, "Okay, Lily. You can sing a song in the bath. The warm water will feel nice on your skin."
Lily put on her soft, pink bathrobe and went to the bathroom. She got in the tub and started to sing her favorite song. The warm water made her feel cozy and relaxed. Mommy listened to Lily sing and smiled. She was happy that Lily was enjoying her bath.
