Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a crazy toy. The toy was a zigzag. Tim liked to play with the zigzag toy all day.
One day, Tim saw that his zigzag toy was in two parts. It was separate. He was sad. He wanted to fix his toy. He asked his mom for help.
Tim's mom helped him put the zigzag toy back together. Now it was not separate anymore. Tim was happy. He played with his crazy zigzag toy all day again. And they lived happily ever after.
