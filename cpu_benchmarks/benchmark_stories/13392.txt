Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play soccer with his friends in the park. One day, they found a big net and decided to use it as a goalpost. Timmy's friend, Johnny, kicked the ball really hard and it went into the net. 
But then, the ball got stuck in the net! Timmy tried to get it out, but it wouldn't budge. So, he asked his other friend, Sarah, to help him. Together, they pulled and pulled until the ball finally came out. 
After that, Timmy made sure to stay away from the net when he kicked the ball. He wanted to make sure it stayed clear so the ball wouldn't get stuck again. And from that day on, they had lots of fun playing soccer without any more problems. The end.
