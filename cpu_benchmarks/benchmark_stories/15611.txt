Lily liked to draw with her crayons. She had many colors and she made pictures of her family, her dog, and her toys. She was very happy when she drew.
One day, she saw a thick book on the shelf. It had many words and pictures in it. It was her mom's work book. She wanted to see what was inside. She took the book and opened it on the floor.
She saw many pages with numbers and letters and shapes. She did not understand them. She thought they were boring. She decided to make them more fun. She took her crayons and started to draw on the pages. She drew flowers and stars and hearts and faces. She used all her colors and made the book very bright.
She was very proud of her work. She wanted to show her mom. She picked up the book and ran to the kitchen. She saw her mom cooking. She said, "Mom, look what I did! I made your book pretty!"
Her mom turned around and saw the book. She was very angry. She said, "Lily, what did you do? This is my work book! I need it for my job! You ruined it! You can't draw on other people's things!"
Lily was very scared. She did not know her mom would be mad. She thought she was helping. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I didn't know. I just wanted to make you happy."
Her mom sighed. She said, "I know, Lily. But you have to ask before you touch other people's things. And you have to respect their work. This book was very important and hard to make. Now I have to get a new one."
Lily felt very bad. She regretted drawing on the book. She wished she had not done it. She said, "I'm very sorry, mom. I won't do it again. Can I help you fix it?"
Her mom smiled. She said, "Thank you, Lily. That's very kind of you. But I don't think we can fix it. It's too late. But maybe you can help me with something else. How about you draw me a new picture with your crayons? And then we can hang it on the fridge. I would love that."
Lily nodded. She said, "Okay, mom. I will do that. I love you, mom."
Her mom hugged her. She said, "I love you too, Lily. And I love your drawings. But only on paper, okay?"
Lily agreed. She said, "Okay, mom. Only on paper." She ran to get her crayons and paper. She wanted to make her mom happy. She learned her lesson. She never drew on books again.
