Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to read books with her mommy and daddy. One day, while reading a book about a princess, she saw a spark on the page. It was so pretty and shiny! 
Lily asked her parents what the spark was, and they told her it was a rare kind of magic. She was amazed and wanted to learn more about it. She read more books about magic and sparkles, and soon she became an expert on rare sparks. 
Now, every time she read a book, she looked for rare sparks on the pages. And every time she found one, she would smile and feel happy. Reading was her favorite thing to do, and finding rare sparks made it even more fun!
