Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, they found a shiny red ball and started to spin it around. It was so much fun!
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise and saw a big ambulance with flashing lights and loud sirens. It was rushing to help someone who was hurt. Lily and her friends watched as the ambulance drove away.
Later that day, Lily's mom gave her a brilliant idea. They would make their own ambulance out of cardboard boxes and play pretend. Lily was so excited and couldn't wait to start building. They worked together and made the most brilliant ambulance ever! They even added a spinning wheel on top. It was so much fun pretending to be doctors and nurses helping people in need.
