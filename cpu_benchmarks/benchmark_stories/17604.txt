Once upon a time, there was a small baby named Lily. Lily slept in a small crib next to her mommy's bed. One day, Lily's mommy realized that Lily was getting bigger and needed a bigger crib. 
Mommy said to Lily, "Lily, you are growing so big. It's time for a bigger crib." 
Lily replied, "Okay mommy, I want a big crib like yours." 
So, mommy went to the store and bought a big crib for Lily. Lily was so happy to have a big crib to sleep in. She slept soundly every night in her new big crib.
