Tom and Jen are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big bird in the park. It is a turkey. The turkey is silly. It runs after the dogs and the cats. It makes loud noises. It tries to eat the flowers.
Tom and Jen think the turkey is funny. They want to play with it. They run after the turkey. The turkey runs away. It goes to the pond. It jumps in the water. It splashes and swims. Tom and Jen laugh. They go to the pond too. They watch the turkey.
But the turkey is not happy. It does not like the water. It wants to get out. It flaps its wings. It shakes its feathers. It makes more loud noises. It looks for a way out. It sees a boat. It jumps on the boat. It tries to steer the boat.
The boat is not a real boat. It is a toy boat. It belongs to a boy. The boy is angry. He does not like the turkey. He wants his boat back. He runs to the pond. He shouts at the turkey. He throws stones at the turkey.
The turkey is scared. It does not know what to do. It jumps off the boat. It runs to the park. It looks for a safe place. It sees Tom and Jen. It runs to them. It hides behind them. Tom and Jen are surprised. They feel sorry for the turkey. They hug the turkey. They tell the boy to stop. They say the turkey is their friend.
The boy is confused. He does not understand. He says the turkey is not a friend. He says the turkey is a pest. He says the turkey is a dinner. He says he wants to eat the turkey. He says he has a big oven.
Tom and Jen are shocked. They do not like the boy. They do not want to eat the turkey. They want to save the turkey. They say the turkey is not a dinner. They say the turkey is a pet. They say they have a big house. They say they will take the turkey home.
The turkey is happy. It likes Tom and Jen. It does not like the boy. It does not want to be a dinner. It wants to be a pet. It wants to go home with Tom and Jen. It nods its head. It makes a happy noise. It follows Tom and Jen.
Tom and Jen are happy too. They like the turkey. They do not care if it is silly. They think it is cute. They think it is fun. They think it is brave. They take the turkey home. They give it a name. They call it Fluffy. They play with Fluffy. They feed Fluffy. They love Fluffy.
The end.
