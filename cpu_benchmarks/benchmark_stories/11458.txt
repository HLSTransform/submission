Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl named Sarah. She was 3 years old and loved to play with her mom and dad. One night, Mom and Dad decided to surprise Sarah with some special popcorn. They bought her some special popcorn with lots of chocolate and sprinkles and they were very thoughtful.
Sarah was so excited when she saw the popcorn and she wanted to learn how to make it. Mom said, " Sarah, let's create some popcorn together. Follow me and we'll do it together.‚Äù
So Sarah and Mom went to the kitchen and they started to make the popcorn. First they added some oil to the pot, then they poured the popcorn, and put the pot over the fire. Sarah watched and waited until the popcorn was ready.
The popcorn smelled so delicious and it was filled with a magical smell. Finally, when the popcorn was ready, Sarah was so excited that she jumped and clapped her hands.
Mom and Dad gave Sarah some popcorn and she enjoyed it. From that day forward, Sarah always looked forward to making popcorn with her Mom and Dad.
