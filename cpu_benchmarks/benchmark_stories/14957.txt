The sun started to go up, and the boy started to get ready to go. It was time to go in a boat. He felt a little nervous, but he was also excited.
The boy was feeling ready, but his dad had one more thing to remind him: stay away from the unknown. The boy nodded, and then his dad hugged him.
They drove to the lake and the boy's dad showed him the boat. It was small and shiny. He wanted to touch it, but his dad reminded him to be careful not to fall in.
The boy and his dad got in the boat and started rowing. The boy was happily looking around, but then he remembered his dad's warning and he started to get scared. 
Soon, they reached land. The boy stepped out of the boat and saw a strange man standing there. He was scared, but his dad talked to the man.
It turned out the man was a friend of his dad's. He was there to remind them to take care of the boat while they were gone. Relief and happiness ran through the boy, and he smiled. He knew that his dad had been looking out for him and kept him safe.
