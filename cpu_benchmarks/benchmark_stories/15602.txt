Sam liked to play with insects. He liked to watch them crawl and fly and make noises. He had a jar where he kept some of his insect friends. He gave them grass and water and talked to them.
One day, Sam brought his jar to school. He wanted to show his teacher and his classmates his insects. He was very proud of them. He put his jar on his desk and waited for the bell.
But Tom, who sat next to Sam, did not like insects. He thought they were gross and scary. He wanted to tease Sam and make him cry. He waited for Sam to look away and then he opened the jar. He took out one of the insects and threw it at Sam.
"Look, Sam, your insect is flying away!" Tom laughed. "How do you like that?"
Sam was very sad and angry. He saw his insect fall on the floor and get stepped on by someone. He felt like he lost a friend. He wanted to hit Tom, but he knew that was wrong. He looked for help.
He saw Lily, who sat behind him. Lily was a dependable friend. She always helped Sam when he was in trouble. She saw what Tom did and she did not like it. She picked up the jar and closed it. She gave it back to Sam and hugged him.
"It's okay, Sam, don't listen to Tom. He is mean and silly. Your insects are cool and nice. I like them too. Do you want to show them to me?" Lily asked.
Sam nodded and smiled. He felt better. He opened the jar and showed Lily his insects. He told her their names and what they liked to do. Lily listened and asked questions. She was very interested and kind.
Tom saw Sam and Lily talking and playing. He felt jealous and lonely. He wished he had a friend like Lily. He wished he had not teased Sam. He realized he was wrong and he felt sorry. He wanted to say sorry, but he did not know how. He looked down and said nothing.
