Once upon a time, there was a sad man. He wanted to be happy again, but he didn't know how. Then he saw a ladder. He thought it would be the perfect thing to help him. So he climbed the ladder so he could try to be happy.
But when he reached the top, he felt even more sad. He wanted to smile again, but nothing made him feel better. He stayed up there and looked around, but he was still sad.
Finally, he decided to come down the ladder, but he slipped and fell. He didn't know what to do. He was very hurt and still very sad.
The man never smiled again.
