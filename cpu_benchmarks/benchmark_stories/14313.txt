It was a hot day. The sun melted the ice cream cones and the soft grass. Little Jack was outside playing in his garden with his red bow.
He was having so much fun until someone said, "Hello Jack!" He turned around and saw an old lady standing by the fence. He gave her a polite smile and said, "Hi!"
The old lady said, "What a beautiful bow! Can I have a look?" Jack gladly handed his bow to her. She was so amazed by its beauty.
The old lady said, "That was so polite of you Jack! As a reward, I'm going to give you something special." She reached into her pocket and pulled out a colorful butterfly. Jack was so happy he couldn't stop smiling.
He thanked the old lady and went back to playing with his new butterfly. The sun kept melted and the bow stayed right by his side. Jack had a wonderful day.
