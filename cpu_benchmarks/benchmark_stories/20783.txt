Once there was a little girl called Sophie who loved to jump. Every day she would jump around the garden with the birds and the butterflies. 
One day, she found something very special in the grass. It was a red lollipop! She picked it up, held it tight and began to jump up and down. 
She was so excited and she kept jumping, higher and higher. Finally, she was able to single-handily bite the lollipop in half. She was very pleased with herself.
Sophie kept jumping and eating the lollipop, enjoying the sweet taste. She was so persistent that she finished the whole lollipop before the day was done. She was satisfied and decided to jump back home, tired but happy.
