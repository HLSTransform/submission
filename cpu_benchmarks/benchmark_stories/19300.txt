Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved food. Every day, she would use her spoon and fork to eat all kinds of delicious food. Her mom would cook the most amazing dishes and the little girl could not get enough of it.
One day, the little girl decided to be crazy and not use her spoon and fork. Instead, she used her hands to eat her food. She thought it was great fun and she loved how she felt like a giant!
But then all of a sudden the little girl started to feel sick. Her tummy was grumbling, and her head was feeling funny. She knew she had used her hands too much and had not eaten her food properly.
So the little girl decided to go back to using her spoon and fork. Now, she always makes sure to eat her food the right way!
