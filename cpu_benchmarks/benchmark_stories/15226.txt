Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a funny monkey named Max. Max loved to joke and make his friends laugh. He would swing from tree to tree, playing with all the animals.
One day, Max found a big, yellow banana. He thought it would be easy to share it with his friends. Max called out to all his friends to come and see the banana. They all came running and were very excited.
Max thought of a funny joke to play with the banana. He put the banana on the ground and waited for his friend, the elephant, to come by. When the elephant walked close, Max yelled, "Watch out for the banana!" The elephant stopped and laughed. All the animals laughed too. They knew Max was always joking. They shared the banana and had a fun day in the forest.
