Once upon a time, there was an elderly man named Mr. Smith. He lived in a small village near a big forest. One day, his granddaughter, Lily, came to visit him. They loved spending time together and playing hide-and-seek in the woods.
One morning, they woke up to find that the village was covered in thick fog. Mr. Smith promised Lily that they would still go on their adventure in the forest, but they had to be careful and stick together.
As they walked through the fog, they heard a rustling in the bushes. Mr. Smith told Lily to stay close and not to be afraid. Suddenly, a little puppy appeared from the bushes. Lily was so happy and wanted to take the puppy home with them.
But Mr. Smith knew that the puppy belonged to someone else and they had to find its owner. They searched the village and finally found the puppy's owner, an old lady who lived alone. She was so grateful to have her puppy back and thanked Mr. Smith and Lily for their kindness.
From that day on, Mr. Smith and Lily always went on adventures together, but they never forgot the promise they made to always help others in need.
