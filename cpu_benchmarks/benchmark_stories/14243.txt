Once upon a time there was a little girl named Nina. She was very brave and loved going on adventures. One day, she decided to wander into the forest to explore. As she walked, she noticed a giant mushroom. She was very excited and anxious to see if it was safe to eat. 
She decided to pick it and take a bite. The mushroom tasted sweet and delicious, so she ate some more. Then all of a sudden, she started to feel funny. Her stomach started to hurt and she felt very anxious. The mushroom had made her very sick!
Nina forgot all about the mushroom and sadly had to stay at home for weeks until she felt better. She remembered the mushroom but made sure to never eat one again. Unlucky for Nina, eating that mushroom had made her very sick!
