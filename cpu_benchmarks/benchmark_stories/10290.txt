Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play together. Today they want to visit their grandma. Grandma lives in a big house with many stairs.
Anna and Ben put on their coats and hats. They hold their mom's hand. They walk to the bus stop. They wait for the bus. They see the bus coming. It is yellow and loud.
"Look, mom, the bus is here!" Anna says.
"Yes, let's get on the bus," mom says.
They get on the bus. They find a seat. They look out the window. They see cars and trees and shops. They see a park with swings and slides. They see a school with children and teachers.
"Can we play in the park later?" Ben asks.
"Maybe, if we have time," mom says.
They ride the bus for a long time. They get off the bus. They walk to grandma's house. They see the house. It is white and tall. It has a red door and a blue roof. It has many stairs.
"Wow, grandma's house is so big!" Anna says.
"Yes, it is. Do you remember how to climb the stairs?" mom asks.
"Yes, we do. We hold the railing and we count the stairs," Ben says.
They climb the stairs. They count the stairs. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. They reach the door. They knock on the door. They hear grandma's voice.
"Who is it?" grandma asks.
"It's us, grandma. Anna and Ben and mom," Anna says.
"Come in, come in. I'm so happy to see you," grandma says.
She opens the door. She hugs them. She has a big smile and thick glasses. She smells like cookies and flowers.
"Hello, grandma. We missed you," Ben says.
"Hello, my darlings. I missed you too. Come in, come in. I have something for you," grandma says.
She leads them to the living room. She shows them a big basket. It is full of toys and books and candies.
"Wow, grandma, thank you. You are so nice," Anna says.
"You're welcome, my dears. You are so sweet. Now, let's have some fun," grandma says.
They sit on the couch. They play with the toys. They read the books. They eat the candies. They talk and laugh and sing. They have a lot of fun. They love to visit grandma. Grandma loves to visit them. They are a happy family.
