Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to kick the ball to each other and run after it. But then the fog came. The fog was thick and white and made it hard to see. Ben and Lily could not find their ball or each other.
"Ben, where are you?" Lily called out.
"Lily, I'm here!" Ben answered. He tried to follow her voice, but the fog was too strong.
They were scared and cold. They wanted to go home, but they did not know which way to go. They wished the fog would go away.
Then they heard a loud noise. It was a big truck. The truck had a big hose. The hose sprayed water into the air. The water made the fog go away. The truck was a fire truck. The fire truck was helping to release the fog.
Ben and Lily saw the fire truck and the firemen. They also saw their ball and each other. They ran to the fire truck and thanked the firemen.
"Thank you for releasing the fog!" Lily said.
"You're welcome, little girl. We're glad you're safe," one fireman said.
"Can we see your hose?" Ben asked.
"Sure, little boy. Do you want to try it?" another fireman said.
He gave Ben a helmet and a coat and let him hold the hose. Ben felt very brave and happy. He sprayed water into the air and made a rainbow.
Lily clapped and cheered. She also got a helmet and a coat and took turns with Ben. They had fun with the fire truck and the firemen.
The fog was gone and the sun was shining. Ben and Lily were not scared and cold anymore. They were warm and glad. They hugged the firemen and said goodbye. They took their ball and went home with their mom. They told her about their adventure in the park. They said the fire truck and the firemen were very nice. They said they liked to release the fog.
