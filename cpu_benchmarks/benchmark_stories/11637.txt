Once upon a time there was a little boy called Joe. He liked to play with his toys and explore the world. One day he asked his mum to take him to the beach.
Mum said yes, so she brought them to the shore. Joe's eyes lit up as he saw the incredible blue sea and the sandy beach. He spotted some seagulls flying high above and heard the waves bring the water to the shore.
Joe found a big shell and put his ear to it. He thought he could hear an animal in the shell. He tried to pick it up but it was very heavy. To his surprise, his mum had brought a small bucket and some gloves. She gently lifted the shell and showed it to Joe. Inside was a baby lung fish. Its colour was so bright that Joe was in awe. It was incredible! 
Mum put the fish back in the water and said that she wanted Joe to be able to see it grow up. Joe saw the fish swimming away and smiled. This had been an incredible adventure.
