Tom and Lily went to the zoo with their mom. They wanted to see the monkeys. They ran to the monkey house and looked at the big glass. They saw many monkeys. Some monkeys were swinging on ropes. Some monkeys were eating bananas. Some monkeys were playing with each other.
Tom and Lily observed the monkeys. They liked the monkeys. They pointed at the monkeys and said their names. They said, "Look, mom, a brown monkey! Look, mom, a black monkey! Look, mom, a baby monkey!"
One monkey was very funny. He was spinning on a tire. He spun faster and faster. He made funny noises. He made Tom and Lily laugh. He stopped spinning and jumped off the tire. He looked very dizzy. He wobbled and fell on the ground. He made Tom and Lily laugh more.
The dizzy monkey got up and shook his head. He looked at Tom and Lily. He smiled and waved at them. He picked up a banana and threw it at the glass. He made a loud bang. He made Tom and Lily jump. He made Tom and Lily scream.
Mom said, "Don't be scared. The monkey is just playing. He can't hurt you. He is behind the glass." She hugged Tom and Lily. She said, "Did you like the monkeys?" Tom and Lily nodded. They said, "Yes, mom, we liked the monkeys. But the dizzy monkey was the best!"
