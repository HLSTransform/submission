Once upon a time, there were two sisters called Lucy and Jane. Lucy and Jane liked to help each other, so they decided to make a special dish together.
First, they got all the ingredients they needed. Then they set the table, making it nice and tidy.
Jane said, "Let's add the milk. Stir it carefully, Lucy!"
Lucy mixed in the milk, stirring carefully. She smiled and said, "Let's add the sugar now!"
Jane nodded and handed her the sugar. Then Lucy sprinkled in the sugar carefully.
When they started to place the dish on the table, it looked so tasty! The table was tidy and the dish was perfect.
"We did it!" said Lucy. Jane smiled and agreed. "Yes! We made a yummy dish together!"
