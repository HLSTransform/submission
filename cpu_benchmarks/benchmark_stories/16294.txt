Once upon a time, there was a little chicken named Chirpy. Chirpy was very silly and loved to play. One day, Chirpy found a big egg in the grass. Chirpy didn't remember where it came from, but she wanted to play with it.
Chirpy rolled the egg around and around, but then she accidentally broke the egg! Oh no! Chirpy felt very sad and didn't know what to do. But then, she remembered that her mommy had told her that sometimes eggs break and it's okay.
Chirpy felt better and went to find her mommy. She told her mommy what happened and her mommy gave her a big hug. Chirpy learned that it's okay to make mistakes and that even silly little chickens can be brave and tell the truth.
