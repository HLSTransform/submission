Lily and Tom were playing in the garden. They liked to dig holes and find worms and stones. Lily found a shiny thing in the dirt. It was a pipe. She showed it to Tom.
"Look, Tom, I found a pipe! It is shiny and round. Can I blow in it?" Lily asked.
Tom looked at the pipe. He wanted to blow in it too. He said, "No, Lily, it is my turn. You always find the best things. Give me the pipe."
Lily did not want to give the pipe to Tom. She said, "No, Tom, it is mine. I found it first. You can blow in it later."
Tom and Lily started to pull the pipe. They both wanted it. They did not see the big dog that came near them. The dog saw the pipe. He thought it was a bone. He barked and jumped on Tom and Lily. He took the pipe in his mouth and ran away.
Tom and Lily were scared and sad. They lost the pipe. They looked at each other. They said, "Sorry, Lily. Sorry, Tom. We were silly. We should have shared the pipe. Maybe the dog will bring it back."
They hugged and went to look for the dog. They hoped he would allow them to play with the pipe again. They learned that it is better to share than to fight. The pipe was not so ordinary after all. It was a special pipe that made them friends.
