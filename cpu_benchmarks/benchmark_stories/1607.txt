Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play with toys and sing songs. One day, they find a big box in the attic. Inside the box, there is a player. The player has a round thing that spins and makes music.
"Wow, look at this!" Lily says. "Let's try it!"
They put the round thing on the player and turn it on. The music is loud and fun. Lily and Tom start to dance. They jump and clap and spin. They are happy.
But then, they hear a noise. It is Mom. She is coming up the stairs.
"Oh no, we have to stop!" Tom says. "Mom will be mad. She said we can't play in the attic."
But Lily does not want to stop. She likes the music. She is lazy. She does not listen to Tom.
"Come on, Lily, hurry!" Tom says. He turns off the player and puts the round thing back in the box. He runs to the door.
But Lily stays. She dances by herself. She does not hear Mom.
Mom opens the door. She sees Lily dancing. She is not happy.
"Lily, what are you doing?" Mom says. "You know you are not allowed to play in the attic. And you are making too much noise. You have to come down right now."
Lily stops dancing. She looks at Mom. She is scared. She knows she is in trouble.
"Sorry, Mom," Lily says. "I just wanted to dance."
Mom sighs. She takes Lily by the hand and leads her down the stairs. She is not very mad, but she is disappointed.
"Next time, listen to your friend," Mom says. "And don't be lazy. Dancing is fun, but you have to follow the rules."
Lily nods. She feels sorry. She hopes Mom will forgive her. She hopes Tom will still be her friend. She likes to dance, but she likes to play with Tom more.
