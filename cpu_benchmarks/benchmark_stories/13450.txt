Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they were playing hide-and-seek when Lily suddenly felt something tickling in her nose. She sneezed loudly and her friends laughed.
After playing for a while longer, Lily noticed that her bike tire was flat. She was sad because she couldn't ride her bike anymore. But then her dad came and fixed the tire for her. She was happy again.
Later that day, Lily and her friends were walking in the park when they saw a big dog. Lily was scared because she had never seen such a big dog before. But her friend's mom told them that the dog was friendly and that they didn't need to be scared. They petted the dog and had fun playing with him.
