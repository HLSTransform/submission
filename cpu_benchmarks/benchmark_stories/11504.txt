Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a new toy that he loved to play with every day. He also had a little sister named Sue. Sue was very small and liked to watch Tim play with his new toy.
One day, Tim's mom made dinner for the family. She made broccoli for everyone to eat. Tim did not like broccoli at all. In fact, he hated it. He did not want to eat it, but his mom said he had to.
Tim had an idea. He gave some of his broccoli to his little sister, Sue. Sue tasted the broccoli and smiled. She liked it a lot! Tim was happy because he did not have to eat the broccoli he hated. From then on, Tim and Sue always shared their food with each other.
