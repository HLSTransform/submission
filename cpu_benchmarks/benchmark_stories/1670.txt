Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Timmy, mind the weather. It looks like it might rain soon."
Timmy looked up at the sky and saw some big, brown clouds. He knew that meant his mom was right. Timmy ran to his friends and said, "Hey guys, we better go inside. The weather is going to be bad soon."
His friends agreed and they all went inside to play. Just as they got inside, it started to rain really hard. Timmy's mom was happy that he listened to her and minded the weather.
