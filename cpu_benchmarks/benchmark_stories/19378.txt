Once upon a time there was a jolly bear. He wanted to go for a walk. He looked around and saw many paths, but he couldn't decide which one to choose. He wanted to pick the one that would make him the happiest.
Finally, he chose the path that went up the hill. He thought walking up the hill would be fun and he would get to see the top of the hill. He started walking on the path and smiled as he went.
The bear walked up the hill and came to a tree. He was surprised to see a bee buzzing all around the tree. The bear was a bit scared. He wanted to be brave and he wanted to keep walking. He decided to pick the path that went around the tree.
The bear walked around the tree and continued up the hill. He was so glad he chose the path that went around the tree. He soon reached the top of the hill and gasped in delight. From the top of the hill he could see a beautiful lake. He was so happy he chose the right path.
Pleased with his adventure, the jolly bear returned home, happy and content. He knew he had chosen the right path.
