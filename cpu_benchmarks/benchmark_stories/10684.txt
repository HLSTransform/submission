Jimmy was out in the forest with his dad. Jimmy looked at the tall trees and the long lumber all around. Dad was working hard and every now and then, he would let out a big sigh.
"What are you doing, Dad?" Jimmy asked.
Dad smiled and said "I'm making something important for you, Jimmy. It's going to be a surprise." 
Jimmy smiled too and watched his dad work. He was impressed with how much Dad was doing and how hard he was working. 
After a while, Dad stopped and said "There! It's done". 
Jimmy looked and smiled, excited to see what his dad had made. Dad had made a big wooden house, just for Jimmy! 
Jimmy was so happy and he hugged his Dad and thanked him. Dad smiled and they both sighed - they were so proud of the important work they'd done together.
