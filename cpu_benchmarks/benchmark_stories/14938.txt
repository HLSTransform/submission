Once upon a time there were two friends named Kate and Sam. They liked to play together and pretend. 
One day, Kate and Sam decided to play pretend in the rain. They ran out into the wet garden and used their hands to make pretend umbrellas. They laughed and twirled in the rain, feeling it on their faces. 
Soon it was time for Kate to stay home for dinner. Sam stayed out in the rain pretending to be an explorer, visiting far away lands. After a while, Kate said her goodbye and went inside. She left Sam in the wet garden with a smile in her heart. 
Later that night, when Kate lay in bed, she thought of her friend Sam and smiled, imagining his adventures in the magical, wet garden full of pretend.
