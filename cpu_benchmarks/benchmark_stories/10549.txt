Toby was very miserable. He had dropped his favourite toy and it was broken. He looked across the room and saw his bookshelf. He went to it and took out a big pile of books. Toby spread the books across the floor and sat down in the middle. It was like a big blanket. Toby lay down and it covered him all the way up to his chin. Toby was happy and snuggled under the books. He didn't feel miserable anymore. He smiled and went to sleep.
