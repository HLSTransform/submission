Lila was a little girl who liked to taste new things. She tasted fruits, flowers, bread, cheese, and even dirt. She wanted to know how everything tasted. One day, she saw a big shadow on the wall. It looked like a bird with long wings. She wondered how it tasted.
She ran to the shadow and tried to catch it with her mouth. But the shadow moved away. It was not a real bird. It was a shadow puppet. Lila's brother, Sam, was making it with his hands. He laughed and said, "You can't taste a shadow, silly. It has no taste."
Lila felt sad. She wanted to taste the shadow bird. She asked Sam, "Can you make me a real bird?" Sam shook his head. He said, "I can't make a real bird. But I can show you one. Come with me."
He took Lila to the window. He pointed to the sky. There were many real birds flying in the sun. They were graceful and beautiful. They sang and chirped. Lila smiled. She said, "They are so pretty. How do they taste?"
Sam said, "I don't know. I never tasted a bird. But I don't think you should. They are not food. They are friends. They have feelings and families. They don't like to be eaten."
Lila nodded. She said, "You are right. I don't want to eat them. I want to watch them and listen to them. Maybe they will teach me their songs."
Sam said, "Maybe they will. But you have to be quiet and gentle. Then they will trust you and come closer."
Lila and Sam sat by the window. They were quiet and gentle. They watched and listened to the birds. They felt happy and curious. They learned some of their songs. They did not taste them. They loved them.
