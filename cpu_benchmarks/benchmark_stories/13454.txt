Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily lived in a big house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to help dust the furniture. Lily was happy to help and got her special duster. She dusted the table and the chairs and even the picture frames on the wall.
After they finished dusting, Lily's mommy asked her if she wanted to study her ABCs. Lily was excited to learn and they sat down at the kitchen table with her ABC book. But when Lily saw that she didn't know some of the letters, she felt ashamed. Her mommy told her not to worry and that they would keep studying until she knew them all.
Lily was happy to keep learning and she knew that even though she didn't know everything yet, she could still try her best. And whenever she saw dust on the furniture, she would remember how she helped her mommy and feel proud of herself. The end.
