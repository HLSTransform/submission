Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to make things with her hands, like play-dough animals and paper airplanes. One day, she saw her mom sewing a dress and asked her what she was doing. Her mom said she was making a fashion dress for her friend's party.
Lily was very curious about fashion and asked her mom to teach her how to sew. Her mom showed her how to use a needle and thread and together they made a large bow for Lily's hair. Lily was so proud of what she had made and wore it to the party.
At the party, Lily saw her friend crying because she didn't have a pretty dress like the other kids. Lily remembered how happy she felt when she made the bow for her hair and decided to make her friend a dress. She used all the skills her mom taught her and made a beautiful dress for her friend.
Her friend was so happy and thanked Lily for her kindness. Lily learned that it's not just about making things for yourself, but also about making others happy.
