Lila and Ben were playing with blocks in their room. They liked to make towers and houses with the blocks. They had many blocks of different colors and shapes. Some were round, some were square, some were long and some were short.
"Look, Lila, I made a big tower with the square blocks!" Ben said, showing his creation to his sister. "It is very tall and strong. It can rise up to the sky!"
"That is nice, Ben, but I made a better house with the round blocks!" Lila said, pointing to her own work. "It is very cozy and pretty. It can keep us warm and safe!"
They both smiled and admired their blocks. They were proud of what they made. They decided to play together and pretend that their blocks were a city.
But then, they heard a loud noise from outside. It sounded like thunder. They looked out the window and saw dark clouds and rain. They felt anxious. They did not like storms. They were afraid of the lightning and the wind.
"Mommy, Daddy, where are you?" Lila cried, running to the door. "We are scared of the storm!"
Ben followed her, holding his tower. He did not want to leave his blocks behind. He hoped they would not fall or break.
"Don't worry, kids, we are here!" Mommy said, coming into the room. "We heard the storm too. It is okay, we will stay with you until it is over."
Daddy hugged them and took them to the couch. He gave them a blanket and some cookies. He told them stories and jokes to make them laugh. He said the storm would not last long and that everything would be fine.
Lila and Ben felt better. They snuggled with their parents and ate their cookies. They still had their blocks with them. They were not anxious anymore. They were happy.
