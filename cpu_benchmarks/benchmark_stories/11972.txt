Once upon a time, there was a kind king who loved to play with his shiny metal sword. One day, he lost his sword and asked his wise queen for help. She searched everywhere and finally found it in the garden. The king was so happy and said, "Thank you, please always help me when I lose things." The queen smiled and said, "Of course, my dear." From that day on, the king was more careful with his metal sword and never lost it again.
