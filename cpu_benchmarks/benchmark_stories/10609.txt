Emma was a young girl with a creative heart. She loved to express her ideas through fashion. Every morning she would spend lots of time picking out what she wanted to wear. On today's outfit she choose a bright pink t-shirt with a lion on the front. As soon she put it on, Emma let out a loud roar - like the lion on her shirt.
At the same time, there was an elderly neighbour walking his pet dog in the park. When he heard the roar, he got terrified and screamed.
But when the neighbour realised it was just Emma roaring and not a real lion, he smiled and said, "Oh, don't worry, Emma, it's just you being harmless!" 
The neighbour was relieved and even started laughing. Emma was very happy to have made her neighbour happy.
The next morning when Emma picked up her lion shirt to wear, she heard a roar in the distance. It was a real lion coming from the zoo nearby! 
Emma laughed excitedly and ran towards her neighbour, shouting, "Did you hear that? Today I heard the real roar!" 
The neighbour smiled and said, "Yes, Emma. Today, it was a real roar!"
