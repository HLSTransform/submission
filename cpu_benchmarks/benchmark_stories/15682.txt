Once there was a bright bird. She sat in the tree singing a beautiful song. As she sang, she was looking out for her best friend. All of a sudden, she heard a voice coming from far away.
"What's the truth?" The voice asked.
The little bird was so happy to see who was talking. It was her friend! She flew down from the tree and quickly sat by her friend.
"Friend, I know the truth!" The little bird said with a smile.
"What is it?" Her friend asked.
"I know that the world is a wonderful place and that we should be kind to all the living creatures." 
Her friend nodded with agreement and then the two happily flew off together into the bright sky.
