Once upon a time, there were two friends - Bob and Jack. They both wanted to discover something special.
One night, they decided to go on a journey together. As they walked, Bob saw something shiny in the sky. It was the moon! Bob was so excited and called for Jack.
Jack ran over and was envious. He wanted the special shiny object for himself. Bob quickly told him that if he looked long and hard enough, he could also discover something special.
So, together, Bob and Jack found many beautiful things under the night sky - from stars and clouds to fireflies and a rabbit. 
It was a magical night! Both Bob and Jack were happy they had gone on the journey together.
