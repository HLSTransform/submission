Once upon a time, there was a hungry wolf. The wolf lived in a big forest. He was very hungry and wanted to find some food.
One day, the hungry wolf found a big, red apple. He was so happy! He picked up the apple and started to chew it. The apple was very yummy and sweet. The wolf chewed and chewed until the apple was all gone.
After eating the apple, the wolf was not hungry anymore. He was very full and happy. The wolf went back to his home in the forest, and took a long nap. Now, every time the wolf got hungry, he would find a big, red apple to chew and be happy again.
