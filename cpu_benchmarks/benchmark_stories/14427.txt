Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the store with his mommy. One day, they went to the store to buy some yummy snacks. Timmy was so excited to try the new cookies that his mommy picked out. 
As they were walking down the aisle, Timmy saw a toy car that he really wanted. He asked his mommy if he could have it, but she said no. Timmy was sad at first, but then he remembered the cookies and started to feel happy again. 
When they got home, Timmy and his mommy started to eat the cookies. They were so delicious that Timmy started to dance around with excitement. He was so happy that he forgot all about the toy car at the store. From that day on, Timmy knew that going to the store with his mommy meant yummy snacks and lots of fun!
