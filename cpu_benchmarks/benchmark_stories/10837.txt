Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. One day, Timmy and his friends were playing outside when they saw a skunk. Timmy's friend said, "We should spray the skunk with water." Timmy said, "No, that's not nice. The skunk might get scared."
Suddenly, Timmy's little sister came outside and said, "I need an operation. I feel weak." Timmy asked her what was wrong, and she said her tummy hurt. Timmy knew he had to help his sister, so he took her to their mom.
After the operation, Timmy's sister felt much better. Timmy's mom told him he was a good brother for helping his sister. Timmy learned that it's important to be kind and helpful to others, even if they are animals like skunks or family members who feel weak.
