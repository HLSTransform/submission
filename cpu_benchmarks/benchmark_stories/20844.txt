Once upon a time, there was a young bunny. He was walking through the woods when he saw a grape lying on the ground. He was very excited and he wanted to take it home. He slowly opened the grape and ate it. 
As he was walking, he heard a rustling noise coming from a nearby bush. He decided to open the bush and to his surprise, he saw a big fox. The fox looked at him with a fierce glare and growled. 
The bunny was scared but he was brave and he tried to stand his ground. The fox then slowly opened its mouth, revealing big sharp teeth. The bunny knew the fox was going to eat him, so he quickly ran away as fast as he could. Unfortunately, this was not fast enough. The fox caught up with him, and the bunny was never seen again. 
The moral of the story is never open something without knowing whatâ€™s inside. Always think twice before making a decision.
