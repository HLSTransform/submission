Ben likes to collect things. He has a box full of rocks, shells, and feathers. He also has a big helmet that he wears when he rides his bike. He thinks his helmet makes him look brave and strong.
One day, he goes to the park with his mom and his bike. He sees a shiny coin on the ground. He stops his bike and picks up the coin. He puts it in his pocket and smiles. He thinks it is a treasure.
He rides his bike some more and sees a girl with a pink helmet. She is riding a scooter. She stops next to him and says, "Hi, I'm Lily. I like your helmet. It's big and blue."
"Hi, I'm Ben. Thank you. I like your helmet too. It's pink and pretty," he says.
"Do you want to play with me?" she asks.
"Sure, what do you want to play?" he says.
"Let's collect things. I have a bag full of stickers, buttons, and beads. We can trade and share," she says.
"OK, that sounds fun. I have a box full of rocks, shells, and feathers. And a coin. It's shiny and round," he says.
They park their bike and scooter and sit on a bench. They open their bag and box and show each other their collections. They trade and share some of their things. They talk and laugh. They become friends. They like to collect things.
