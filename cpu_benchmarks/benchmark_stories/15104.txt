Once upon a time there was a boy named Tom. Tom was three years old and he liked to explore. One day while Tom was exploring he heard a strange noise. It was coming from the bushes nearby. Tom was confused.
Tom slowly walked towards the bushes and peeked in. To his surprise, he saw a little animal. Tom was so excited.
"Hello!" Tom said.
The animal didn't answer. It just stayed still and stared at Tom.
"Are you lost?" Tom asked.
The animal nodded in response.
"Welcome, friend! I'm Tom. I can help you find your way home," Tom said.
The animal happily jumped up and down.
Tom and the little animal walked around and looked for the animal's home. Finally, they found it. The animal's family welcomed it with hugs and kisses.
Tom said goodbye. He watched the animal join its family and smiled. Tom was so glad that he'd been able to help his new friend.
