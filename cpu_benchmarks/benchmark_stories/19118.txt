Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around outside. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a big slide and wanted to go down it. 
Lily climbed to the top of the slide and looked down. It was very high! She was scared, but her mom said, "You can do it, Lily! Just slide down." So, Lily took a deep breath and slid down the slide. It was incredible! She felt so happy and proud of herself.
But then, Lily saw something that made her embarrassed. She had accidentally left her toy at the top of the slide. A boy found it and said, "Hey, this is a cool thing! Can I keep it?" Lily was sad and didn't know what to do. 
Suddenly, Lily's mom came to the rescue. She asked the boy nicely to give the toy back to Lily. The boy said sorry and gave it back. Lily was so happy and grateful. She learned that it's important to be brave and to always keep an eye on her things.
