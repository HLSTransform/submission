Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the grass. One day, he saw a cricket hopping around. Timmy thought the cricket was funny, so he tried to catch it. But the cricket was very flexible and jumped away from Timmy's hands.
Timmy's big sister came outside and saw what he was doing. She told Timmy not to tease the cricket, because it was just trying to have fun too. Timmy felt bad and decided to let the cricket go. The cricket hopped away, happy to be free. Timmy learned that it's important to be kind to all creatures, even if they're small like a cricket.
