Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden. One day, she saw a big, green plant with lots of leaves. It looked very pretty.
Lily wanted to touch the plant, but it was very dirty and filthy. She didn't want to get her hands dirty. So, she went inside and washed her hands.
Later that day, Lily learned how to whistle. She blew and blew, but she couldn't make a sound. She decided to practice every day until she could whistle like a bird.
