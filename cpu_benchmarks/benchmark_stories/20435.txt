One day, a boy went for a walk by the creek. He saw a big rock and picked it up. But then, he accidentally dropped it and it made a loud sound. The boy felt sad, but he kept walking. 
As he walked, he heard the creek making a fast sound. He looked and saw the water moving quickly. The boy thought it was cool and started to run along the creek. 
But then, he saw a butterfly and wanted to catch it. He ran too fast and tripped over a rock. He fell down and got a boo-boo. But his mom came and helped him feel better. They sat by the creek and watched the water go fast.
