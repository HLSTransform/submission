Once upon a time, there was a kind and polite boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside in his garden, where he helped his mom plant some bulbs in the ground. Timmy was happy because he knew the bulbs would grow into pretty flowers soon.
One day, as Timmy was playing in his garden, he saw a big rock in his way. He tried to step over it, but it was too high. Timmy didn't want to hurt himself, so he decided to move the rock instead. He pushed and pushed, and finally, the rock moved out of the way.
Later that day, Timmy's mom called him inside for dinner. As he was walking back to the house, he saw a little bulb starting to grow where he had moved the rock. Timmy was so excited to see the flower that would grow from the bulb. He knew that he had done a good thing by stepping over the rock and moving it out of the way.
