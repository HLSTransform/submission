Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy cook on the stove. One day, Lily's mommy told her they were going to the fair. Lily was so excited, she clapped her hands and said, "Yay!"
At the fair, Lily saw a big, red balloon. She wanted it so badly, but her mommy said they couldn't afford it. Lily started to cry. Suddenly, a kind man walked up and gave Lily the balloon. She was so happy, she hugged him tight.
Later that day, they went back home and started cooking dinner. Lily's mommy turned on the stove, but it didn't work. They tried and tried, but it just wouldn't turn on. Suddenly, Lily remembered the kind man at the fair and said, "Maybe he can help us!" They went back to the fair and found the man. He helped fix the stove and they all had a delicious dinner together.
