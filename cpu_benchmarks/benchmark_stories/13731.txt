Once upon a time, there was a knight named Jack. Jack had a sword that he loved very much. One day, Jack went to the forest to find some food. Suddenly, he heard a noisy sound. It was a dragon! The dragon was big and scary. Jack was scared too. 
"Please, Mr. Dragon, don't hurt me," said Jack. "What do you want?"
"I want your sword," said the dragon. "If you give it to me, I won't hurt you."
Jack thought for a moment. He loved his sword, but he didn't want to get hurt. Finally, he decided to give the sword to the dragon. 
But when the dragon took the sword, it started to rot! The dragon was so surprised. "Why is your sword rotting?" he asked Jack.
"I don't know," said Jack. "Maybe it's because you're not a good dragon."
The dragon felt bad. He gave the sword back to Jack and said, "I'm sorry. I won't be a bad dragon anymore."
From that day on, Jack and the dragon became friends. They shared food and stories. And Jack's sword was never noisy or rotting again.
