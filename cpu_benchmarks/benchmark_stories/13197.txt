One day, a little girl named Hanna dreamed of having a pony. She wanted one more than anything! Every day, she looked outside her window, hoping there might be a pony waiting for her. One morning, Hanna woke up and realized there was a pony standing outside her window! She was so excited that she ran outside.
Hanna was scared at first, but she slowly walked closer and closer. She was quiet so she wouldn't scare the pony. The pony was so gentle and friendly; she even nuzzled and nudged Hanna! Hanna was no longer frightened.
The pony followed Hanna wherever she went. Hanna felt like she was in a dream, but it was all real! She realized that her dream of having a pony had come true. Now she had a special friend to keep her company.
