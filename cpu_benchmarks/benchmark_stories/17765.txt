Once upon a time, there was a thin tooth. It came out of the mouth of a small child. The child was very happy with his new tooth. Every morning he would wake up and show it to his mommy and daddy.
One day, the tooth decided to take a little trip. It came out of the child's mouth and flew away. It flew through the sky, past the birds and the clouds, until it landed on a field of soft green grass. 
The tooth enjoyed its adventure, but soon started to miss the child. It wanted to come back home. So the tooth flapped its tiny wings and flew back home.
The tooth came back and put itself back in the child's mouth. The child was so happy to see it again. And so, he smiled and hugged his mommy and daddy. From then on, the tooth stayed in the child's mouth forever!
