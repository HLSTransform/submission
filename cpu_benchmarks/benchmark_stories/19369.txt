Once upon a time, there were two birds on a hanger. They were both so graceful. The hanger hung in the sky, close to the clouds. The birds were content just to sit and look out from the hanger. 
One day, the birds felt a strange pull in their wings. They closed their eyes, remembering their desire to rise. With all their might, the birds flapped their wings and began to rise. 
They soared higher and higher, going close to the clouds. The birds felt so free and graceful. the wind tickled their feathers and the sunlight warmed their wings. 
The birds flew in circles, rising and dipping in the sky. Eventually, they grew tired and decided to return to the hanger. The birds flew close and gently landed back on the hanger. 
The birds were tired but happy, having felt the freedom of rising in the sky. They laid their wings on the hanger and felt content to stay there for a while.
