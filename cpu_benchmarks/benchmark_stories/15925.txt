Mama and Baby Bear were walking through the forest one day. Mama Bear was pointing to all the different animals. "Look Baby Bear," she said, "here is a rabbit. And there is a squirrel. Do you see the young fawn in the meadow?". 
Baby Bear was so excited! He pointed to the meadow and said, "See, Mama. Good fawn!"
Mama Bear laughed and said, "That's right, Baby Bear. You are very smart. Good job!" 
They continued on their walk and eventually stopped to rest. Mama Bear pointed up at the trees and said, "See the birds in the sky? They are so tiny and can fly very high. Isn't that good, Baby Bear?" 
Baby Bear smiled and said, "Yes, Mama. Good birds!"
