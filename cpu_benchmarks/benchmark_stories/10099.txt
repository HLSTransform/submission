Lily wanted to wear her new dress to the party. It was pink and had flowers on it. She loved her dress very much. She put it on and looked at herself in the mirror. She felt happy and pretty.
But when she went downstairs, her brother Tom was waiting for her. He was wearing a blue shirt and jeans. He looked at Lily and laughed. "You look silly in that dress," he said. "It is too big and too bright. You should wear something else."
Lily felt sad and angry. She did not like Tom's words. She did not want to change her dress. She liked her dress. She said to Tom, "I don't care what you say. I like my dress. You are mean and rude."
Tom did not stop laughing. He said, "You are a baby. You don't know anything. Come on, let's go. We are late for the party."
Lily did not want to go with Tom. She wanted to ignore him. She wanted to stay in her room with her dress. But she also wanted to go to the party. She wanted to see her friends and have fun. She felt nervous and confused. She did not know what to do.
She looked at her dress again. She thought, "My dress is beautiful. I am beautiful. I don't need Tom's opinion. I need my own opinion. I will go to the party and have a good time. And I will ignore Tom."
She took a deep breath and smiled. She walked past Tom and opened the door. She said, "I am ready. Let's go."
Tom stopped laughing. He looked at Lily and saw her confidence. He felt a little ashamed. He said, "Okay. Let's go."
They went to the party. Lily had a lot of fun. She played with her friends and ate cake and ice cream. She got many compliments on her dress. She felt happy and proud.
Tom had fun too. He played with his friends and ate cake and ice cream. He saw Lily having fun. He felt a little sorry. He thought, "Maybe I was wrong. Maybe her dress is not so bad. Maybe she is not so babyish. Maybe I should be nicer to her."
He went to Lily and said, "Hey, Lily. I'm sorry I was mean to you. Your dress is nice. You look nice. Do you want to play with me?"
Lily looked at Tom and saw his apology. She felt a little surprised. She thought, "Maybe he is not so mean. Maybe he is not so rude. Maybe he can be nice. Maybe I can play with him."
She said, "Okay, Tom. I accept your sorry. My dress is nice. I look nice. Yes, I want to play with you."
They played together and had more fun. They forgot their fight. They became friends again. They were happy.
