Tom and Lily were playing in the sand. They had a big bucket and a small bucket. They wanted to make a sand castle with the big bucket, but it was difficult. The sand was too dry and the bucket was too heavy.
"Let's ask Mom for some water," Tom said. He picked up the small bucket and ran to the picnic table. Mom was reading a book. She smiled at Tom and gave him some water in the small bucket.
"Thank you, Mom," Tom said. He ran back to the sand with the small bucket. Lily was waiting for him. She had a question.
"Tom, how will we make the sand castle with the big bucket?" she asked. "The small bucket is easy, but the big bucket is difficult."
Tom had an idea. He poured some water on the sand and mixed it with his hands. He made the sand wet and sticky. He filled the big bucket with the wet sand and pressed it hard. He turned the big bucket upside down and lifted it. A big sand castle came out of the bucket.
"Wow, Tom, you did it!" Lily said. She clapped her hands. "You are so smart!"
Tom and Lily were happy. They had made a big sand castle with the big bucket. They decorated it with shells and stones. They played with their sand castle until it was time to go home. They hugged their sand castle and said goodbye. They hoped it would stay there until they came back.
