Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing in the field near her house. One day, she saw an enormous butterfly with wings that glowed in the sun. 
Lily ran to her mom and said, "Mommy, mommy, come see! Big butterfly in the field! So big, so pretty, it glows!" 
Her mom came outside and saw the butterfly too. "Wow, that is an enormous butterfly! It's so pretty with its glowing wings," her mom said. 
Lily and her mom sat in the field and watched the butterfly fly around. They talked about how magical it was to see something so beautiful. Lily said, "I want to be like the butterfly and glow too!" 
Her mom smiled and said, "You already glow, Lily. You have a beautiful smile that lights up the room." Lily felt happy and hugged her mom. They continued to watch the butterfly in the field until it flew away, leaving behind a trail of glowing magic.
