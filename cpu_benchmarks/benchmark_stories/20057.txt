Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to drink coffee with her mommy every morning. Her mommy would always make her a little cup with milk and sugar.
One day, Lily saw a green butterfly outside her window. She wanted to catch it and keep it as a pet. So, she ran outside to try and catch it. But when she got outside, the butterfly vanished. Lily was sad that she couldn't catch it.
Later that day, Lily's mommy made her a cup of coffee as usual. But when Lily took a sip, she accidentally spilled it all over herself. The hot coffee burned her and made her cry. She wished she had caught the green butterfly instead.
