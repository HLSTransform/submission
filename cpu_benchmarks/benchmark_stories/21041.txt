Tom and Mia were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big tree with many leaves. They wanted to climb the tree and see what was up there.
They took turns to go up the tree. Tom went first. He saw a bird nest with three eggs. He saw a squirrel with a nut. He saw a spider web with a shiny insect. He wanted to touch the insect, but the spider scared him. He said, "Mia, look at this insect! It is so pretty and shiny!"
Mia went up the tree. She saw the insect too. She liked it very much. She said, "Tom, can I have the insect? I want to keep it as a pet!"
Tom said, "No, Mia, it is mine! I saw it first!"
Mia said, "But I like it more! Please, Tom, give it to me!"
Tom and Mia started to fight. They pulled and pushed and shouted. The spider was angry. It bit Tom on his hand. Tom cried out loud. He let go of the insect. The insect flew away.
Mia said, "Tom, are you okay? I am sorry, I did not mean to hurt you."
Tom said, "Mia, I am sorry too. I should have shared with you. The insect is gone now. We were silly to fight over it."
Tom and Mia hugged each other. They climbed down the tree. They saw their mom waiting for them. She had a basket with snacks and juice. She said, "Are you hungry, my loves? Come and have some food. You look tired from playing."
Tom and Mia said, "Yes, mom, we are hungry. Thank you for the food. We love you, mom."
They ran to their mom. They ate and drank and told her about their adventure. They learned to yield and share and be kind. They had a happy day in the park.
