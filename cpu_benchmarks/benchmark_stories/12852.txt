Once upon a time there lived a young girl who was very humble. One day she was walking in the woods when she saw a big monster. The girl was scared and started to run away.
 
The monster shouted at her, “Wait! Please don't be scared, I mean no harm.”
 
The girl stopped, and the monster continued, “Will you recognize me? I'm an old friend who met you many years ago.”
The girl looked at the monster carefully, and then shook her head. “No, I don't recognize you.”
The monster looked sad. “That's okay, it was a long time ago. I guess you don't remember me. Goodbye, little one.”
The girl started to walk away, but then the monster grabbed her arm and shouted, “You won't get away that easily!” 
The girl was scared and started to cry. She didn't know what to do. Suddenly the monster changed his form and became a giant snake. He swallowed the little girl whole and then disappeared into the woods. 
The girl was never seen again.
