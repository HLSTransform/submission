Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play outside in the meadow. One day, while playing, he saw a big, disgusting spider. Benny was scared and tried to escape, but he tripped and fell. 
The spider started to crawl towards Benny, but then Benny had an idea. He rubbed his paws together really fast and made a loud noise. The spider got scared and ran away. Benny felt very proud of himself for being so clever. 
From then on, whenever Benny saw something scary, he would rub his paws together and make a loud noise to scare it away. Benny never forgot how he escaped from the disgusting spider and always felt brave.
