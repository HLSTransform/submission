Once there was a little girl named Martha who loved playing in the backyard. One day, she had an idea to pretend that she was a princess.
She put on her fanciest dress, grabbed her toy sword and ran into the backyard. She chanted, “I'm a beautiful princess, I'm a beautiful princess!”
But when Martha got to the backyard, she saw a little bird that had fallen out of its nest. It was sad, so she put away her sword and dress and kneeled down next to the bird. 
Martha asked, “What's wrong?”
The bird said, “My mom went away and I can't get back in my nest.”
Martha thought for a moment and then she said, “I think I have a plan.”
Martha helped the bird back into its nest and the bird said, “Thank you! You are a kind and noble princess!”
Martha smiled, realizing that it felt much better to do something good and kind instead of just pretending. She realized that being a princess was not about dresses and swords, but about being kind and helpful. From that day on, Martha did her best to be fine and noble in everything she did.
