Once upon a time there was a little bunny. He was hopping around outside and he decided to go explore the big world. So he hopped and hopped until he found a tube. He poked the tube and it made a funny noise. The bunny got scared and hopped away.
But then he remembered how brave he was, so he hopped over to the tube and poked it again. Suddenly the tube started to move and it was going really high! The bunny was so excited and he hopped around it with joy. 
The bunny hopped in the tube and it went even higher! He could see all the amazing things around him and he couldn't believe it. 
The tube eventually stopped and the bunny hopped out. He was so happy and he knew he had to come back and explore the tube again. He said goodbye to the tube and hopped off, feeling brave and excited for the next adventure!
