Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his magnet. He would rub it on things and watch them stick. One day, Timmy went to the park to play. He brought his magnet with him. 
At the park, Timmy met a little girl named Lily. She had a yummy lollipop. Timmy wanted the lollipop, but Lily wouldn't share. Timmy was sad. 
Suddenly, Timmy had an idea. He rubbed his magnet on a nearby bench and showed Lily how it stuck. Lily was amazed! She wanted to try it. Timmy said he would only let her try if she shared her lollipop. 
Lily agreed and they had fun playing with the magnet together. Timmy learned that sharing is important and that sometimes, you just need to rub things to make them stick.
