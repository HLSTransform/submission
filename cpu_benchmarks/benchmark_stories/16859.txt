Yesterday, there was a polite bear named Ben. Ben liked to slide down the hill. He would slide down on his belly and it was so much fun! 
One day, Ben saw a little bunny who was sad. The bunny had lost his carrot. Ben asked the bunny what was wrong and the bunny told him about the lost carrot. 
Ben knew how to make the bunny happy. He took the bunny to the top of the hill and let him slide down with him. The bunny had so much fun that he forgot all about his lost carrot. 
From that day on, the bunny and Ben became good friends and they would slide down the hill together every day.
