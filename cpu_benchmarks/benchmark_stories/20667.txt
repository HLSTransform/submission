Once there was a spider who liked to move. He moved all day and all night. He could move so fast and so far.
One day the spider wanted to try something a bit different. He heard about spicy food, so he decided to try it.
The spider crawled along until he found a little mound of spicy pepper. He was a bit scared but he thought he'd give it a try.
So he put some of the pepper on his back and started to move. At first it was ok. But then it started to make his body very hot and spicy.
The spider kept moving until he had moved far away from the pepper. He was relieved to be away from the spicy pepper and vowed never to try it again.
