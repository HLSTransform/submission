Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big tree with many leaves. They wanted to climb the tree and see the sky.
They found a basket near the tree. It had a long rope. Lily had an idea. She said to Tom, "Let's attach the basket to the tree. We can make a swing and go up and down."
Tom liked the idea. He helped Lily tie the rope to a branch. They put the basket on the ground. They took turns to sit in the basket and push each other. They had fun swinging in the air.
But then they saw a bee. It was flying near the basket. It was yellow and black and had a sting. Lily and Tom were scared of the bee. They thought it would hurt them.
They shouted, "Help! Help! A bee! A bee!"
A man heard them. He came to the tree. He saw the bee. He smiled. He said to Lily and Tom, "Don't be afraid. The bee is harmless. It won't sting you. It just wants to smell the flowers in the basket. They are pretty and sweet."
Lily and Tom looked at the basket. They saw some flowers. They had not noticed them before. They were red and blue and purple. They smelled nice.
They felt silly. They said to the man, "Thank you. We are sorry. We did not know the bee was harmless. We like the flowers too. They are pretty and sweet."
The man said, "You're welcome. You are brave. You made a nice swing. But be careful. Don't swing too high. And don't forget to share the basket with the bee."
Lily and Tom nodded. They said, "Okay. We will be careful. And we will share the basket with the bee."
They smiled. They went back to swinging. They enjoyed the sun and the breeze and the flowers. And they made a new friend. The bee.
