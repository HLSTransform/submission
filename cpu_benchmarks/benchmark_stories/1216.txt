Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his toy car. One day, Timmy wanted to attach a trailer to his toy car. He tried and tried, but he couldn't do it. He felt frustrated because he really wanted to play with his car and trailer.
Suddenly, Timmy's mommy came into the room and asked him what was wrong. Timmy showed her his toy car and trailer and told her he couldn't attach them. His mommy smiled and showed him how to attach the trailer to the car. Timmy was so happy and thanked his mommy.
Later that day, Timmy and his toy car went for a drive. They stopped at a spot in the park where there were lots of other kids with their toys. Timmy had so much fun playing with his car and making new friends. He was grateful that his mommy helped him attach the trailer and he wasn't frustrated anymore.
