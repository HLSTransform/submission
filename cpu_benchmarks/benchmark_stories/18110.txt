Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim lived in an igloo with his family. They loved their igloo because it kept them warm. One day, Tim went outside to play in the snow. He built a snowman and had so much fun. 
But then, a big storm came. The wind blew hard and the snow fell fast. Tim tried to go back to his igloo, but he couldn't find it. He was lost in the storm. He tried to keep walking, but it was too hard. 
Finally, Tim was so cold and tired that he fell asleep in the snow. When his family found him, it was too late. Tim was not normal anymore. He was gone forever.
