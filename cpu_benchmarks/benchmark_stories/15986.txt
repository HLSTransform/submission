Once upon a time, there was a little bear who loved to eat dessert. One day, he went to his mommy and asked for a soft cake. His mommy said, "Sure, my little bear. Let me pack a cake for you." 
The little bear was very happy and took the soft cake with him. He went to the forest and sat under a tree. He ate his dessert and felt very full. Then, he saw a little bird who was sad. The bird said, "I lost my nest. I don't know where to go." 
The little bear felt sorry for the bird and said, "Don't worry, I will help you." He packed some soft leaves and made a new nest for the bird. The bird was very happy and thanked the little bear. From that day on, they became good friends and ate dessert together under the tree.
