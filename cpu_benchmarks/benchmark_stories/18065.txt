Once upon a time, there was a cute little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around in the park. One day, Lily's mother told her that they were going to the zoo. Lily was very excited! She loved seeing all the animals and hearing them make funny noises. 
As they walked around the zoo, Lily saw a baby elephant. It was so cute! She wanted to go see it up close. Her mother told her to come with her and they walked over to the elephant's exhibit. Lily was so happy to see the baby elephant playing with its mother. She hugged her own mother and said, "I love you, Mommy!" 
After a fun day at the zoo, Lily and her mother went home. Lily was tired from all the walking and excitement, so her mother tucked her into bed. As she fell asleep, Lily thought about all the cute animals she saw and how much she loved spending time with her mother.
