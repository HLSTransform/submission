Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, while playing tag, she fell and scraped her knee. Her mom put a patch on it and told her to rest.
The next day, Lily wanted to play again, but her knee still hurt. Her friend, Emma, noticed and asked, "What's wrong, Lily?"
"My knee hurts," Lily replied.
Emma said, "I have an idea! Let's play a game where we support each other. We can take turns being the one who needs support."
Lily thought it was a generous idea and agreed. They played the game and it was so much fun. Lily's knee felt better because her friends supported her. From then on, they played the game every time someone needed support.
