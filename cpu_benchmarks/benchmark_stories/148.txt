Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo loved to swim in the ocean with his friends. One day, Nemo met a friendly surfing crab named Crabby. Crabby said, "Come surf with me, Nemo! It's so much fun!" Nemo was scared at first, but he decided to try it.
Nemo and Crabby surfed the waves together and had a delicious picnic on the beach. But then, a big wave came and swept Nemo away. Nemo cried out for help, but it was too late. Nemo's friends were sad and learned a lesson: it's important to be careful and stay safe, even when having fun.
