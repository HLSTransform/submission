Once upon a time there was an adorable ranch. It was filled with animals, farms and fields. Every morning, the animals would go out and collect all of the food they needed. They collected lots of different things like flowers, fresh fruits, and vegetables. 
One day, a little girl named Clara visited the ranch. Clara was so excited to see all the animals and the fields. She ran around, playing for hours. All of the animals liked Clara, so they invited her to help with their collection. 
Clara happily agreed and started to collect the fruits and flowers. She ran around the ranch carrying baskets full of the stuff she had collected. Clara had the time of her life - it was more fun than she had ever imagined! 
At the end of the day, all the animals and Clara had collected so much food and flowers. They were so happy and thanked Clara for showing them how much fun it was to collect things. Clara thanked them right back and promised to come back and visit as soon as she could.
