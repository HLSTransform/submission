Once upon a time, there was a furry bear who was walking along a path. As he walked, he passed many stones. 
Suddenly, he slipped and fell on one of the stones, and everyone nearby started to laugh. The bear felt embarrassed and wanted to hide. He looked around, but there was nowhere to go! 
He spotted a big tree with lots of leaves, and ran to it. He climbed up the trunk, hoping no one would see him. He sat on a branch, feeling safe and cozy, surrounded by the furry leaves. 
Just then, he heard happy voices coming from below the tree. He looked down, and saw a bunch of children playing with stones. He smiled. No one had seen him, so he no longer felt embarrassed. He stayed up in the tree all day, surrounded by the furry leaves. 
The End.
