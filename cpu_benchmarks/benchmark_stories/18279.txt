Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her backyard. One day, she saw a lovely butterfly flying around. She wanted to catch it, but it flew too high.
Lily went to her dad and said, "Daddy, can you please help me catch the butterfly? I want to see it up close." Her dad smiled and said, "Sure, I can help you. Let's get a rope and make a net."
They found a long rope and tied it to two sticks. Then they went outside and searched for the butterfly. Finally, they saw it sitting on a flower. Lily's dad held the rope and Lily requested, "Daddy, can you please catch the butterfly with the net?"
He carefully put the net over the butterfly and they both looked at it closely. The butterfly was very pretty with bright colors. Lily was so happy that she got to see it up close. She thanked her dad for helping her and they both went back inside.
