Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the park. One day, he saw a candy wrapper on the ground. He picked it up and threw it in the trash can. 
His mom saw what he did and said, "Timmy, you are so clean and good! You suggest we should always keep our park clean." 
Timmy smiled and continued to play. Later that day, he saw a little girl who was lost. Timmy went up to her and asked if she needed help. He walked her to her mom and made sure she was safe. 
His mom saw what he did and said, "Timmy, you are so kind and helpful! You light up the world with your good deeds." 
Timmy felt happy and proud. He learned that being clean and kind can make a big difference in the world.
