Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there was an ancient castle. The castle was very big and very old. It had been there for a very long time. Inside the castle, there was a big room where people would sing and dance. This was called an opera.
One day, a little boy came to the castle. He was very curious and wanted to see the opera. He walked inside and saw all the people singing and dancing. He was amazed! But then he noticed an old lady sitting in the corner all by herself. She looked sad.
The little boy went up to her and asked, "Are you okay? Do you need help?" The old lady looked up and smiled. She said, "Yes, I'm just feeling a little lonely." The little boy knew he cared about her, so he took her hand and brought her to the front of the room. They watched the opera together and had a wonderful time. From that day on, they became good friends and would always go to the opera together.
