Once upon a time, there was a woman who was very strong. Everywhere she went, she did hard work. One day, she was at the market and wanted to buy some food.
The woman picked up a big watermelon and asked the man at the market, "How much does it weigh?"
The man took out his scales and said, "It weighs twenty pounds."
The woman didn't have enough money for such a heavy watermelon, so she kept looking around the market. But everything was so filthy and she didn't want to buy anything else.
Just then, a little girl came up to the woman and said, "I know where you can get a nice watermelon! I just saw one, and it was much lighter than that one."
The woman thanked the little girl and asked her to take her to the watermelon. When they got there, the woman was happy to see how beautiful and clean the watermelon was.
The woman asked the little girl, "How much does this one weigh?"
The little girl smiled and said, "It only weighs five pounds."
The woman thanked the little girl for her help and bought the watermelon. She went home happy that she was able to get what she needed without spending too much.
