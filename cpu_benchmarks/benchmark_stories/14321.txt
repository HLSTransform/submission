Once upon a time there was a boy named John. He was very smart and he loved to learn new things. Every day, he read books, played with toys and tried to build puzzles. 
One day, John's mom gave him a new puzzle. It had lots of colorful pieces that he needed to fit together. John was so excited! He worked hard, trying to put the pieces together.
Suddenly, the pieces fit together perfectly! John was so proud of himself. He knew he was very smart and he was happy that he successfully completed the puzzle.
John was so excited about the puzzle that he wanted to show it to his friends. He ran to find his friends, but when he showed them the puzzle, they laughed at him and wouldn't accept it.
John was sad, but he knew that even though his friends didn't accept his puzzle, he was still very smart. He put on a brave face and told himself that some day his friends would accept him for the smart boy that he was.
