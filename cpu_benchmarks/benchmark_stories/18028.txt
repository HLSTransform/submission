Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very excited because his mommy was throwing a party for him. He invited all his friends to come and play games and eat cake.
But when the party started, Timmy got scared because he saw a big spider on the wall. He didn't want to have fun anymore because he was too scared of the spider.
His mommy saw that Timmy was scared and she knew what to do. She got a broom and gently spread the spider away from the party. Timmy felt much better and he realized that sometimes we get scared, but there is always someone who can help us.
The moral of the story is that we should never be too scared to have fun at a party, and we should always ask for help when we need it.
