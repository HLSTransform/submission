Once there was a boy named Jack who wanted to take a nap. He searched his house for a good spot and found a patch of sunlight on the living room floor.
Jack said to his mom, "Mom, I'm gonna take a nap there".
Mom replied, "Ok, Jack, but don't nap for too long. Just a regular nap".
Jack got comfortable on the patch and closed his eyes. He felt warm and peaceful and began to drift off. He had a wonderful dream while taking his regular nap.
When he was done napping, Jack felt refreshed and happy. He realized that he had been asleep for the perfect amount of time. He thanked his mom for reminding him to take a regular nap.
