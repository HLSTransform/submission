Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Lily. She had a big heart and loved to share. One day, she got an invitation to a party. The invitation said to bring a dish to share. 
Lily decided to make her favorite cookies. She poured all the ingredients into a bowl and mixed them up. Then she put them on a tray and brought them to the party. 
When she arrived, everyone was happy to see her and her generous cookies. They all said thank you and ate them up. Lily felt happy that she could share her cookies and make her friends smile. The end.
