Once upon a time, there was a bad king. He lived in a palace and wanted to keep all the people away. But one day, he heard a very noisy sound. He went out to see what it was, and he saw a little bird flying around. The king wanted to keep the bird all to himself, so he tried to capture it. 
He said, "Hey, come to me! I will keep you safe in my palace!" 
The bird knew that the palace was a bad place and didn't want to go near it. So it flew away and said, "No, I don't want to go to your palace!" 
The king was angry, and he said, "If you don't come to my palace, I will not let you go." But the bird was brave and said, "No! You can't keep me here. I want to be free!" 
The king knew that the bird was right, so he waved his arms and released the bird. The bird flew away and was very happy to be free. 
The king was happy too, because he realized that everyone should be free. And he never tried to keep the bird in his palace again.
