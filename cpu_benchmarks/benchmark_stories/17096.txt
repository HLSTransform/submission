Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her daddy. One day, they went to the park and it started to rain. Lily's daddy picked her up and they ran to a big tree for shelter. The rain was deep and they got very wet. But they still had fun together, playing and laughing until the rain stopped. From that day on, Lily always loved to play in the rain with her daddy.
