Once upon a time, there was a kind princess who lived in a big castle. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite one was a little scale. She used it to weigh all her toys and see which one was the heaviest.
One day, the princess decided to make some yummy cookies. She cut some butter and sugar with a knife and put them in a big bowl. Then she added some flour and mixed it all together. She used her scale to make sure she had the right amount of ingredients.
After baking the cookies, the princess shared them with her friends. They all said they were the most delicious cookies they had ever tasted! The princess was very happy that she could share her yummy treats with her friends.
