Once upon a time, there was a bald baby. Every day, the baby's mommy would remind him to be careful and stay safe. The baby would have fun playing outside, but one day something went wrong.
The baby was playing close to a lake when he suddenly started to walk too close to the edge. His mommy quickly ran from the porch and reminded him not to go too close. But the baby was too excited to listen and he accidentally fell into the lake. 
The baby's mommy screamed and tried to get the baby out. But no matter how hard she tried, she was unable to reach him in time. The baby disappeared under the water and all that was left was a sad and scared mommy. 
The end.
