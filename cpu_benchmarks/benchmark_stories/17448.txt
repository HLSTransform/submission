Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big dog. The dog is black and white. It has a long tail and a red collar.
"Look, a dog!" Tom says. "Can we pet it?"
"I don't know," Mia says. "Maybe it is not nice."
Tom runs to the dog. He wants to touch its fur. He thinks the dog will like him. He does not see the sign. The sign says: "Beware of the dog. It bites."
The dog does not like Tom. It growls and shows its teeth. It jumps on Tom and bites his arm. Tom screams. He feels terrible pain. He drops to the ground.
Mia is scared. She runs to Tom. She sees blood on his arm. She cries. She rubs his arm. She tries to make him feel better.
"Help! Help!" Mia shouts. "The dog bit Tom!"
But no one hears her. No one comes to help. The dog is still angry. It barks and runs to Mia. It bites her leg. Mia screams. She feels terrible pain. She falls to the ground.
Tom and Mia are hurt. They are alone. They are afraid. The dog is still there. It is not a nice dog. It is a bad dog. It wants to bite them more.
This is a bad ending.
