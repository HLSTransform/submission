Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia was a big girl now and she liked to do things by herself. She was very independent. She liked to ride her bike, put on her shoes, and play with her toys all by herself.
One day, Mia saw a group of police riding their bikes in the park. They were wearing blue uniforms and had shiny badges on their shirts. Mia thought they looked very cool and she wanted to ride her bike just like them.
So, Mia put on her helmet, got on her bike, and started to ride around the park. She felt like a police officer too! Mia rode her bike all day long, feeling very proud and independent, just like the police she saw in the park.
