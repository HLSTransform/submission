Lily and Tom were going to the park with Mom. They liked the park. They could play on the swings, slide down the slide, and run on the grass. They were very happy.
But on the way, they saw a cat. The cat was on the road. It looked scared and hurt. It had a cut on its leg. Lily and Tom felt sorry for the cat. They wanted to help it.
"Mom, can we stop and help the cat?" Lily asked.
"Of course, dear. We can delay going to the park for a little while. The cat needs our help. You are very compassionate, Lily and Tom," Mom said.
Mom parked the car and got out. She took a blanket and a bottle of water from the trunk. She gently wrapped the cat in the blanket and gave it some water. The cat purred and licked Mom's hand.
"Thank you, Mom. You are very kind," the cat seemed to say.
Lily and Tom smiled. They were glad the cat was feeling better. They petted the cat and talked to it softly.
"Can we take the cat home, Mom?" Tom asked.
"Well, we have to find out if the cat has a home already. Maybe it has a collar or a tag with its name and address. If not, we can take it to the vet and see if they can find its owner. If no one claims the cat, then maybe we can adopt it. How does that sound?" Mom asked.
Lily and Tom nodded. They liked that idea. They hoped the cat would be their new friend.
They got back in the car and drove to the vet. They did not mind delaying going to the park. They had found a better way to spend their day. They had shown compassion to a cat in need. And they had learned a valuable lesson. Sometimes, helping others is more fun than playing.
