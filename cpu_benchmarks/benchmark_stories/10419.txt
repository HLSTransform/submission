Once upon a time there was a troubled fireman. He was feeling so sad that he didn't know what to do. But then he got an idea. He decided to invite all the children in the town over for a party. He served them yummy snacks and they had lots of fun. 
They played games, danced, and laughed all afternoon. The fireman was so happy when he saw all their smiling faces. He was no longer troubled and he felt like he could do anything. He thanked the children for coming and waved goodbye. They all left with big smiles and happy hearts.
