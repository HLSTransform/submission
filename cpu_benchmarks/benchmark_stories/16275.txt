Once upon a time, a little girl named Jean was very enthusiastic to go for a bus ride. She put on her favorite dress and waited for the bus to arrive. When it arrived, she opened the huge door of the bus and got on. She sat in a front seat and waited for the bus to start.
When the bus began to move, Jean went up to the window and looked out. She felt so excited when she saw the trees and houses passing by. She waved at people and smiled at them. Everyone waved back at her with a smile too.
Jean looked out the window for the whole bus ride. She was in awe with the different places she saw. When the bus finally stopped, she was sad that the ride was over. She opened the huge door one last time and waved goodbye to the bus as she walked away.
