Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was very lucky. One day, she was walking by the ocean and saw a boat. It was the most beautiful boat she had ever seen! She wanted to see what was inside, so she hopped on board.
Inside, Lucy saw lots of treasures! She was so excited, but she didn't recognize any of them. She was about to explore more when, suddenly, she noticed something shiny. She reached out to grab it, and it was a golden medal!
She was so happy to have found something that she recognized. She had seen this medal before in her grandpa's room. As it turned out, her grandpa had been on this boat many years ago! It had been his lucky boat!
Lucy was so happy to have found a piece of her family history, and was even luckier to have recognized it. From that day on, Lucy always kept her grandpa's medal close by to remember the wonderful day she found it.
