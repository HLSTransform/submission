Once upon a time, two friends wanted to celebrate. They both loved insects, so they decided to go on an adventure to find some. 
The two friends went to a park, looking for bugs. As they walked, they noticed a thick bush. They heard some noise coming from inside and decided to take a closer look. 
When they got closer, they realized that the bush was full of insects! There were all kinds of bugs. The two friends carefully peeked through the thick leaves to watch the bugs. 
The two friends were so excited! They were happy to have found so many insects. They celebrated by jumping up and down and singing together. 
They had so much fun celebrating! They decided to go home and come back to the park later to look for more insects.
