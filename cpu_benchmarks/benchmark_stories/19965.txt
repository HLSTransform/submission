Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play in the farm. One day, they saw a big barrel near the barn. They wondered what was inside.
"Let's search the barrel," Tom said. "Maybe there is something fun."
"OK," Sam agreed. They ran to the barrel and looked inside. It was dark and empty.
"Boo!" Tom shouted. He jumped into the barrel and scared Sam.
"Ha ha, you are foolish, Sam. You are scared of nothing," Tom laughed.
Sam was angry. He wanted to get back at Tom. He saw a rope near the barrel. He had an idea.
He tied the rope around the barrel. Then he pulled the rope hard. The barrel rolled away with Tom inside.
"Help! Help!" Tom cried. He bumped and bounced in the barrel. He felt sick and dizzy.
"Ha ha, you are foolish, Tom. You are trapped in the barrel," Sam laughed.
Sam ran after the barrel. He wanted to stop it before it hit something. He saw a big tree ahead. He tried to catch the barrel, but it was too fast.
"Crash!" The barrel hit the tree and broke. Tom fell out of the barrel. He was covered in dirt and wood.
"Ow! Ow!" Tom cried. He had a big bump on his head.
Sam felt sorry for Tom. He ran to him and hugged him.
"I'm sorry, Tom. I was mean to you. Are you OK?" Sam asked.
Tom looked at Sam. He was still angry, but he was also glad that Sam cared.
"I'm OK, Sam. I'm sorry, too. I was mean to you, too. Can we be friends again?" Tom asked.
Sam nodded. They smiled at each other.
They went back to the farm. They told their mom what happened. She was not happy. She scolded them for being foolish and playing with the barrel. She gave them some ice for their bumps. She told them to be careful and kind to each other.
Tom and Sam learned their lesson. They never played with the barrel again. They played with other things that were safe and fun. They were good brothers.
