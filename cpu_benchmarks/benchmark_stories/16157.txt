Once upon a time, there were two friends called John and Jane. John had short, black hair and Jane had long, blonde hair.
One day they were walking in the park together. All of a sudden a big gust of wind started blowing and it blew Jane's long, blonde hair into her face. She was so frustrated that she shouted "I wish I had short, black hair like John".
John heard her and he said, "I'll give you some of my hair so you don't get so annoyed when the wind blows it in your face".
But Jane refused. She said, "No, that's ok. I will just be more careful not to get it in my face when it's windy".
John was very quiet. He knew that Jane didn't really like her long, blonde hair. So he said, "ok, if you ever change your mind, just let me know".
And from then on, John and Jane loved walking in the park together. No matter how windy it was, Jane never complained about her hair. 
The End!
