Ben and Mia like to play outside in the sunshine. They have a big sandbox with many toys. They can make castles, bridges, and roads with the sand. They work hard and have fun.
One day, the sky is gray and it rains a lot. Ben and Mia cannot play outside. They are sad and bored. They look out the window and see the wet sand. They miss their sandbox.
"Can we go outside, Mom?" Ben asks.
"No, sweetie, it is too wet and cold. You will get sick," Mom says.
"When will it be dry again?" Mia asks.
"Maybe tomorrow, if the sun comes out," Mom says.
Ben and Mia hope the sun will come out soon. They want to play in their sandbox again. They find some books and puzzles to do inside. They try to have fun, but they still think about the sand.
The next day, they wake up and see the sun shining. They are happy and excited. They run to the window and see the dry sand. They put on their hats and shoes and grab their toys.
"Can we go outside, Mom?" Ben and Mia ask.
"Yes, you can, but don't forget your sunscreen," Mom says.
Ben and Mia go outside and play in their sandbox. They make new castles, bridges, and roads with the sand. They work hard and have fun. They are glad the sun came out. They love the sunshine.
