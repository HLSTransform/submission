Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing soccer with his friends. One day, Timmy's friend Billy said, "I want to buy a new soccer ball, but I don't have any money."
Timmy replied, "I have some money. I can pay for half of the ball and you can pay for the other half."
Billy was happy and they went to the store to buy the soccer ball. They played with it all day and scored many goals.
But the next day, Billy lost the ball. Timmy was upset and said, "That was foolish of you to lose the ball. We paid for it together."
Billy felt bad and said, "I'm sorry, Timmy. I'll help you pay for a new ball."
From then on, Timmy and Billy learned to take better care of their things and to work together to achieve their goals.
