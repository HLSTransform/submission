Lila and Ben went to the park with Mom. They saw a big pond with many ducks and swans. Lila liked the swans. They had long necks and white feathers. She wanted to feed them some bread.
"Can I go closer, Mom?" Lila asked.
"Sure, but be careful. Swans can be mean sometimes. Don't touch them or bother them," Mom said.
Lila nodded and walked slowly to the edge of the pond. She broke a piece of bread and threw it to the water. A swan saw the bread and swam towards it. It ate the bread and looked at Lila. Lila smiled and threw another piece.
Ben watched from a distance. He was scared of the swans. He thought they were big and loud and scary. He saw a toy car on the grass. He picked it up and played with it. He made the car zoom on the ground. He liked the sound it made.
"Zoom, zoom, zoom!" Ben said.
The swan heard the noise and turned its head. It saw the car and Ben. It did not like the car. It thought it was a threat. It flapped its wings and hissed. It left the water and ran towards Ben.
"Help, help!" Ben cried. He dropped the car and ran away.
Lila saw the swan chasing Ben. She felt sorry for Ben. She was brave. She ran after the swan and shouted.
"Stop, stop, stop! Leave Ben alone! He is my brother!" Lila said.
The swan heard Lila and stopped. It looked at her and saw that she was not afraid. It was surprised. It realized that Ben and Lila were not enemies. It calmed down and walked back to the pond.
Lila reached Ben and hugged him. She picked up the car and gave it to him.
"Are you okay, Ben?" Lila asked.
"Yes, thank you, Lila. You are very brave. I'm sorry I was scared," Ben said.
"It's okay, Ben. I was scared too. But we are safe now. The swan is gone. Do you want to feed the ducks with me?" Lila asked.
"Okay, Lila. That sounds fun. Let's go," Ben said.
They walked to the pond and fed the ducks. Mom watched them and smiled. She was proud of Lila and Ben. They were brave and kind. They had a good day at the park.
