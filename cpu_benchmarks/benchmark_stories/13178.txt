Once there was an adorable teddy bear named Teddy. Teddy had been very lonely all day and wanted to explore.
Just then, Teddy noticed a tall structure. He wanted to know what was inside so he poked it with his paw. The structure opened up and Teddy saw a lovely garden with pretty flowers.
He hopped through the garden and explored every corner of it. He found lots of wonderful things! He found a pond full of fish, lots of big trees, and a swing that he could play on. Teddy had a wonderful time playing around in the garden.
When Teddy was tired, he lay down in the grass and looked up at the sky. He thanked the structure for giving him such a wonderful day, and said goodnight.
