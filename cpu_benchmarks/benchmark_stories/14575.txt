He was so happy to have such a useful stick! He started swinging it around. Suddenly, he saw something strange happening. The stick started to vanish! Elliot was very surprised. He tried to understand what was happening. He looked around and the swamp was empty. He had no idea what happened to the stick. He looked for it for a long time, but it seemed to have vanished. To this day, he is still trying to figure out what happened to that useful stick.
