Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the mud with her boots on. One day, her mom said, "Lily, it's time to come inside and clean your boots."
Lily replied, "Why do I have to clean my boots? They're not dirty."
Her mom said, "Yes, they are. Look at all the mud on them."
Lily sighed and said, "Okay, I'll clean them."
As she was cleaning her boots, she noticed something happening outside. She ran to the window and saw that it was raining. She yelled to her mom, "Mom! Look! It's raining! Can I go play in the rain with my clean boots?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, you can. Just be careful and have fun!"
