Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big house with a long hall. One day, Lily was walking down the hall when she heard a loud noise. It was her cat, Mittens, playing with a toy.
Lily felt happy because she loved her cat. Mittens ran up to her and licked her hand. Lily felt Mittens' soft fur and smiled. She picked up Mittens and carried her down the hall to her room.
Lily loved her home and how it made her feel. She felt safe and happy there. She cuddled with Mittens and felt grateful for her loving family. The end.
