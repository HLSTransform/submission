Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Emily. Emily's favorite color was pink. Each night, after dinner, she would pull out her special pink paper and her favorite pen. She would write stories and draw pictures. One night, when Emily was writing, the paper suddenly became very heavy. Emily looked at the paper with a puzzled expression. She had been writing so lightly, why was it so heavy? 
Suddenly she heard a familiar voice. "Hello, Emily!" 
Emily cried with delight "Mommy!" 
Mommy explained, "I saw how much you love to write, so I put a little weight inside the paper. The weight will help you write better and easier." 
Emily was so excited, she jumped up and gave her mommy a big pink hug. Every night afterwards, Emily would take out her special pink paper and write stories with ease and joy.
