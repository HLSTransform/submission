Once upon a time, there was a squirrel named Nutty. Nutty loved to collect nuts and store them in his tree. One day, Nutty found a big, shiny nut that he had never seen before. He was so excited that he wanted to keep it for himself.
But then, Nutty's friend, Chip the chipmunk, came by and asked if he could have the nut. Nutty didn't want to share, but he didn't want to be mean either. So, he told Chip that he would think about it and went to his tree to settle down and think.
As Nutty sat in his tree, he realized that he didn't need the nut as much as Chip did. He had plenty of nuts already, but Chip didn't have any. So, Nutty went back to Chip and told him that the nut was available for him to have.
Chip was so happy and thanked Nutty for being such a good friend. Nutty felt good too, knowing that he did the right thing and made his friend happy. From then on, Nutty and Chip shared all their nuts and were the best of friends.
