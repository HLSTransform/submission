One day, Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They saw a big pile of mud and worms. Ben said, "I dare you to touch the worms, Lily. They are so disgusting and slimy."
Lily was scared of the worms, but she did not want to look like a baby. She said, "No, you touch them, Ben. You are the one who likes disgusting things."
Ben said, "No, you touch them. I dare you. If you touch them, I will give you my candy."
Lily thought about the candy. She liked candy very much. She said, "Okay, I will touch them. But only for a second."
She reached out her hand and touched the worms. They were cold and wet and wiggled on her fingers. She screamed and pulled her hand back. She wiped her hand on her dress.
Ben laughed and said, "You did it, Lily. You are so brave. Here is your candy."
Lily took the candy and said, "Thank you, Ben. But I don't like worms. They are disgusting. Let's go and play something else."
They ran away from the mud and worms and played on the swings. They had fun and forgot about the disgusting worms. They were happy in their world.
