Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the world around her, but one day she felt sad because she had explored everything she knew. She said to her mom, "Mommy, the world feels empty. What can I do?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Let's go on an adventure and see what surprises we can find!" So, Lily and her mom went on a walk. They saw trees, birds, and flowers. Suddenly, they saw a big rainbow in the sky. Lily was surprised and said, "Wow, that's so pretty!"
As they continued walking, they met a friendly dog who wanted to play. Lily was happy and said, "Hi doggy, you're my new friend!" They played together and had so much fun. Lily realized that there is always something new to discover in the world and it's never truly empty. She hugged her mom and said, "Thank you for showing me the surprises in the world."
