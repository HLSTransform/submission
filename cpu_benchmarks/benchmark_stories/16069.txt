One day there was a special night for Tata and her family. She put her best dress on and her mama put a fancy lamp on the table. Everyone was excited, but Tata began to tremble.
Tata curious asked her mama why she was trembling. "We will find out soon", her mama replied.
The family opened the door and Tata stood in front of a big cake with a lot of candles! Everyone cheered and sang happy birthday. Tata ran to her mama and hugged her. The light of the lamp and the cake's candles shone in Tata's eyes. 
Tata realized that she had been trembling for fear of not having a birthday. She was happy and relieved that her family had remembered her special day!
