Mommy and daddy took their little girl to the park.  She giggle and when she saw the big cart.  She ran to it and asked Daddy to push her in.  Daddy said yes, so he started pushing the cart. 
Mommy, Daddy, and their little girl went all around the park.  Daddy pushed the cart faster and faster, until finally they stopped to take a break.  But the little girl was still anxious to keep playing.
So they went to a big hill and Daddy pushed the cart up and down the hill.  The little girl squealed with excitement.  They did that for a while until the little girl started feeling sleepy.
Daddy stopped pushing the cart and the little girl said goodbye to the park.  She waved at the cart as if she was saying goodbye to a special friend.  Mommy and Daddy took their little girl home and she dreamed of the fun she had at the park.
