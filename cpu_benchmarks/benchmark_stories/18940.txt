Once upon a time, there was a flexible snake named Sam. Sam was very good at turning and twisting his long body. One day, Sam met a big bear named Ben in the forest.
Sam said, "Hi, Ben! Look at me turn and twist my body!" Ben smiled and said, "Wow, Sam! You are very flexible. I wish I could do that too!"
Sam thought for a moment and said, "I can teach you, Ben! Let's try it together." Ben tried to turn and twist his big body like Sam, but he could not. He felt a funny feeling in his stomach.
Ben said, "Oh no, Sam! My stomach feels funny when I try to turn like you." Sam laughed and said, "That's okay, Ben. We are all different. You are good at other things, like catching fish and climbing trees!"
Ben smiled and said, "You're right, Sam. We can still be friends even if we can't do the same things." And from that day on, Sam and Ben were the best of friends, playing and having fun in the forest together.
