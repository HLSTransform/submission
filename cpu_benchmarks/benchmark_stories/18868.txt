Lily and Sam were twins who liked to play in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They also made a small igloo with thick snow blocks. They wanted to sleep in the igloo, but their mom said no. She said it was too cold and they could get sick.
"Please, mom, can we sleep in the igloo?" Lily asked.
"No, sweetie, you can sleep in your warm bed. Maybe tomorrow you can play in the igloo again," mom said.
Lily and Sam were sad, but they obeyed their mom. They went inside and had hot chocolate and cookies. They brushed their teeth and put on their pajamas. They hugged their mom and said good night.
But they were not sleepy. They had a secret plan. They waited until their mom was asleep. Then they put on their coats and boots and sneaked outside. They ran to the igloo and crawled inside. They had brought a flashlight and a blanket. They felt cozy and happy.
"Wow, this is so cool! We are sleeping in an igloo!" Sam said.
"Yes, we are! We are like Eskimos!" Lily said.
They giggled and told stories. They did not hear the wind blowing or the snow falling. They did not see the big shadow that moved near the igloo. They did not know that they were about to receive a surprise visitor.
