Once upon a time, there was a kind bear. He lived in a nice house with a chimney. Every day, he would make a fire in the chimney.
One day, the bear had an idea. He decided to make a treat by putting some ingredients into the chimney. He mixed them up and put them inside.
The bear then lit the fire and waited. After some time, he looked into the chimney and saw some smoke. The mix he put in was burning!
The bear's eyes lit up. He said, "I hope it tastes yummy!"
The bear waited some more and eventually the treat was ready. He took it out of the chimney and the smell was wonderful.
"Oh it's so delicious!", the bear said happily.
He ate the treat and it was the best he ever had. The bear was so happy he thanked the chimney for helping him make the treat. He knew he could trust the chimney to be kind.
