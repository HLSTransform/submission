Once upon a time, there was a big whale. The whale lived in the deep blue sea. He had many friends, like fish and crabs. But he had a problem. He was very smelly. His friends did not like the smell.
One day, the whale thought, "I need to find a way to not be smelly." So, he swam and swam until he found a big rock. The rock was covered in green plants. The whale rubbed against the rock to clean himself. The green plants took away the smell.
The whale swam back to his friends. They were all happy that he was not smelly anymore. They played together in the sea. The whale learned that it is important to be clean. And all the sea friends lived happily ever after.
