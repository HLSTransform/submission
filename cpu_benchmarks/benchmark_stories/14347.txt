Once upon a time, there was a little ant. The ant liked to crawl around and explore. One day, the ant found an object on the ground. It was shiny and round, and the ant thought it looked very interesting.
The ant decided to crawl closer to the object to investigate. But as the ant got closer, it started to feel a bad feeling in its stomach. It didn't know why, but something about the object didn't feel right.
Suddenly, the object started to move! It was actually a spider, waiting to catch its prey. But the ant was too smart. It quickly crawled away and found a safer place to explore. From then on, the ant knew to be careful around objects that looked too good to be true.
