Once upon a time, there was a little girl, Maya, who lived on a farm. She was only three years old so she was very curious about everything. Today, she wanted to raise something.
One morning, Maya asked her mom, “Mommy what can I raise?” Her mom said, “You can raise some peppers!” 
Maya was excited, so she went to the garden to get some pepper seeds. She dug some holes and planted the pepper seeds in the ground. She watered them, and called them her little peppers.
As weeks passed, the peppers grew bigger and bigger. Eventually, they were ready to be picked. So, Maya and her mom went to the garden and began to pick the peppers. 
Suddenly, Maya took a bite out of one of them, and shouted, “Mommy the pepper tastes so disgusting!” Her mom laughed and said, “That’s why you have to cook them first before eating them!”
Maya smiled and said, “I will never eat a pepper without cooking it again!” and she ran off happily to play with her friends.
