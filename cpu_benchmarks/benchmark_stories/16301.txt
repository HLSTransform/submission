Once upon a time, there was a bee named Buzz. Buzz was very independent and liked to do things on his own. One day, Buzz wanted to give his friend, the flower, a present. Buzz found a pretty flower and wanted to wrap it up as a gift. 
Buzz looked around for something to wrap the flower in. He found a big leaf and carefully wrapped the flower inside. Buzz was so happy with his gift and couldn't wait to give it to his friend. 
When Buzz gave the flower to his friend, the flower was so happy that it gave Buzz a big hug. Buzz felt so proud of himself for being independent and for making his friend so happy. From that day on, Buzz always looked for ways to be helpful and kind to his friends.
