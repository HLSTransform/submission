Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends and run around. One day, Timmy fell down and hurt his arm. It hurt really bad, so his mom took him to the doctor.
At the doctor's office, Timmy had to get an x-ray. The x-ray machine took a picture of his arm so the doctor could see if it was broken. Timmy was scared, but he hoped his arm was okay.
The doctor looked at the x-ray and saw that Timmy's arm was just bruised. He told Timmy and his mom that he needed to rest and take it easy for a while. Timmy was happy that he didn't have a bad injury and he learned that it's important to be careful when playing outside.
