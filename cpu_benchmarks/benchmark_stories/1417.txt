Once upon a time, there was an enormous tree. It was so huge that not even the biggest birds could fly over it. One day, a little girl came walking by. She stopped to look at the giant tree, and then saw something that made her very happy – a twig poking out from the trunk.
The little girl was so excited that she reached up and tried to pull out the twig. It was stuck firm, so she gave it a tug, and then something amazing happened – the twig broke!
The little girl was so happy that she jumped up and down. She put the twig in her pocket and went off skipping away. From then on, she always carried the twig with her – a reminder of the enormous tree.
