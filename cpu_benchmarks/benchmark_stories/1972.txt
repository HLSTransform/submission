John and his mum were walking down the street. John saw something that made him laugh. It was a big, green balloon. He wanted to get it.
John said, "Please, Mum! I want that balloon!" His Mum said no and shook her head.
John started to cry and his Mum felt bad. She said, "How about some ice-cream instead?" John stopped crying and smiled.
John and his Mum went to an ice-cream shop. There were lots of different flavours to choose from. John chose an ice-cream that looked like a balloon and laughed.
Suddenly, the shopkeeper said, "This is a very deep freezer. Please be careful!" John stopped laughing and nervously reached for the ice-cream. He dropped the ice-cream into the deep freezer!
John started to cry again. His Mum gave him a hug and said, "It's ok. We can get another ice-cream".
John felt better and laughed. He chose the same ice-cream again. And they both enjoyed it.
