Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Toby. Toby had a unique way of learning. His mom knew he was special so every day she would try to teach him new things. One day she decided to teach Toby about sharks. She told Toby that sharks were a special type of fish and showed him pictures of them. Toby was fascinated and couldn't wait to learn more. 
The next day, Toby's mom took him to the beach so he could see a real shark. When they got there, Toby saw a giant shark swimming in the water and he was fascinated. He asked his mom a lot of questions and she was happy to teach him all about the shark. 
After that, Toby became obsessed with sharks. He drew them in his drawings and asked his mom questions about them all the time. Toby had discovered something unique that could only be taught by his mom and he was excited to share it with the world.
