Once upon a time, there was a boy. He was only three years old. One day, the boy went to the park. He was so excited!
At the park, the boy saw swings and slides. He also saw a big, dark tree. He wanted to explore.
The boy walked to the tree and opened the door. When he opened it, he saw lots of animals! They were squirrels and birds and bunnies. The boy was so happy.
The boy played with the animals all day. He watched them climb the trees and race around. When the day was over, the boy opened the door and went home, back to his own special park.
