Once upon a time, there was a boy. He wanted to find a rainbow, so he decided to go on an adventure. The boy got ready and hurried out of his house. He ran through the grass, across a field and into the woods. He kept running until he found a big, comfortable tree. The boy climbed up and soon, he could see a beautiful rainbow. It was all the colors of the rainbow and the boy couldn't believe his eyes. He was so happy that he stayed in the tree and watched the rainbow for a long time. Finally, he had to go home, so he said goodbye to the rainbow and hurried away.
