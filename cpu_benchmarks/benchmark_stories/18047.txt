Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a big bicycle that he loved to ride. His bicycle was enormous! It was so big that Timmy felt like a giant when he rode it.
One day, Timmy and his bicycle went on an adventure. They rode through the park and over the hills. Timmy felt so happy and free when he rode his bicycle. He loved the wind in his hair and the sun on his face.
When Timmy got home, he was tired but happy. He felt proud of himself for riding his enormous bicycle all by himself. Timmy knew that he would always love his bicycle and the adventures they went on together.
