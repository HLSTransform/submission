Once upon a time, there was a long journey over a big hill. On the other side of the hill, Lucy and her mommy saw a big, exciting surprise! It was a sparkling diamond! Lucy said, "Mommy, what is it?" Mommy smiled and said, "It's a diamond!" Lucy was very happy and wanted to pick it up. But Mommy said, "No, it's best to leave it here and not touch it. We don't know where this diamond came from and we don't want to take it away from someone else." 
So they kept walking but looked back to see if they could tell where the diamond came from. Then, from far away, they heard someone shouting, "My diamond! I've been looking for it for a long time!" They looked back and saw a woman on top of the hill, waving her hands. The woman was very happy as she had finally found her diamond. Mommy smiled at Lucy and said, "See, I told you not to take it away from someone else. This diamond belongs to that woman and we should not take it from her." 
Lucy learned an important lesson from this experience. She understood that it is not nice to take something that belongs to someone else without asking. We should always respect other people's property and reveal where it came from.
