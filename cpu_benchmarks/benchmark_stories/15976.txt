Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved ice-cream very much. Every day, Timmy would ask his mommy for ice-cream. But his mommy was stubborn and would only give him a little bit.
One day, Timmy went to the park and saw a merry-go-round. He wanted to spin on it so badly. But he was feeling sad because he didn't have any ice-cream. Suddenly, a kind lady came up to him and gave him a big ice-cream cone. Timmy was so happy that he couldn't stop spinning on the merry-go-round.
From that day on, Timmy would always remember how much fun it was to spin and eat ice-cream. And he learned that sometimes, even stubborn mommies can be nice and give you what you want.
