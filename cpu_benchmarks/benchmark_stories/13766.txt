Lily and Ben are friends who like to play with blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes. They can build towers, houses, bridges and more with their blocks.
One day, they decide to have a test. They want to see who can build the highest tower with their blocks. They are both competitive and want to win. They start to stack their blocks on the floor, trying to make them steady and tall.
"Look at my tower, Lily! It is bigger than yours!" Ben says, pointing at his blocks.
"No, it is not! My tower is bigger and prettier!" Lily says, showing her blocks.
They keep building and arguing, until they hear a loud noise. It is their dog, Spot, who has run into the room. Spot sees the blocks and thinks they are toys. He jumps on them and scatters them all over the floor. The towers fall down and break into pieces.
"Spot, no!" Lily and Ben shout, running to their blocks. They are sad and angry. They look at their dog, who wags his tail and licks their faces. He does not know he has ruined their test.
Lily and Ben sigh. They realize that their test was not very important. They hug their dog and each other. They decide to play with their blocks together, not against each other. They are friends again.
