Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to ride his bike in the park. One day, he woke up and saw that it was noon. He quickly ate his lunch and went to the park to ride his bike. 
The weather was fine, and the sun was shining. Timmy rode his bike up and down the hills, and he felt very happy. He saw some ducks in the pond and stopped to watch them. 
After a while, Timmy got tired and went home. He took a nap and woke up feeling refreshed. He thought about how much fun he had riding his bike in the park at noon, and he couldn't wait to do it again.
