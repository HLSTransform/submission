Once upon a time, there was a girl called Lily. She liked to dress up and play pretend. One day, she asked her Grandma if she could have some makeup. Grandma said yes and let Lily have makeup when she was old enough.
Every day, Lily watched her mummy put on beautiful makeup. She wanted her own makeup so she could look pretty. Finally the day came when Grandma let Lily have her own makeup. It was pink, purple and had sparkles! 
Lily loved it so much and she couldn't stop looking at herself in the mirror. She put it on everyday and played pretend, pretending to be a princess. One day, her Grandma said she had to be careful and not to wear too much makeup, because it wasn't real. It was fake. 
Lily was sad but she listened to her Grandma. She made sure not to put on too much makeup and still had fun playing pretend.
