Jill and Jack were hungry, so they went outside to find something to eat. As they walked past a mailbox, they heard someone speaking. It was an old man. He said that he was hungry too, and he asked them if they had something to give him. Jill and Jack said they didn't have anything to give, so the old man got mad. His face turned red and he started to yell. Then he waved his arms and stomped away. Jill and Jack were scared and ran back home.
When they got there, they were sad. They were so hungry, but still there was nothing they could do. They knew they couldn't help the old man feel better, so they tried to forget the bad ending.
