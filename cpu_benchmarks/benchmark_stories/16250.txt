Tonya was walking down the beach when she saw a cute, little palm tree. It was standing alone looking out at the ocean. Tonya had never seen a palm tree before and she wanted to touch it.
She went closer and put out her hand, but as she went to touch the tree it started to twist. “What are you doing?” she asked the tree.
The tree said nothing. Tonya was confused. She asked it again, but the palm tree just kept twisting.
Tonya was worried the palm tree was hurting itself, so she took a step closer. All of a sudden the tree stopped twisting and backed away from Tonya.
Tonya realized that the tree didn’t want her to touch it. She felt bad that she had scared the tree but she still thought it was really cute. She smiled at it and walked away.
