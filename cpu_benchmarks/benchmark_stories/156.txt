Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved waking up early to see the sunrise. One day, she woke up and saw that the sky was yellow. She was very happy because she knew that meant the sunrise would be extra pretty.
Lily went outside to watch the sunrise with her mom. "Look, Mommy! The sunrise is so pretty today!" Lily said. "Yes, it is," her mom replied. "The yellow sky provides a beautiful background for the sunrise."
Lily and her mom sat and watched the sunrise together. They talked about how the sun makes everything warm and bright. Lily was so happy to spend the morning with her mom and see the beautiful yellow sunrise.
