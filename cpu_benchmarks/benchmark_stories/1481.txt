Once upon a time there was a flame. It was incredible! It lit up the dark sky with its bright light. Everywhere it went, it made the trees, rocks and grass glow beautiful colors.
The flame flew up to the sky. It became so big that it filled the entire sky. People on the ground were in awe and clapped their hands. 
The flame brought warmth and joy to all who saw it. It was wonderful! It danced and swayed in the sky, filling the night with a special kind of happiness.
Finally, the flame began to come back down. It flew all around like a ballerina, touching everything it saw and making everyone smile. 
Then, it was gone. The sky became dark, but everyone remembered the incredible flame. And they had smiles on their faces.
