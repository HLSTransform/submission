One day, a little pale cat named Luna was playing with her friend, a big dog named Max. They were running and jumping in the park. Luna was very happy because the sun was shining and the sky was blue.
Suddenly, Luna looked up at the sky and saw the universe. It was full of stars and planets. "Wow! Look at the universe, Max!" said Luna. Max looked up and said, "It is so big and pretty!"
Luna felt a tickle in her nose. She tried to stop it, but she couldn't. "Achoo!" Luna sneezed. The sneeze was so big that it made the stars in the universe shake. Luna and Max laughed and laughed. They played in the park until the sun went down, and then they went home to sleep.
