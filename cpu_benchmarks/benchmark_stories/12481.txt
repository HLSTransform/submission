Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big machine in the park. It has many buttons and lights. Tom and Lily are curious.
"Let's join the machine!" Tom says. "Maybe it is fun!"
"I don't know, Tom. It looks scary." Lily says. "Maybe we should not touch it."
But Tom does not listen. He runs to the machine and pushes a button. The machine makes a loud noise and opens a door. Tom goes inside the machine.
"Lily, come on! Join me!" Tom shouts.
Lily is afraid, but she does not want to lose Tom. She follows him and goes inside the machine. The door closes behind them.
The machine starts to shake and spin. Tom and Lily scream. They want to get out, but they cannot. The machine is too strong. It is not fun. It is bad.
The machine takes Tom and Lily away. They never see the park or their families again. They are very sad. They wish they did not join the machine. The end.
