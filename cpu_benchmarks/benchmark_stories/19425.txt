Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was so cheerful! She woke up one day and wanted to take a nap. She had a special nap blanket and she shook it out to make her bed. She curled up and closed her eyes. Soon she was fast asleep and began to dream. When she woke up, she felt so rested and happy. She sprang out of bed and shook her arms in the air, full of cheer! She was so glad to have had such a nice nap. When her friends heard about her cheerful morning, they all clapped and cheered. The little girl smiled and shook her head with delight. She was so grateful for her nap and the cheers from her friends.
