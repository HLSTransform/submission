Once upon a time there was a boy called Ted. He was a quiet boy who liked to swim in the sea. He was swimming one day when it started to get dark. Ted got out of the water and noticed that he was lost. He started to cry but then he heard someone call out his name. It was his mom! She had been looking for him for so long but now she had found him. Ted was so happy.
Ted's mom hugged him and said sorry for getting lost. She told him that she should have been paying more attention. Then Ted's mom said that she had brought his favourite snack for him. Ted forgot all about being lost and said thank you.
His mom smiled and said, "Ted, I will always forgive you". Ted smiled back and they hugged again. Ted knew that his mom would always be there to help him. He was so happy that his mom had forgiven him, and he was even happier that he could swim in the sea again and have fun with his mom. From then on, Ted and his mom always enjoyed playing together in the quiet sea.
