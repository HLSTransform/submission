Tim and Sue wanted to pick some apples from the big tree in the yard. They saw a ladder leaning on the fence. Tim said, "Let's use the ladder to reach the apples. They look so yummy!"
Sue said, "But the ladder is too tall and wobbly. We might fall and get hurt. We should be careful and ask Mom for help."
Tim said, "No, we can do it by ourselves. I'm not afraid. You are just a scaredy-cat." He grabbed the ladder and dragged it to the tree. He climbed up the ladder, but it was not steady. It shook and tilted as he moved.
Sue said, "Tim, stop! The ladder is not safe. Come down before you fall!" She was worried about her brother.
Tim said, "No, I want the apples. I'm almost there. Don't be a baby." He reached for the apples, but he lost his balance. The ladder slipped and he fell to the ground. He cried out in pain. He hurt his arm and his leg.
Sue ran to him and hugged him. She said, "Tim, are you okay? I'm sorry you got hurt. I told you to be careful and quit climbing the ladder."
Tim said, "I'm sorry too. I was silly and stubborn. I should have listened to you and quit. You were right. The ladder was not safe. I learned my lesson. Next time, I will be careful and ask Mom for help."
Sue said, "That's good, Tim. I'm glad you learned your lesson. I love you, brother."
They hugged each other and waited for Mom to come. Mom heard their cries and came running. She saw what happened and took them inside. She cleaned their wounds and gave them a hug. She said, "I'm glad you are not badly hurt. But you should never use the ladder without me. It's dangerous. You could have broken your bones or worse. You should always be careful and quit when something is risky. Do you understand?"
Tim and Sue said, "Yes, Mom. We understand. We're sorry. We won't do it again."
Mom said, "That's good, my sweeties. I love you both. Now, how about some apple pie for dessert?"
Tim and Sue said, "Yes, please! We love apple pie!"
They smiled and ate the apple pie. They were happy and grateful. They learned to be careful and quit when something is not safe. They also learned to listen to each other and to Mom. They were good children.
