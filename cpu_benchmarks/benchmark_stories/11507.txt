Once upon a time, in a small house, there was an old toy box. Inside the box, there were many toys. One day, a small toy triangle woke up and decided to find a new friend.
The toy triangle walked around the room and saw a big, soft bear. The triangle said, "Hi, bear! Do you want to be my friend?" The bear smiled and said, "Yes, I want to be your friend." They played together and had a lot of fun.
After playing, the bear felt something poke him. He looked down and saw the toy triangle. The triangle said, "I'm sorry, bear. I didn't mean to poke you." The bear laughed and said, "It's okay, triangle. We are friends now, and friends help each other." From that day on, the old toy box was a happy place for all the toys.
