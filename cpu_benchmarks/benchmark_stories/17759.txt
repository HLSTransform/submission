Once there was a little girl named Jane. She was only three years old. One day Jane wanted to choose something special. She went to the toy store and saw a bright, sparkly monster. She knew it was the one!
Jane was excited and couldn't wait to go home and play. She hugged the monster and gave it a kiss. But something was wrong. The monster was deaf! Jane was a bit scared but thought she could help.
So Jane put her hands over the monster's ears and said "Monster, can you hear me?" And the monster heard! All of a sudden it was moving and talking and was so happy. Jane was so proud of herself.
Jane and the monster became best friends. They played together every day. Jane was so happy she chose the monster. It was the best decision she ever made.
