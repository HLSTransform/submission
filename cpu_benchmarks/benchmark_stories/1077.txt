Once there was a circle. It travelled around and around but it couldn't find its way out. Until one day, a clear voice said, "reverse!"
The circle started to go backwards. It went all the way back to the start, right where it had begun. With a second clear voice, it said, "go forward!"
And the circle started to go around and around, this time going forward. Finally, it found the way out of the maze and was so very happy. It was free!
The circle thanked the clear voices and continued on its way. It went around and around, making a path of joy wherever it went.
