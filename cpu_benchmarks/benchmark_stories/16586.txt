Tom and Jen are friends. They like to play in the park on Sunday. They have a ball, a bike and a kite. They have fun.
But one Sunday, something bad happens. A big dog comes to the park. The dog is not nice. The dog wants to play with the ball, the bike and the kite. The dog runs after Tom and Jen. Tom and Jen are scared.
"Go away, dog!" Tom shouts. "This is our park!"
"Leave us alone, dog!" Jen cries. "These are our toys!"
But the dog does not listen. The dog bites the ball. The ball pops. The dog chases the bike. The bike falls. The dog jumps on the kite. The kite rips.
Tom and Jen are sad. They have no toys. They have no fun.
Then, a man comes to the park. The man is the dog's owner. The man is silly. He does not see the dog is bad. He thinks the dog is good.
"Hello, kids!" the man says. "Do you want to play with my dog? He is very friendly!"
Tom and Jen look at the man. They look at the dog. They look at their toys. They shake their heads.
"No, thank you!" they say. "We do not want to play with your dog. He is very naughty!"
They run away from the man and the dog. They go home. They hope the next Sunday will be better.
