Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in their room. But sometimes they fight over the same toy. One day, they both want to play with the red car.
"Give me the car!" Anna says.
"No, it is mine!" Ben says.
They pull the car from each other. The car breaks. They hear a loud snap. They look at the car. It has two parts. They feel sad and angry.
"Mama!" they cry.
Mama comes to their room. She sees the broken car. She sees their tears.
"What happened?" she asks.
"Anna broke the car!" Ben says.
"No, Ben broke the car!" Anna says.
Mama sighs. She picks up the car parts. She says, "I can fix the car. But you have to change. You have to share and be nice to each other. Fighting is not good. Do you understand?"
Anna and Ben nod. They say, "We are sorry, Mama."
Mama smiles. She says, "It is okay. I love you both. Now, help me fix the car. Then we can have a treat. How about some cookies?"
Anna and Ben smile. They say, "Yes, please!"
They help Mama fix the car. They use some glue and tape. The car looks like new. They hug Mama. They say, "Thank you, Mama!"
Mama says, "You are welcome. Now, let's go to the kitchen. I have some cookies for you. But remember, you have to share and be nice to each other. Okay?"
Anna and Ben say, "Okay, Mama!"
They go to the kitchen. They see a plate of cookies. They each take one. They say, "Mmm, yummy!"
They eat their cookies. They feel happy. They do not fight anymore. They play with the car together. They take turns. They say, "This is fun!"
Mama watches them. She feels proud. She says, "That's my good twins. I am glad you changed. You are not helpless. You can solve your problems. You can be kind. You can have fun. I love you both."
Anna and Ben say, "We love you too, Mama!"
