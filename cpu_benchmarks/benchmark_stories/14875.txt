Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Bun Bun. Bun Bun loved to dance in the meadow with her friends. One day, while dancing, she found a twig on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her friends.
"I'm scared of twigs," said her friend, a little mouse named Mousy.
"Don't be fearful," said Bun Bun. "It's just a twig. See, I can dance with it."
Bun Bun twirled and hopped with the twig in her hand. Mousy watched and then tried it too. She was no longer scared. From that day on, Mousy and Bun Bun danced with twigs every time they played in the meadow. They learned that sometimes things that seem scary at first are not so scary after all.
