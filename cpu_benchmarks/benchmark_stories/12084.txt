Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to draw and write on his paper. He would use his crayons to make pretty pictures. One day, Timmy went outside to play. The sun was shining bright in the sky. Timmy felt happy and calm as he played in the warm sun. When he went back inside, he wrote a story about his fun day in the sun. Timmy was proud of his writing and showed it to his mom. She smiled and told him it was wonderful. From then on, Timmy loved to write stories about his adventures in the sun.
