Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her grandma bake cookies. One day, Lily and her grandma went to the apple orchard to pick some apples. They picked lots of apples and put them in a basket. 
When they got back home, Lily's grandma asked her to open the recipe book. They looked for the recipe to make apple cookies. They found the recipe and started baking. Lily helped her grandma mix the ingredients and put the cookies in the oven. 
After a while, the cookies were ready. Lily's grandma took them out of the oven and they smelled so good! Lily couldn't wait to eat them. When they were cool enough, Lily and her grandma sat down and ate the delicious apple cookies they had baked together.
