One day, a beautiful bird was flying in the sky. She saw a magazine on the ground. She wanted to look at the pretty pictures in the magazine. So, she flew down and picked it up with her beak.
As the beautiful bird flew back up, the wind blew very hard. The pages of the magazine started to scatter. They flew all around the sky like big, colorful leaves.
The beautiful bird felt sad that her magazine was gone. But then, she saw all the scattered pages making the sky look even more beautiful. She smiled and knew that the pretty pictures were now a part of the lovely sky.
