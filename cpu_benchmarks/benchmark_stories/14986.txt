Once there was a little boy named Grant. He was very obedient and never gave his parents any trouble. One day Grant's parents told him to go and play in the yard. 
Grant happily ran outside and started to play. He was jumping around and having lots of fun. He smiled as he said, "This is so fun!" 
Then Grant saw a bouncy ball in the yard. He picked it up and said, "I can bounce this ball!" 
He put the ball down and started to bounce it up and down. As he bounced, he smiled and laughed. Grant said, "Bouncing this ball is so much fun!" 
After Grant was done bouncing the ball, he put it back in the yard and ran back into the house. His parents smiled and said, "Good job, Grant. You are so obedient!"
