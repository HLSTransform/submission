Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and laugh with her friends. One day, Lily's mom gave her a jar of candy with a label that said "only one piece per day". Lily wanted to eat all the candy at once, but her mom said no.
Lily was sad and didn't understand why she couldn't eat all the candy. Her mom explained that if she ate too much candy, she would get sick. Lily listened and understood that it was important to follow the label.
From that day on, Lily always read the label before eating anything. She felt clear about what she should and shouldn't do. And she learned that following the rules can keep her healthy and happy. Now Lily laughs and plays with her friends, knowing that she is making good choices.
