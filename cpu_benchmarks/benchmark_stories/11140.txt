Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a tap in her backyard where she loved to play. One day, her grumpy neighbor, Mr. Brown, came over and told her to stop playing because the noise was bothering him.
Lily didn't understand why Mr. Brown was so angry. She asked him why he was so grumpy. Mr. Brown replied, "I'm not grumpy, I just don't like the noise."
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "I admire your garden. It's so pretty." Mr. Brown was surprised by her compliment and softened a little. He replied, "Thank you, Lily. I work hard on it."
Lily suggested that they could play together and Mr. Brown could teach her how to take care of his garden. Mr. Brown smiled and agreed. From that day on, they became friends and Lily learned a lot about gardening. They both lived happily ever after.
