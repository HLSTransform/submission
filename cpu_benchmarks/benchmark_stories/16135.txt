Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very clever. She had a brilliant idea. She took a piece of paper and a pencil and made a funny face. She looked at it and smiled. 
Just then, her mum walked into the room. "What have you got there darling?" she asked.
"It's a funny face I made with my pencil and paper," said the little girl with a smile.
Mum laughed. "Let me see," she said.
The little girl handed her the piece of paper. Mum looked at the funny face and smiled. "That's brilliant!" she said. "Well done!"
The little girl felt very pleased with herself. She smiled, put the piece of paper away, and ran off to show her friends.
