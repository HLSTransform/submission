Once upon a time there was a little girl called Mandy. She was so excited because she was going to her first bounce show. The stage was icy, but it made the show so much more exciting.
At the show, Mandy bounced around like crazy. She jumped and bounced on the stage and the audience cheered and clapped. She did amazing flips and bounces and everyone was so impressed.
After the show, Mandy's parents took her out for a treat. Mandy was so happy because she had so much fun bouncing around on the stage.
Now, whenever Mandy visits the bounce show she can't help but smile and bounce around. She loves it so much and will never forget how icy the stage was!
