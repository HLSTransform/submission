Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play in the park. They had a ball that was soft and red. They liked to kick the ball to each other and run after it. Sometimes they would pass the ball to other kids and make new friends.
One day, they went to the park with their mom. She told them to stay close and not go too far. She said she would watch them from the bench. Ben and Lily nodded and ran to the grass with their ball. They had so much fun that they forgot what their mom said.
They saw a big hill and wanted to see what was on the other side. They kicked the ball up the hill and followed it. They did not see their mom waving and calling them. They did not hear the cars honking and the dogs barking. They only saw the ball rolling down the hill.
They reached the bottom of the hill and saw a big road. There were many cars and trucks and buses. They were loud and fast and scary. Ben and Lily wanted to cross the road and get their ball. They did not look left and right. They did not wait for the green light. They did not hold hands.
They ran into the road and tried to catch their ball. But they were too late. A big truck came and hit them. They flew in the air and landed on the ground. They did not get up. They did not move. They did not breathe.
Their mom saw what happened and screamed. She ran to them and hugged them. She cried and cried and cried. She wished she had not let them go. She wished they had not forgotten. She wished they had not passed the ball. She wished they had not played with the soft and red ball.
