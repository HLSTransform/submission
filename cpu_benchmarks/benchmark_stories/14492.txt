Ben was in the mall with his mom. He was excited and pointed to all the fun things to see, like a bright toy train and a delicious cookie shop. 
They were walking down the aisle and Ben pointed to something very weird. It was a strange animal with a big snout. Its fur was purple, and it had big blue eyes.   
Ben's mom whispered, "That's an unusual pet, isn't it?" Ben's eyes were wide as he nodded. 
Just then, something moved in the pet cage. Ben pointed and said, "Mommy, what's that?" 
Mommy laughed. "It's a guinea pig. Come on, let's go see." 
They got closer, and Ben could see the guinea pig was eating a carrot. He realized it must be a pet and smiled. 
It was a weird mall, but Ben loved it.
