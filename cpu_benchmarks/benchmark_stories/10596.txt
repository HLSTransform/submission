Once upon a time there were two friends, Matt and Susan. They decided to go on a special adventure. They found a clear raft and hopped on. Matt said, "Let's rock the raft!" Susan smiled and they started to rock the raft on the water. The raft moved back and forth as they laughed and smiled. They raced the wind, rocking faster and faster. Then before they knew it, they were at the other side. They jumped out of the raft and hugged each other. They had been on a wonderful adventure!  The end.
