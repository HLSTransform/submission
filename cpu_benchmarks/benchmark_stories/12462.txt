Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the garden. Lily had a doll and Tom had a car. They liked to pretend that the doll and the car were friends and went on adventures together.
One day, a big boy came to the garden. He saw Lily and Tom and their toys. He wanted to play with them, but he was not nice. He said, "Your toys are stupid. They are old and dirty. My toys are better. They are new and shiny. Give me your toys and I will give you mine."
Lily and Tom did not like the big boy. They did not want to give him their toys. They said, "No, thank you. We like our toys. They are not stupid. They are fun and we value them. They are our friends. We do not want your toys. They are not nice. They are mean and you are mean."
The big boy got angry. He tried to grab Lily's doll and Tom's car. Lily and Tom held on to their toys and shouted, "Stop! Go away! Leave us alone!"
The big boy did not stop. He pulled and pushed and kicked. He was very rude. He made Lily and Tom cry. He made their toys fall on the ground.
Then, Lily's mom and Tom's dad came to the garden. They saw what the big boy was doing. They were very mad. They said, "What are you doing? How dare you hurt Lily and Tom and their toys? You are a very bad boy. You should be ashamed of yourself. Go home and do not come back."
The big boy was scared. He ran away. He did not say sorry. He did not take his toys. He left them on the ground.
Lily's mom and Tom's dad picked up Lily and Tom and their toys. They hugged them and kissed them. They said, "Are you okay? We are sorry that the big boy was so mean to you. You are very brave and kind. We are proud of you. We love you and we value you. You are our friends."
Lily and Tom smiled. They said, "Thank you, mom and dad. We love you and we value you too. You are our friends."
They went inside the house. They put their toys on a post. They said, "You are our friends too. We are sorry that the big boy was so mean to you. We value you and we will take care of you."
They played with their toys happily. They forgot about the big boy. They had fun and they were happy.
