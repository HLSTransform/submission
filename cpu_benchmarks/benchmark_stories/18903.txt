Lily liked to help her mom in the kitchen. She liked to stir the pot and smell the food. Mom was making soup for lunch. She put carrots, potatoes, chicken and water in the pot. She said it would become delicious.
Lily wanted to taste the soup. She asked mom if she could have a spoon. Mom said yes, but be careful. The pot was very hot. Lily took a spoon and dipped it in the pot. She blew on the soup and put it in her mouth.
Mmm, it was delicious! Lily smiled and said thank you to mom. Mom smiled back and said you're welcome. She gave Lily a hug and a kiss. They sat down at the table and ate the soup together. Lily was happy and full. She liked to help her mom in the kitchen.
