One day in the garden, Sue and Jack were playing. They saw something very strange. It was enormous. It looked like a pencil!
Jack said: "What is that?"
Sue replied: "I don't know. Let's gather it and take it to Mum."
So, Jack and Sue got the enormous pencil and went to find Mum. She was very surprised. She said: "Where did you find this?"
Jack said: "We found it in the garden." 
Mum smiled and said: "A pencil this big must have been left there by a giant! Do you know what I'm going to do with it?"
Jack and Sue shook their heads. Mum replied: "I'm going to keep it for us to draw with."
Jack and Sue smiled. They were very happy that they had found the enormous pencil.
