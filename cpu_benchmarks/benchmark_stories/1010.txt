Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He was very curious. One day, Tim ventured into a big, dark room. As Tim walked in, he could feel his muscles trembling. He had never seen a room as big and dark as this one.
Tim had never seen a room with so many switches. Everywhere he looked, he saw switches on the walls and in the corners. He was very excited and tried to press each switch he saw. But none of them worked. He tried again and again, but nothing changed. 
Tim kept trying and eventually, he came across one special switch. He pressed it and, at once, a big light came on. Bright yellow light filled the room, and Tim smiled in joy. He was very persistent and he was rewarded.
As he ran out of the room, Tim felt very happy. He had conquered his fear and he had found a special switch that could turn on the lights. He learned that being persistent can help you achieve great things.
