Once, there was a boy and a girl who were best friends. They were playing outside, near a hill. The girl asked the boy, "Shall we go up the hill — shall we try?" The boy said, "Yes, let's!"
So the two friends started walking up the hill. The hill was quite big, and it was very deep. As they walked, the boy and the girl talked about their adventures together.
They arrived at the top of the hill. From the top, they could see lots of trees, and a bright blue sky. The two friends smiled and said, "We did it! We arrived at the top of the hill!" 
Then they ran back down and celebrated their success, before going off to do their next adventure.
