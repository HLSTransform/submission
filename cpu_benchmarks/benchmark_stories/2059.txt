Once upon a time, there was a little chicken named Chickie. Chickie was very selfish, which means she only thought about herself and not others. One day, Chickie found a big bowl and decided to fill it with all the yummy corn she could find. She didn't want to share with her chicken friends because she was too selfish. 
But then, a big storm came and all the corn was blown away. Chickie was sad and hungry. Her chicken friends came to help her and shared their corn with her. Chickie learned that it's important to share and not be selfish. From that day on, Chickie always filled her bowl with enough corn to share with her friends.
