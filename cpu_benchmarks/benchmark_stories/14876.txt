Once upon a time, there was a kind boy named Timmy. He loved to draw on paper with his crayons. One day, Timmy met a kind girl named Sarah. They played together and had lots of fun.
As they grew up, Timmy realized he wanted to marry Sarah. So, he drew a picture of a ring on a piece of paper and asked her to marry him. Sarah said yes and they had a big party with lots of cake and balloons.
From that day on, Timmy and Sarah were married and they drew lots of pictures together on paper. They lived happily ever after. The end.
