Once upon a time there was a girl named Annie. Annie was very creative and loved to play. She decided one day to make something special. She found some wheat in the kitchen and she knew just what to do.
Annie made a pillow out of the wheat. It was soft and fluffy. It was perfect for a nap. Annie laid down on the pillow and quickly fell asleep.
Annie slept for a long time and had many nice dreams. When she woke up, she found something special had happened. The wheat pillow had turned into a magical pillow with lots of funny shapes and colours.
Annie was so excited about her creative pillow that she made lots of more pillows with different shapes and colours.
Annie had lots of fun playing and sleeping with her magic pillows. She was so happy and the wheat had made her dreams come true.
