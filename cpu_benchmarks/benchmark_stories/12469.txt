Lily was playing with her doll in the garden. She liked to pretend that her doll was sick and she was a doctor. She had a toy stethoscope and a bandage. She put the stethoscope on her doll's chest and said, "Don't worry, you will be fine. I will take care of you."
But then she heard a loud noise. It was an ambulance. It had a red light and a siren. It stopped in front of her neighbor's house. Lily saw two men get out of the ambulance. They had white clothes and a big bag. They ran to the door and knocked.
Lily was curious. She left her doll on the grass and ran to the fence. She saw the men come out of the house with a stretcher. On the stretcher was an old lady. She was Lily's neighbor, Mrs. Jones. She looked very weak and pale. She had a mask on her face and a tube in her arm.
"Where are they taking her?" Lily asked one of the men.
"They are taking her to the hospital, sweetie. She is very sick and needs help," the man said.
"Will she be okay?" Lily asked.
"We hope so. We will do our best to make her better," the man said.
Lily felt sad. She liked Mrs. Jones. She often gave her cookies and read her stories. She wanted her to be well.
"Can I do something for her?" Lily asked.
The man smiled. He bent down and gave Lily a hug.
"You can do something very important for her. You can pray for her and send her your love. She will feel it and it will help her heal," he said.
Lily nodded. She hugged the man back and said, "Thank you. I will do that. I care for her very much."
The man kissed her cheek and said, "You are a very sweet and kind girl. I'm sure she cares for you too."
Then he got in the ambulance with the other man and Mrs. Jones. The ambulance drove away with the siren and the red light.
Lily watched it go. She felt a tear roll down her cheek. She whispered, "Get well soon, Mrs. Jones. I love you."
Then she went back to her doll and picked her up. She hugged her and said, "Don't worry, you will be fine. I will take care of you."
