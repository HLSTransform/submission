Once upon a time, there was a little bee who was very shy. She never talked to anyone and always kept to herself. One day, a little girl came to visit the garden where the bee lived. The bee was curious and flew over to the girl.
"Hello," said the little girl. "What's your name?"
The bee was too shy to answer, so the little girl tried to explain that it was okay to talk to her. "Don't be shy," she said. "I won't hurt you."
The bee felt a little better and decided to talk to the girl. "My name is Buzzy," she said softly.
The little girl smiled. "That's a nice name for a bee. Do you want to be friends?"
Buzzy was surprised but happy. "Yes, please!" she said.
From that day on, Buzzy and the little girl were the best of friends. Buzzy wasn't shy anymore and loved to fly around the garden with her new friend.
