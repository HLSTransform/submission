Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. But today it is very hot. The sun is bright and makes them sweat.
"Let's find some shade," Tom says. "We can rest under a tree."
"OK," Sue says. "But where is a tree? I only see grass and flowers."
They look around. They see a big hill. On top of the hill, there is a thin tree. It has green leaves and brown bark.
"Look, there is a tree!" Tom says. "Let's go there."
They run to the hill. They climb up. They are tired and thirsty. They reach the tree. They sit under it. They feel the cool breeze. They see the blue sky.
"Ah, this is nice," Sue says. "The tree gives us shade. We are not hot anymore."
"Yes, it is nice," Tom says. "The tree is our friend. It helps us."
They smile. They hug the tree. They thank the tree. They unite with the tree. They are happy.
