Once upon a time, there was a big, old car. The car was red and had four wheels. It could speed very fast and go to many places. One day, the car went to a new place it had never been before. It was a park with lots of trees and flowers. The car drove around the park, going fast and slow. It was so much fun! When it was time to go home, the car felt happy and tired. It had a great adventure in a new place.
