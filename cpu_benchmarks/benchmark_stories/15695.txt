Sally and her dad were standing in the driveway admiring the shiny new motorcycle. Dad was so proud of it; it was the most impressive thing Sally had ever seen. "Wow!" cried Sally. "Do you like it, sweetheart?" her dad asked. Sally nodded. "Can I take it for a spin?" she asked, hopping up and down excitedly. 
Dad smiled and put his arm around Sally. "Sure thing!" he said. He helped Sally lean into the seat and showed her how to hold the handles and start the bike. "Be careful and don't go too fast," he warned. Sally smiled, revved the engine, and zoomed off with a loud rumble. Dad sighed and watched her go, feeling proud yet worried. 
Sally rode around the block, leaning into the turns and feeling the wind rush through her hair. It was the most incredible feeling she had ever had! When she reached home, Dad was waiting with a smile on his face. "That was impressive, Sally! Where did you learn to do that?" Dad asked. 
Sally just grinned and said, "I learned it from you, Dad!"
