Sally was very excited. Her mom said that she was going to study with a blueberry. On the way to the blueberry, she saw a big, loud truck. She was so excited that she started shouting and running. 
When she got to the blueberry, she looked around. She saw a lot of different things to do. She saw colouring books, games and puzzles. She wanted to do all of them, but she decided to focus on one thing at a time. 
First she wanted to study. She got out her books and pencils and started to look at the pictures. She could name most of the objects in the pictures, but there were some she didnâ€™t know.
As Sally studied, she had a snack of blueberries. They were juicy and sweet, and she ate them all up. She wanted more, but she was almost done studying. 
After she was done, she felt proud of what she had accomplished. She had studied and eaten blueberries, and she had fun too!
