One day a little girl wanted to explore. She decided to go to the park. When she arrived, she saw an incredible cross. She crawled up to it and touched it with her tiny fingers. The cross felt cool and smooth. 
She started to crawl around it. The little girl saw shapes and colours everywhere. Even the ground was filled with patterns. She kept on crawling and playing.
 
After a while, she looked up and the cross was so big and incredible. She had a great day crawling around the cross.
The little girl smiled and crawled home. She could not wait to tell her parents all about her incredible adventure.
