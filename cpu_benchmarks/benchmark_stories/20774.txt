Once upon a time, there was a small boy who was very cheerful. He lived in a big city and he liked to explore. Every day, he would take a vehicle around town and he was always very curious. 
One day, he was taking the vehicle down a bumpy road when suddenly the vehicle began to pinch him. He was scared, but very curious too. The little boy kept pushing the vehicle for what seemed like hours until finally he stumbled upon a huge pond of water. 
The little boy was very excited. He quickly forgot about the pinch and jumped into the water. He splashed and laughed as he explored around the lake. 
The pinch had been a sign from the vehicle â€“ it wanted the little boy to find this lake and make a new discovery. The little boy was so cheerful to have found something new, and he smiled knowing that the pinch led him to an adventure.
