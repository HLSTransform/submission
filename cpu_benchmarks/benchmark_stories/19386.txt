Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three years old. One day, Lucy imagined she was in a forest with a big crystal. The crystal was very bright and sparkly. Suddenly, Lucy felt scared because she had never been in a forest before. She started to cry.
Just then, a fairy appeared. The fairy was wearing a sparkly dress and had a wand in her hand. She said, "Do not be scared, pretty Lucy". She waved her wand and the crystal changed color to pink. It started to sparkle even more. 
The fairy said, "Look, this pink crystal will protect you. You will be safe now." Lucy stopped crying and smiled. Then the fairy waved her wand sprinkle some fairy dust in the air and disappeared.
When Lucy looked back, the forest and the pink crystal had gone. She was back in her room. She felt safe and happy.
