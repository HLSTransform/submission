Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three years old. Every day she played in the garden.
One day, Lucy found a smelly towel in the garden. She picked it up and was determined to gain something from it. If she could make the smelly towel clean, maybe she could use it for something.
So Lucy tried to clean the towel. She washed it with soap, scrubbed it with a brush, and then rinsed it with water. The smelly towel was now clean and smelled much better!
Lucy was very happy that she had been able to gain a clean towel. She gathered some flowers and put them on the towel. Then she took the towel and ran home to show her mum what she had done. Her mum was so proud of her and said she could use it for picnics. 
Lucy was very pleased. She had worked hard, and she had been able to gain a clean towel.
