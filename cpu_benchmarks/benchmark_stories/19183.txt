Once there was a boy named Tim. Tim was sad and miserable. He did not have any friends. He liked to keep his toys on a bookshelf in his room. The bookshelf was big and had many toys.
One day, Tim saw a cat outside his window. The cat was lost and looked sad too. Tim wanted to be friends with the cat. He took the cat inside his house and gave it some food. The cat was happy and Tim was happy too.
But the cat liked to play with Tim's toys on the bookshelf. The cat knocked over the toys and broke them. Tim was very sad and angry. He took the cat back outside and said, "You cannot be my friend." Tim was alone again, and the cat was sad too.
