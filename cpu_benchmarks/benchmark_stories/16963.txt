Tom and Lily were twins who liked to sing. They wanted to be famous singers like the ones they saw on TV. They had a cord that they used as a microphone. They would take turns to sing and pretend they had a big audience.
One day, they saw a poster for a talent show at their school. They decided to sign up and sing together. They practiced every day with their cord. They sang loud and fast and made funny faces. They thought they were very good.
On the day of the show, they went on stage with their cord. They saw many other kids who had real instruments and costumes. They felt nervous. They started to sing, but they forgot some words and sang out of tune. The other kids laughed at them. They felt sad and ran off the stage.
Their teacher saw them crying and came to comfort them. She said, "Don't worry, Tom and Lily. Singing is a skill that you can improve. You just need to practice more and learn from others. You also need to sing with your heart and not just your voice. Singing is not about being famous, but about expressing yourself and making others happy."
Tom and Lily listened to their teacher and nodded. They realized they had been too proud and silly. They thanked their teacher and hugged each other. They decided to keep singing, but with more effort and joy. They learned that to be good at something, you need to work hard and be humble.
