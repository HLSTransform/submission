Once upon a time, there was a happy little puppy named Max. Max loved to play and run around in the park with his owner. One day, Max saw a big ball and he wanted to play with it, but it was too heavy for him to lift. Max was sad.
Suddenly, a big dog came and took Max's ball. Max tried to get it back, but the big dog was too strong. Max's owner came to help, but the big dog was too powerful. Max and his owner went home without the ball, feeling very sad.
From that day on, Max was always afraid to go to the park. He was scared that the big dog would come and take his toys again. Max's owner tried to make him happy, but Max was still scared. Max never played in the park again. The end.
