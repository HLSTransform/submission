Once upon a time, there was a farmer. His farm was very large, with lots of animals. One day, he decided to make a garden. He started by gathering shiny, thick rail to make it.
One day, he woke up to a big surprise! His rail had become thin and soft! The farmer was very happy. He used the rail to make a fence around the garden.
The fence looked amazing. He could now watch the animals, birds and butterflies that came to the garden to play and have fun. 
The fence was strong and the farmer was very proud of it. All his hard work was worth it. From then on, the farmer enjoyed his beautiful garden each and every day. The end.
