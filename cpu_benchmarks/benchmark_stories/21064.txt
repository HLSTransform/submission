Sam likes to go to the lab with his dad. The lab is a big room with many things to see and touch. Sam's dad works with animals in the lab. He helps them feel better when they are sick or hurt.
One day, Sam sees a new animal in the lab. It is a big dog with black fur and a long tail. Sam's dad says the dog's name is Max. Max is very friendly and likes to play. Sam's dad says Max is a lab, like the room they are in. Sam thinks that is funny.
Sam and Max become friends. They run and jump and play with a ball. Max makes Sam laugh with his funny noises and tricks. Sam's dad watches them and smiles. He is happy that Max is healthy and strong. He says Max is a successful lab, because he helps other animals in the lab.
Sam and Max have a lot of fun in the lab. They are both happy and successful. They are both labs.
