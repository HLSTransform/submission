Fred was a young boy of three. He liked to play and have fun. One day, Fred was getting dressed when he found a new shirt in his drawers. He put it on and it fit him perfectly. He was so excited to wear his brilliantly coloured new shirt.
The shirt was so bright, Fred felt like he was a superhero. He liked his new shirt so much, he even paraded around the kitchen to show it off to his mum and dad. His mum and dad smiled and said that the shirt was brilliant; it suited him perfectly. Fred smiled back and went back to playing.
He couldn't wait to show off his new shirt to all his friends. He was sure they would think it was brilliant too. Every time he put it on he felt special, like he could do anything.
And that's how Fred's new brilliant shirt fit into his life, making him feel like a superhero even at 3 years old.
