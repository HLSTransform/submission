Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and stuffed animals. One day, she went to the park with her mommy and daddy. While playing on the swings, she saw a patient dog who was waiting for his owner. 
Lily wanted to pet the dog, but he was too distant and wouldn't come close to her. She regretted not bringing any treats to give to the dog. So, she asked her mommy and daddy if they had any snacks. They gave her a biscuit, and Lily offered it to the dog. 
The dog happily ate the biscuit, and then he came closer to Lily. She was so happy that she could finally pet the dog. From then on, Lily always brought treats to the park so she could make friends with the patient dog. And she never regretted being kind to him. The end.
