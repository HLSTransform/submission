Once upon a time there was a special place in the woods. It was an incredible secret garden that only me and my best friend Candice knew about. We would always visit in the Summer and play games together.
Today it was a special day because we were going to make diaries! We wanted to write down all of our best Summer memories. Candice grabbed the paper and markers and suggested, "Let's find a spot to start writing".
Our special spot was under a big tree. I began writing while Candice drew pictures. Suddenly I started to worry, what if someone else found our secret garden? I asked Candice, "Should we stop writing so no one finds our spot?". She looked up and said, "No, let's keep going. This is our special place, no one else can come here". 
I was so relieved and we went back to writing and drawing. We made our diaries look incredible and filled them with wonderful memories. We knew our friendship and our special spot was safe!
