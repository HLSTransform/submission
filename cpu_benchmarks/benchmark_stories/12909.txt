Once upon a time there was a little girl called Sue. She was very hungry and always had an empty tummy. Today she was especially hungry so she decided to go to the park. She found a nice seat in the sunshine and sat down.
When she was sat down, Sue started to see all the exciting things happening. There were birds chirping and butterflies flying in the sky. One of the butterflies flew so close to Sue that she could almost feel it's wings. 
All of a sudden Sue saw something behind her. It was a big brown dog! The dog gave her a friendly wink and Sue was so excited that she smiled back. The dog was so warm and cuddly that Sue decided to give it a big hug.
At first, the dog was a little bit scared but before long it was happy to sit with her. Sue felt so happy to have a new friend. She gave the dog one more hug before getting up and letting it go. She said goodbye and waved as she went on her way, her tummy full and ready for an exciting day!
