Once upon a time there was a frog. He was very messy, with dirt on his head and ribbit everywhere. He wanted to talk but he didn't know how.
He hopped around looking for someone to talk to. He hopped through the forest and over the stream. He hopped past the trees and the bright flowers.
Suddenly he saw a little girl. She was in her garden playing with her toys. The frog hopped right up to her. He opened his mouth and said "ribbit". 
The girl was so surprised! She smiled and said "hello frog!". The frog was so happy that he could talk.
They talked and talked all day. They talked about the flowers, and the birds, and the trees. The frog never wanted to leave. The little girl and the frog were the best of friends.
