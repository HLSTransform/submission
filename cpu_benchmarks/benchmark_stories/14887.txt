Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to jump on her cushion and play with her toys. One day, Lily's mom spilled some water on the cushion and it became wet. Lily was sad because she couldn't jump on it anymore.
Lily's mom told her not to worry and that they would fix the cushion. She took it outside and put it in the sun to dry. Lily was happy to see her cushion getting better. 
Later that day, Lily and her mom went to the park. They saw a little boy who had fallen and hurt his knee. Lily's mom was very compassionate and helped the boy. She gave him a band-aid and a hug. Lily saw how kind her mom was and felt proud. 
When they got back home, Lily saw that her cushion was dry and ready to jump on again. She was so happy and grateful for her mom's help. She knew that her mom was always there to soak up her tears and make things better.
