Once upon a time there was a brave little Bertha. She wanted to join a race and decided to ask her mom. Bertha said, "Mom, can I join the race?" Her mom said, "Yes, I think it is a good idea."
Bertha was excited and went to the race. She saw so many people and was so happy to be part of it. As the race started, she ran as fast as she could. But she slipped and fell! Everyone was so sorry for her but Bertha said that it was ok.
When it was time for the winner to be announced, everyone admired Bertha. Even though she did not win, they all thought she was very brave to try. 
At the end, Bertha said to her mom "I am sorry that I lost the race, but I am happy I tried." Her mom said, "I am very proud of you and don't be sorry. You tried your best and that is all that matters."
