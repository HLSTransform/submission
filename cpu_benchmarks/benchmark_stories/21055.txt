Tom and Jen were playing in the bath. They liked to splash and make bubbles. Mom said they could stay a little longer, but soon it was time to get out.
"Come on, kids, it's getting late. I have your towels ready," Mom said.
Tom and Jen got out of the water and wrapped themselves in their towels. Tom had a blue towel and Jen had a pink one. They felt warm and cozy.
"Let's go to your room and put on your pajamas," Mom said.
But Tom had a naughty idea. He wanted to scare Jen. He hid behind the door and waited for Jen to come. He thought it would be funny.
Jen walked to the door, holding her towel. She did not see Tom. She was humming a song.
"Boo!" Tom shouted, jumping out from behind the door.
Jen screamed. She was scared. She dropped her towel and ran to Mom.
"Mom, Tom scared me!" Jen cried.
Mom hugged Jen and gave her a kiss. She was not happy with Tom.
"Tom, that was not nice. You made Jen scared. You should say sorry," Mom said.
Tom felt bad. He did not mean to make Jen scared. He just wanted to play.
"I'm sorry, Jen. I was just joking. Please don't be scared," Tom said.
Jen looked at Tom. She saw that he was sorry. She forgave him.
"It's okay, Tom. I'm not scared anymore. But don't do that again," Jen said.
Tom nodded. He gave Jen a hug. He picked up her towel and gave it to her.
"Here, Jen. This is your towel. It's pink and soft," Tom said.
Jen smiled. She took her towel and wrapped it around her. She felt warm and cozy again.
"Thank you, Tom. You are a good brother," Jen said.
Mom smiled too. She was glad that Tom and Jen made up. She took them to their room and helped them put on their pajamas. She tucked them in and kissed them good night.
"Sleep well, kids. I love you," Mom said.
Tom and Jen said, "I love you, Mom."
They closed their eyes and fell asleep. They dreamed of bubbles and songs. They were not scared anymore.
