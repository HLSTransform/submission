Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She wanted to go to the west. The west was a very quiet place, but she was excited. 
She started running to the west. She ran and ran until she could see the west. She got closer and closer, until she saw tall buildings and cars. Suddenly, she was scared. It was so loud and busy! 
She started to cry and scream. She wanted to go back home. A kind lady saw her crying and held her hand. She told the little girl that everything would be ok.
The kind lady took the little girl back home. The little girl felt safe in her home, and smiled.
The end.
