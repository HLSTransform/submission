Sara and Ben love to watch movies with popcorn. They sit on the sofa with a big bowl of popcorn and a blanket. They choose a movie with animals and cars. They are very happy.
But then, their dog Spot sees the popcorn. He likes popcorn too. He jumps on the sofa and tries to get some. Sara and Ben say, "No, Spot! This is our popcorn! Go away!" They push him off the sofa. Spot is sad and angry.
He waits until Sara and Ben are not looking. He runs to the sofa and grabs the bowl of popcorn. He runs away with it. He spreads the popcorn all over the floor. He eats some and plays with some. He makes a big mess.
Sara and Ben hear the noise. They turn around and see Spot and the popcorn. They are very angry. They shout, "Spot! Bad dog! Look what you did!" They get up and chase him. Spot runs away. He thinks it is a game.
They catch him and take the bowl away. They scold him and put him in his bed. They clean up the popcorn. They are very tired. They sit on the sofa again and watch the movie. They are not very happy.
Spot feels sorry. He knows he was naughty. He wants to say sorry. He gets out of his bed and goes to the sofa. He licks Sara and Ben's faces. He wags his tail. He looks at them with big eyes.
Sara and Ben see Spot. They are still angry, but they are also kind. They see that he is sorry. They pat his head and say, "OK, Spot. We forgive you. But don't do that again. And you can have some popcorn too. But only a little bit." They give him some popcorn. He eats it and smiles. He cuddles with them on the sofa. They are all happy. The end.
