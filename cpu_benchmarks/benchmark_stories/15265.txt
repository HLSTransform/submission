Once upon a time there was a mailman who was scared of something. He was not sure what it was, but he found himself shaking when he went on his mail route. One day he decided that he wanted to try and restore the happy feeling he once had before he was scared. 
So, he reached into his mail bag and pulled out a toy train. He then put in his pocket and took a deep breath. He ventured out and soon found himself feeling more relaxed. As he went around delivering mail, he pulled out the toy train and he chugged it along the ground. 
Soon, as he was smiling, singing and playing with the little toy train, other mailmen, who also were scared, joined him. They too all had small toys in their pockets and they began to restore their happy feeling too. All the mailmen smiled and laughed happily together. 
The mailman's mission was accomplished and they all returned to their mail route with a restored sense of joy and friendship.
