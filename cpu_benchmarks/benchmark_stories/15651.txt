Jimmy was very sad. He missed his mommy. His mommy always made the yummiest toast for breakfast. But this morning there was no toast.
Jimmy’s daddy walked into the kitchen and saw Jimmy. “Why are you so sad?” he asked. 
“I miss my toast”, Jimmy said.
Daddy smiled. “I know just what we can do”, he said. Daddy took out a large loaf of bread and put it into the toaster. Then he waited for the toast to be done.
Jimmy smiled. He was so excited. 
A few minutes later, the toast was ready. It was big, warm and tasty. Daddy put it onto a plate and Jimmy ate every last bite.
“That was delicious Daddy. I won’t miss my mommy’s toast anymore”, Jimmy said with a smile.
