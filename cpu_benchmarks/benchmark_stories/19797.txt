Once upon a time, there was a very sad little girl. She had purple arms and was always so sad. One day, she had a very big cry and it kept going and going. Then she felt something touch her arm. She looked around and saw her mom smiling at her. Her mom said, "It's okay, honey. I forgive you."
The little girl was so happy and hugged her mom so tight. She felt tears of joy on her cheeks and knew that the sadness was gone. She smiled and said, "I forgive you too!"
From that day on, the girl followed her mom's example and tried to forgive all the people around her. She never forgot the big purple arms of her mom. They reminded her that forgiveness was the best feeling in the world.
