Anna and Ben are playing in the garden. They see a cricket on the grass. It is green and shiny. It makes a loud noise with its legs.
"Look, a cricket!" Anna says. "I want to grab it."
She runs to the cricket and tries to catch it with her hand. But the cricket is fast and jumps away.
"Ha ha, you missed it!" Ben says. He also wants to grab the cricket. He chases it across the garden.
The cricket jumps into a flower pot. Anna and Ben follow it. They peek inside the pot. The cricket is hiding under a leaf.
"Shh, be quiet," Anna says. "Maybe it will come out."
They wait and watch. The sun is warm on their faces. They hear the cricket making noise again.
"There it is!" Ben says. He reaches into the pot and grabs the cricket. He holds it in his hand. It tickles his palm.
"Wow, you got it!" Anna says. She comes closer to see the cricket. It is still green and shiny. It stops making noise.
"Can I hold it too?" Anna asks.
"OK, but be gentle," Ben says. He gives the cricket to Anna. She holds it in her hand. It tickles her palm too.
They look at the cricket and smile. They are happy. They like the cricket.
