Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had an old blouse that she loved to wear. One day, Lily decided to play hide and seek with her friends. She found a good hiding spot behind a big tree. Her friends looked for her, but they couldn't find her. Lily giggled quietly while she hid. 
After a while, Lily got bored of hiding and wanted to join her friends. She came out from behind the tree, but her blouse got caught on a branch and ripped. Lily felt sad because she loved her old blouse. But her friends told her not to worry and they all went to play together. 
From that day on, Lily learned that it's okay if her clothes are old or get ripped. What's important is having fun with friends.
