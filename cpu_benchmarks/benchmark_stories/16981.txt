Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play soccer in the park. But they do not have good equipment. Their ball is old and flat. Their shoes are too small and hurt their feet.
One day, their mom says, "I have a surprise for you. We are going to buy new equipment for soccer. Come with me to the store."
Sara and Ben are very happy. They hop in the car and go to the store. The store is big and open. It has many things for soccer. Balls, shoes, nets, cones, jerseys, and more.
Mom says, "You can choose one thing each. What do you want?"
Sara says, "I want a new ball. A big and round and shiny ball. Like this one." She points to a red ball with white stars.
Ben says, "I want new shoes. Shoes that fit and are fast and cool. Like these ones." He shows a pair of blue shoes with yellow stripes.
Mom says, "Okay, those are good choices. Let's buy them and go to the park."
Sara and Ben are very excited. They thank mom and pay for their equipment. They run to the car and drive to the park. They can't wait to play soccer with their new equipment. They feel happy and proud.
