Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a big sack. He liked to play with his sack and put his toys in it. Tim had a friend named Sam. Sam liked to play with Tim and his sack.
One day, Tim and Sam wanted to see who could put the most toys in the sack. They were very competitive. Tim put in his toy car, and Sam put in his toy train. They kept putting toys in the sack until it was very full.
Then, Tim's mom said it was time to clean up. Tim and Sam did not want to stop playing, so they tried to ignore her. But Tim's mom said it again, "Time to clean up!" Tim and Sam knew they had to listen. They put the toys away and went inside for a snack.
