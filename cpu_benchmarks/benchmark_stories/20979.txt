John and Tom were walking together in the park one day. Tom spotted something strange up ahead and said, "John, let's go explore!"
Curious, John followed him. To their surprise, they discovered a wall. Tom said it was the biggest wall they had ever seen.
John thought this was really cool, so he tried to climb the wall. "Be careful!" Tom cried. But John was too far up to hear him.
When he got to the top, John realized he was stuck - the wall was too high to get down. He started to get scared, but then he noticed a door.
When he opened it, John was surprised to find a thoughtful old man inside. He asked the man if he could help him down. The man nodded and said, "Yes, but only if you do a favor for me."
John said, "Yes, of course!" but the man told him the favor was too difficult and John had to stay in his cave forever. John was very sad, but he had no choice.
John and Tom never saw each other again.
