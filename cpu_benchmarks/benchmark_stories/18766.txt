Lily liked to eat melon. She liked it so much that she always asked her mom for more. One day, her mom gave her a big melon and said, "This is for you, Lily. But you have to mind it well. Don't let it get smelly or bad. Eat it soon, okay?"
Lily was very happy. She said, "Thank you, mom. I will mind it well. I will eat it soon." She put the melon on the table and went to play with her toys.
But Lily forgot about the melon. She played for a long time. She played with her dolls, her blocks, her books, and her crayons. She had so much fun that she did not hear her mom calling her for lunch.
When Lily came to the table, she saw the melon. It was not big anymore. It was small and wrinkled. It had brown spots and flies on it. It was smelly and bad. Lily felt sad. She said, "Oh no, my melon. I did not mind it well. I did not eat it soon. Now it is smelly and bad. I can't eat it anymore."
Her mom hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. You made a mistake. But you can learn from it. Next time, when you get a melon, you have to mind it well. You have to eat it soon. Then it will be sweet and juicy and good. Do you understand?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, mom. I understand. I'm sorry, mom. I will mind it well next time. I will eat it soon." Her mom smiled and said, "That's good, Lily. I love you. Now, let's have some lunch. I have some soup and bread for you. And maybe, after lunch, we can get another melon for you. What do you think?"
Lily smiled and said, "I think that's great, mom. I love you too. And I love melon." She hugged her mom and they went to have lunch. Lily learned her lesson. She never let a melon get smelly or bad again. She always minded it well and ate it soon. And she always enjoyed it.
