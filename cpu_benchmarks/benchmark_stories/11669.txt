Once upon a time, there were two friends called Jim and Sam. Jim had an ordinary freezer. Sam asked him why he had it, and Jim said that he likes to store all of his food in it. 
Jim then asked Sam if he wanted to see what was inside it. Sam was very excited and said "yes". 
Jim opened the freezer, and Sam saw a huge ice-cream inside. He couldn't believe his eyes. Jim said, "Do you want some?" and Sam said, "Yes please!".
Jim offered Sam some of the ice-cream and he had a big smile on his face. Sam said, "Thank you!"
They both enjoyed the delicious ice-cream from the ordinary freezer. They had a great time together and both were happy. 
The end.
