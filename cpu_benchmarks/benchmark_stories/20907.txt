Emma was a clever young girl. She was always trying to help her mom in the house. One day, Emma decided to offer to clean the dishes. Her mom was so proud of her and said "Thank you, Emma! You're such a helpful girl." 
 
So Emma started to work. She put all the dishes in the sink and started to scrub them. Time flew away and after a while Emma looked around and saw that the table was so clean she hadn't finished with the dishes.
Confused, Emma asked her mom: "Where are the dishes?" Her mom replied: "I moved them to the other table and I thought you knew. Now the dishes are broken!" 
Emma felt so overwhelmed and sad. She had worked hard, but everything had gone wrong. In the end, Emma was so sad that she couldn't help her mom anymore.
