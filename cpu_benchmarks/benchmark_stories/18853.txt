Tom and Lily are twins. They like to play in the garden. One day, they see a big pile of dirt. They wonder what is inside.
"Let's dig!" Tom says. He takes a shovel and starts to scoop the dirt. Lily helps him. They work hard and have fun.
Soon, they find something round and brown. It is a potato. They feel happy and excited. They dig some more and find more potatoes.
"Wow, look at all these potatoes!" Lily says. "We can make a soup with them!"
"Or we can make fries!" Tom says. He likes fries a lot.
They put the potatoes in a basket and run to the house. They want to show their mom and dad. They feel proud of their discovery.
But on the way, they hear a loud bark. It is Rex, the neighbor's dog. He is big and scary. He sees the twins and the basket. He wants the potatoes. He runs after them.
Tom and Lily feel afraid and alert. They run faster and faster. They shout for help.
"Mom! Dad! Rex is chasing us!"
Their mom and dad hear them. They come out of the house. They see Rex and the basket. They yell at Rex and scare him away.
"Are you okay, kids?" their mom asks. She hugs them and checks them for injuries.
"We're okay, mom," Tom says. He holds the basket tight.
"We found potatoes in the garden," Lily says. She shows them the potatoes.
Their mom and dad smile and praise them. They take them and the basket inside. They wash the potatoes and cook them. They make a soup and some fries. They share them with the twins. They all enjoy the meal.
Tom and Lily feel happy and safe. They love their mom and dad. They love their potatoes. They love their garden. They hope to find more things to dig.
