Once upon a time, a strong chest sat in a room. Inside the chest was an important letter that needed to be mailed. 
A little boy wanted to help. He opened the chest, looked at the letter, and said, "I can mail it for you!" 
But his mom told him, "No! It's too important. You can't mail it. You're too small. It's too big a job for you. You might make a mistake."
The little boy was sad. He wanted to help out. He thought hard and came up with a plan. 
He said to his Mom, "I will make sure it's right. I'm strong now. I can do it!"
His Mom saw how strong the little boy had become, and finally said, "Okay, you can try."
The little boy was so excited. He carefully put the letter in the mailbox, and it was on its way. He felt proud of himself for being so strong and capable.
