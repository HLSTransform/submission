Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack. He wanted to know all about wheat. So he asked his mom to explain what wheat was.
His mom smiled and said, "Well wheat is a type of grain. It looks like this."
She showed him a picture of some wheat in a field. Jack then asked, "What do you do with wheat?"
His mom replied, "People use wheat to make flour, which is used to make bread and other things."
Jack thought for a moment. He was curious so he asked, "Can I plant some wheat?"
His mom said, "Of course you can! You just need to be patient. Plant the seeds in some soil and water them every day. Then you'll need to wait a few weeks until you can reap the wheat. When you do, you can make your own flour."
Jack was very excited. He thanked his mom and ran off to get started. He was determined to be patient and give it a try.
