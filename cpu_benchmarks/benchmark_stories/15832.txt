Mandy had a cup with her name on it. It was a pale blue mug with pretty flowers. She loved it so much.
One day, Mandy's mom said: "Let's write your name on this mug, Mandy."
Mandy was so excited. She grabbed a pen and wrote her very long name on the mug.
Mandy looked at her mug. "Mom, I love it!" she yelled.
Mandy's mom chuckled. "It looks great, Mandy," she said.
Mandy grabbed her mug and hugged it tight. From then on, whenever she sipped her favorite drinks, she was proud to drink from her mug with her name written on it.
