Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to bake cakes with his mommy. They would use a big mixer to mix the flour and sugar together. Timmy loved to help his mommy mix the batter.
One day, Timmy's mommy had to go to the store. She told Timmy not to touch the mixer while she was gone. But Timmy didn't listen. He started to play with the mixer and accidentally turned it on. The batter flew everywhere and made a big mess.
When Timmy's mommy came back, she saw the mess and felt very ashamed. She told Timmy that he should have listened to her. Timmy felt bad and said sorry.
In the end, Timmy and his mommy had to clean up the mess and didn't get to eat any cake. Timmy learned to always listen to his mommy and not to play with the mixer.
