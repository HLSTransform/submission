Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Bobo. Bobo was always ready to play and have fun. One day, he saw a big step in the park. He thought it would be fun to jump on it.
Bobo tried to settle near the step, but he was too excited. He ran around and around, not paying attention to where he was going. He didn't see the big hole near the step.
Bobo kept playing near the step, not knowing about the hole. He was so happy and ready to jump. But then, Bobo fell into the hole. He couldn't get out and he was very sad. The fun day at the park had a bad ending for poor Bobo.
