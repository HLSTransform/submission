Once upon a time, there was a lovely cow named Betsy. Betsy loved to give milk to all the kids in the farm. One day, a thunderstorm struck the farm and scared Betsy. She ran away from the farm and got lost in the woods.
A little girl named Lily saw Betsy and asked, "Are you lost?" Betsy mooed and Lily understood that she was lost. "Don't worry, I'll help you find your way back home," Lily said.
Lily walked with Betsy for a long time until they finally found the farm. Betsy was so happy to be back home and gave Lily a lot of milk. "Thank you for helping me," Betsy said to Lily. "You're welcome," Lily replied with a smile.
