Ben and Sam are friends. They like to play golf in the park. Golf is a game with a stick and a ball. They hit the ball with the stick and try to make it go in a hole.
One day, they see a big pond in the park. There are boats on the pond. The boats have sails. The sails are like big sheets that catch the wind. The wind makes the boats move on the water.
"Look, Sam, boats!" Ben says. "Let's go and see them."
"OK, Ben, but we have to be careful. The pond is deep and wet," Sam says.
They run to the pond and watch the boats. They see different colors and shapes of sails. Some are red, some are blue, some are yellow. Some are square, some are triangle, some are circle.
"Wow, they are so pretty!" Ben says. "I wish we had a boat."
"Me too," Sam says. "Maybe we can make one."
They look around and see some things they can use. They find a big box, a long stick, a rope, and a sheet. They put the box on the water. They tie the stick to the box with the rope. They tie the sheet to the stick with the rope. They have made a boat with a sail.
"Look, Sam, we have a boat!" Ben says. "Let's sail on the pond."
"OK, Ben, but we have to be careful. The wind is strong and the water is wavy," Sam says.
They get in the box and hold the stick. The wind blows the sheet and the boat moves on the water. They feel happy and excited. They sail on the pond and have fun. They forget about golf for a while. They are sailors.
