One day, Rover took his leash and went on a walk. Everywhere he went, he left a messy trail behind him. He trotted around in the park, over the bridge, and he even dug in the mud. But, he wasn't paying attention to where he was going. 
Suddenly, there was a loud noise. It scared Rover and he tried to part, but he couldn't. Rover was so scared he was shaking and he couldn't move his legs. He didn't know what to do.
Rover looked around and saw that he was stuck! His leash had gotten tangled around a tree and he couldn't get free. Even with all his wiggling and tugging.
Then, Rover heard a voice. It was his owner, calling to him. His owner was nearby and he had noticed that Rover had gotten himself into a complicated mess. With some help, his owner was able to untangle Rover and get him back on track.
The moral of this story is that it's important to pay attention to where you're going and not to get too distracted by other things, or you can get into a messy situation.
