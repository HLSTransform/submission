Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit named Benny. Benny loved to hop and play all day long. One day, Benny saw a shiny piece of jewelry on the ground. He picked it up and put it on his neck. He felt so happy and proud of himself. 
But then, he saw his friends, the squirrels, looking weak and sad. Benny realized that he had been selfish and didn't share his jewelry with his friends. So, he decided to bow his head and apologize to his friends. 
From that day on, Benny learned that sharing is important and it's not nice to make others feel weak or left out. He made sure to always share his toys and treats with his friends, and they all lived happily ever after.
