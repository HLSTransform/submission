Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named Cara. She had a pot, and she loved it very much. Everywhere she went, she brought the pot with her.
One day, Cara needed to climb a tall hill. She asked for help, but no one answered. "How am I going to climb this hill with my pot?" she thought.
Just then, a little bird flew over and said, "I will support you, Cara! I can help you get to the top of the hill with your pot." Cara smiled and thanked the little bird.
The little bird helped Cara all the way to the top of the hill. Cara was so happy and grateful. She thanked the bird and said, "You are so good to help me with my pot.”
The little bird smiled and said, "It is important to always help others. It makes us feel good and makes the world a better place.”
Cara understood and said, “I will always try to help people and support them when I can.”
Moral of the story: The importance of supporting and helping other people.
