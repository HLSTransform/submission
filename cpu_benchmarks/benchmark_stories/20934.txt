Billy was very excited. He had been waiting all morning for his Daddy to take him to the park. Finally the time had come. 
Daddy said to Billy, "Are you ready to go?"
Billy grinned and said, "Yes Daddy, let's go!"
Daddy chuckled and said, "That sounds good! Let's go."
They went outside, and Daddy said, "Look up!"
Billy looked up, and he saw a big helicopter flying in the sky. He said, "Wow Daddy, what's that?"
Daddy said, "That's a helicopter. It carries people around."
Billy was fascinated. He watched the helicopter carrying people and flying away. After awhile, he got a little sleepy, and so Daddy put him in the car. 
They drove to the park and soon Billy was awake again. He couldn't wait to explore and have fun with Daddy.
