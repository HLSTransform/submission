Once upon a time, there was a man who loved to drive his car. He would go on great adventures and see many things. One day, he saw a goat on the side of the road. The goat looked at him with big eyes and the man thought it was so cute. He stopped his car and got out to say hello to the goat. The goat was friendly and let the man pet him. The man thought it was a great day because he got to meet a new friend. From then on, every time the man went for a drive, he would look for the goat and say hello. The end.
