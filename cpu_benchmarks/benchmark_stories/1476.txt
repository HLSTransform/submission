Once upon a time, there was a track. The track was very attractive. Every day, many little children would come and play on the track. 
One day, a group of children were playing a game. It was called "Number Track". They had to count from 1 to 10 and race around the track. 
The first little boy had a head start, but the second was very fast. He passed the first little boy and ran all the way around the track. 
The group of children cheered for the little boy and hugged him. Together, they all played the Number Track game until it was time to go home. 
The children had so much fun on the Number Track, and they went home tired and happy.
