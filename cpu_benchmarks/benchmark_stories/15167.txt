Once there was a little girl named Jane who loved to guess things. She was always playing guessing games, asking what something was or who was behind the door.
One day she asked her mom: "What's in the box?" Mom smiled and said, "You have to guess!"
Jane tried to guess, but she couldn't figure it out. There was only silence. She waited, but the silence continued.
Suddenly, her mom said, "It's a spicy noodle dish!" Now Jane was excited. She quickly opened the box and saw a plate of hot, spicy noodles. She laughed, and they ate the noodles together.
At the end of the meal, Jane said, "That was a delicious surprise!" Her mom smiled and said, "I guess it was!"
