Tom and Mia are twins. They like to play in the park with their mom. Mom says they have to behave and listen to her. She says it is important to be safe and kind.
One day, they see a big slide in the park. Tom and Mia want to go on the slide. They run to the slide and wait for their turn. Mom follows them and watches them.
"Can I go first?" Tom asks Mia.
"No, I want to go first!" Mia says.
They start to argue and push each other. Mom tells them to stop and share. She says they have to behave and take turns.
But Tom and Mia do not listen. They keep fighting and pushing. They do not see the other kids on the slide. They do not see the slide is wet and slippery.
Suddenly, Tom and Mia both fall from the slide. They fall hard and hurt themselves. They cry and scream. Mom runs to them and hugs them. She checks if they are okay. She says they have to be careful and not fight.
Tom and Mia are sorry. They say they are sorry to each other and to Mom. They say they will behave and share next time. Mom says she loves them and kisses them. She says they are important to her. She says they can go on the slide again, but only if they are nice and safe. Tom and Mia nod and smile. They hug Mom and say they love her too. They go on the slide again, but this time they behave and have fun.
