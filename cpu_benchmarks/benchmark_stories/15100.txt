Once upon a time there was a little girl called Evie. She liked playing with her toys and going on adventures with her friends.
Today was special; Evie was going to go to church with her family. She was so excited!
When they arrived at the church, her family said good morning to everyone they saw. Evie was shy and felt a bit embarrassed, but she waved hello too. After saying hello to everyone, they went inside the church.
Evie wasn't sure what to do, until she heard someone singing and clapping their hands. She soon realized the clapping was a sign to join in, so she began clapping along. The song soon became familiar and Evie's shyness began to become less and less.
When the singing was over, Evie felt so proud of herself. Her shyness had become joy and she looked forward to coming back to church with her family again soon.
