Once upon a time, there was a cute little rabbit named Benny. Benny loved to play with his friends in the park. One day, they decided to go to the stadium to watch a big game. Benny was very excited because he had never been to the stadium before.
When they got to the stadium, they saw lots of people cheering and clapping. Benny's friend asked him if he wanted to take a picture with the mascot. Benny said yes and they went to take a picture with the big, furry mascot.
After the game, Benny and his friends went home, tired but happy. Benny couldn't stop talking about how much fun he had at the stadium. He couldn't wait to go back and take more pictures with the cute mascot.
