Lily and Ben love to race. They race on their bikes, they race on their feet, they race on their sleds. They always have fun, but they also want to win. One day, they go to the beach with their mom and dad. They see a big boat that takes people to see whales. They want to go on the boat and race to see who can find a whale first.
Mom and dad buy tickets for the boat and they all get on. Lily and Ben run to the front of the boat and look at the water. They see many fish and birds, but no whales. They keep looking and looking, but they don't see any. They start to feel bored and sad. They want to see a whale and win the race.
Then, they hear a loud splash. They turn around and see a huge whale jumping out of the water. It is gray and white and has a big tail. It looks friendly and happy. Lily and Ben are amazed and excited. They both point at the whale and shout, "I see it, I see it, I win, I win!"
But the whale is not happy to see them. The whale thinks they are rude and noisy. The whale does not like to be pointed at and shouted at. The whale gets angry and decides to teach them a lesson. The whale swims closer to the boat and slaps its tail on the water. The water splashes all over the boat and makes everyone wet. Lily and Ben get scared and cry. They run to their mom and dad and hug them. They say they are sorry and they don't want to race anymore. They just want to go home.
The whale sees them crying and feels sorry for them. The whale knows they are just kids and they don't know better. The whale swims away and leaves them alone. The boat turns around and goes back to the shore. Lily and Ben learn their lesson. They learn to be quiet and respectful when they see animals. They learn that racing is not always fun and that sometimes it is better to share and enjoy. They also learn that whales are not friendly and that they should stay away from them. They never want to see a whale again. The end.
