Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy bunny that she loved very much. One day, Lily went to the park to play. She left her bunny on a bench and went to play on the swings. 
A little boy named Max saw the bunny and thought it was lost. He picked it up and went to look for the owner. When he saw Lily, he said, "Excuse me, is this bunny yours?" 
Lily was so excited to see her bunny. She said, "Yes, that's mine! It belongs to me." Max gave the bunny back to Lily and they became friends. They played together and had fun on the playground. 
From that day on, Lily and Max played together every day. They shared their toys and had lots of fun. Lily was happy to have her bunny back and she was grateful to have a new friend.
