Once upon a time, there was a big carpet in a small house. A little boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, played on the carpet every day. They loved to run and jump on it.
One day, Tim spilled juice on the carpet. The carpet started to rot and smell bad. Tim's mom saw the mess and said, "Oh no, the carpet is rotting! Tim, you need to clean this up."
Tim felt sorry and said, "I'm sorry, Mom. I will clean it up." So Tim and Spot worked together to clean the rotting carpet. They scrubbed and scrubbed until the carpet was clean and smelled good again.
Tim's mom was happy and said, "Thank you, Tim and Spot, for cleaning the carpet." Tim and Spot smiled, knowing they had fixed their mistake. From that day on, they were more careful when playing on the carpet.
