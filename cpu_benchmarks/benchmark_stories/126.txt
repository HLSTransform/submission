Once upon a time, there was a big garage. It was where Daddy parked his car. One day, Mommy told Daddy that they needed more space in the garage. Daddy said he would increase the size of the garage. 
The next day, Daddy got to work. He used his tools to make the garage bigger. He worked very hard all day. When he was done, Mommy was very happy. She said, "Wow, Daddy! The garage is so much bigger now!" 
That night, Daddy went to bed feeling very alert. He was happy that he could make Mommy happy by increasing the size of the garage. He knew that they would have more space for their things now. The end.
