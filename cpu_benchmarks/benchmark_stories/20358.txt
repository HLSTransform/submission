Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toy cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They pretend to drive them on the floor, on the sofa, on the table.
One day, they find a big box in the garage. It is their dad's old car. It is red and shiny, but it does not work. Anna and Ben are curious. They want to see inside the car. They climb into the box and sit on the seats. They feel adventurous.
They see a wheel, some buttons, some levers, and a key. They touch everything. They turn the wheel, they push the buttons, they pull the levers. They pretend to drive the car. They make noises with their mouths. Vroom, vroom, beep, beep!
They see the key in the ignition. They wonder what it does. Ben reaches for the key with his hand. He turns it. Suddenly, the car makes a loud noise. It starts to move. Anna and Ben are scared. They scream. They want to stop the car.
Their dad hears the noise. He runs to the garage. He sees the car rolling out of the box. He runs after it. He catches the car and stops it. He opens the door and takes out Anna and Ben. He hugs them and scolds them. He tells them not to play with the car. He tells them it is dangerous.
Anna and Ben are sorry. They say they are sorry. They promise not to play with the car again. They go back to their toy cars. They play with them safely. They are still adventurous, but they are also careful.
