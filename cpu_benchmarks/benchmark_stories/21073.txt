Lily and Sam were friends who liked to play together. They both knew how to sign, because Lily's mom was deaf. They used their hands to make shapes and letters and talk to each other.
One day, they found a big palm tree in the park. It had many green leaves and yellow fruits. Lily and Sam wanted to climb the tree and pick some fruits. They signed to each other, "Let's go up!"
But when they reached the top, they saw only one fruit left. It was big and juicy and looked very yummy. Lily and Sam both reached for it at the same time. They signed to each other, "I want it! It's mine!"
They started to pull and tug and push each other. They were both selfish and did not want to share. They forgot to be careful and hold on to the tree. They lost their balance and fell down.
They landed on the ground with a thud. They both cried and hurt themselves. They had bruises and scratches and bumps. The fruit rolled away and was eaten by a monkey. Lily and Sam looked at each other and felt sorry. They signed to each other, "I'm sorry. I was selfish. Are you okay?"
But it was too late. They had lost their friend and their fruit. They learned a hard lesson that day. They wished they had been kind and generous instead.
