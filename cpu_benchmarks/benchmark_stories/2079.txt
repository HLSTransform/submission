Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the rain. One day, it rained so much that the whole street was covered in water. Lily put on her raincoat and boots and jumped in the puddles. 
After playing in the rain, Lily went inside to have dinner with her family. They had fried chicken with oil on it. Lily loved the taste of the crispy chicken. 
But Lily's little brother, Jake, was jealous of her because she got the biggest piece of chicken with the most oil on it. Lily shared her chicken with Jake and they both were happy. And then, it started to rain again. They ran outside to play in the rain together.
