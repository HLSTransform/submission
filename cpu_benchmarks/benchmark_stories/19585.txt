Once upon a time, there was a brave True. He wanted to decorate his house for Summer. He wanted it to look real nice.
True worked very hard. He picked pretty flowers for the windows and a bright sun for the door. He hung colorful stars around the walls.
Finally he was finished and he was very, very proud. He could see that his house looked better than ever. True smiled and said, "This is the best house ever!" 
He was so happy that he decided to invite all of his friends to come over and celebrate. They all admired his house and said it was the most beautiful house they had ever seen. True was so proud.
From that day onward, True was always full of pride. He was always working hard to make his house look more amazing. True was the best decorator around and his friends were very happy.
