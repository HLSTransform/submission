Once there was a boy called Dave. He liked to jog in the park. One day, it was raining but he wanted to go to the park anyway.
So, Dave put on his boots and went outside. He saw lots of puddles in the park. Dave started to jog around the puddles. He was having lots of fun.
But then, Dave slipped and fell into one of the puddles! He was so wet and cold and started to cry. It was a very bad day. 
Dave had to go home straight away. He was still wet and cold. He had to tell his mom what happened. She was very upset.
Dave learnt his lesson and never jogged in the park again when it was raining.
