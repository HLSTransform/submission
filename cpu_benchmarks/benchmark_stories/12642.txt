Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to draw. He would draw all day long, and his mommy would always say, "Timmy, you're going to be an artist someday!"
One day, Timmy was drawing a big rhinoceros when his mommy came into the room. "Wow, Timmy, that's amazing!" she said.
Timmy smiled and said, "I want to write a story about a rhinoceros who was too hot."
His mommy smiled and said, "That's a great idea! But remember, Timmy, it's important to always stay cool and not let our emotions get the best of us."
Later that day, Timmy finished his story and showed it to his mommy. She read it and said, "Timmy, this is wonderful! And you know what? You're going to be a great writer someday too!"
