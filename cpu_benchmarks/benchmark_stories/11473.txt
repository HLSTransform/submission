Kiki and Bobo were best friends who liked to do everything together. One day, they decided to make something special with glue.
Kiki said, “Let’s make something that only we know about.”
Bobo asked, “What should we make?”
Kiki replied, “Let’s make a secret box! We can put treasures in it and make a hiding place for them.”
They got out the glue and started making the box. Kiki found some bits and pieces that belonged to her and put them inside the box. Bobo did the same and soon the box was full.
When the box was complete, Kiki said, “Our secret box is ready! We can hide it somewhere secret and no one can find it.”
So, that’s what they did. They found a hidden spot in the garden and buried the box there.
“Now the treasures belong to us and no one else can find them,” Kiki said with a smile.
