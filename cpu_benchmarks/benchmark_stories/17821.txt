Once upon a time there was a silly duck. He wanted to solve a problem, but he didn't know how. He asked all the other animals for help, but none of them knew what to do. 
The duck thought and thought about how to solve the problem. Then he finally had an idea! He ran to a pond nearby and got a big bucket of water. 
The duck poured the water all over the problem. Then he waited. Soon the problem started to get smaller and smaller. It was no longer a problem! Everyone was so happy. 
The silly duck had solved the problem. All the animals cheered and thanked him for his hard work. The duck was so proud. He had done it! He had solved the problem with a bucket of water.
