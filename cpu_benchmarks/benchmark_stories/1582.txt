Once upon a time, there was a little squirrel named Sammy. Sammy loved to play with his acorn friends in the forest. One day, while playing, Sammy found a big, shiny acorn. He was so happy and wanted to keep it forever.
But as Sammy was running back to his tree, he saw a big, scary bird. Sammy was so fearful that he dropped his shiny acorn and ran away. When he got back to his tree, he realized that he lost his other acorns too.
Sammy felt sad and wanted his acorns back. Then he remembered something his mama taught him: "If you want things to change, you have to change too." So, Sammy decided to be brave and go back to where he dropped his acorns.
When Sammy got there, he saw that the big, scary bird was gone. He searched and found all of his acorns, including the shiny one he dropped. Sammy learned that sometimes we have to be brave and face our fears to get what we want.
