Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lily. She was 3 years old and always loved playing with her toys.
One day, Lily was in the toilet and saw something weird. She did not know what it was and asked her mummy.
Mummy said, "Oh, Lily! That's a spider. Don't worry, it is not dangerous."
Lily was still scared and asked, "What does it do in the toilet? That's weird!"
Mummy laughed and said, "Spiders like to eat the bugs in the bathroom. That's why it's in there!"
Lily was curious and wanted to know more. She asked, "Can I help it do its job?" 
Mummy smiled and said, "No, sweetheart. That's okay. The spider knows what is best. Just let it do its own thing and it will be fine."
Lily thought that was nice and decided to watch the spider instead of playing with her toys. She thought it was cool how the spider can do its job all on its own.
