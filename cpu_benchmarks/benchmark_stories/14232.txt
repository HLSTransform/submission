Once upon a time there lived a little girl named Gabby. Gabby wanted a new dress for her birthday, but she knew it was too expensive. She asked her mom for one but when her mom said no Gabby just shrugged.
Later that night, Gabby had a great idea! She snuck into her mom's room and grabbed some of her mom's clothes. She cut them up and sewed them all together. She made a beautiful, new dress out of her mom's old clothes.
The dress looked so special, but it also felt a bit strange. That's when Gabby noticed that the fabric was different. It felt a lot softer than normal fabric and it shined in the light. She looked closely and saw that the fabric was made out of skin!
Gabby was so surprised and happy, she ran outside and showed everyone her new dress. No one else had a dress like hers. Even though it was made from expensive skin, Gabby's new dress felt like the best birthday present ever.
