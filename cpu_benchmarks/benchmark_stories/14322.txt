Once there was a little girl named Jane. She was only three years old, and she loved driving in her toy car. Every day, her dad would take her for a drive in the park.
One day, her dad brought her a special rope. It was the most beautiful purple rope that Jane had ever seen! She was so excited that she asked her dad if they could go for a drive and bring her rope with them.
So they drove to the park. Jane played with her rope while they drove. She made all sorts of fun shapes with her rope. When they reached the park, Jane took her rope and played with it on the grass.
She made her rope twist and turn, and even jumped rope with it! She was having so much fun that she didn't want to go home. But when the sun went down, the little girl and her purple rope had to go back home.
