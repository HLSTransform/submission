Once upon a time, there was a wise owl who lived on a big tree. He loved to sit on his porch and watch the world go by. One day, a little rabbit came to visit him.
"Hello, Mr. Owl!" said the little rabbit. "What are you doing?"
"I'm just sitting on my porch and enjoying the view," replied the wise owl.
"I wish I could see the world like you do," said the little rabbit.
"You can," said the wise owl. "Just remember to always drive your own life. Don't let others tell you what to do."
The little rabbit thought about what the wise owl said and thanked him for the advice. From that day on, the little rabbit drove his own life and made his own choices. And he lived happily ever after.
