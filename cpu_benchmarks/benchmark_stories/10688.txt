Once upon a time there was a little boy named Carl. Every morning, Carl's mom would tell him to clean up his room. But every morning Carl would forget, so one morning his mom decided to take him to a university to teach him a lesson. 
When they got to the university, Carl was amazed. Everywhere he looked there were students walking around and a big library filled with books. But Carl still hadn't learned his lesson, so his mom sat him down in front of a pile of papers. 
'Carl,' she said, 'you see all this mess? It's terrible, isn't it? It takes forever to clean up. I want you to remember this the next time I ask you to clean your own room!' 
Carl nodded. He knew now that he had to remember to clean up his own room. His mom and Carl left the university and Carl was happy to go home and start cleaning. 
The End.
