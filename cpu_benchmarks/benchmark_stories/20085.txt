Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the rain, but her mom always told her to be careful. "If you run too fast, you might slip and fall," her mom would say.
One day, Lily was playing outside with her friends. They were all running around and having fun. Lily was running too fast and she slipped and fell. She got all wet and muddy. Her friends laughed at her.
Lily felt sad and embarrassed. She knew she didn't behave properly by running too fast. From then on, she learned to slow down and be careful when she played outside. She didn't want to get wet and muddy again.
