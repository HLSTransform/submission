Mum and Jack were walking in the park. Jack was so excited! "What are we here for?" he said, eyes wide and filled with wonder. 
"We're here to watch the parade," Mum said. "Lots of people will be marching and it will be really festive!"
Jack couldn't wait! The parade started and there was music, bright flags and throngs of people cheering. He watched with awe and delight. 
Then suddenly, it was over. 
"What happened?" Jack asked, disappointed. 
Mum explained that the people were celebrating a victory. Everyone was very happy and feeling a bit dizzy. 
Jack thought about that and smiled, understanding what had happened. Then, he cheered too and smiled from ear to ear. He had been part of the victory too.
