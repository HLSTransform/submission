Ben and Mia were twins who liked to play outside. They had a big yard with a swing, a slide and a sandbox. They also had a dog named Spot who was very obedient and followed them everywhere.
One day, the sky was dark and the wind was loud. Their mom told them to come inside because there was a storm coming. She said it was dangerous to stay outside when there was lightning and thunder. Ben and Mia did not want to stop playing, so they did not listen to their mom. They thought the storm would be fun to watch.
They ran to the swing and pushed each other higher and higher. Spot barked and wagged his tail, but he also looked at the sky and whimpered. He knew the storm was bad and he wanted to go inside with their mom. He tried to pull Ben and Mia by their clothes, but they ignored him.
Suddenly, they heard a loud boom and saw a bright flash. A big bolt of lightning hit the swing and made it catch fire. Ben and Mia screamed and jumped off the swing. They were scared and hurt. They ran to the house, but the door was locked. Their mom had gone to the basement to be safe from the storm. She did not hear them knocking and crying.
Spot was still outside with them. He was brave and loyal. He tried to help Ben and Mia. He ran to the slide and barked. He wanted them to follow him and hide under the slide. It was made of plastic and metal, so it would not burn. Ben and Mia did not understand what Spot was saying. They were too busy looking for their mom. They did not see the second bolt of lightning that hit the sandbox. They did not see the sparks that flew to the slide. They did not see the fire that spread to the slide. They did not see Spot who ran to the slide and tried to save them. They did not see anything. They only felt pain.
