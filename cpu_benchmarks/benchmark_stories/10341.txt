Tom and Sue were playing in the garden. They liked to dig and make mud pies. They found an old ashtray in the dirt. It was blue and round and had a picture of a fish on it.
"Look, I found a fish bowl!" Tom said. He filled the ashtray with water and put some grass and stones in it.
"No, it's not a fish bowl, it's an ashtray. My dad has one like that. He puts his smokes in it." Sue said. She took the ashtray from Tom and dumped the water out.
"Hey, give it back! I want to play with it!" Tom said. He grabbed the ashtray from Sue and ran away.
Sue chased him and tried to get it back. They ran around the garden and splashed in the puddles. They got very wet and dirty. The ashtray got soaked too.
"Stop, stop, you're making a mess!" Mom said. She came out of the house and saw them. She was not happy. She took the ashtray from them and threw it in the trash.
"That's not a toy, that's a nasty thing. You shouldn't play with it. And look at you, you're soaked and muddy. Come inside and get cleaned up." Mom said.
Tom and Sue followed Mom inside. They were sad and sorry. They liked the blue ashtray. They wanted to play with it more. But they knew they did something bad. They said sorry to Mom and hugged her. Mom forgave them and gave them a bath. She told them a story about a real fish bowl and a real fish. Tom and Sue liked the story. They forgot about the ashtray. They were happy again.
