Once upon a time, there was a bad teaspoon. It was very naughty and always getting into trouble! One day, the teaspoon was playing near a river. It was having great fun, when it accidentally dropped a rock in the river and it made a big splash. Suddenly, the teaspoon heard a noise. It was a voice - a voice that was recording what had happened! 
The teaspoon was very scared. It looked around, and it saw a camera. A man was standing with the camera, and he had recorded the teaspoon's naughty behaviour! The teaspoon felt very embarrassed.
The man said "I'm going to show this to your mummy, we'll see what she says!" The teaspoon started to cry, it was too scared to go home. But then the man said "I won't tell your mummy, as long as you never do naughty things near the river again".
The teaspoon was so relieved. It promised never to do bad things near the river again and thanked the man for being so kind. The teaspoon was very happy and it went home.
 
And from that day onward, the teaspoon was a very good teaspoon. It never did anything naughty ever again!
