Tom and Anna are brother and sister. They like to play with their toys in their room. One day, they find a big jar of money on the shelf. They are very happy and excited.
They want to buy some candy and stickers with the money. But they do not know how much money they have. They cannot count very well. They decide to ask their mom to tell them.
They run to the kitchen where their mom is making lunch. They show her the jar of money and ask her to tell them how much it is. Their mom is surprised and angry. She says, "Where did you get this money? This is not your money. This is our money. We need it to pay for food and clothes and bills. We do not have a lot of money. We have to be tight with our money. You cannot take it and buy candy and stickers. That is very naughty."
Tom and Anna feel sad and sorry. They did not know that the money was not theirs. They did not know that their mom and dad had to be tight with their money. They say, "We are sorry, mom. We did not mean to be naughty. We did not know. We will put the money back on the shelf. We do not need candy and stickers. We love you, mom."
Their mom hugs them and says, "I love you too, Tom and Anna. I know you did not know. But you have to ask before you take something that is not yours. And you have to learn to be tight with your money too. Money is not for playing. It is for buying things we need. Maybe one day, when we have some extra money, we can buy some candy and stickers as a treat. But not today. Today, we have lunch. Come on, let's eat."
