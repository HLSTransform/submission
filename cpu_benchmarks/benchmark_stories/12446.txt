Tom and Lily were brother and sister. They liked to play and joke with each other. One day, they were bored at home. They decided to play a game with the couch.
"Let's pretend the couch is a boat," Tom said. "We can sail to a faraway island and have fun."
"Okay," Lily said. "But you have to be the captain and I have to be the pirate. I will try to steal your boat."
They climbed on the couch and pretended to sail. Tom had a hat and a map. Lily had a scarf and a sword. They made noises and faces.
"Ahoy, matey!" Lily shouted. "I am the clever pirate Lily. I will take your boat and your treasure."
"No, you won't," Tom said. "I am the brave captain Tom. I will fight you and keep my boat and my treasure."
They swung their sword and map at each other. They laughed and joked. They had fun.
But they did not see that their mom was coming. She had a tray with cookies and milk. She wanted to surprise them with a snack. She did not know they were playing on the couch.
She walked into the living room and saw them. She was angry. She dropped the tray. The cookies and milk spilled on the floor.
"Tom! Lily!" she yelled. "What are you doing? You are making a mess. You are ruining the couch. You are not supposed to play on the couch. You are in big trouble."
Tom and Lily stopped playing. They looked at their mom. They looked at the floor. They looked at the couch. They were scared. They were sorry. They did not mean to make their mom angry. They did not mean to ruin the couch. They did not mean to spill the cookies and milk.
They tried to say sorry. But their mom did not listen. She took them by the hand and dragged them to their room. She locked the door. She said they had to stay there until dinner. She said they had to think about what they did. She said they had to learn their lesson.
Tom and Lily cried. They hugged each other. They wished they did not play on the couch. They wished they did not joke so much. They wished they had their cookies and milk. They wished their mom was not angry. They wished they could play again.
But they could not. They had to stay in their room. They had to wait for dinner. They had to be quiet. They had no fun.
The end.
