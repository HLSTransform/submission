Anna likes to read novels. Novels are books with many pages and stories. Anna has a novel that is very popular. Many people want to read it. It is about a girl who goes to a magic school.
One day, Anna goes to the park with her novel. She finds a nice bench under a tree. She opens her novel and starts to read. She turns the pages and follows the story. She is very happy.
But then, a boy comes to the bench. He sees Anna's novel and says, "Hey, that is my novel! Give it to me!"
Anna is surprised and scared. She says, "No, this is my novel! I bought it with my money!"
The boy is angry and tries to grab the novel. He pulls and pulls. Anna holds and holds. The novel is torn in half. The pages fly in the air.
Anna and the boy are both sad and sorry. They look at the broken novel and cry. They say, "We are sorry, novel. We are sorry, each other."
They hug and make up. They decide to share the novel. They take one half each and sit on the bench. They read the novel together and become friends. They are happy.
