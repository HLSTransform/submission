Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the sun, but it was very hot. His mom told him to drink lots of water to stay cool. Timmy liked to play with his toy cars and make loud "vroom vroom" noises. 
One day, Timmy and his mom went to the park. They played on the swings and the slide. But when it was time to go home, Timmy didn't want to leave. He wanted to stay and play more. His mom said they had to go because it was getting late and they needed to eat dinner. 
Timmy was sad to leave the park, but he was also hungry. When they got home, his mom made him a delicious meal. Timmy felt better and went to bed happy, dreaming of playing in the park again.
