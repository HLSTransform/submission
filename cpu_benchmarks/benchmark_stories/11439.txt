Once upon a time there was a very compassionate man. He loved animals, and he was always helpful to others.
One day, he heard a loud screaming coming from the woods close-by. He rushed over to see what was happening. He came upon an animal stuck in a giant spider web. The poor creature was scared and in pain.
The man felt so sorry for the animal. Even though it was dangerous, he carefully pulled away the web and freed the animal. He then put the poor creature in his pocket and took it home. Even though he was being kind, he was still worried about the price he might have to pay.
 
Once home, he placed the animal in an old shoebox and put a blanket on top. He wanted to keep the creature safe, but he wasn't sure what he should do next.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a giant wolf appeared. It jumped up and started to roar. The man was terrified and started to scream. The animal in the old shoebox was so scared it started to scream too.
The compassionate man tried to fight back the wolf within him, but it was too late. The wolf snatched the creature from its shoebox and took off. The compassionate man screamed in pain and sorrow. It was too late, the man had paid a heavy price for his compassion.
