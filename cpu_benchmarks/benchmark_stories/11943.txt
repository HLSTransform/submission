Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went outside to play. The wind was blowing and it made her hair fly all around. Lily's mommy called out to her, "Lily, be careful in the wind!" 
Lily played for a while and then went back inside. She accidentally spilled her juice on her shirt. "Oh no!" she said, "My shirt is wet!" 
Her mommy helped her take off her shirt and put on a new one. "Don't be embarrassed," said her mommy. "It's okay to make mistakes." 
Lily felt better and went to play again. This time, she made sure to stay away from the wind and keep her juice in her cup so she wouldn't get wet or embarrassed again.
