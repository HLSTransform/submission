The sea was calm and the tide was low. Tom and his mom were walking along the beach, looking for the most perfect shells. Tom hoped he would find one as he searched through the sand.
Suddenly, Tom saw something rolling towards him. It was a beautiful, shiny shell. Tom was so happy and he shouted happily to his mom. She smiled at Tom and picked up the shell.
Tom and his mom kept searching the beach and soon they found even more shells. Some were big and some were small. Some were smooth, and others were rough. Tom was so excited with his new shells.
Suddenly, their lucky streak ended and the tide was now coming in. But it wasn't over yet! Tom noticed a kind and generous seagull overhead. The seagull dropped a shell in front of Tom and his mom. They were so excited and grateful for this kind gift.
Tom and his Mom put the shells in their bucket and smiled at each other. Tom was so thankful for the kind seagull and he hoped they would have even more luck on their shell-finding adventures!
