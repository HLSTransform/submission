Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a big, red ball and loved to play with it. One sunny day, Tim went to the park with his mom.
At the park, Tim saw a big, open box. He was curious and went to look inside. In the box, he found a big, green frog. The frog looked at Tim and said, "Ribbit! I'm hungry. Can you help me find something to eat?"
Tim thought for a moment and then said, "I know! There are some yummy bugs under that rock!" They went to the rock and found lots of bugs for the frog to eat. The frog was very happy.
As they were looking for more bugs, they found a fake, plastic bug. The frog tried to eat it, but it didn't taste good. Tim laughed and said, "Silly frog, that's a fake bug! Let's find more real bugs for you to eat."
After the frog had eaten enough bugs, Tim and the frog played with the big, red ball together. They had so much fun at the park that day. And from that day on, Tim and the frog became the best of friends.
