Tom and Sue were playing in the park. They liked to pretend they were spies and had a secret mission. They had a toy phone and a toy missile. The phone could make noises and the missile could fly.
"Agent Tom, this is Agent Sue. Do you copy?" Sue said into the phone.
"Copy, Agent Sue. What is the mission?" Tom said.
"The bad guys have a big bomb. We have to stop them. Use the missile to hit the bomb. But be careful, they have guards and traps." Sue said.
"OK, Agent Sue. I will do it. Over and out." Tom said. He put the phone in his pocket and held the missile in his hand. He looked around. He saw a clear path to the bomb. It was a big red ball on a bench. He also saw some bad guys. They were other kids with hats and sticks. He had to resist them.
He ran towards the bomb. He dodged the sticks and the rocks. He was almost there. He aimed the missile at the bomb. He pressed the button. The missile flew in the air. It made a loud sound. It hit the bomb. The bomb popped. It was full of confetti. The confetti flew everywhere. Tom and Sue cheered.
"Good job, Agent Tom. You saved the day. The bad guys are gone. The mission is done." Sue said.
"Thank you, Agent Sue. You are a great partner. Let's go back to the base. We have more missions to do." Tom said.
They picked up their toys and ran back to the slide. They were happy. They liked to play spies. They had a lot of fun.
