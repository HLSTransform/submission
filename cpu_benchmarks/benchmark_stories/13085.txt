Once upon a time there was a family that had an oven. It was big and red and they used it to make food. It was special because it was the only oven in the world like it.
One day, the family got a surprise. It was a box that had something inside. They opened it and it was full of crazy colourful jewels. It was like a treasure.
 
Everyone was so excited. They wanted to know how much the jewels were worth. They worked out that the jewels were worth a lot of money.
The family was so happy and wanted to show everyone the jewels. They organised a party and invited everyone. They put the jewels in the oven so everyone could see them.
At the party, everyone loved the jewels and everyone said how valuable they were. The family was so proud. 
The end.
