Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a clock in her room that she loved to watch tick-tock. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a present. It was a box with something interesting inside. Lily opened the box and found a shiny necklace. She put it on and showed it to her mommy. 
Later that day, Lily went outside to play in the garden. She found a spot where the dirt was soft and easy to dig. She decided to bury her necklace in the ground so that she could find it again later. She dug a hole with her hands and carefully placed the necklace inside. Then she covered it with dirt and patted it down. 
Days went by and Lily forgot where she buried her necklace. She looked and looked but couldn't find it. One day, while she was playing in the garden, she saw something shiny peeking out of the ground. She dug and dug until she found her necklace. She was so happy and showed it to her mommy again. From that day on, Lily never forgot where she buried her special things.
