Once upon a time, there was a youth. He was very curious about exploring the world. One day, he was invited by a friend to a grand feast. He was so excited to go!
At the feast, there were many delicious foods from all over the world. The tables were filled with all sorts of goodies. He could not believe the choices!
The youth went around trying all the different foods. Everything was so yummy! He ate so much that he felt like he might burst. He wanted to try everything he could.
The youth was never so happy. He thanked his friend for inviting him to the feast. They laughed and danced together, and enjoyed the delicious food.
It was a night he would never forget.
