Once upon a time there was a clever potato called Steve. He lived in a town and he wanted to do something special. He decided to go for a walk around the town. 
Steve was a brave potato and he explored everywhere. He saw a big hill and he decided to climb it. At the top it was very windy, but he kept going. 
Finally, he reached the top and he was so happy. He looked around and saw the whole town. He was very proud of himself. 
It had been a long day and Steve decided it was time to go home. He walked back down the hill and soon he was back with his family. They were all so happy to see him safe and sound.
The next day, Steve decided to go on another adventure. He knew it would be lots of fun! The clever potato was very happy.
