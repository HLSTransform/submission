Once upon a time, there was an adventurous little girl called Sarah. She loved to explore everywhere and learn new things. Today, Sarah wanted to go to the shop. She put on her shoes and grabbed her bag. 
Sarah said goodbye to her mommy and walked out the door. She felt so brave and excited - it was her first ever time walking alone. She skipped and hopped all the way to the shop. 
Once Sarah got to the shop, she started to look around. There were so many things to see and choose from! She saw the sweet treats and colourful toys, and even picked out a new, sparkly headband for herself. 
When it was time to go home, Sarah said goodbye to the shop keeper, who had helped her find some goodies for her friends at home. Holding onto her shopping bag, Sarah took a deep breath and started her walk home. Even when it got a bit dark, she wasn't scared - she knew she would make it home safe. 
When Sarah finally arrived home, she couldn"t stop talking about her wonderful, adventurous day. She was so proud of herself for taking the journey all by herself and couldn't wait to do it all over again!
