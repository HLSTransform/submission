Once upon a time there was a dark sky. It was very gloomy. One night in the sky, something special happened. A line rose up from the horizon. It sparkled and shone in the night.
All of the people in the village were so amazed. They all stood outside looking up at the rising line in the sky. It rose higher and higher until it reached the stars.
The people in the village all looked up and smiled. They felt so happy and excited. They could not believe it - a bright, shining line of light in the dark and gloomy sky. 
The line was still rising and twinkling in the night sky when the morning came. It was so beautiful that many people wanted to take a picture of it. 
What a special night with a rising line in the gloom!
