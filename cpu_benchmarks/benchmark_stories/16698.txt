Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big bird in the park. It has a long neck and long legs. It is an ostrich.
"Wow, look at that bird!" Sara says. "It is so big and funny!"
"Let's go and say hello to it," Ben says. "Maybe it will be our friend."
They run to the ostrich. The ostrich sees them and makes a loud noise. It is angry. It does not like children.
"Go away, go away!" the ostrich tells them. "This is my park. You are not welcome here."
Sara and Ben are scared. They try to run away. But the ostrich is faster. It chases them and kicks them with its strong feet. It hurts them a lot.
Sara and Ben cry. They wish they never saw the ostrich. The ostrich is a rare and mean bird. It is not a good friend.
