One day, a girl named Lucy went to visit her friend, Sam. Sam was worried because he had to unpack a big box. Inside the box was a special powder that could make things grow.
Sam opened the box and saw the powder. He said, "Lucy, can you help me unpack this powder? I am worried I will make a mess." Lucy smiled and said, "Sure, I can help you!"
Together, they carefully unpacked the powder. They put it on the plants in Sam's garden. The plants grew big and strong. Sam was not worried anymore. He was happy, and they both played in the garden all day.
