Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a house with her mommy and daddy. One day, Lily's mommy said, "Lily, today we will decorate our house for Easter."
Lily was very excited and asked, "What is Easter?" Her mommy explained that Easter is a special day when we celebrate with eggs and bunnies.
Lily and her mommy started to decorate the house with colorful eggs and cute bunnies. But then, they found a disgusting spider on the wall! Lily was scared, but her mommy said, "Don't worry, we'll take care of it."
After they got rid of the spider, they continued to decorate the house. When they finished, Lily's house looked so beautiful and ready for Easter. Lily was so happy and couldn't wait for the Easter bunny to come and visit her.
