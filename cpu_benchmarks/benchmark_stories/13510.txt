Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy wanted to watch his favorite cartoon on TV, but his mom said they had to go to the store first to buy some tape.
Timmy didn't want to go to the store, he wanted to watch his cartoon. "Mom, can we delay going to the store until after my cartoon is over?" Timmy asked.
His mom thought for a moment and said, "Okay, we can wait a little bit, but we can't delay it too long."
Timmy was so happy that he got to watch his cartoon. After it was over, they went to the store to buy the tape. The store was very big and had a lot of things to look at. Timmy saw some mild candy and asked his mom if they could buy it too. His mom said yes and they had a fun time at the store.
