Once upon a time, there was a big yellow turkey named Tom. Tom lived on a farm with many friends. Tom liked to worry a lot.
One day, Tom lost his favorite toy. He looked everywhere, but he could not find it. Tom felt sad and started to worry. "Oh no, where did my toy go?" Tom asked his friend, the cow. "I don't know," said the cow, "but don't worry, we will find it."
Tom and the cow looked all around the farm. They asked all their friends if they had seen the toy. But no one knew where it was. Tom started to worry more and more.
Finally, they found the toy under a big tree. Tom was so happy! He said, "Thank you for helping me find my toy. I will try not to worry so much next time." Tom and his friends played with the toy and had lots of fun.
