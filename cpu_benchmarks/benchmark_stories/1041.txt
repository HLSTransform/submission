Alice was hungry. She saw a fan in the corner of the room and it made her happy. She ran over to it, and skipped around it. She enjoyed the cool breeze it gave her.
Then she got an idea. She skipped to the kitchen to get a snack. She found some yummy cookies and she grabbed one. She skipped back to the fan to eat the cookie.
While she was eating the cookie, she kept feeling the breeze of the fan. She was very happy and it kept her cool while she enjoyed her snack.
Once she was done, she gave the fan a big hug and said, "Thank you, fan!" and she skipped away, feeling very content.
