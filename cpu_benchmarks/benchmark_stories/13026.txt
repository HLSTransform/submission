Once upon a time, there was a bookcase. It was made of wood and it was tall and strong. All day long, it stood alone in the room.
But one night, the bookcase started to sing a sleepy song. It said, "I want to sleep, I want to rest."
The bookcase asked all around, "Is there a place where I can sleep?" But no one was available. So the bookcase had to find a place to sleep by itself.
Finally, the bookcase sighed and lay down on the floor. It was cozy and it was warm, so the bookcase went to sleep.
It dreamed of the days when it was available, when it was filled with books and when it was standing in the room.
The bookcase slept all night long, until the morning light came shining through the window. Then the bookcase woke up and stood up tall again. It was happy to be available and ready for another day.
