Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. Amy loved to help her mom. One day, her mom asked her to restore a clean dish. Amy was very happy to help.
Amy went to the kitchen and saw the clean dish on the table. She picked it up and started to walk back to her mom. On the way, she met her friend, Tim. Tim said, "Hi Amy, what are you doing?" Amy replied, "I am helping my mom restore this clean dish."
As they talked, Amy did not see a toy on the floor. She tripped on the toy and the clean dish fell from her hands. The dish broke into many pieces. Amy was very sad and cried. Her mom came and saw the broken dish. The dish could not be restored and they had to throw it away. This made everyone sad and it was a bad ending.
