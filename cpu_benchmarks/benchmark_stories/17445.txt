Tom and Mia are best friends. They like to play together at school. Sometimes they play with blocks, sometimes they play with dolls, sometimes they play with cars. They have a lot of fun.
One day, they see a new boy in their class. His name is Sam. He is very big and loud. He pushes other kids and takes their toys. He makes them cry. Tom and Mia do not like Sam. They are scared of him.
At snack time, Tom and Mia sit together. They have apples and juice. Sam comes over and grabs Tom's apple. He says, "This is mine now. You are too small and weak." He laughs and walks away. Tom is sad and angry. He wants his apple back.
Mia sees Tom's face. She feels sorry for him. She whispers in his ear, "Don't worry, Tom. We can get your apple back. We are smart and brave. We can work together." She puts her hand on his shoulder. She smiles at him.
Tom feels better. He whispers back, "Thank you, Mia. You are a good friend. How can we get my apple back?" Mia thinks for a moment. She has an idea. She whispers her plan to Tom. They nod and get ready.
They wait until Sam is busy playing with a ball. They sneak up behind him. Mia grabs his backpack. Tom grabs his apple. They run away as fast as they can. They hide behind a tree. They high-five each other. They eat the apple and share the juice. They are happy.
Sam turns around and sees his backpack and apple are gone. He is mad and confused. He looks around and sees Tom and Mia behind the tree. He yells, "Hey, you two! Give me back my stuff!" He runs towards them.
But Tom and Mia are not afraid. They stand up and face him. They say, "No, Sam. This is Tom's apple. You took it from him. That is not nice. You should say sorry and be kind to others. You are not tough. You are mean."
Sam stops and looks at them. He is surprised. He sees that they are not scared of him. He feels ashamed. He says, "I'm sorry. You are right. I was mean. I don't have many friends. I wanted to be tough and cool. But I was wrong. Can you forgive me?"
Tom and Mia look at each other. They think for a moment. They say, "Yes, we can forgive you. But you have to promise to be nice and share from now on. And you have to give us some of your snacks too." Sam nods and agrees. He gives them some of his cookies and crackers. He says, "Can we be friends?" Tom and Mia say, "Yes, we can be friends. But you have to play nicely with everyone. And you have to whisper sometimes. You are too loud." Sam smiles and says, "OK, I will try. Thank you for giving me a chance." They hug and make up.
The end.
