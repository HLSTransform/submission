Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved to wear her favourite dress. One day, the girl and her mum went to the market. She looked around and saw the bright colours of the vegetables, the delicious smell of the cakes, and the funny shapes of the fruit.
The girl was having lots of fun looking at all the different things. She felt happy and peaceful in the market. Then, she remembered her favourite dress at home. She wanted to wear it to the market.
The girl and her mum went back home and the girl put on her dress. She twirled around in joy and looked at herself in the mirror. Now she felt even more ready to go back to the market.
The girl and her mum returned to the market. She laughed, smiled, and twirled around in her dress. Everyone at the market noticed the girl with her beautiful dress, twirling around and having fun. The market felt so peaceful, happy, and full of joy. 
The girl wore her dress proudly and enjoyed the rest of her time at the market.
