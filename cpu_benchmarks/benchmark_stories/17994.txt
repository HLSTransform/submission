Once upon a time, there was a happy train. It had many cars and a big engine. The train loved to go on long trips and see new things. One day, the train saw a little bear who was sad. The bear was lost and didn't know how to get home. The train stopped and the bear got on. The bear was so happy to be on the train and hugged the train's big wheel. The train was happy too because the bear fit perfectly in the train car. They went on many trips together and had lots of fun. The end.
