Once upon a time, there was an old man. He loved salad! He would measure it every morning before he ate it.
So, one morning he went out to get some salad and found the biggest one he had ever seen. It was so big! He wanted to measure it with his ruler, so he took it home.
At home, he grabbed his ruler and measured the salad. He was so happy! It was much bigger than any salad he had ever seen before.
But then he started to feel a bit sad. Why was the salad so big? He looked at the salad and realized it was old. It was too old to eat!
The old man decided to throw it away. But he was still happy, because he was able to measure the biggest salad he had ever seen.
