Ben and Mia are friends. They like to play together. One day, they find a big box in the park. It is empty and clean.
"Let's make a house with the box!" Mia says.
"Good idea!" Ben says. "I will lead you to a good spot."
Ben takes Mia's hand and leads her to a shady tree. They put the box under the tree and cut a door and a window with scissors. They draw flowers and stars on the box with crayons. They make a roof with a blanket.
"Wow, our house is so pretty!" Mia says.
"Yes, and cozy too!" Ben says. "We are lucky to have a house like this."
They go inside the box and pretend to cook and read and sleep. They have a lot of fun in their house. They are happy.
