Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy who loved to play with balls. One day, he found a big, red ball in the park. He threw it up high and caught it with a big smile on his face. 
Suddenly, a girl named Sally came over and asked, "Can I play with your ball?" Timmy replied, "No, it's mine." Sally looked sad and said, "I don't have any toys to play with."
Timmy felt bad and decided to share his ball with Sally. They played together for a while until the ball accidentally hit a ball of yarn that was lying nearby. The yarn started to unravel and Timmy and Sally didn't know what to do. 
They tried to put the yarn back together, but it was too tangled and unknown how to fix it. They decided to go ask Timmy's mom for help. She was able to untangle the yarn and they all laughed and played together happily.
