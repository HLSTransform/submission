Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy was very excited because his grandma was coming to visit him. He waited and waited for her to arrive. Finally, he saw her coming down the road.
"Grandma, you're here!" Timmy shouted.
"Yes, I am here, my wise little mouse," Grandma said with a smile. "I brought you a present."
Timmy was so happy to see his grandma and to receive a present. He opened the present and found a new cell phone inside.
"Thank you, Grandma! You're the best!" Timmy exclaimed.
Grandma and Timmy spent the day talking on the phone and having fun. Timmy was grateful for his wise grandma and the special gift she brought him.
