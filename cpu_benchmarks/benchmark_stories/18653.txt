Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in his backyard. One day, he lost his favorite toy car in the grass. Timmy searched and searched but could not find it. 
Timmy's mom came outside and asked him what he was doing. Timmy told her he was searching for his toy car. His mom helped him look, and after a while, they were successful! They found the toy car in the bushes. 
Timmy was so happy and thanked his mom for helping him. From then on, Timmy made sure to keep his toys in a safe place so he wouldn't lose them again. The end.
