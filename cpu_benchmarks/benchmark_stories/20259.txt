Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a large fireman named Tom. Tom loved to help people and he was very good at his job. Everyone in the town liked Tom because he was always there when they needed him.
One day, a little girl named Lucy was playing with her toy car when she saw smoke coming from her house. She did not understand what was happening. She was scared and started to cry. Just then, Tom the fireman came with his big red truck. He saw Lucy and knew she needed help.
Tom the fireman quickly put out the fire in Lucy's house. He made sure Lucy and her family were safe. They were so happy that Tom was there to help them. From that day on, Lucy wanted to be a fireman just like Tom when she grew up. She knew that she wanted to help people too.
