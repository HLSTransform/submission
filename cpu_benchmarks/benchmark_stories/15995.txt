Once upon a time, there lived a little cat named Felix. Felix was very happy and content with his life. He had a home, friends and plenty of food to eat. 
One day, Felix was playing in the garden when he heard a tiny voice. It was the voice of a little mouse named Mable. Mable said: "I wish I had a fancy house like yours, Felix."
Mable was so jealous of Felix's house that she decided to lie. She told Felix that she could build a better and more wonderful house with her own two paws. 
Felix knew it was a lie so he said: "Mable, lying isn't nice. Just be content with your own life and be happy with who you are." 
Mable felt bad so she said sorry and the two of them became best friends. And they both lived happily ever after.
The moral of the story is that you should be happy with your own life and not lie.
