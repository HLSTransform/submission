Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved magic and wanted to learn how to do it. One day, she saw a cute bunny in the woods and tried to use magic to make it come to her. But it didn't work.
Lily asked her mom, "Why can't I do magic?"
Her mom explained, "Magic is not real, it's just pretend. You can't make things happen just by wishing for them."
Lily was sad, but her mom had an idea. "Why don't we make a magic wand together? It may not do real magic, but it will be fun to pretend."
Lily was excited and they made a wand out of a stick and some glitter. She waved it at the bunny, and it hopped over to her. Lily was so happy and said, "It's magic!"
Her mom smiled and said, "No, it's not magic, it's just a cute bunny who likes you." And they both laughed and played with the bunny together.
