Once upon a time, there was a happy family. They lived in a big house with a garden. One day, the mother cooked a yummy yellow soup for lunch. She introduced the soup to her little girl. The little girl loved the soup so much that she ate it all up. After lunch, they went to play in the garden. The sun was shining and the flowers were blooming. They had so much fun together!
