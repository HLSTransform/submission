Once upon a time there was a kind old man. He believed in helping others and made sure everyone was taken care of. One day, he found a scary razor in the street. He picked it up and wondered what to do. He believed that it could hurt someone, so he took it to the policeman. The policeman was very thankful and said that it was important to keep people safe, especially when something could be dangerous. The old man was proud that he had done something good. He continued to believe that everyone should always look out for each other. The End.
