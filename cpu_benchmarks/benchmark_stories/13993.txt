One day, a boy named Tim went to camp. At camp, there were lots of fun things to do. Tim liked to count how many friends he made at camp. He also liked to count the stars at night.
One day, Tim met a new friend named Sam. Sam said, "I like to count too! Let's count the bugs we find." They both started to look for bugs. They found a big, green bug. Tim thought it was disgusting, but Sam liked it.
After they counted the bugs, Tim and Sam played together all day. They had so much fun at camp. At night, they counted the stars together. They were happy to be friends and count together.
