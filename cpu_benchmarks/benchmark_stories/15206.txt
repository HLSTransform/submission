Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy that could shoot. He liked to play with it all day. One day, Tim saw a big tree in his yard. The tree had a branch that was just an inch too high for him to reach. Tim had an idea.
Tim went to find his toy that could shoot. He thought, "If I shoot the branch, maybe I can make it fall down." Tim was very excited to try his idea. He knew that if the branch fell, he would have a new toy to play with.
Tim aimed his toy at the branch and shot it. The branch shook a little but did not fall down. Tim tried again and again. Finally, after many tries, the branch fell down. Tim was so happy! He picked up the branch and played with it all day in the mild sun. And that's how Tim got a new toy from the tree.
