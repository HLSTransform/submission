Once there was a little girl named Sally. She was only three years old but she was very smart. She liked to go to the park every day with her mom and dad. 
One day, Sally saw something very interesting in the playground. It was a big, red banana! Sally was so excited. She shouted out to her parents that she wanted the banana.
Her parents said it was okay, but they reminded Sally to always mind what she was doing. She nodded and carefully crawled over to the big, red banana. She took it in her tiny hands and looked at it. She couldn't believe it was real and hers to keep!
Sally and her parents went home with the big, red banana. Sally showed her parents her beautiful prize and they all laughed. She ate some of the banana that day and shared the rest with her family. From then on, Sally always remembered to mind what she was doing so she could have more fun at the park.
