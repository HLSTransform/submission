Anna and Ben were friends who liked to play outside. They liked to look at the sky and see the sun, the clouds and the birds. Sometimes, at night, they saw the moon and the stars. They thought the moon was very pretty and shiny.
One night, Anna said to Ben, "I want to marry the moon. He is so bright and round and he makes me happy." Ben said, "But how can you marry the moon? He is very far away and he changes every night. Sometimes he is big, sometimes he is small, sometimes he is not there at all."
Anna said, "I don't care. I love the moon and I want to be with him. I will find a way to go to him and marry him." Ben said, "But what about me? I am your friend and I love you too. I want to play with you and be with you. You can't leave me alone."
Anna said, "You are my friend, but the moon is my love. I have to follow my heart. Goodbye, Ben." She ran away and looked for a way to go to the moon. She tried to climb a tree, but it was too difficult. She tried to fly a kite, but it was too windy. She tried to make a rocket, but it was too dangerous.
She was very sad and tired. She realized that she could not go to the moon and marry him. She missed Ben and his smile and his voice. She wished she had listened to him and stayed with him. She ran back to him and said, "Ben, I am sorry. I was silly and foolish. I don't want to marry the moon. I want to be your friend. Can you forgive me?"
Ben said, "Of course, I forgive you. You are my friend and I love you too. I am glad you are back. Let's play and be happy." They hugged and played and laughed. They looked at the moon and the stars and thanked them for their light. They learned that the moon is beautiful, but friendship is more important.
