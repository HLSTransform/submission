Once upon a time, there was a little bird with a rare blue wing. The bird loved to fly around in the sky and see all the pretty flowers and trees. One day, the bird saw a little girl who needed help. The girl was trying to dress herself but she couldn't do it by herself. The bird decided to help the girl by picking out a pretty dress for her. The girl was so happy and thanked the bird for its help. The bird felt proud of itself for being able to help someone. From that day on, the bird and the girl became good friends and they would often play together in the park.
