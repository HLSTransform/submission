Once upon a time, there was an ugly twig. It was lying all alone in the damp ground. Suddenly, a little girl appeared. She was only three years old. She bent down, touched the twig, and wanted to take it home. But then she thought the twig wasn't very pretty, so she left it and ran away. 
She regretted her decision. Without the twig, the ground looked so empty. A tear rolled down her cheek as she remembered how ugly and lonely the twig was. She took a deep breath and ran back to the twig. But before she could pick it up, it was gone. 
The little girl was sad and wished she hadn't been so hasty. She had a lot of regrets now. She wished she would have taken the twig home with her and made it happy. That way, the ugly twig would have had a special place in her heart forever.
