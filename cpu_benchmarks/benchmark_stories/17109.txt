Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited because she was going to a party with her friends. She put on her long dress and her shiny shoes.
When she arrived at the party, she saw a big ice cream cake. She wanted to eat it so badly, but it was too long until the cake would be cut. She asked her friend, "When will the cake be ready?" Her friend replied, "Soon, but be patient."
After a while, the cake was finally ready. Lily took a big piece and put it in her mouth. It was so delicious! But then, she felt it start to melt. She said to her friend, "My cake is melting!" Her friend said, "Hurry up and eat it before it melts completely!" So Lily ate her cake quickly and enjoyed the rest of the party.
