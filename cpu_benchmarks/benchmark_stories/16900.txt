Mia and Leo were playing in the garden. They saw a big peach tree with many ripe peaches. They wanted to pick some and eat them.
"Let's get some peaches, they look yummy!" Mia said.
"OK, but we have to be quick. Mom said we can't leave the garden," Leo said.
They ran to the tree and reached for the peaches. They each grabbed one and bit into it. But they did not like the taste. The peaches were spicy and made their mouths burn.
"Yuck, these peaches are spicy!" Mia said.
"Ow, ow, ow, they hurt my tongue!" Leo said.
They spit out the peaches and threw them away. They ran back to the garden and looked for some water. They saw a hose and turned it on. They drank some water and rinsed their mouths.
"Ah, that's better," Mia said.
"Much better," Leo said.
They heard Mom calling them from the house.
"Mia, Leo, come inside. It's time for lunch," Mom said.
They ran to the house and hugged Mom.
"Mom, we tried some peaches from the tree, but they were spicy and bad," Mia said.
"Spicy peaches? Oh, no, those are not peaches. Those are hot peppers. You should not eat them. They are for cooking, not for snacking," Mom said.
"Hot peppers? Oh, no, we did not know. We are sorry, Mom," Leo said.
"It's OK, my loves. You did not mean to. But next time, ask me before you pick something from the tree. Some fruits and vegetables are not good for you raw. Now, let's have some lunch. I made some sandwiches and some real peaches for dessert," Mom said.
"Yay, sandwiches and peaches!" Mia and Leo said.
They followed Mom to the kitchen and ate their lunch. They enjoyed the sweet and juicy peaches. They learned their lesson and never ate hot peppers again.
