Once upon a time, there were two friends named Jack and Lucy. Every Tuesday, they went to the forest to play.
This Tuesday, they decided to go find and play with a large scale. So, they went to the river and searched for it.
When they finally found the scale, they both smiled gleefully. But then, Jack suddenly forgot what he was supposed to do!
Lucy reminded him, “We need to find something that is light, to put on the scale!”
Jack remembered then and said, “Oh yeah! Let’s search for something together!”
So, the two friends searched around the river until they found a large rock. They carefully placed the rock on the large scale and found out it was heavy.
Jack and Lucy were so happy they found out what their scale was supposed to do! They continued to play until it was time to go home.
