Once there was a small, furry bunny called Biff. Biff liked to explore and one day he was jumping around his house when he found something very exciting - a big, white closet! Biff wanted to see what was inside, so he hopped into the closet and shut the door behind him.
Biff heard a funny noise and looked around. There in the corner he saw something he had never seen before - a big, magical printer! It was printing pieces of paper with colourful pictures, shapes and letters. Biff was fascinated and started jumping and hopping around the printer.
Just then, Biff heard someone calling his name. It was his mom. She asked, "Biff, what are you doing in the closet?" Biff stopped jumping and said, "I'm playing with a printing machine, Mommy!" Biff's mom smiled and said, "That's wonderful! Now, let's go have some fun outside. The printer can stay in the closet for a while." 
So, Biff hopped out of the closet and with his mom, they went outside and had a lovely afternoon of fun.
