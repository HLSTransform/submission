Once there was a little boy named Sam. He was three years old and was playing outside. Sam saw an old brick and he was very excited. He picked it up and said, "This looks ready to play with!"
Sam took the brick and he walked to the park. He spoke to his friends and said, "Look at this brick, I found it! We can use it to play with." Everyone was very happy and they started to play together with the brick.
They had so much fun with the brick. They made towers and pretended they were castles. They all shouted, "Ready, set, go!" and started to have a race with the brick.
All day long Sam played with the brick and had a great time. He was so excited to find the brick and was so happy to share it with his friends. They all said goodbye at the end of the day and went home smiling.
