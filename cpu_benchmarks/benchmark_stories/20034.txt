Lily and Sam liked to build with blocks. They had many blocks of different colors and shapes. They could make houses, towers, bridges and more. They had fun playing together and sharing their ideas.
One day, they decided to build a big castle. They used blue and white blocks for the walls, yellow and red blocks for the windows, and green and brown blocks for the roof. They worked hard and helped each other. They were proud of their castle.
"Look at our castle, Lily! It is so big and pretty!" Sam said.
"Yes, Sam, it is! And look, we have a flag too!" Lily said. She had made a flag with a paper and a stick. She put it on top of the castle.
They heard a knock on the door. It was their mom. She came to see what they were doing.
"Wow, what a wonderful castle you have built, Lily and Sam! You are very creative and clever!" Mom said.
"Thank you, Mom! Do you want to see inside?" Lily asked.
"Sure, I would love to see inside. But first, can I take a picture of you and your castle? You look so happy and graceful!" Mom said.
She took out her phone and snapped a picture of Lily and Sam smiling next to their castle. They posed with their flag and their blocks.
"Say cheese!" Mom said.
"Cheese!" Lily and Sam said.
Mom showed them the picture. They liked it very much.
"That's a great picture, Mom! Can we keep it?" Sam asked.
"Of course, you can keep it. And you can keep your castle too, for a while. But remember, you have to clean up your blocks later, okay?" Mom said.
"Okay, Mom. We will clean up later. But can we play with our castle for a few more minutes, please?" Lily asked.
"Sure, you can play for a few more minutes. But then it's time for lunch, okay?" Mom said.
"Okay, Mom. Thank you!" Lily and Sam said.
They hugged their mom and went back to their castle. They played with their blocks and their flag. They pretended to be kings and queens of their castle. They had a lot of fun. They were happy.
