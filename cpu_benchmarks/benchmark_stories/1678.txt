Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very poor and didn't have many toys to play with. One day, Lily's mom called for a taxi to take them to the park. Lily was so excited to go to the park because she had never been there before.
When they got to the park, Lily saw other kids playing with their toys. She felt sad because she didn't have any toys to play with. Then, Lily saw a little boy crying because he lost his toy. Lily felt bad for the little boy and wanted to help him. She told her mom to call the taxi driver and ask if they could go back home to get one of her toys to give to the little boy.
The taxi driver was very kind and agreed to take them back home. Lily gave the little boy her favorite toy and he stopped crying. Lily felt happy that she could help someone else. She learned that even though she was poor and didn't have many toys, she could still make someone else happy. Lily didn't miss her toy because she knew it was making someone else happy.
