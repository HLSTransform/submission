Billy was walking home from school and decided to whistle. Suddenly an ashtray flew out of the window above him! It made a loud noise and stopped at his feet. Billy was so surprised he stepped back.
Billy called out, "What was that?"
An old man leaned out of the window and said, "That was my grandmother's special ashtray! She used it every day for a hundred years."
"I'm so sorry," said Billy. "It sounded like it broke."
The old man frowned and said, "That's OK, but I need that ashtray back. It's very special."
Billy was worried, but he didn't want the old man to be sad. He looked around and spotted a delicious-looking cookie on a plate on the side of the road.
Billy pointed at the cookie and said, "I'll trade you the ashtray for the cookie."
The old man smiled and said, "Deal!"
Billy handed over the ashtray and the old man gave him the cookie. Billy took a big bite and said, "Delicious! Thank you so much."
The old man smiled and said, "No problem. Lucky for me, I met a kind boy who knew how to make a good trade."
