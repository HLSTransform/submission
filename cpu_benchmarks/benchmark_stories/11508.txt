Once upon a time, a little dog named Max found a heavy sausage on the ground. He wanted to take it home to share with his friend, a cat named Luna. Max tried to carry the sausage, but it was too heavy for him.
Max asked Luna for help. "Luna, can you help me carry this heavy sausage?" Luna came to help Max. Together, they carried the heavy sausage back to their home.
When they got home, the sausage was dirty. Max and Luna used a cloth to wipe the sausage clean. "Now we can eat it!" said Max. They shared the sausage and were very happy.
