Maggie was very excited. She was organizing her first birthday party and was determined to make it a success. Unfortunately, her brother Mark was not as enthusiastic. He wanted to stay home and play. 
"Maggie, why do we have to organize a party?" Mark asked.
"Because it's my birthday and I want to have some fun," Maggie replied.
Mark sighed and reluctantly agreed. He helped Maggie gather all the things she needed: decorations, cups and plates, presents and a big pot of rice. 
On the day of the party, Mark was feeling guilty. Despite helping his sister to organize the party, he still wanted to stay home and play. He had missed out on some of the fun. 
Maggie saw the guilty look on her brother's face and gave him a hug and a reassuring smile. 
"It's ok, Mark. You helped me organize and that's what really matters," she said. 
Mark smiled back in relief and enjoyed the rest of the party with the delicious pot of rice and all his friends.
