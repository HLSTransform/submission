Sam was eating a nice chew. It was soft and tasted yummy. He loved to chew it.
When he was done, he noticed that his mom was getting the mail. Sam ran to help. He was so helpful!
Mom opened the mail and was excited. There were two packages and some letters. Sam couldn't wait to see what was inside.
Mom opened one of the packages and it was a new chew! It was pink and blue and really big. Sam was so excited and he wanted to try it right away.
He started chewing and it was even yummier than the old one. Sam smiled and thanked his mom for the new chew. He was so happy.
