Once upon a time, there was a big gym where kids loved to play. The gym was very clean and had many fun things to do. A little boy named Tom loved to go to the gym and play with his friends.
One day, Tom was playing with a ball in the gym. He saw a girl named Lily who wanted to play with the ball too. Tom did not want to yield the ball to Lily. He wanted to keep it all to himself. This made Lily sad and she started to cry.
Tom's mom saw what happened and told Tom to share the ball with Lily. Tom listened to his mom and gave the ball to Lily. They played together and had lots of fun. Tom learned that sharing with others is good and makes everyone happy.
