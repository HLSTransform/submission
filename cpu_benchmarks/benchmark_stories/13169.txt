Once upon a time, there was a boy. He was so adventurous! He loved to explore and play outside. One day, he wanted to find something really special. He heard about a magical pie that made people feel happy. He set out to find this pie.
He followed the signs and directions he had been given, and eventually he made it to the magical pie. He was so excited! He grabbed the pie, but when he looked down, it was gone! He couldn't believe it! The pie had disappeared. 
He was so sad, but he decided to keep looking. He kept exploring and looking until finally, he found it! The pie was in a special, hidden place. The boy smiled, put the pie in his pocket, and ran home. 
He never knew what made the pie disappear, and he never did find out. But it just made his adventure even more special.
