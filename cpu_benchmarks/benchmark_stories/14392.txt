Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, she went to the harbor with her mommy and daddy. They saw big boats and ships there. Lily was so happy and excited.
But then, she saw another little girl playing with a toy boat. Lily felt jealous because she wanted to play with the boat too. Her mommy saw her sad face and promised to buy her a toy boat later. Lily smiled and felt happy again.
After playing at the harbor, they went home. Lily couldn't wait to play with her new toy boat. She remembered her mommy's promise and was so excited. When they got home, her mommy kept her promise and gave her a beautiful toy boat. Lily was so happy and played with it all day long.
