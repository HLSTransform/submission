Once upon a time, there was a man and a woman. They were ordinary people, living an ordinary life. Every day, the man would give the woman a big kiss before he left for work. They were very happy together.
One day, the woman was at the store when she saw a beautiful microphone. She thought it would be perfect for a surprise for the man, so she brought it home.
When the man got home, the woman was excited to show him her surprise. She said, "Look, I got us a microphone!" The man was so angry, he didn't even say hello. He grabbed the microphone and threw it out the window. Then, he walked away without even giving her a kiss.
The woman was very sad. She had been so excited to surprise the man, and it had ended so badly. The ordinary life they once had together was gone, and the woman knew things would never be the same.
