Once upon a time there were two frogs. They were best friends, and liked to visit each other. One day, the frogs thought it would be fun to go for a swim.
The frogs hopped to a pond and jumped in. They swam and swam until they were so wet that the sun made droplets scatter off of their backs! They felt so refreshed in the warm, wet water.
After a while, the frogs decided it was time to go home. They said goodbye and hopped away. They would visit each other again soon!
