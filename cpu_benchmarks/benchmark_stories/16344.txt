Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very noisy. He liked to play with his toys and make loud sounds. One day, Tim's mom said, "Tim, you need to take this pill. It will help you feel better."
Tim looked at the pill and said, "No, I don't want to take it. It's too big!"
His mom said, "Don't worry, Tim. I will help you. Just take a big sip of water, and the pill will go down easily."
So Tim took a big sip of water and swallowed the pill. After that, he started to feel better. He played with his toys again, but this time, he played quietly. His mom was happy that Tim was feeling better and not being too noisy. And they lived happily ever after.
