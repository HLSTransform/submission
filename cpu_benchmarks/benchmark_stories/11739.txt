Once there was an old bear who wanted to find a new neighbor. He was getting a bit lonely, and he wanted somebody to play with and share his meals with. So he asked his friends and his family if they knew of anyone who wanted to be his neighbor.
His family searched all around and finally, a big, kind owl said he knew of a neighbor who was perfect! The bear was so excited! He wanted to meet his new neighbor right away.
So the bear went tumbling, hopping, and shuffling over to meet his new neighbor. It turns out the neighbor was also old, but very friendly. They had so much fun together, playing, singing and having meal time. The bear felt so excited, just like he had found a new friend.
The moral of the story is that you can always find someone new, no matter where you look. Even if somebody seems old, you never know how much fun you can have together. So don't be afraid to reach out to a new friend and try something different.
