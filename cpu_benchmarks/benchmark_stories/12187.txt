Once upon a time, there were two kids that were playing outside. One was called Jody and the other was Will.
Jody asked Will, "Can you tell me a spell?" But Will said no. He thought it was too hard and he didn't want to try. So Jody asked again, "Please? Just one spell?"
Will said no and he walked away. Jody felt upset and he wanted to show Will that he could do it. So he tried the spell that he'd heard his mom say. He said it wrong and something bad happened.
Jody's mom saw him and she was very mad. She said, "Jody, why did you do that? I told you to be obedient!" Then she slapped him on the hand.
Jody cried and he learned his lesson. He realized that he should have listened to his mom and been obedient. It was a hard lesson, but it was a good one.
