Lily was a good dog. She liked to play with her ball, run in the park, and lick her owner's face. She was obedient and listened to her owner's commands. She knew how to sit, stay, and come.
One day, Lily hurt her ear. She was chasing a squirrel and ran into a bush. A thorn scratched her ear and made it bleed. It hurt a lot and she cried. Her owner saw what happened and took her to the vet. The vet cleaned her ear and put a bandage on it. He gave her owner some medicine and told him to give it to Lily every day.
Lily did not like the bandage or the medicine. She wanted to scratch her ear and shake it off. But her owner told her to leave it alone and be a good girl. He said it would help her ear heal faster and stop hurting. Lily was obedient and did what her owner said. She rested on her bed and let her owner pet her and give her treats. She still played with her ball, but not too hard. She did not run in the park, but walked slowly. She did not lick her owner's face, but nuzzled his hand.
After a week, Lily's ear was better. The vet took off the bandage and said she was healed. He praised her for being obedient and brave. He gave her a sticker and a toy. Lily was happy and wagged her tail. Her owner was proud and hugged her. He said she was a good dog and he loved her. Lily licked his face and thanked him. She was ready to play and run again. She was a good dog.
