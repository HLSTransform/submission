Once there was a rabbit named Radish. He had a big problem: he was deaf. Each morning he would wake up and not hear anything. This made him sad.
One day Radish wanted to find a way to fix his problem. He saw a carrot in the garden and thought, "Maybe it can help me hear again!"
Radish grabbed the carrot and rushed to his friend, the fox. He asked the fox, "Can this carrot help me?"
The fox replied, "No, it's just a carrot. It can't help you."
Radish was sad and stuck with being deaf. He knew he wouldn't be able to fix his problem.
