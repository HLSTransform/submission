Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play games with her friends. One day, they decided to play chess. Lily didn't know how to play, but her friend showed her how. Lily thought the pieces were charming, especially the queen.
During the game, Lily's friend needed to lift a piece off the board. Lily wanted to help, so she lifted it for her. Her friend smiled and said thank you. Lily felt happy that she could help.
After the game, Lily and her friends went outside to play. They ran and laughed and had so much fun. Lily thought it was the best day ever!
