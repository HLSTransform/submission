Lily was a good girl who liked to play with her toys. She had a lot of toys, but her favorite was a soft mouse that she named Mimi. She always hugged Mimi and talked to her before she went to sleep.
One day, Lily came home from the park and wanted to play with Mimi. But she could not find Mimi anywhere. She looked under her bed, in her closet, in her drawers, but Mimi was not there. Lily felt sad and scared. She wondered if Mimi had vanished.
She ran to her mom and cried, "Mom, mom, where is Mimi? I can't find her. Did she vanish?"
Her mom hugged her and said, "Don't worry, Lily. Mimi did not vanish. Maybe she is hiding somewhere. Let's look for her together."
They searched the whole house, but they still could not find Mimi. Lily was about to give up, when she heard a squeak from the kitchen. She followed the sound and saw Mimi on the table, next to a big piece of cheese.
"Mimi, there you are!" Lily exclaimed. "Why did you leave me? I was so worried about you."
Mimi looked at Lily with her big eyes and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was hungry and I smelled the cheese. I wanted to have a bite, but I forgot to tell you. I didn't mean to make you sad."
Lily smiled and said, "It's okay, Mimi. I'm glad you are safe. But you should not take things that are not yours. That is not good. And you should always tell me where you are going. That way, I won't think you have vanished."
Mimi nodded and said, "You are right, Lily. I'm sorry. I will not do it again. Can you forgive me?"
Lily hugged Mimi and said, "Of course, I forgive you. You are my best friend. But next time, if you are hungry, I will share my snack with you. Okay?"
Mimi squeaked and said, "Okay. Thank you, Lily. You are very good and kind."
They both said sorry to Lily's mom for the cheese and went back to Lily's room. They played and talked until it was time for bed. Lily kissed Mimi and said, "Good night, Mimi. I love you."
Mimi snuggled with Lily and said, "Good night, Lily. I love you too."
The end.
