Tommy likes to examine things. He likes to look at them and touch them and see how they work. One day, he finds a telephone in his mom's room. He picks it up and puts it to his ear.
"Hello?" he says.
He hears a voice on the other end. It is a lady. She sounds surprised.
"Hello, who is this?" she asks.
Tommy smiles. He likes to talk to people. He is polite.
"I am Tommy. I am three. Who are you?" he says.
The lady is polite too. She tells him her name and where she lives. She asks him where he lives and who he is with.
"I live in a house with my mom and dad and my dog. My mom is in the kitchen. She is making cookies. Do you like cookies?" he says.
The lady says she likes cookies. She asks him what kind of cookies his mom is making.
"Chocolate chip. They are yummy. Do you want some?" he says.
The lady says she would love some, but she is too far away. She says she has to go now, but she thanks him for the nice chat. She tells him to be careful with the telephone and to say goodbye to his mom.
"Okay. Bye-bye. Thank you for talking to me. You are nice." he says.
He hangs up the phone and puts it back where he found it. He runs to the kitchen to help his mom with the cookies. He tells her he made a new friend on the telephone. She smiles and hugs him. She is proud of him for being polite.
