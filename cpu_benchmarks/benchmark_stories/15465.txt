Once there were two friends, Kyla and Adam. They were both only three years old. They both wanted to have some fun, so they decided to play. They had two small red balls. They decided to play catch with the balls.
Kyla threw the ball to Adam, who caught it and smiled. Adam then threw the ball back to Kyla. She caught it and giggled. They both continued to throw and catch the balls like this. Every time one caught the ball, they both smiled.
Kyla said, "Let's play a new game!" Adam was very excited, and said, "Yes, let's play!" Kyla said she would provide the fun and the two started their new game.
They used some blocks to build a small house. Kyla said, "Let's pretend that the small house is ours!" So they both pretended it was their house and played all sorts of fun games. They pretended they were cooking in the kitchen, they played hide and seek in their house. 
When they were done playing, they were both happy and had a lot of fun. Kyla thanked Adam for providing the fun and Adam thanked Kyla for the same. They hugged each other and promised to do it again soon.
