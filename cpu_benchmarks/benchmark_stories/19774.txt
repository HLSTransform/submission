Once upon a time there was a big, slow bear. He lived in the forest and was always very careful. One day he heard some news. It was a warning about a large fire!
The bear quickly went to tell the other animals. He shouted, “Be careful! There’s a big fire coming this way!”
The animals were very scared. Everyone ran away looking for a safe place. The bear moved slowly, but he managed to find a safe spot to hide.
The fire came closer and closer, but luckily it passed by without burning the bear or the other animals. When it was safe, the bear warned everyone to be cautious and to always keep their eyes open for danger!
