Once there was a little bear who was feeling very lonely. He had no one to play with, so he decided to take a walk in the woods. He walked for what felt like hours, until he came across a lake. He stopped for a moment and paused, looking at the calm water. Suddenly, he heard a noise from the bushes. He realized it was a strange robot! It had no battery and couldn't move, but the little bear felt sorry for it.
He decided to go back to his house and get some help. He came back with a big, bright battery. He carefully put the battery into the robot, and it started to move! The robot was so happy and thanked the bear for his help.
The bear and the robot became very good friends. They would play together every day and the bear was no longer lonely. They had so much fun and the bear knew he had found the perfect friend.
