Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and run around in the park. One day, she went to the park with her mommy and daddy. She was having so much fun on the swings and the slide that she forgot to eat her snack. 
Later that day, Lily's mommy asked her if she had eaten her snack. Lily realized she had forgotten and felt a little sad. Her mommy explained that sometimes our brains forget things, but it's okay because we can always remember later. Lily felt better and promised to remember to eat her snack next time.
From that day on, Lily made sure to take snacking seriously so she wouldn't forget again. She was happy that her mommy taught her about the brain and how sometimes it can forget things.
