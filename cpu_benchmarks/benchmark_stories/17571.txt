Lila and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big tree with many birds. They want to see the birds up close.
"Look, Lila, there is a nest on that branch!" Ben says. He points to a round thing made of sticks and leaves.
"Wow, Ben, let's go see it!" Lila says. She runs to the tree and tries to climb it. Ben follows her.
They climb and climb until they reach the branch with the nest. They lean over the nest and peek inside. They see four chubby baby birds with yellow feathers. The baby birds open their mouths and make loud noises.
"Hello, baby birds!" Lila says. She smiles and waves at them.
"Shh, Lila, don't scare them!" Ben says. He puts his finger on his lips.
Suddenly, they hear a loud squawk. They look up and see a big bird with red and blue feathers. It is the mother bird. She is angry. She flies towards them and flaps her wings.
"Uh-oh, Lila, we have to go!" Ben says. He grabs Lila's hand and jumps off the branch.
They run away from the tree and the mother bird. They are scared and sorry. They did not mean to bother the birds.
"Sorry, mother bird, sorry, baby birds!" Lila and Ben say. They run back to their mom and dad, who are waiting for them on a bench.
They tell them what happened. Their mom and dad hug them and tell them it is okay. They also tell them to be careful and respectful of the animals in the park.
Lila and Ben nod and say they will. They learned their lesson. They still like the birds, but they will not go near their nest again. They will watch them from far away and enjoy their songs.
