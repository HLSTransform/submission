Once upon a time there was a little lady called Lily. She lived in a meadow full of flowers. Every day she would make sure that the flowers were clean and happy. One day a flower in the meadow needed some extra care. Lily was eager to help, so she started taking care of it.
She watered it with love and care, and before long the flower began to bloom. Lily knew that if she took care of the flower it would eventually bloom. This taught her a valuable lesson, that with enough love and care anything can blossom and grow.
She continued to take care of the other flowers, and soon the entire meadow was filled with bright and beautiful blooms. All the other ladies in the meadow were very impressed and wanted to learn from Lily. They asked her to teach them how to make their flowers bloom. Lily smiled and said, “Nothing will bloom without love and care.” 
The other ladies were very impressed with Lily. She showed them that love and care are essential to make something beautiful bloom. From that day on, they all looked after the meadow and the flowers, and everyone was happy.
