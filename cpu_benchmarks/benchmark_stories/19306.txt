Once there was a boy named Tom. Tom was very silly and he loved firework.
One day Tom was in the park when he saw a firework. He wanted to play with it! So he dropped it on the ground and it made a loud noise.
Tom was so happy and he started to laugh. He jumped around and said, "This is fun!" 
Then suddenly, the firework made a bigger noise and flew up in the sky. Tom looked up and saw the beautiful firework shooting across the sky. It was so colorful!
Tom knew he had been silly, but it was still a lot of fun. He smiled and waved goodbye to the firework as it disappeared.
