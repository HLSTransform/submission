Once upon a time there was a carefree bear who loved to play. One day he stumbled upon a fight in the woods. The bear was scared, so he tried to run away, but he was too slow. He tripped and tumbled, looking for a way to escape. But before he could get away, two other animals ran right into him! His clumsy feet sent them to the ground too. All three of them stopped and looked at each other in surprise. 
Then something miraculous happened. The animals smiled and started to laugh. They all realised they were too scared to fight, and they decided they would be friends instead. The bear was so happy. From that day onwards, he was extra careful around fights, so he could keep his new friends safe. The end.
