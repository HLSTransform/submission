Once there was a girl called Lucy who was very selfish. She wanted to turn her seat all the way round so she would always be facing forwards. But every day when she turned her seat, the other children shouted at her because they wanted to turn their own seat too.
One day, Lucy decided to be kind and not turn her seat. Instead, she shared it with the other children. Soon, all the children were happy and turning the seat together. They laughed and joked the whole time, having lots of fun.
When it was time to go home, the other children thanked her for being so kind. They gave her a big hug and waved goodbye. 
From that day on, Lucy was always kind and sharing, never being selfish again.
