Tim likes hockey. Hockey is a game with sticks and a black thing. You hit the black thing with the stick and try to put it in a net. Tim has a hockey stick and a black thing at home. He plays hockey in his yard.
One day, Tim sees a new boy next door. The boy has a bike and a helmet. Tim wants to play with him. He takes his hockey stick and his black thing and goes to the boy. He says, "Hi, I am Tim. Do you like hockey?"
The boy smiles and says, "Hi, I am Sam. I like hockey, but I don't have a stick or a black thing. Can I play with you?"
Tim nods and says, "Sure, you can play with me. I will introduce you to hockey. Hockey is fun, but hard. You have to be fast and strong and careful. Do you want to try?"
Sam says, "Yes, I want to try. Thank you, Tim. You are nice."
Tim and Sam play hockey in the yard. They take turns hitting the black thing and trying to score. They laugh and run and have fun. They become friends. Tim is happy. He likes hockey and he likes Sam.
