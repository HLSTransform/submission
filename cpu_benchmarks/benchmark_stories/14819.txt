Sara liked to play with lizards. She found them in the garden and put them in a box. She gave them water and grass and rocks. She thought they were her friends.
One day, she saw a big lizard on the fence. It was green and shiny and had a long tail. Sara wanted to catch it and put it in her box. She ran to the fence and reached for the lizard.
"Be careful, Sara!" her mom shouted. "That is not a lizard, that is a crocodile! It can bite you!"
But Sara did not listen. She grabbed the crocodile by the tail and tried to remove it from the fence. The crocodile was angry and turned around. It opened its mouth and showed its sharp teeth. It bit Sara's hand and made her scream.
Sara dropped the crocodile and ran to her mom. Her mom hugged her and took her to the car. They drove to the hospital. Sara's hand was bleeding and hurting. She cried and wished she had listened to her mom. She learned that not all lizards are friendly and that some can be very dangerous.
