One day, Emily was walking by a huge gate with her mom. She wanted to go inside, but the gate was too high. Suddenly, Emily noticed a lady wearing a bright yellow dress. She had a big smile on her face. Emily asked the lady if she could go inside. The lady opened the gate and Emily walked in.
The inside of the gate was huge! There were lots of tall trees and pretty flowers. She saw a pond with a tiny bridge above it. Emily skipped over it and began to explore the other side.
The lady walked slowly behind Emily, trying to keep up. She was still wearing her yellow dress, and smiled whenever Emily found something new to explore. Emily enjoyed her time on the other side of the gate and didn't want to leave. But eventually it was time to go home. Emily thanked the lady for opening the huge gate and they went on their way.
