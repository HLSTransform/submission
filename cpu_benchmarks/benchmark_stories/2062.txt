Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved animals, especially puppies. One day, Lily's parents took her to the park to play. While they were there, a little puppy came up to Lily and wagged its tail. 
Lily was so happy to see the puppy and wanted to pet it. But her parents told her that she couldn't because they didn't know if the puppy was harmless or not. 
Lily didn't understand why she couldn't pet the puppy, so she asked her parents why. Her parents explained that sometimes puppies can be dangerous and might bite. They didn't want Lily to get hurt. 
Lily understood and agreed not to pet the puppy. She didn't want to get hurt either. The puppy seemed sad that Lily refused to pet him, but Lily's parents explained that it was for her safety. In the end, Lily went home happy and safe, knowing that she made the right choice.
