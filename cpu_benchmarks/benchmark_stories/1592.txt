Ben is a boy who likes to play with his dog, Rex. Rex is a big dog who can run fast and catch balls. Ben and Rex are best friends. They like to go to the park and have fun.
One day, Ben and Rex go to the park with Ben's mom. Ben's mom has a bag with meat and bread for lunch. She puts the bag on a bench and tells Ben and Rex to stay near her. But Rex smells the meat and wants to eat it. He runs to the bench and jumps on the bag.
Ben's mom sees Rex and shouts, "No, Rex! Bad dog! Leave the meat alone!" But Rex is deaf. He cannot hear Ben's mom. He only hears his tummy. He rips the bag and takes the meat. He runs away with the meat in his mouth.
Ben sees Rex and runs after him. He calls, "Rex, come back! Drop the meat! You are in trouble!" But Rex is deaf. He cannot hear Ben. He only sees the meat. He runs to a hill and eats the meat.
Ben's mom runs after Ben and Rex. She is angry and worried. She catches up with Ben and hugs him. She says, "Ben, are you okay? Rex is a naughty dog. He should not take the meat. He should listen to us." But Rex is deaf. He cannot hear Ben's mom. He only feels happy. He licks his lips and wags his tail. He loves Ben and Ben's mom. He thinks they are the best.
