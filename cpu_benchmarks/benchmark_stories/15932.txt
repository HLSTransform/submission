One day, Bob saw a big sheet. It was white and fluffy. He thought it was a good idea to play under it. So Bob walked over to the sheet and grabbed it with his little hands. He put it over his head so he could have a cozy place. But then he started to smell a bad smell. It was disgusting!
"Ugh!" he said.
Bob started to take off the sheet. He saw something big and slimy. It was a big frog!
"Ribbit!" said the frog.
Bob was so surprised that he stepped back.
"What are you doing here?" he asked.
"I was just looking for a warm place to sleep," answered the frog.
Bob smiled and said, "Maybe you can sleep without the sheet. It smells disgusting." 
The frog agreed and hopped away. Bob was so glad the frog was gone. He was happy he could play with the sheet again.
