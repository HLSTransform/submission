Once upon a time there were two friends, Tom and Lucy. Tom had a guitar and Lucy loved music. They decided to gather together in the park and play. 
Tom said to Lucy, "Let's make some music!" He held his guitar and strummed some chords. Lucy smiled, "That's wonderful! Your guitar is so flexible and plays nice tunes." 
Tom smiled back and said, "Let's make some more music with this guitar." So they gathered up some of their friends and taught them how to play the guitar. They played together in the park and had so much fun. 
Soon, songs filled the air and everyone danced and cheered. Tom and Lucy turned to each other and smiled in delight. 
They had gathered together and made beautiful music with their guitar!
