Tim likes to write. He has a big book and a blue pen. He writes about things he sees and things he dreams. He writes about his family and his friends. He writes about his toys and his pets.
One day, Tim goes to the sea with his mom and dad. He sees a big boat and many fish. He sees a big bird and a small crab. He sees a big whale and a small dolphin. He is very happy and excited. He wants to write about the sea.
He asks his mom for his book and his pen. His mom gives them to him. He sits on the sand and starts to write. He writes: "I see a big whale. It is gray and wet. It has a big tail and a small eye. It makes a loud sound. It is slow and gentle. I like the whale."
He shows his mom what he wrote. His mom smiles and hugs him. She says: "You are a good writer, Tim. You write very well. I am proud of you."
Tim smiles and hugs his mom. He says: "Thank you, mom. I love you. I love to write."
