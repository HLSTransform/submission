Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sophie. She liked to do puzzles, but her mum always told her to be careful when she did them.
One day, Sophie was playing with her puzzle when she found a tight spot. She tried to move the pieces around, but it was too hard. She decided to crawl underneath the table and take a closer look at the puzzle.
Suddenly, something grabbed her foot! It was her pet cat. The cat was trying to pull the puzzle piece out from Sophie's hand.
Sophie picked up the cat and said "No, no! Don't mess with my puzzle!" But the cat kept trying to grab the piece.
Sophie sighs and said "Cats! They just don't understand how to play with puzzles." Then she placed the cat onto the floor and scolded it "No more puzzles for you!"
The cat just meowed and went away. Sophie then managed to finish her puzzle, and found it to be even more fun now that she figured out the tight spot.
