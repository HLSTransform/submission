Once upon a time, there was a beautiful doll. Her name was Matilda, and she lived in a big white house.
One day, Matilda heard a ring. It was a special ring that meant she had to go to the hospital. Matilda was scared, but the people at the hospital were very kind. They said that Matilda needed an operation.
Matilda did not understand, so the people at the hospital explained. They said that the operation would help Matilda be healthy. All Matilda had to do was take deep breaths while they were doing the operation.
Matilda was still a bit scared, but she took a deep breath and looked around. Everything was very soft and gentle. Matilda felt safe and relaxed. Then, before she knew it, the operation was over. Matilda sighed in relief and smiled.
