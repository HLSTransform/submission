Once there was a woman who was very angry. She was so angry that she was shouting and slamming the door. She stomped into the bathroom, and saw the bathtub. 
The bathtub was full of water, and it looked so tempting to her. She was still angry and so she decided to jump in! She had a splash around for a few minutes before she started to feel better. 
When she got out of the bath she was no longer angry. She had calmed down and was feeling much happier. She made sure to leave the bathtub full of water for other people to enjoy!
