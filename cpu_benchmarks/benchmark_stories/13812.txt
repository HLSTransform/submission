Lily and Ben were twins. They liked to play with their toys and books. But they did not like to share. They always wanted the same thing.
One day, they found a big seat in the yard. It was red and soft and had wheels. Lily and Ben both wanted to sit on it and ride it. They ran to the seat and pushed each other.
"I saw it first!" Lily said.
"No, I did!" Ben said.
They both tried to climb on the seat, but it was too big for them. They fell off and bumped their heads. They cried and rubbed their heads.
Mom heard them and came to the yard. She saw the seat and the twins. She knew what happened.
"Come here, Lily and Ben," Mom said. "I have something to tell you."
Lily and Ben stopped crying and went to Mom. They were curious and hopeful.
Mom smiled and said, "This seat is not a toy. It is a stroller. It is for your baby brother, who will come soon. You can help me push him in the seat, but you cannot sit on it or ride it. It is not safe for you. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They were surprised and excited. They had a baby brother!
Mom hugged them and said, "You are going to be great big siblings. But you have to learn to share and be kind. Can you do that?"
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They thought about the seat and the baby. They wanted to be good and happy.
They nodded again and said, "Yes, Mom. We can do that."
Mom smiled and said, "Good. Now, let's go inside and have some cookies. And maybe later, we can lean on the seat and watch the birds."
Lily and Ben agreed. They followed Mom inside, holding hands. They forgot about the seat and the fight. They were looking forward to the baby.
