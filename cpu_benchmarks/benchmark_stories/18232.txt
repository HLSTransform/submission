Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim and his mom went to the store. They wanted to buy a toy. Tim saw a toy car. It was blue and icy. Tim liked the icy toy car. He asked his mom, "Can I have the car?" His mom looked at the price. The price was low. She said, "Yes, you can have the car."
When they got home, Tim was very happy. He wanted to play with his new toy car. He asked his mom, "Can I unpack the car now?" His mom said, "Yes, you can unpack the car." Tim unpacked the car. He played with it all day.
At night, Tim put his icy toy car next to his bed. He said goodnight to his mom. He was very happy with his new toy. Tim went to sleep with a big smile on his face.
