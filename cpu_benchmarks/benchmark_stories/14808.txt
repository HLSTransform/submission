Ben and his dad went to the farm to see the animals. Ben liked the cows, the pigs, and the chickens, but his favorite was the mule. The mule had big ears, a long nose, and a funny voice. Ben wanted to pet the mule and feed him some carrots.
"Can I go to the mule, dad?" Ben asked.
"Sure, son, but be careful. The mule can be stubborn and kick sometimes," dad said.
Ben ran to the mule and held out a carrot. The mule sniffed the carrot and took a bite. Ben smiled and stroked the mule's fur. He felt happy and brave.
"Hello, mule. You are my friend. Do you like carrots?" Ben said.
The mule nodded and made a loud sound. He sounded like he was laughing. Ben laughed too. He gave the mule another carrot and hugged his neck.
Suddenly, the mule sneezed. He sneezed so hard that he blew the carrot out of his mouth and onto Ben's face. Ben felt something wet and sticky on his cheek. He looked at the carrot and saw that it was covered with mule snot.
"Yuck!" Ben cried. He dropped the carrot and wiped his face with his sleeve. He felt embarrassed and gross.
The mule looked at Ben and made another loud sound. He sounded like he was teasing. Ben felt angry and sad.
"Stop it, mule. That's not nice. You are not my friend. You are mean," Ben said.
He ran away from the mule and back to his dad. He hugged his dad and told him what happened.
"I'm sorry, son. The mule didn't mean to hurt you. He was just playing. He likes you," dad said.
"Really?" Ben asked.
"Really. He's just a silly mule. He doesn't know how to behave. He needs to learn some manners," dad said.
"Can we leave now, dad? I don't want to see the mule anymore," Ben said.
"Okay, son. Let's go home. We can come back another day and see the other animals. Maybe the mule will be nicer then," dad said.
Ben nodded and held his dad's hand. They walked to the car and left the farm. Ben hoped the mule would say sorry next time. He still liked the mule, but he didn't like his snot.
