One day there was a fat pig and a little bunny. The bunny was very curious and asked the pig, "What are you doing?"
The pig was very busy, busy mixing mud.
The bunny asked, "Why?"
The pig replied, "Because muddy wallows are good for rolling around in!"
The bunny felt sad for a moment and said, "Oh no, I can't do that. I'm too small!"
The pig replied, "It's okay, you don't have to roll around in the mud. You can pick flowers if you want!"
The bunny smiled and began to pick some pretty yellow flowers in addition to the mud the pig was mixing.
However, the mud was becoming drier and drier and the pig wanted to roll around. The pig nudged the bunny and said, "You need to move! I want to roll in my muddy wallow now."
The bunny was not happy. He didn't think it was fair that the pig had all the mud and he had nothing. He said, "It's not fair. You have all the mud and I have nothing."
The pig thought for a moment and said, "I have an idea. Why don't you help me mix the mud? That way we can both play in it!"
The bunny was excited and agreed. They both worked together to mix the mud until it was the perfect consistency for rolling around in.
