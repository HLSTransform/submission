Once upon a time, there was a little baby named Lily. She loved to crawl around the house and explore new things. One day, she found a big figure in the living room. It was an enormous teddy bear! 
Lily crawled up to the teddy bear and hugged it tight. "Wow, this teddy is so big!" she said. 
Her mom came into the room and saw Lily with the teddy bear. "Do you like the teddy bear, Lily?" she asked. 
Lily nodded her head and said, "Yes, Mommy! It's enormous!" Her mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it, Lily." 
From that day on, Lily and the enormous teddy bear were inseparable. They played and crawled around the house together, and Lily was always happy to have her new friend by her side.
