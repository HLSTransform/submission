One day, Milly woke up feeling anxious. She was worried about a big test at school. She got up and went to the kitchen to eat some breakfast. Then Milly found a big white piece of paper on the kitchen table. She was happy and excited and got a big smile on her face. She ran to get a crayon and quickly began to draw a big rainbow on the paper. She made lots of colours and shapes, and when she was done she felt much less anxious. Then she carefully cut the rainbow into a hundred little pieces and scattered them around the room. She giggled and laughed, and it made her feel much more calm and ready to face the day.
