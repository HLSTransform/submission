Once upon a time, there was a stubborn mule. He lived on a farm near a big bridge. The mule was so stubborn that no matter how much the farmer tried, he couldn't get the mule to move.
One day, the farmer went for a walk. As he reached the bridge, he started to whistle. The mule heard the whistle and started to walk towards it. He was so excited to get to the farmer that he crossed the bridge and ran to the farmer's side.
The farmer was so happy to have the mule back with him. They both walked back over the bridge, the mule no longer stubborn. Every day after that, the farmer would whistle and the mule would come running. They were the best of friends.
