One day, Little Billy was playing with his toy cars. His brother, Peter, was eating an egg. Billy wanted to try the egg, so he asked, "Can I chew it?"
Peter said, "No, Billy. Eggs are too hard for you to chew!"
But Billy was feeling nosy. He wanted to try it anyway. So he said, "I want to try it! Please!"
Peter said, "OK. Be careful not to choke." Then he handed Billy the egg.
Billy tried to chew it. He chewed and chewed, but it was too hard. He couldn't chew up the egg. So he spat it out.
Peter smiled and said, "I told you it was too hard!"
