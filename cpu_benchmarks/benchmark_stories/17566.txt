Anna and Ben were friends who liked to jog. They jogged every day in the park, and they had fun. They saw birds, flowers, and other joggers. They said hello to everyone they met.
One night, Anna and Ben saw something unusual in the sky. It was a big ball of fire with a long tail. It was a comet. They had never seen a comet before. They were amazed and excited.
"Wow, look at that!" Anna said. "It is so bright and beautiful!"
"Yes, it is!" Ben said. "Do you think it is a wish comet?"
"A wish comet?" Anna asked. "What is that?"
Ben said, "A wish comet is a comet that can make your wish come true. You just have to close your eyes and say your wish out loud."
Anna and Ben liked the idea of a wish comet. They decided to try it. They closed their eyes and said their wishes.
"I wish for a new bike!" Anna said.
"I wish for a big cake!" Ben said.
They opened their eyes and waited for their wishes to come true. But nothing happened. The comet was still in the sky, but their wishes did not come true.
They felt sad and disappointed. They wondered why their wishes did not come true.
Then they heard a voice. It was an old man who was also jogging in the park. He had seen them make their wishes.
"Hello, children," he said. "I see you were trying to make a wish on the comet."
"Yes, we were," Anna said. "But it did not work. Why not?"
The old man smiled and said, "The comet is not a wish comet. It is just a comet. A comet is a big rock that flies around the sun. Sometimes we can see it from the earth. It is very rare and special, but it cannot make your wishes come true."
"Then how can we make our wishes come true?" Ben asked.
The old man said, "You can make your wishes come true by working hard, being kind, and helping others. Those are the things that make you happy and proud. The comet is a gift from nature, but it is not a magic wand. You have to make your own magic."
Anna and Ben thought about what the old man said. They realized he was right. They thanked him for his advice and said goodbye.
They looked at the comet again and smiled. They still thought it was beautiful, but they did not wish on it anymore. They decided to jog back home and work on their wishes.
The moral of the story is: You cannot rely on magic to make your wishes come true. You have to work hard, be kind, and help others.
