Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys. One day, he saw a large ball in the park. 
Timmy: "Wow! That ball is so big! I want to play with it."
A little girl named Sarah was playing with the ball. 
Timmy: "Can I play with your ball, please?"
Sarah: "Sure! I love sharing my toys with others."
Timmy was so happy to play with the large ball. He kicked it and threw it in the air. Sarah and Timmy played together for a long time. 
Timmy: "Thank you for sharing your ball with me. I had so much fun playing with you."
Sarah: "You're welcome! I love making new friends." 
From that day on, Timmy and Sarah played together often and became the best of friends.
