Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing outside and making new friends. One day, Timmy went to the park and met a new friend named Billy. They played together all day and had so much fun. 
As the sun started to set, Timmy realized he had to go home. He said goodbye to Billy and started walking home. But as he walked, he began to worry. He couldn't remember where his house was! He started to feel scared and sad.
Luckily, Timmy had a good memory and remembered that his house was near the big tree. He found his way home and was so relieved. From that day on, Timmy always paid attention to his surroundings and never got lost again. The moral of the story is that it's important to pay attention and be aware of your surroundings so you don't get lost and feel tired from worry.
