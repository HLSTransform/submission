Sara and Ben were eager to play in the park. They ran to the big slide and climbed up the ladder. Sara went first and slid down with a whoosh. Ben followed her and laughed.
"Let's play hide and seek!" Sara said. "I will count and you hide."
"Okay!" Ben said. He ran away to find a good spot. Sara closed her eyes and counted to ten.
"Ready or not, here I come!" Sara shouted. She opened her eyes and searched for Ben. She looked behind the swings, under the bench, and in the sandbox. She could not find him.
"Where are you, Ben?" Sara called. She heard a giggle from behind a palm tree. She ran to the tree and peeked around it. There was Ben, hiding behind the big green leaves.
"I found you!" Sara said. She grabbed Ben's hand and pulled him out.
"You are good at searching!" Ben said. He smiled and hugged Sara.
"You are good at hiding!" Sara said. She smiled and hugged Ben back.
They were happy to be friends. They decided to play some more. They did not see the big dog that was running towards them. The dog liked to chase children. It barked and ran faster. Sara and Ben did not hear it. They were in for a surprise.
