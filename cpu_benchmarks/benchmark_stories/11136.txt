Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had an adorable toy pistol. He loved to play with it all day long. One sunny day, Tim went to the park to play with his friends.
At the park, Tim saw his friend, Sally. Sally was playing with her toy spreader. She was spreading sand all around her. Tim walked up to Sally and said, "Hi Sally! I have my pistol. Do you want to play together?"
Sally smiled and said, "Yes, Tim! Let's play! I can spread sand, and you can use your pistol!" So, Tim and Sally played together at the park. They had a lot of fun with their toys.
As the day went on, more friends came to the park. They all played together, spreading sand and using their toy pistols. It was a fun day for everyone, and Tim was so happy to share his adorable pistol with his friends.
