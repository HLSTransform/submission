Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she went to the ice cream truck to get a treat. She looked at all the flavors and tried to decide which one she wanted. 
The man in the truck was very rude and told her to hurry up and order. Lily felt sad and didn't know what to do. She looked down at her hand and saw a pretty flower she had picked. She decided to give the flower to the man and ask him to be nicer. 
The man smiled and said thank you. He realized he had been rude and promised to be kinder to everyone. Lily was happy she could make a difference with just a simple flower. She enjoyed her ice cream and went home with a big smile on her face. The end.
