Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was very impatient and was always looking for something to do. 
One day she saw a chair. She ran over to the chair and said, “This is perfect. I can sit on it and have fun!” 
Suddenly, her mom came into the room. She said, “Come here and help me, sweetheart. I need your help.” 
The little girl was very impatient. She said, “But mama, I don’t want to come. I want to stay here with the chair.” 
Her mom said, “Please come, my love. This will be a lot of fun. I promise.” 
The little girl finally agreed and ran over to her mom. They had a lot of fun working together. And the little girl never forgot how much fun she had helping her mom.
