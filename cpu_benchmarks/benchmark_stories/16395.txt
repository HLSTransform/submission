Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play outside. They plan to go to the park today. They put on their coats and hats. It is cold outside.
They walk to the park. They see a big slide. They want to go on the slide. But there is a problem. The slide is wet. It rained last night. Sara and Ben are sad.
They see a boy and a girl. They have towels. They are wiping the slide. They are making it dry. Sara and Ben go to them. They say hello.
"Can we help you?" Sara asks.
"Sure, you can. We are making the slide dry. Then we can all play on it." The boy says.
"That is very nice of you. Thank you for sharing." Ben says.
They all work together. They use the towels. They make the slide dry. Then they take turns. They go on the slide. They have fun. They laugh and smile.
The sun comes out. It makes the park bright. It makes them warm. They are happy.
The moral of the story is: Sharing and helping others can make everyone happy.
