Once upon a time, there was a happy boy named Tim. He loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, he saw a police officer in a uniform walking by. The officer looked very important and Tim felt eager to talk to him.
"Hello officer, what are you doing?" Tim asked. The officer smiled and said he was keeping everyone safe. Tim thought that was really cool and he wanted to be a police officer too when he grew up.
The officer talked to Tim for a little while and even let him try on his hat. Tim felt very special and happy. From that day on, he always waved at the officers he saw and felt proud of their uniforms.
