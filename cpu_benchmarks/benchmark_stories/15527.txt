Once upon a time, there was a bowl. It happened that the bowl had some easy things inside. It had some balls, a toy car and a toy robot. 
One day, the bowl started to move on its own. No one knew how or why this happened. But the bowl kept bouncing and rolling around the room. 
The ball, car and robot were having lots of fun. They kept falling in and out of the bowl. They laughed and cheered as the bowl spun around. 
 
The bowl was an easy ride for the toys. They kept asking it to go faster. But sooner or later it always came to a stop. That was the end of their fun. 
The toys were sad when the bowl stopped. But then it started to happen again and again. Each time, they had a different game to play. 
The bowl kept on rolling, taking the toys on a fun new adventure. It was always an easy and exciting ride!
