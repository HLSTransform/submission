A great elephant was walking through the forest. He was feeling very happy, but he didn't know that danger was ahead. Suddenly the elephant came across a hunter with a gun. The hunter wanted to punish the elephant for coming too close. The elephant was scared and ran away as fast as it could.
The hunter chased the elephant, but it was no use. The elephant was too fast and soon it escaped. The hunter was furious and wanted to punish the elephant, but it was too late.
The elephant was relieved that it had escaped punishment. It was so grateful that it could be free and enjoy the great forest. It was a happy elephant after that day.
