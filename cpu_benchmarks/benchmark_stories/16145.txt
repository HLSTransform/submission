Once upon a time, there was a girl called June. Every day, she would go to the city with her dad to have fun.
One day, when they were at the city, June saw something very special. She saw a big door made of metal with a big red lock on it. Her dad said to her, "That lock is special. You have to Unlock it with something special."
June was puzzled. She asked her dad, "What do I need to unlock it?"
"You need to be gentle and try to find the small key that opens it," her dad said.
June tried hard to be gentle and eventually found the key. She excitedly opened the lock and what she saw amazed her.
Inside the locked door, there were an amazing city full of lights and fun activities. She gasped in wonder and felt happy that she could Unlock the door.
June and her dad went through the door and enjoyed the city together. They both had a great time and knew unlocking the door was worth it.
