Once upon a time there was a jet. It cut through the sky like a knife. It was very fast and strong. But one day it ran into something rough. It was a mountain. The jet was stuck.
The pilot was worried. He looked all around. Then he saw something. It was a saw. It had big, sharp teeth. The pilot knew what he had to do. He grabbed the saw and started to cut. He cut and he cut, until finally the jet was free.
The pilot was relieved. He thanked the saw for helping him. The jet flew up into the sky and away. The pilot and the jet lived happily ever after.
