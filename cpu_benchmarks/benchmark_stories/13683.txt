Tim and Kim were twins who liked to play with toys. They had many toys in their room upstairs, but they always wanted more. One day, they saw a big store with many new toys in the window. They asked their mom if they could go inside and look.
Mom said yes, but they had to be careful and stay close to her. She also said they could not buy any toys, because they already had enough. Tim and Kim nodded, but they did not listen. They ran into the store and looked at all the toys. They saw cars, dolls, balls, puzzles, and books. They wanted them all.
They each grabbed a toy and tried to hide it in their pockets. They thought they were lucky and smart. They did not see the store man watching them. He saw them take the toys and he was angry. He called mom and told her what they did. Mom was very sad and mad. She made them give back the toys and say sorry. She also made them go home without any treats.
Tim and Kim felt bad. They knew they did a wrong thing. They learned that stealing is not good and that they should be happy with what they have. They also learned that they should listen to mom and be careful in the store. They hugged mom and said sorry again. They went to their room upstairs and played with their old toys. They realized they had many toys and they did not need more. They were not lucky and smart, they were silly and naughty. They decided to be good and share their toys from then on.
