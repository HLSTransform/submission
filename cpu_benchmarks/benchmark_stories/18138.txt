Once upon a time, there was a big, old tree in the west. The tree was very tall and had lots of branches. The animals in the forest loved to play around the old tree. One day, a little squirrel named Sammy was misbehaving. He was jumping on the branches and not being very careful. The other animals told Sammy to behave and be more careful. 
Sammy felt bad and decided to listen to his friends. He started to climb the tree slowly and carefully. As he climbed higher, he saw a beautiful sunset in the west. The sky was orange and pink, and the clouds looked like cotton candy. Sammy was so happy he decided to share the beautiful sight with his friends. 
From that day on, Sammy always behaved when he was playing around the old tree. He knew that being careful was important, and he didn't want to get hurt or make his friends worry. The animals in the forest were proud of Sammy for learning to behave and always looked forward to watching the sunset in the west together.
