Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She wanted to go on a journey to see the stars. She asked her mommy, "Can we buy a rocket ship to see the stars?" Her mommy said, "Yes, we can buy a rocket ship."
So, they went to the store to buy a rocket ship. It was a dark and scary store, but they found the rocket ship. They bought it and flew to space. Lily was so happy to see the stars. She said, "Mommy, look at the stars! They are so pretty!" Her mommy said, "Yes, they are beautiful. I'm glad we went on this journey together."
