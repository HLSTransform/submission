Lily was a little girl who liked to examine everything. She would look at the flowers, the bugs, the books, and the toys with her big eyes. She wanted to learn about the world.
One day, she was in her room and she saw something new on the ceiling. It was a shiny star that her mom had put there. Lily was curious and wanted to examine it. She climbed on her bed and reached for the star.
"Be careful, Lily!" her mom said from the door. "You might fall and hurt yourself. The star is just for looking, not for touching."
But Lily did not listen. She wanted to touch the star and see how it felt. She stretched her arm and grabbed the star. But the star was not strong. It broke off the ceiling and fell on the floor. Lily fell too and bumped her head.
"Ow!" Lily cried. "Mommy, help!"
Her mom ran to her and hugged her. She checked her head and saw a small bump. She kissed it and said, "You are lucky, Lily. It is not a big hurt. But you should have listened to me. The star was not for touching. It was for making your room pretty and bright. Now it is broken and you are sad."
Lily looked at the broken star and felt sorry. She said, "I'm sorry, Mommy. I was silly. I wanted to examine the star, but I should have looked with my eyes, not with my hands."
Her mom smiled and said, "It's okay, Lily. I forgive you. You are a smart girl and you like to examine things. But you have to be careful and respectful. Some things are not for touching. They are for admiring. And some things are for touching. They are for playing. You have to know the difference."
Lily nodded and said, "I understand, Mommy. Thank you for teaching me. Can we fix the star?"
Her mom said, "Maybe we can. But first, let's have some lunch. You must be hungry after all that examining."
Lily said, "Yes, Mommy. I'm hungry. Can we have some soup and bread?"
Her mom said, "Sure, Lily. Let's go to the kitchen and have some soup and bread. And maybe a cookie for dessert."
Lily smiled and said, "Yay! I love soup and bread and cookies. And I love you, Mommy."
Her mom said, "I love you too, Lily. You are my sweet star."
