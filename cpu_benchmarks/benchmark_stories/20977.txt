The little girl nodded her head and looked up at her mommy.
"Mommy," she asked, "where is the toilet?"
Her mommy nodded and pointed towards the other room. "That's the toilet", she said. The little girl nodded and started walking slowly towards the room.
The room was very dull. The walls were white and the floor was wooden. There was a toilet in the corner of the room. She went closer to see it. It was a bright white toilet with a shiny lid. The little girl nodded and smiled, she was happy to see such a nice toilet.
She then went back to her mommy and nodded happily. "Mommy," she said, "I saw the toilet. It was very nice!" Her mommy nodded and smiled. She was glad her little girl was happy.
