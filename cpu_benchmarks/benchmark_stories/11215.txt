Jack was a young boy and he used to live in the city. He heard traffic sounds every day. He wasn't used to so much noise.
One day, Jack heard a very different sound. It sounded like a human singing. He looked around to find its source.
He saw an old woman singing on the street corner. Jack was so amazed. He asked the woman, "What are you singing?"
The old woman looked at him and said, "It's an old lullaby. I used to sing it when I was young."
Jack said, "Can you teach me how to sing it?"
The old woman smiled and said, "Yes, I will teach you. Let's start now."
As the two were singing, Jack forgot the traffic sound he usually heard. He enjoyed singing the lullaby with the old woman.
