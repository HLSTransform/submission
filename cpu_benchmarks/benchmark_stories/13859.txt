Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a modest temple. The temple was pretty, with a big tree outside. People liked to visit the temple and say "hello" to the kind man who took care of it.
One day, a little girl named Lily went to the temple with her mom. They saw the kind man and said, "Hello, can we mark the tree with our names?" The kind man smiled and said, "Yes, you can."
Lily and her mom took a small rock and marked the tree with their names. They were happy to see their names on the tree. They said "thank you" to the kind man and went back to their home. Now, every time they visited the temple, they would see their names on the tree and remember that special day.
