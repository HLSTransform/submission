Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Haley. She was three years old and loved to dance. Every day she would dance around her house, twirling and spinning and laughing with delight.
One day, Haley wanted to dance outside in the sunshine but her mom said she had to stay safe. She wanted to keep Haley safe from any harm. So, Haley stayed in the house and she was sad.
But then a wonderful idea came to her. She wanted to make a special safe place outside for her to dance. She made a big circle out of branches and twigs and she filled it with grass. Then she called it her Fit Circle.
She danced in her Fit Circle and she was so happy. The sun shone down on her like a warm hug. Haley danced and spun and twirled until she was all out of breath. Then she lay down in the grass and smiled at the beautiful sky above her.
Now, Haley can dance outside safely in her Fit Circle. She is fit and safe and happy, and she always will be.
