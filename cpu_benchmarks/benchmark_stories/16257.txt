Once upon a time, there was a wealthy seal. He had a lot of money, and he liked to give it away. One day, he was swimming in the ocean when he met a small girl.
Girl: "Hello, sir seal. Can you give me some money?"
The seal thought carefully. He saw that the girl was very poor and had a lot of need. So he asked her a question.
Seal: "What would you do with the money?"
Girl: "I would use it to buy food and clothes for my family."
The seal was touched by her request. He decided to give the girl some of his wealth. The seal gave the girl enough money to buy food and clothes for her family.
Girl: "Thank you, sir seal. You are very kind."
The seal smiled and swam away. The little girl went home and was happy that she had been able to help her family with the seal's generous gift.
