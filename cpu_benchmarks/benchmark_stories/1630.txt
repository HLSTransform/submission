Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big pot on a bench. The pot is shiny and has flowers on it.
"Look, a pot!" Tom says. "Let's play with it!"
"OK!" Sue says. They run to the bench and take the pot. They pretend it is a hat, a drum, and a boat.
But then, a lady comes to the bench. She looks worried. She has a basket with bread and cheese. She looks for the pot.
"Where is my pot?" she says. "I need it for my picnic!"
Tom and Sue hear the lady. They feel bad. They know they took the pot.
"Uh-oh," Tom says. "We have to give the pot back."
"Yes," Sue says. "But how?"
They think for a moment. Then, they have an idea. They put the pot on the ground. They walk to the lady. They smile and say hello.
"Hello, kids," the lady says. "Do you know where my pot is?"
Tom and Sue point to the pot. They say, "We are sorry. We played with your pot. It is very pretty. Here it is."
The lady sees the pot. She is happy. She says, "Thank you, kids. You are very kind. You can have some bread and cheese if you want."
Tom and Sue say, "Thank you, lady. You are very nice. We like bread and cheese."
They sit with the lady and share the picnic. They talk and laugh. They are friends. They are happy.
