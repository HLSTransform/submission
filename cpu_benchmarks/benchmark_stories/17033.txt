Ben and Mia were playing in the park. They liked to run and slide and swing. They saw a big furry dog with a red collar. The dog was barking and wagging its tail.
"Can we pet the dog?" Mia asked Ben.
"OK, but be careful," Ben said. They walked slowly to the dog and reached out their hands. The dog licked their fingers and let them touch its fur.
"Hello, doggy," Mia said. "You are so soft and warm."
The dog's owner was sitting on a bench. He was reading a book and did not see the kids. He did not hear the dog bark louder and louder.
Suddenly, the dog bit Mia's arm. Mia screamed and cried. Ben tried to pull the dog away, but the dog was too strong. The dog bit Ben's leg. Ben screamed and cried too.
"Stop, stop, stop!" they shouted. "Help, help, help!"
The dog's owner looked up and saw what was happening. He ran to the dog and grabbed its collar. He yelled at the dog and hit it. He pulled the dog away from the kids.
"I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry," he said. "Are you OK? Do you need a doctor?"
Ben and Mia were bleeding and hurt. They were scared and angry. They did not want to talk to the dog's owner. They wanted their mom and dad.
They ran to their clothes on the grass. They put on their jackets and hats. They left the park and went home. They never played with a furry dog again.
