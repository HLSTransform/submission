Ben and Lily were playing in the yard. They liked to make things with sticks and stones and leaves. They made a house, a car, a boat and a chain. The chain was long and shiny. They used silver paper and tape to make it.
"Look at our chain!" Ben said. "It is so pretty. We can mail it to grandma. She will like it."
"Yes, let's mail it to grandma!" Lily said. "She will be happy. How do we mail it?"
Ben thought for a moment. He saw a big box near the fence. It had a hole on the top. He ran to the box and lifted the chain.
"Here, Lily, help me put the chain in the box. This is the mail box. We can mail things in it."
Lily ran to help Ben. They put the chain in the box. They were proud of their work.
"Bye bye, chain!" they said. "Have a nice trip to grandma!"
They went back to play with their other things. They did not see the rain clouds in the sky. Soon, it started to rain. The rain was heavy and cold. It made everything wet.
The box got wet. The hole got bigger. The chain got wet. It slipped out of the box. It fell on the ground. It got dirty and muddy.
Ben and Lily did not know. They ran inside the house. They were wet and cold. They changed their clothes and had some hot chocolate. They forgot about the chain.
The next day, they went to the yard again. They saw the box. It was soggy and torn. They saw the chain. It was dirty and dull.
"Oh no!" Ben said. "Our chain! It is ruined! It did not mail to grandma!"
"Oh no!" Lily said. "Our chain! It is ugly! Grandma will not like it!"
They were sad. They picked up the chain. They tried to clean it. But it was too wet and sticky. They threw it away.
They learned a lesson. They learned that rain can make things wet. They learned that wet things can get spoiled. They learned that mail boxes are not for chains. They learned that they should ask mom or dad before they mail anything.
