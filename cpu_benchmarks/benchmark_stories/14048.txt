Once there was a family who went on a camping trip. They had a fun time, but when they were packing up to leave, the mom noticed something weird. One of the big rocks next to the campfire had a crack in it and there was something inside the crack.
The mom got closer and saw that there was a little green frog in the crack. She thought it was so strange and weird. She tried to take the little frog out of the crack but he was too fast and he disappeared. 
They looked everywhere for the little frog, but he was nowhere to be found. They looked and looked, but eventually the little family had to give up the search. 
The family was sad that the little frog disappeared, but they still had a nice time on their camping trip. They would never forget the weird little frog they almost found.
