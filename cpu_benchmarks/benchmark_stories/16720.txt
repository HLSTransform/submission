Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They like to slide, swing and run. One day, they see a new boy in the park. He has a big truck toy. Sara and Ben want to play with the truck.
They go to the new boy and say hello. They ask him his name. He says his name is Max. They ask him if they can play with his truck. He says no. He says it is his truck and he does not share. He says they can go away.
Sara and Ben are sad and angry. They think Max is mean. They want to play with the truck. They try to take the truck from Max. Max does not let them. He pushes them away. He makes them fall. Sara and Ben get hurt. They cry.
A lady comes to the park. She is Max's mom. She sees what is happening. She is not happy. She goes to Max and scolds him. She tells him to share his truck and be nice. She tells him to say sorry to Sara and Ben. She tells him to welcome them as friends.
Max feels bad. He sees that Sara and Ben are hurt. He says sorry to them. He gives them his truck. He asks them if they want to play with him. Sara and Ben stop crying. They smile. They say yes. They say thank you. They welcome him as a friend.
They all play together in the park. They have fun. They share the truck. They slide, swing and run. They are happy.
