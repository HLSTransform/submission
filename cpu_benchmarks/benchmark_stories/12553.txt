Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with blocks. They make towers and houses and cars with the blocks. They have fun and laugh a lot.
One day, Anna and Ben go to the park with their moms. They bring their blocks with them. They find a nice spot under a big tree. They start to build with the blocks. They make a big castle with a bridge and a flag.
"Look at our castle!" Anna says. "It is so pretty and strong!"
"Yes, it is!" Ben says. "We are good builders!"
They are very cheerful and proud of their work.
Then they hear a sound. It is the ice cream truck. They love ice cream. They run to their moms and ask for some.
"Can we have ice cream, please?" Anna and Ben say.
"Sure, you can," their moms say. "But don't forget your blocks. They are yours and you need to take them home."
"OK, we won't forget," Anna and Ben say.
They get their ice cream and eat it. It is yummy and cold. They lick their cones and smile.
They see some other kids playing on the swings and the slide. They want to play too. They run to join them. They have more fun and laugh more.
They forget their blocks. They forget their castle. They forget their promise.
They play until it is time to go home. Their moms call them.
"Come on, Anna and Ben, it is time to go home," their moms say.
"OK, we are coming," Anna and Ben say.
They run to their moms. They hug them and say thank you for the ice cream and the park.
They get in the car and drive away.
They forget their blocks. They forget their castle. They forget their promise.
Under the big tree, the blocks are still there. The castle is still there. The flag is still there.
But Anna and Ben are not there.
They forgot.
