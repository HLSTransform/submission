Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jake. He was three years old and loved to explore. One day, he asked his mum if he could go on an adventure and explore different places.
Mum said, “Yes, as long as you stay calm and stay in the places I allow you to.”
“Okay,” said Jake. He packed a bag with some snacks and a map and set off.
He explored a meadow, a stream and a pond, and then came to a small cave. It looked dark, but he was brave.
“Mum, can I go inside?” he asked.
Mum thought for a moment, and then said, “Yes, but only if you remain calm.”
So, Jake went inside the cave. It was cool and damp, with a few rocks and stones. He explored each corner and soon found a very special place. It was his own secret spot — a little area which was all his own.
“Mum, look!” he said proudly. “This is mine!”
Mum smiled and allowed Jake to keep exploring his special spot. Jake felt happy and calm in his little area, and returned there many more times. He had found his own special place — one that only he was allowed to explore.
