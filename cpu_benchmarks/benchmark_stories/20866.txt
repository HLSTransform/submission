Max was excited about his first day at the park. He was so excited that he lay down on the grass and started to look for four-leaf clovers. After a few minutes, he noticed something shiny next to him. It was a penny!
Max was very happy that he had found the penny and he jumped up and down, screaming with joy. He lay back down to look for more coins, but a gush of wind blew the penny away. Max started to cry, he was so sad that he had lost his penny!
Max started to look around the park for his penny, but he couldn't find it. He started to get frustrated, he wanted his penny back.
Then Max had an idea, he ran back to the exact spot where he found the penny, and lay down again. He closed his eyes and concentrated, and sure enough there was the penny! He was very excited that he had found it, and he picked it up and put it in his pocket.
Max had his penny back, and he ran off to show all of his friends how he had found it!
