Once upon a time, in a land full of yellow, there lived a big lion who loved to roar. One day, the lion met a small mouse. The mouse was scared of the lion's big roar. The lion said, "Don't be scared, little mouse. I won't hurt you."
The lion saw that the mouse was eating a potato. The lion had never seen a potato before. "What is that?" the lion asked. The mouse said, "This is a potato. It is very yummy. Would you like to try it?" The lion nodded and took a small bite. He liked it a lot!
Later, the lion got caught in a big net. He roared and roared, but he could not get out. The little mouse heard the lion's roars and remembered how the lion had been nice to him. The mouse ran to the lion and used his sharp teeth to cut the net. The lion was free!
The lion thanked the mouse and said, "You are small, but you are very brave. I am glad we are friends." The mouse smiled and said, "We are friends because you were kind to me." And from that day on, the lion and the mouse were best friends, and they always helped each other. The moral of the story is to be kind to everyone, no matter how big or small they are.
