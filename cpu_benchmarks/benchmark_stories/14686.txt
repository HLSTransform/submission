Once upon a time there was an old man and an old woman. One day the old man was walking in the forest when he noticed a deer. The deer was old and tired and wandered slowly amongst the trees. The old man was very kind and decided to help the deer. He offered it some food and the deer happily accepted. As the old man continued to feed the deer, it became better and more energetic. Then one day, the old man noticed something very special - the deer smiled at him! Ever since then, the deer and the old man have been the best of friends.
