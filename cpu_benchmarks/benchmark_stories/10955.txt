Once upon a time, there was a fat cat named Tom. Tom liked to eat a lot. His friend, a small dog named Max, liked to help Tom. Max would load Tom's food into a big bowl every day, in the right order: first the dry food, then the wet food, and last, a yummy treat.
One day, Max saw a big, tall tree. Max thought it would be fun to play in the tree. He ran to Tom and said, "Let's play in the tree!" Tom tried to climb the tree, but he was too fat. Max felt sad for Tom and thought of a plan.
Max started to load Tom's food in a new order: first a little dry food, then a lot of wet food, and no treats. After some days, Tom became less fat. Max asked Tom to try to climb the tree again. This time, Tom could climb the tree! Tom and Max played in the tree and had a lot of fun. They learned that eating the right food in the right order can make you strong and happy.
