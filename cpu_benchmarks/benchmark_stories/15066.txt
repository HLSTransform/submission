Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Anna who loved to visit her grandmother.
One day, Anna asked her grandmother: "What is history?" 
Her grandmother smiled and said: "History is the stories of things that happened a long time ago!"
Anna was so curious that she asked her grandmother to tell her a story. Her grandmother told her a story about a pink castle that had a lot of history. Anna listened so carefully as her grandmother described all the wonderful things that happened in the old castle. 
The story excited Anna so much that she asked her grandmother if she could visit the castle. Her grandmother said that she would take Anna to visit the castle the next day. 
Anna could not believe it! She was so excited she put on her best pink dress and was ready to visit the pink castle! 
When they arrived at the castle, Anna could not believe her eyes. It was so beautiful! She and her grandmother spent the whole day exploring the history of the castle. It was a day Anna would never forget!
