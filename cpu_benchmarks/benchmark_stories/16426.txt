Lily was a little bee who liked to fly around the flowers and make honey. She worked hard every day with her friends, but she was not happy. She wanted to see more of the world and have adventures.
One day, she saw a big bird flying high in the sky. She thought the bird looked beautiful and free. She decided to follow the bird and see where it went. She flew away from the flowers and the hive, and did not tell anyone.
The bird flew over the trees and the hills, and Lily followed. She saw many new things, but she also felt scared and tired. She did not know where she was or how to go back. She wished she had stayed with her friends.
She flew closer to the bird and tried to talk to it. She said, "Hello, bird. You are very pretty and fast. Where are you going?"
The bird looked at her and said, "I am going to my nest. Why are you following me? You are not a bird. You are a bee. You should go back to your hive and make honey."
Lily felt sad and ashamed. She said, "I am sorry, bird. I wanted to see the world and have fun. I did not think about my friends or my honey. I was silly and selfish."
The bird said, "It is okay, bee. You made a mistake, but you can learn from it. The world is big and wonderful, but it can also be dangerous and lonely. You have a home and a family who love you and need you. You have a gift and a duty to make honey and share it with others. That is not ordinary. That is special. Go back to your hive and be happy."
Lily thanked the bird and flew back to her hive. She was glad to see her friends and her honey. She told them what happened and said she was sorry. They forgave her and welcomed her back. She learned to be grateful and content with what she had. She still liked to see the flowers and the sky, but she never followed the bird again. She realized that being a bee was not ordinary. It was extraordinary.
