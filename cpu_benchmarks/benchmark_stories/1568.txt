Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved cookies very much. One day, her mom baked some delicious cookies for her. But when Lily went to the kitchen to get a cookie, she saw that all the cookies were gone. Someone had stolen them!
Lily was frightened and started to cry. She looked around the kitchen and saw her little brother with crumbs all over his face. He had stolen all the cookies! Lily's mom scolded her little brother and told him it was not nice to steal. Lily forgave her brother and shared the last cookie with him. From that day on, they always shared their cookies and never stole from each other again.
