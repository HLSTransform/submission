Tom and Mia are twins. They like to play together, but they are also competitive. They want to be the best at everything. One day, they find a big box in the attic. They wonder what is inside.
"Let's open it!" Tom says.
"No, I want to open it!" Mia says.
They both pull on the box, but it is too heavy. They start to argue and push each other.
"Stop it!" their mom says. She comes into the attic and sees the box. "This is a special box. It has something from your grandma. She gave it to me before she went to heaven."
Tom and Mia stop fighting. They feel sorry and hug their mom.
"What is it, mom?" they ask.
Mom smiles and opens the box. She takes out a beautiful dress. It is red and shiny. It feels soft and smooth. It is made of velvet.
"This is the dress your grandma wore when she married your grandpa. She loved this dress very much. She wanted me to have it, and now I want you to have it."
Tom and Mia touch the dress gently. They discover how nice it feels. They also see a picture of their grandma and grandpa in the box. They look happy and young.
"Wow, grandma was so pretty!" Mia says.
"And grandpa was so handsome!" Tom says.
Mom hugs them and says, "You are right. They were very pretty and handsome. And they loved each other very much. And they loved you very much, too. Just like I do."
Tom and Mia hug their mom back. They forget about being competitive. They are happy to share the dress and the picture. They thank their mom and their grandma for the special gift.
