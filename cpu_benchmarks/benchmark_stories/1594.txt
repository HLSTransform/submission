Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play with their toys. They had many toys, but their favorite was a white train that could make sounds and move on the tracks. They always shared the train and took turns to drive it.
One day, their mom gave them a banana each for a snack. Lily ate her banana quickly and threw the peel in the trash. Ben ate his banana slowly and enjoyed every bite. He left the peel on the floor and ran to play with the train.
Lily saw the peel and said, "Ben, you should put your peel in the trash. It is not good to leave it on the floor. Someone might slip and get hurt." But Ben did not listen. He said, "I will do it later. I want to play with the train now. It is my turn."
Lily was angry and said, "No, it is not your turn. You did not finish your snack. You have to delay your play until you clean up your mess." But Ben did not listen. He said, "No, I will not delay. I want to play now. You are mean." He grabbed the train and pushed Lily away.
Lily was sad and cried. She went to tell their mom what happened. Mom came and saw the peel on the floor. She said, "Ben, you were very naughty. You did not listen to your sister. You did not put your peel in the trash. You did not share the train. You made Lily cry. You have to say sorry to her and give her the train."
Ben felt ashamed and sorry. He said, "I am sorry, Lily. I was wrong. I should have listened to you. I should have put my peel in the trash. I should have shared the train. You are a good sister. Can you forgive me?" Lily smiled and said, "I forgive you, Ben. You are a good brother. Can we play together?" Ben nodded and said, "Yes, we can play together. But first, let me put my peel in the trash."
They hugged and went to play with the train. They took turns and had fun. Mom was happy and said, "That's good. You learned your lesson. You should always be careful, respectful, and kind. That is how you get along with others."
The moral of the story is: You should not be selfish and careless. You should listen to others and clean up your mess. You should share and be nice. That is how you make friends and have fun.
