One day, there was a traffic jam on the road. Cars were everywhere, and the people in the cars were very frightened. Then, an engine arrived to help supply the traffic. It had a long hose, and sprayed extra fuel on the cars so they could move faster. Everybody cheered and smiled. Even the frightened people were happy, because they could continue on their journey. The engine and its hose made the traffic a lot better!
