Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, they decided to go on an adventure. Lily's friend, Timmy, said, "I will lead the way!" They followed Timmy through the forest until they found a big hole in the ground. 
Lily said, "That looks scary!" Timmy replied, "Don't worry, I know a fancy way to get across." He took out a rope and tied it to a tree. Then he swung across the hole like a monkey. Lily and her friends followed him and made it safely to the other side. 
Lily said, "Thank you for leading us, Timmy. That was so much fun!" They continued on their adventure, exploring the forest and finding new things to see. Lily felt happy and grateful to have such a brave friend like Timmy.
