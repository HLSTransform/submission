John and mum were walking around in the park. They saw a skull on the ground. John asked his mum what it was and she told him it was a skull. John wanted to take it home and keep it for himself. 
Mum was thoughtful about it and said it was okay to take it but they must take care of it. John was very happy he now owned the skull. 
They went home and John put the skull on a shelf. Every day John would wash and brush it, until it was nice and clean. 
John and mum talked every day about the skull, they thought of funny stories to tell it and asked it questions. 
John said he was the proud owner of the skull and he would take good care of it. He promised the skull it would have a long and happy life with him.
