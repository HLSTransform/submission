Once there was a wealthy man who owned a metal box. He was very proud of the box and kept it in a safe place. One day, he decided to take it outside and show it off to his friends. He went out into the field, with the box in his hands, and he smiled as he admired how shiny it was.
Suddenly, he heard a spring. It was coming from the box. He opened it, and out jumped a small mouse. The mouse felt so scared that it ran away. The wealthy man was very angry and threw the box on the floor in frustration. The metal was bent and dented, and he knew it would never be the same again. He was very sad and walked back home, feeling despondent. The wealthy man never spoke of the box again.
