Tom and Anna are playing with their toys in the living room. Tom has a telephone that makes noises and lights up. Anna has a doll that she likes to dress up. Tom thinks his telephone is more fun than Anna's doll. He says to Anna, "My telephone is powerful. It can talk and beep and flash. Your doll is boring. It can only wear clothes."
Anna feels sad and angry. She says to Tom, "My doll is not boring. She is my friend. She can smile and hug and sing. Your telephone is noisy and rude. It can only annoy people."
Tom and Anna start to argue. They raise their voices and pull each other's toys. Their mom hears them and comes to the living room. She sees them fighting and says, "Stop it, both of you. You are being unkind and selfish. You should share your toys and play nicely. How would you feel if someone took your toy and said mean things about it?"
Tom and Anna look at their mom and feel ashamed. They say, "Sorry, mom. Sorry, Anna. Sorry, Tom." They hug and apologize to each other. They decide to swap their toys and try them out. Tom gives his telephone to Anna and Anna gives her doll to Tom. They press the buttons and make the noises. They dress up the doll and make her sing. They find out that both toys are fun and interesting. They laugh and enjoy playing together.
Their mom smiles and says, "That's better. I'm proud of you. You learned to respect and appreciate each other's toys. You also learned to be generous and curious. You are good children. Now, why don't you call grandma with the telephone and tell her about your day?"
Tom and Anna nod and say, "Yes, mom. We love you. We love grandma. We love our toys." They pick up the telephone and dial the number. They hope grandma will answer and hear their happy voices. They do not drop the telephone. They hold it carefully and gently. They know it is powerful, but also fragile. They know it is a gift, but also a responsibility. They know it is a toy, but also a tool. They know it is theirs, but also shared.
