Once upon a time, there was a baby. The infant was so small and sweet. All day long the infant played games and laughed. But one day the infant had to resist the temptation of the long silver spoon. The infant wanted it so badly, but stopped himself. He knew it was wrong. Suddenly, a giant appeared. He was very angry and tried to take away the spoon. The infant resisted as much as he could, but the giant was too strong. Tears pooled in the infant's eyes. Just as the giant was going to succeed, a long white horse rode up to the rescue. It snorted and blew hot air. The giant flew away in fear. And the infant finally had the courage to take the spoon. He smiled in victory. The End.
