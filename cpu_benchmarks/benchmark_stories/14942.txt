Once upon a time there was a big, strong elephant. He was working so hard in the hot sun, trying to build his new house with a big tool. Suddenly, he got an itch in his nose and he sneezed! The sneeze was so strong the whole house shook.
Frightened, the elephant looked around. In the corner of the room he saw a small mouse. It had run in when the house shook.
The elephant smiled and said, "Hello there. What has brought you to my house?"
The mouse replied, "I heard your big sneeze and came to make sure you were OK!" 
The elephant was very touched by the mouse's kind words. He thanked the mouse and they became friends. From then on, the elephant was never alone while he was building his house.
