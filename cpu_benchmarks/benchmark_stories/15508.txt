Once upon a time, there was a spider named Bob. Bob was always looking for food and he wanted to find something new. One day, he saw a delicious morsel on the ground and he decided to add it to his collection. 
But when Bob went to pick it up, he noticed something strange. It was a small, round object with lots of different parts. Bob was fascinated, so he decided to investigate further. It was an available ant! 
Bob quickly grabbed the ant and added it to his collection. 
The ant was a great addition to his food supply and from that day onward, Bob never went hungry. He was grateful for the available ant and was happy to have a new friend. 
Bob and the ant were best friends and they always played together. They would climb through the trees and search for more food to add to their collection. Whenever Bob needed help, the ant was always there. 
Bob and the ant had many adventures together. They were an inseparable pair and life was good with their happy duo. Whenever Bob needed something, all he had to do was add it, like the available ant.
