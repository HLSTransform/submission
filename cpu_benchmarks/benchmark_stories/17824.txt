Bob was a boy who loved adventures. He had many fun and exciting toys to play with, but he was still not satisfied.
One day, Bob was walking along when he saw something shiny and exciting in the window of the shop. He knew he had to have it. When Bob got nearer, he realised it was a calendar. Inside it were pictures of many places, as well as numbers that Bob could not understand.
Excitedly, Bob jumped into the shop and asked the shopkeeper for the calendar. The shopkeeper handed it to him with a warm smile.
Back at home, Bob grabbed his best colours and set to work at the calendar. He carefully outlined each of the pictures with colour and soon the calendar was full of colour. But when he flipped it over, he was surprised to see what was revealed.
Behind the pictures and numbers, Bob could see a map of the entire world. He was so happy! Now he could plan out his adventures and make new discoveries every day. When outside, the warm sunshine made Bob feel so excited, he was ready to explore!
