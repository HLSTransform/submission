Once upon a time, there was a happy boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to eat healthy food like carrots and apples. He knew that eating healthy made him strong and happy.
One day, Timmy's mommy asked him to pour some milk into his cup. Timmy was very careful and poured just the right amount. His mommy was proud of him!
Later that day, Timmy and his mommy went to a parade. They saw lots of colorful floats and happy people waving. Timmy loved the parade and waved back at everyone.
At the end of the day, Timmy felt very tired but also very happy. He knew that he had eaten healthy and had lots of fun at the parade. Timmy went to bed with a big smile on his face.
