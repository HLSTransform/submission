Once there was a girl named Mandy. Mandy was ordinary, just like everyone else. One day, she wanted to settle down and measure something special.
She found a ruler and set it on the floor. She started to look around her house to find something to measure. She chose a toy car and a tiny bear. She measured them one by one.
Suddenly, Mandy noticed something odd about the toy car. She looked closer and found that the toy car was longer than the little bear!
Mandy was so excited. She knew that she had found something special to measure. She set the toy car and the bear side by side again. Then she used her ruler to measure them both.
When she was done, she settled down in her chair and smiled. She felt happy that she was able to find something special to measure.
