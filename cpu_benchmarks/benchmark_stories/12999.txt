Once upon a time, there was a nice and cute puppy. His name was Boof and he was very friendly. He liked to run and play in a big loop in the park.
One day, Boof got lost and couldn't find his way back home. He looked very sad and lonely and didn't know what to do.
Then, he saw something shiny in the sky. It was a rainbow! Suddenly, he felt a little bit better and remembered his loop in the park. With a happy bark, Boof began running and trying to find his way back home.
Luckily, Boof soon remembered the loop and quickly ran back. He was soon in his familiar park, feeling much happier now. He jumped and played and soon found his way back home.
Boof was so happy to be home and was glad that he had returned!
