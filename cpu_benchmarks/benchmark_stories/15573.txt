Sara liked to skip in the garden. She skipped with her doll, her ball and her dog. She skipped in the sun and in the rain. She skipped when she was happy and when she was sad.
One day, she skipped to the kitchen. She was hungry and wanted a snack. She opened the cupboard and saw a big jar of cookies. They looked tasty. She reached for the jar, but it was too high. She tried to jump, but she could not reach it.
She saw a chair near the cupboard. She had an idea. She dragged the chair to the cupboard and climbed on it. She was almost there. She stretched her hand and grabbed the jar. She was so happy. She opened the jar and took a cookie. She bit it and smiled. It was tasty.
But then she heard a voice. It was her mom. "Sara, what are you doing?" her mom asked. She sounded angry. Sara turned around and saw her mom standing in the door. She looked at the jar, the chair and the cookie. She knew she was in trouble.
She put the cookie back in the jar and closed it. She got down from the chair and moved it back. She looked at her mom and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I was hungry and I wanted a cookie. They looked tasty."
Her mom sighed and said, "Sara, you know you are not supposed to take cookies from the cupboard without asking. They are for after dinner. And you could have fallen from the chair and hurt yourself. That was very dangerous."
Sara nodded and said, "I know, mom. I'm sorry. I won't do it again. Can I skip in the garden now?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, you can. But first, give me a hug and say you love me."
Sara hugged her mom and said, "I love you, mom. You are the best."
Her mom hugged her back and said, "I love you too, Sara. You are my sweet girl. Now go and skip in the garden. But don't skip too far."
Sara said, "OK, mom. Thank you." She took her doll, her ball and her dog and skipped to the garden. She was happy again. She skipped in the sun and in the rain. She skipped when she was happy and when she was sad. She skipped and skipped and skipped.
