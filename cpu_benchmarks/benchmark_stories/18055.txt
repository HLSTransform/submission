Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a pebble on the ground. It was small and shiny. She picked it up and put it in her pocket.
Later, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her toys. Lily's room was messy with toys everywhere. Her mom told her to put them away in the toy box. Lily didn't want to clean up, but her mom told her to do it anyway.
After Lily finished cleaning, she showed her mom the pebble she found. Her mom smiled and told her it was pretty. Lily was happy that she found something special to tell her mom about.
