Daniel was feeling embarrassed. He had given Marie a present - an ordinary armchair - but it wasn't special enough for her. She had laughed in a mean way and said it wasn't good.
Daniel felt sad and tried to hide. He went to the corner where there was an ordinary armchair. He sat down and cried. 
Suddenly, someone tapped him on the shoulder. It was Marie. She had a little present for him and a big smile too.
Marie said: "This armchair looks much better than the one I gave you. I'm sorry I didn't like it."
Daniel said: "Thanks, Marie. I feel much better now." 
Daniel hugged Marie and they sat together in the armchair. It wasn't ordinary - it was special!
