Once upon a time there was a small girl named Bella. Bella loved pink, and especially her special pink dress. On this day she was wearing her dress, with a bow tied at the knee. 
Bella was playing with her dolls in the garden when she saw something shiny and pink. She ran to it and found a pink kite! She was so excited and wanted to fly it right away. She tied the kite’s string around her knee and ran as fast as she could, but the kite wouldn’t fly. 
“Mommy, why isn’t my kite flying?” Bella yelled to her mother. 
“Oh sweetheart,” her mom said, “you need to complete the kite.”
Bella was confused, “What do I need to do?”
Her mom smiled, “You need to add the tail.” She handed Bella a long strip of pink ribbon and said, “Tie this to the back of the kite and it will fly.” 
Bella quickly tied the tail securely to the kite, and then ran as fast as she could with the kite held high. Sure enough, the kite flew into the sky, with Bella laughing and shouting with joy. 
When the kite had finished flying she ran back to her mom
