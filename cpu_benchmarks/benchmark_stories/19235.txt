Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play dress up and would often go to her wardrobe to pick out her favorite outfits. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help clean her room. 
Lily was not happy about this and started to cry. Her mom said, "It's okay, Lily. We can clean together and then you can play dress up again." 
Lily wiped her tears and helped her mom clean. While cleaning, Lily accidentally tore her favorite dress. She was sad and said, "Oh no, my dress is broken." 
But her wise mom said, "Don't worry, Lily. We can fix it together." They got out the needle and thread and fixed the dress. Lily was happy again and thanked her mom for being so wise.
