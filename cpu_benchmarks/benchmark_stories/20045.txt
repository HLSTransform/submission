Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with his toy cubes. He had a red cube, a blue cube, and a green cube. One day, Timmy's mommy said, "Timmy, it's time to go to bed. You look sleepy." 
Timmy didn't want to go to bed yet. He wanted to play with his cubes some more. So, he acted like he was already asleep. "Goodnight, Timmy," said his mommy as she tucked him in. 
After his mommy left the room, Timmy quietly got out of bed and played with his cubes. He stacked them up high and then knocked them down. Suddenly, he heard a noise. It was his mommy coming back to check on him. 
Quickly, Timmy jumped back into bed and pretended to be asleep. His mommy smiled and said, "Good job, Timmy. You're such a good boy for going to sleep." Timmy smiled too, knowing he had tricked his mommy. From then on, he made sure to play with his cubes before bedtime so he wouldn't be too sleepy to play.
