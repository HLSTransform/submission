Once upon a time there was a little boy with an ugly spirit. He was so sad and alone, he felt like he didn’t fit in. One day, he was walking in the forest when he came across an old wooden door. He opened the door, curious to see what might be inside.
But as soon as he did, a strange spirit appeared. The boy was scared and wanted to close the door, but the spirit didn't want him to leave! He begged the spirit to let him pass, but the spirit said no.
The boy was very frustrated and desperate. He didn’t know what to do. He closed his eyes and wished for someone to help him, just then the wind blew and a kind Fairy appeared. She said, “Do not be afraid, I am here to help you.” She waved her wand and the spirit disappeared.
The boy was so relieved, he thanked the Fairy and she said, “Remember, stay strong, be brave and never give up.” And with that, the Fairy vanished.
The little boy was so happy, he could now go home. He made a promise to himself to never give up and from that day forward, he was never afraid again.
