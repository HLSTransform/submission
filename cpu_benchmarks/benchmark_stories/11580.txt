One day, a polite cat named Lucy went for a walk. She found a loop in the park. Lucy thought, "Hmm, I can put this loop to good use." So, she took the loop home with her.
In her home, Lucy saw her friend, a little mouse named Max. Max said, "Hi Lucy! What did you find?" Lucy showed Max the loop and said, "I found this loop. We can play with it!" Max was happy and excited to play.
Lucy and Max used the loop to play a fun game. They put the loop on the floor and took turns jumping in and out of it. They laughed and had a great time. The loop that Lucy found made their day very fun and special.
