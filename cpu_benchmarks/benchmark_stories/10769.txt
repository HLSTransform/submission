Once upon a time, there was a modest princess named Lily. She lived in a big castle with her mom and dad, the king and queen. Princess Lily loved to play outside and make new friends.
One day, while playing in the garden, she saw a little star that fell from the sky. The star was sad because it could not shine anymore. Princess Lily wanted to help the star, so she asked, "Why can't you shine, little star?"
The little star said, "I need to be up in the sky to shine bright, but I don't know how to get back." Princess Lily thought for a moment and had an idea. She asked her mom and dad if they could help the star go back to the sky.
The king and queen called their helpers, and they made a big slingshot. They put the little star in the slingshot and sent it back to the sky. The little star was so happy and started to shine bright again. Princess Lily smiled and waved goodbye to her new friend, the shining star.
