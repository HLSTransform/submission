Once there was a boy called Peter, and he was very stubborn. He wouldn't listen to anyone, not even his parents. 
One day, Peter's mum said to him, "Listen Peter, it's time for you to put on your hat. It's very cold outside." But Peter didn't listen. 
Finally, after a lot of coaxing, Peter reluctantly agreed to put on his hat. He looked very grumpy in his hat, like he didn't want to be wearing it. 
But later that day, Peter was very glad that he was wearing his hat: it was snowing and the hat was keeping his head warm. He couldn't help but smile, and he promised himself that he would listen to his mum more often.
