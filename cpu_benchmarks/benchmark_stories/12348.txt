Once there was a girl named Alice. She loved to read books and knew lots of stories by heart. She loved reading so much that she traveled all around the world with her train to visit different places and libraries. One day when she was traveling on her train, she saw something very fragile on the ground. It was an egg!
Alice stopped her train and got off to take a closer look. With a soft voice she said, "hello fraglile egg, how are you?". Unexpectedly, the egg opened and out jumped a small scaly creature. "Hi!" said the creature. Alice was so excited, she couldn't believe her eyes.
The creature then told Alice that it wanted to learn how to read. So they went to the nearest library and Alice started to read to the creature. Every day, they would meet at the same spot and Alice would read to the creature until it could read by itself.
Alice and the creature had so much fun that they became lifelong friends. Whenever Alice traveled a new place, she would always remember to bring a book for her new friend to read.
