Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her teddy bear. One day, Lily's uncle came to visit. He was a big man with a kind smile, but he looked tired.
"Hello, Lily!" said Uncle. "Can I play with your teddy bear?"
Lily thought for a moment. She loved her uncle, but she didn't want him to take her teddy bear away. "No, Uncle," she said. "You can't replace my teddy bear. He's my best friend."
Uncle laughed. "I'm not going to replace your teddy bear, Lily. I just want to play with him for a little while. I promise I'll give him back."
Lily thought about it and decided to let her uncle play with her teddy bear. But she warned him, "Don't be naughty with my teddy bear, Uncle!"
Uncle smiled and hugged Lily. "I won't be naughty, I promise." And they played together with the teddy bear until it was time for Uncle to go home. Lily was happy to have shared her teddy bear with her uncle, and Uncle was happy to have spent time with his niece.
