Once there was a little girl called Mia. She had long brown hair and big blue eyes. Mia always wanted to explore and try new things. 
One day, Mia was outside in the grass when she heard something very strange. She listened closely and then heard a noise like singing! She was so excited and jumped up to see what it was. 
Mia saw a big yellow bird on a branch. She noticed it was singing with a spoon in its beak. The bird flew down and landed on the ground near Mia. 
The bird said 'hello' to Mia and asked if she could join it. Mia nervously nodded and the bird handed her a cold spoon. Mia was so excited and started to sing along with the bird. 
She sang and laughed as they finished their song and the bird thanked Mia. She thanked the bird too and waved goodbye as it flew into the sky. Mia ran home to tell her Mummy all about it. 
Mia had a wonderful time that day and now she knows that you can learn a lot by just listening.
