Sara likes to walk with her mom and dad. They walk to the park and see many things. Sara sees a dog, a bird, a ball and a slide. She wants to play with everything.
Sara sees a big stack of blocks. She runs to the blocks and picks one up. She puts it on the ground and picks another one. She puts it on top of the first one. She makes a tower with the blocks. She thinks it is easy and fun.
But then a boy comes and kicks the tower. The blocks fall down and make a loud noise. Sara is sad and angry. She cries and shouts at the boy. The boy laughs and runs away.
Sara's mom and dad come and hug her. They tell her it is okay. They help her pick up the blocks and make a new tower. They make it bigger and stronger. They tell her she is smart and brave.
Sara smiles and says thank you. She likes her new tower and her mom and dad. She is happy again. She walks with them to the swing and swings high. She feels the wind and the sun. She thinks it is a good day.
