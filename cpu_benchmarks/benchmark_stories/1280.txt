Once there was a little girl who loved to laugh and play with her friends. She was always happy.
One day, she found a strange switch outside her house. She was excited to try it and see what might happen. She moved the switch up and down and side to side.
Suddenly all the lights in the house lit up. The little girl was amazed and delighted. She knew that this switch was very valuable.
The little girl showed her mom the switch and explained how it worked. Her mom was also happy and said that the switch could help them save energy.
From then on, the little girl made sure to value the switch by using it carefully and responsibly. She and her family were very happy with the switch and it allowed them to save lots of money on their energy bill.
