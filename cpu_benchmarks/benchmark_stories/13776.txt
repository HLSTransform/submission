Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with dolls and cars. One day, they go to the park with their moms. They see a big slide and run to it.
"Me first!" Anna says. She climbs up the ladder and slides down. She laughs and claps her hands.
"Me too!" Ben says. He follows Anna and slides down. He smiles and cheers.
They take turns sliding and having fun. But then, a big boy comes. He pushes Anna and Ben away.
"This is my slide!" he says. He is mean and rude.
Anna and Ben are sad and scared. They cry and run to their moms.
"Mommy, mommy, a big boy pushed us!" Anna says.
"Mommy, mommy, he was mean and rude!" Ben says.
Their moms hug them and wipe their tears.
"That's not nice, that's not fair!" their moms say. They go to the big boy and his mom. They tell them what happened.
The big boy's mom is angry. She scolds the big boy.
"You should not push and be mean to other kids!" she says. "You should say sorry and share the slide!"
The big boy is ashamed. He lowers his head and says sorry.
"Sorry, Anna. Sorry, Ben. Can we play together?" he says.
Anna and Ben are surprised. They look at each other and nod.
"Okay, we can play together. But you have to be nice and fair!" Anna says.
"Yes, and you have to take turns and wait!" Ben says.
The big boy agrees. He smiles and nods.
They go back to the slide. They take turns and wait. They laugh and cheer. They have fun.
Their moms are happy. They watch them and smile.
They are jolly and friendly. They are friends.
