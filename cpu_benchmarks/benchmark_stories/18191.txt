Once upon a time, there was a fat cat named Kitty. Kitty lived in a small house with a nice family. One day, Kitty saw a big red ambulance outside her house. The ambulance had bright lights and made a loud noise. Kitty was curious and wanted to see what was happening.
Kitty went outside and saw a man lying on the ground. He couldn't move, so the ambulance came to help him. The people from the ambulance put the man on a bed with wheels and took him inside the ambulance. Kitty wanted to help, so she followed them.
Inside the ambulance, Kitty saw the man start to feel better. He looked at Kitty and said, "Thank you for coming with me, Kitty. You made me feel less scared." Kitty felt happy that she could help the man. Soon, the ambulance took the man to a place where he could get better, and Kitty went back to her small house with her nice family.
