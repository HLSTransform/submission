One day, two best friends were playing together. It was a sunny day, but suddenly it started to get cold. The two friends shivered and hugged each other. 
The first friend asked the second friend, "What do you think we should do?" The second friend had an idea. He said, "Let's go find the warmest place we can!" 
So the two friends set off on their search. They looked all around, but nothing seemed to be warm enough. That's when they spotted an expensive house with a chimney deeper than the tallest tree. 
The first friend asked the second, "What do you think? Will it be nice and warm inside?" His opinion was that it would be freezing cold. He said, "No way, it looks too fancy." 
The second friend disagreed. "Let's go find out," she said. And so, the two brave friends went inside the expensive house. To their surprise, it was nice and toasty warm. The two best friends couldn't believe it! 
They both agreed that it was their best opinion ever. From that day forward, they both knew never to judge a place by how expensive it looks.
