Once upon time there was a little girl named Grace. Grace was a very happy child and always smiled. One day Grace did something wrong and made her mommy very angry. Grace's mommy yelled at her and said, "Grace you shouldn't have done that, why did you?"
Grace felt very sad, she wanted to make her mommy happy again. She looked up to her mommy and said, "I'm sorry Mommy, I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry."
Her mommy smiled. She reached down and gave Grace a big hug. She said, "It's okay Grace, I forgive you. Now let's put on your sunglasses and go outside and play."
Grace smiled and put on her sunglasses. She and her mommy went to the park. Grace saw some of her friends running around. They had so much fun playing.
After a while, they all got a bit sleepy. Grace's mom said, "Let's go home, it's time for bed." So they said goodbye to their friends and went back home.
Grace's mom tucked her into bed and gave her a kiss. She said "Good night, sweetie. I forgive you and I love you."
Grace smiled and closed her eyes. She was so thankful to have a mommy like hers who would always forgive her. And they all lived happily ever after.
