Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and would twirl around her room all day long. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a long message to give to her grandma who lived far away.
Lily was very excited to bring the message to her grandma. She put on her favorite dress and danced out of the house. As she walked down the street, she saw a little boy sitting on the sidewalk. He looked sad and lonely.
Lily went up to the boy and said, "Hi, what's wrong?" The boy replied, "I lost my mommy." Lily smiled and said, "Don't worry, I'll help you find her. But first, let's dance!" And they danced and twirled around until they saw the boy's mommy coming towards them.
The boy hugged his mommy and Lily gave her the long message for her grandma. The boy's mommy thanked Lily for helping them and said, "You are such a kind and wonderful girl." Lily smiled and danced all the way back home, feeling happy and proud of herself.
