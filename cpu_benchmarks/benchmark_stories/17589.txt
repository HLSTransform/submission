Tom and Lily liked to play in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. One day, they saw a band in the park. The band had elderly people who played music. They had drums, guitars and horns. The music was loud and fun.
Tom and Lily wanted to dance to the music. But some big kids were near the band. The big kids looked mean and scary. They said bad words and laughed at the band. Tom and Lily were afraid of the big kids.
Tom said to Lily, "I dare you to go dance near the band." Lily said, "No, you go first. I dare you." Tom said, "No, you go. I dare you more." They both wanted to dance, but they both did not want to go near the big kids.
Then, one of the elderly people in the band saw Tom and Lily. He smiled and waved at them. He said, "Come on, kids. Don't be shy. Come and dance with us. We like to have fun." He was nice and friendly.
Tom and Lily looked at each other. They felt brave and happy. They decided to go and dance near the band. They ignored the big kids. They had fun with the music and the elderly people. The big kids were surprised and angry. They left the park. Tom and Lily had a great day. They learned to dare and to enjoy.
