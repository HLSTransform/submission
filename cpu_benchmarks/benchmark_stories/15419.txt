Once upon a time there was a Mommy and a Baby. Mommy and Baby were very happy.
One day, Mommy and Baby went for a walk. Baby was feeling excited, but Mommy said, "Be calm, Baby!" So Baby remembered to be calm. 
Mommy pointed to the sky and said, "What do you see Baby?" Baby said, "I see the sun!" Mommy said, "That's right! Look left, what do you see?" Baby said, "I see a tree!"
Mommy smiled, "That's right Baby! Now calm down and remember what we just saw."
Baby was feeling very happy and remembered the sun and the tree. Mommy said, "Good job, Baby! Now let's go home and have a rest."  
Baby and Mommy went home and had a peaceful rest. Baby was so happy to remember the sun and the tree.
