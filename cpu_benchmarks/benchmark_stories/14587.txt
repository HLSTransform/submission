Once upon a time, there was an enormous popcorn machine. It sparkled and shone as if made of diamonds. Every day, the children around the neighbourhood would come together and applaud. They loved the delicious popcorn the enormous machine would make. The children always had the same routine: they would cheer and clap and then wait for their turn to get a bag of the crunchy snack.
Soon, the popcorn machine was making the most delicious popcorn in town. Everyone would line up in long queues and applaud when it was their turn to get a bag of yummy popcorn. Even the adults and grandparents smiled and cheered along.
One day, something amazing happened. Everyone gathered around the enormous machine, and cheered even louder than before. Out of the machine popped the biggest bag of popcorn anyone had ever seen. Everyone gasped, and then cheered even louder. They took a huge bite out of the popcorn and it was the tastiest they had ever had. Everyone applauded in joy, and the children laughed and smiled the whole night.
The enormous popcorn machine made everyone happy, and it was the best popcorn in town.
