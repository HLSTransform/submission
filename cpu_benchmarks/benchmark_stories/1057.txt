Once upon a time there was a nice boy named Jacob. Jacob loved to imagine all sorts of things. He imagined visiting the moon, playing with elephants and even having his own pet dragon! Every day he would tell his mom all the amazing things he had imagined. 
One day, Jacob's mom decided to surprise him. She told him that they were going on a visit! He was so excited! He couldn't wait to see where they were going. 
Jacob put on his nice shoes and watched as his mom drove the car to an amazing place! He was so excited as he stepped out of the car, for he could see a big lake with a beautiful beach! Jacob ran to the sand, dug in the sand and splashed in the lake. He played in the lake for hours and enjoyed every minute of it!
When the sun began to set, Jacob's mom said that it was time for them to go home. Jacob was sad to leave, but promised to himself that he would come back soon with his mom and imagine even more dreamy adventures.
