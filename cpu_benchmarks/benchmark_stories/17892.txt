Once upon a time, there was a small girl. She loved to travel.
One day, she decided to go exploring. With her bag filled with her favourite things, she went off to explore.
She walked past the trees, and saw many animals. She was so excited! As she walked, she spotted a file on the ground. It was small and looked like a special one.
She picked it up and opened it. Inside, she found lots of pictures of different places. It was a magical file! There were pictures of mountains, trees, rivers, and seas.
The small girl wanted to travel to the places in the pictures. She held the small file close to her heart and made a wish.
She wanted to travel to all the beautiful places in the pictures so she could explore the world.
