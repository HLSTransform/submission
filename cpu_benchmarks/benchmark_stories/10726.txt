Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and spend time with her family. One day, her mommy said, "Lily, we need to decide what we want to do this weekend. Let's look at the calendar and see what's happening."
Lily looked at the calendar and saw that there was a clear day on Saturday. "Mommy, can we go to the park on Saturday?" she asked. "That sounds like a great idea, Lily," her mommy replied.
On Saturday, they went to the park and had a lot of fun. They played on the swings, went down the slide, and even had a picnic. As they were leaving, Lily said, "I'm so glad we decided to go to the park today. It was so much fun!"
