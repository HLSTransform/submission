Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny lived in a burrow underground with his mommy and daddy. One day, Benny's mommy sent him to the store to buy some carrots. Benny was so excited to go on his own!
As Benny hopped along the path, he saw a sad little bird sitting on a root. "What's wrong?" Benny asked the bird. "I lost my nest," the bird replied sadly. "Don't worry," Benny said, "I'll help you find it!" 
Benny hopped around, looking for the bird's nest. Finally, he found it in a tree. "Here it is!" Benny said happily. The bird was so grateful and thanked Benny for his help. Benny felt proud and happy that he could make a new friend and help someone in need.
