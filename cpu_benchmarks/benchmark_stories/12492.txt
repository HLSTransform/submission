Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a cool idea to build a big tower with his blocks. He stacked them up high and then he stood back to see how tall it was. 
But then, the tower fell down and Timmy felt sad. His mom came in and gave him a hug. She said, "It's okay, Timmy. Let's try again." 
So, Timmy built another tower and this time he stood really still and careful. And guess what? It stood tall and strong! Timmy was so happy and proud of himself. He showed his tower to everyone who came to visit.
