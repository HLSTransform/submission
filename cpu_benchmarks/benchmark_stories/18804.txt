Anna liked to make things with her hands. She made dolls, hats, scarves, and bags. She was gifted at making things. She wanted to share her things with other people.
One day, her mom told her there was a festival in the park. She said Anna could sell her things there. Anna was happy and excited. She packed her things in a big basket and went with her mom to the park.
At the festival, there were many people. They looked at Anna's things and smiled. Some people bought her things and gave her money. Anna said thank you and put the money in a jar. She felt proud and happy.
She also saw other things at the festival. There were balloons, flowers, candy, and toys. She wanted to buy some things for herself and her mom. She used some of the money she earned and bought a balloon for herself and a flower for her mom.
She gave the flower to her mom and hugged her. Her mom hugged her back and said she was proud of her. They both enjoyed the festival and went home with their things. Anna had a good day.
