Once upon a time there was a big house full of people. Everyone was happy until one day, when it got very hot. Everyone started to feel very warm and sticky.
Then Mama looked at the thermometer. "Itâ€™s too hot!" Mama shouted.
So Daddy went outside to get buckets of water. Everyone collected the buckets and started to splash and play in the cool water. Everyone was happy and felt nice and cool.
Next, Mama and Daddy said it was time to wash. Everyone got in the bath and scrubbed themselves until they were clean.
Afterwards, everyone was cool, fresh, and happy. They shouted with joy and hugged each other.
