Sara likes to go to the station with her dad. She likes to see the big trains that go fast and make loud noises. She likes to wave at the people who get on and off the trains. She likes to look at the pictures and signs that tell where the trains are going.
One day, Sara sees a new train at the station. It is very big and shiny and has many colors. It has a funny face on the front and a long tail on the back. It looks like a dragon. Sara thinks it is the most beautiful train she has ever seen.
Sara asks her dad if they can ride the dragon train. Her dad says yes, but they have to wait in a long line. Many other people want to ride the dragon train too. It is a very popular train. Sara does not mind waiting. She is very excited.
When it is their turn, Sara and her dad get on the dragon train. They find a seat near the window. Sara looks out and sees the station getting smaller and smaller. The dragon train starts to move. It goes faster and faster. It makes a loud roar. Sara feels like she is flying.
Sara smiles. She is very happy. She loves the dragon train. She hopes they can ride it again soon.
