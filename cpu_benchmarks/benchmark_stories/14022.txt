Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a kind girl named Lily. She had a big red ball that she loved to play with. One day, Lily and her friend Ben went to the park to play with the ball.
As they were playing, the ball split in two. "Oh no!" said Lily, "What do we do now?" Ben thought for a moment and said, "Let's have a race to see who can find a new ball first. The one who finds it will win!"
They both ran around the park, looking for a new ball. Lily saw a small boy crying. She stopped and asked, "Why are you sad?" The boy said, "I lost my toy." Lily and Ben decided to help the boy find his toy. They searched and found the toy under a bush. The boy was so happy.
Lily and Ben forgot about their race and the win. They learned that being kind and helping others was more important than winning. And they all became good friends and played together every day.
