Molly and her Daddy were looking out of the window. Molly saw something exciting! She saw a big parade! There were lots of people and loud noises. Molly asked her Daddy what it was and he said it was a parade. 
Molly was so happy and pointed to all the people and the colorful floats. The people had on pretty clothes and they waved and smiled. There were even some animals too! Molly spotted a big gray elephant walking in the parade. 
Molly and her Daddy watched the parade until it was finished. Then they went outside to find the elephant. It was still walking down the street. Molly waved and smiled to all the people. She and her Daddy followed the parade until it was finished. 
Molly had so much fun watching the parade. She wished the parade lasted forever!
