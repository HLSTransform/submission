Alice was walking through a big field when she suddenly heard loud clapping. As she got closer, she saw an orange bird with beautiful feathers. The bird was flapping its wings and singing a song. Alice watched it for a few minutes until the bird was done singing.
Afterwards, the orange bird bowed and the field became filled with applause. Alice clapped and applauded too. The bird flew away, but Alice could still feel the love in the air. 
Alice smiled and thought to herself “that was so much fun!” She couldn’t help but be filled with admiration and appreciation for the wonderful orange bird.
