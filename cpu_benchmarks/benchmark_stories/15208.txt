Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She had a favorite vest that she wore every day. It was red and had a picture of a fierce lion on it. Mia thought the lion was very cool.
One day, Mia's vest got dirty from playing outside. She was sad and didn't want to take it off. Her mommy said, "Mia, we need to clean your vest so it looks nice again." Mia agreed and gave her vest to her mommy.
While the vest was being cleaned, Mia played with her toys. She pretended her teddy bear was a fierce lion, just like the one on her vest. When her mommy brought the clean vest back, Mia was so happy. She put it on and said, "Thank you, Mommy! Now my lion can be fierce and clean!" Mia and her mommy smiled and hugged each other.
