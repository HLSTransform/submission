Tim was lonely. He had no friends to play with. He lived in a big house with his mom and dad, but they were always busy. He wished he had a pet, like a dog or a cat, to keep him company.
One day, he found a jug in the garage. It was old and dusty, but it had a funny shape. It looked like a fat man with a big nose and a hat. Tim liked the jug. He took it to his room and cleaned it with a cloth. He put it on his shelf and said, "Hello, jug. You are my friend now. What is your name?"
The jug did not answer. Tim was sad. He thought the jug did not like him. He went to bed and hugged his pillow.
The next morning, he heard a strange noise. It sounded like a sneeze. He opened his eyes and saw the jug on his shelf. It was moving and shaking. It had a face and a mouth. It said, "Achoo! Achoo! Excuse me, I have a cold. I'm sorry, I did not talk to you yesterday. I was asleep. I'm a magic jug. My name is Juggy. And you are?"
Tim was surprised and happy. He jumped out of bed and ran to the jug. He said, "Wow, you can talk! You are a magic jug! My name is Tim. I'm glad you are awake. You are my friend, right?"
Juggy smiled and nodded. He said, "Yes, I'm your friend. And you are mine. I was lonely too, in the garage. I'm happy you found me. We can have fun together. Do you want to play a game?"
Tim nodded and clapped his hands. He said, "Yes, I want to play a game. What game do you want to play?"
Juggy thought for a moment. He said, "How about hide and seek? I'll hide first. You count to ten and then look for me. Ready, set, go!"
Juggy jumped off the shelf and rolled under the bed. Tim covered his eyes and counted to ten. Then he opened his eyes and looked for Juggy. He searched the room, but he could not find him. He heard a giggle from under the bed. He bent down and saw Juggy's nose sticking out. He said, "I found you, Juggy! You are a good hider. Now it's my turn to hide. You count to ten and then look for me."
Juggy agreed and covered his eyes. He counted to ten and then opened his eyes. He looked for Tim, but he could not see him. He heard a laugh from behind the curtain. He rolled to the window and pulled the curtain. He saw Tim hiding behind it. He said, "I found you, Tim! You are a good hider too. You are a smart boy. I like you."
Tim and Juggy hugged and laughed. They played more games and told each other stories. They had a lot of fun. They were not lonely anymore. They were happy. They were friends.
