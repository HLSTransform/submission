Tommy was feeling lazy. He sat in his mum's lap in front of the fireplace. His mum had a big basket of things that she was dropping into the fireplace. Sparks flew out of the fireplace as the things dropped in.
Tommy wanted to help, so he reached out his hands to grab things. He dropped the things into the fireplace one by one. Some of them made a loud crackle sound when they dropped. Some made lots of beautiful sparks.
Tommy's mum was very proud of him. She smiled each time he dropped a new thing. The fireplace became very warm and the room was full of light. It was such a cozy place to be.
Tommy and his mum stayed in front of the fireplace for a long time. It was so nice there with the warm fire. They both felt happy and lazy.
