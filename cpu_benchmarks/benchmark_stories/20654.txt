Once there was a rat who was very playful. His favorite game was to run and hide in the garden. One day, as he was playing, a dog came by. The rat was so scared that he quickly ran away and hid deep inside a bush. The dog ran after him, but he was too quick for the dog, so it stopped.
When the rat came out from the bush he saw another animal. It was a cat! The rat was so scared he quickly ran away. The cat chased him, but the rat was so fast that he managed to get away again. The cat eventually stopped running.
The rat was very happy to have gotten away, but he couldn't believe that he had been chased away twice in one day. He decided to go back to his hole and take a little nap. When he awoke he felt much better, and soon he was running and playing again in the garden.
