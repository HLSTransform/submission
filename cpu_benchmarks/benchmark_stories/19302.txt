Once upon a time, there lived a lonely little bird. She lived all alone in a big tree and the only friend she had was the rainbow. Every single day the little bird would look up and see the beautiful rainbow in the sky.
One day, the little bird decided to try and fly up to the rainbow. She flapped her little wings and started to raise up, up and away. Higher and higher she flew until she finally saw the rainbow up close.
The little bird was so happy as she past through the different coloured parts of the rainbow. The colours were so beautiful and the little bird was happier than ever!
But then the rain started to fall and the little bird had to leave the rainbow. As she flew away, the little bird waved goodbye to her new friend, the rainbow. The little bird was no longer lonely and she was always happy when the rainbow was in the sky.
