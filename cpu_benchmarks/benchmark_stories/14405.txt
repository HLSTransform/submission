Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to imagine all sorts of things, like flying on a unicorn or swimming with dolphins. One day, Lily's mom told her about a big race that was happening in their town. The winner would get a shiny trophy!
Lily was so excited and she imagined herself winning the race and getting the trophy. She practiced and practiced, but on the day of the race, she didn't win. She was sad and disappointed.
Her mom said, "Lily, it's not about winning the trophy. It's about trying your best and having fun." Lily realized her mom was right. She may not have won the trophy, but she had a charming time running with her friends. From then on, Lily always remembered to have fun and try her best, no matter what.
