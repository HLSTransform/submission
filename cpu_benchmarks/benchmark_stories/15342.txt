Once there was a man who had a job. Every day he had to carry things from the station to his home. But the station was very far away, so it was risky to carry such a heavy load all on his own.
One day, he heard about a unique car that could travel very fast. He decided to give it a try. He put all the things he had to carry in the car and drove it to and from the station.
The car was so fast that he could make the trip between the station and his home in half the time. He was very happy and the people at the station were very impressed.
Now his job was much easier! Every time he had to carry something from the station, he used the unique car and was able to finish his job quickly and safely.
