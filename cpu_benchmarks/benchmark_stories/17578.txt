Tim and Kim are friends. They like to play in the park. They run, jump, slide and swing. They have fun.
One day, they see a big hole in the ground. It is a pit. They are curious. They want to look inside.
"Be careful," Tim says. "The pit is deep and dark. We might fall in."
"Don't worry," Kim says. "I have a flashlight. I can see what is in the pit."
Kim turns on the flashlight and shines it into the pit. She sees something shiny and wet. It is water.
"Look, Tim," Kim says. "There is water in the pit. Maybe we can drink it. I am thirsty."
"I don't know," Tim says. "The water might be dirty or bad. It is not regular water. It is pit water."
Kim does not listen. She leans over the pit and reaches for the water. She slips and falls in. She screams.
"Help, Tim, help!" Kim cries. "The water is cold and yucky. It tastes like mud. Get me out!"
Tim is scared. He grabs a rope from the slide and throws it to Kim. He pulls her out of the pit. She is wet and dirty.
"I am sorry, Tim," Kim says. "You were right. The pit water is not good to drink. It is gross. I should have listened to you."
"It's okay, Kim," Tim says. "I am glad you are safe. Come on, let's go home. We can drink some regular water there. And maybe some juice."
