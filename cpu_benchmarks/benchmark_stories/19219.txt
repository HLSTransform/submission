Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play dress up and put on makeup. One day, Lily's mommy gave her some makeup to play with. Lily was so happy and she put on lots of makeup. She looked like a princess!
When Lily went to school, her friends saw her makeup and they mentioned how pretty she looked. But one of Lily's friends, a poor boy named Timmy, didn't have any makeup to play with. Lily felt sad for Timmy and wanted to share her makeup with him. So, Lily gave some of her makeup to Timmy and they played together happily ever after.
