Once upon a time, there was a long desert. Everyone was hot and tired and wanted an oasis. So, they all got together and decided to cut the long desert in two.
They worked hard with hammers and saws, and soon they had an oasis. It had a big, blue lake and tall, green trees. Everyone jumped in the lake and ran around the trees.
They were so happy to have this oasis, so they decided to have a big party. There was music, singing, and dancing. Everyone had a great time!
The oasis was so wonderful that all the people that cut it promised that it would last forever. It became a special spot for all the people to go and have fun. The children played there throughout the day, and the adults went at night.
The people never forgot the day they cut the long desert to make their oasis.
