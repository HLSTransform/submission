Once upon a time, there was a graceful bear. He was walking in the woods one day. Suddenly, he saw a cross in his path. He was curious and stopped to look at it.
"Who made this cross?" he wondered.
Then he heard someone calling. "Can you help me?"
Bear walked over to the voice and he saw a little rabbit. "My name is Rabbit and I'm stuck in this hole," said Rabbit.
Bear thought for a moment and then remembered he had a rope in his pocket. He pulled it out and gave the rope to Rabbit. Rabbit was so grateful that he thanked Bear and promised to help him if he ever needed it.
Bear smiled and waved goodbye to Rabbit. Soon, Bear was walking across the woods, lost in thought. Suddenly, he saw a graceful deer. "Hello," said the deer.
Bear was so surprised that he couldn't help but smile. He felt really happy to meet the deer. He wanted to talk to the deer and tell her about his adventure with Rabbit. He told her all about it as they walked together.
The deer was so pleased to hear Bear's story. She thought it was so brave of Bear to help Rabbit. She thanked Bear for his kindness and said goodbye.
Bear smiled and waved goodbye to the deer. He was happy because he had made a new friend. He still remembered the cross he saw earlier and
