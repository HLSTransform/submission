Once, there was a little girl named Mia. She was 3 years old. Mia loved playing with toys but one of her biggest wishes was to own something really special. She asked her mom for a special luxury toy for her birthday. 
Her mom looked at Mia and said, "Well, Mia, if you want a special toy, you should save up your pocket money. It might take some time, but if you work hard, you'll have enough money to get one." Mia agreed and started saving her pocket money every day. 
After a few weeks, Mia had saved up enough money to buy the luxury toy she wanted so much. She ran to the toy store to buy it, but she noticed that the toy was very fragile. 
Mia knew she had to be careful and handle the toy with care. She bought the luxury toy, but always remembered that if you want something special, you must take care of it, too. That's why she always recommends buying fragile things with care.
