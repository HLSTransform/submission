Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very sleepy and wanted to go to bed. But his mommy promised him they would read a story together. Timmy was happy and waited patiently for his mommy to finish her work.
When his mommy finally came, Timmy was very excited. But he was so sleepy that he could hardly keep his eyes open. His mommy noticed and asked, "Are you too sleepy to read a story?" Timmy shook his head and said, "No, I want to read a story with you."
As they read the story, Timmy started to feel more and more sleepy. Eventually, he couldn't keep his eyes open any longer and fell asleep. When he woke up the next morning, he told his mommy, "I hate falling asleep during story time." His mommy promised to read another story with him that night, and Timmy was very happy.
