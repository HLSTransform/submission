Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to draw pictures with her pink crayon. One day, she drew a picture of a flower and showed it to her mom. Her mom replied, "Wow, that's beautiful!" Lily was so happy to hear her mom's reply. 
Later that day, Lily's dad came home from work and she showed him the same picture. He also replied, "This is amazing, Lily!" She felt so proud that both her parents liked her pink flower picture. 
The next day, Lily showed the picture to her friends at preschool. They all replied, "Wow, that's so pretty!" Lily felt so happy that everyone liked her picture. From that day on, Lily loved to draw more pictures for everyone to see.
