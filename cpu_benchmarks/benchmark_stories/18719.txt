Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her dolls and sing songs. One day, Lily's mommy had to go to work, so she asked Lily to be quiet while she was gone. Lily promised to be polite and not make any loud noises.
Lily played quietly for a while, but then she got bored. She decided to color a picture for her mommy to surprise her when she came home. Lily worked very hard on her picture, using lots of pretty colors. When her mommy came home, she was very happy to see Lily's beautiful picture.
From then on, Lily remembered to be polite and quiet when her mommy had to work. And sometimes, she even worked on special surprises for her mommy to show how much she loved her. The end.
