Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to race her toy cars on the floor. One day, she found a pit in the ground. She didn't know what it was, but it looked like a big hole. 
Lily asked her mommy, "What is this big hole?" 
"It's an unknown pit," said her mommy. "We don't know what's inside." 
Lily was curious and wanted to explore the pit. She asked her mommy if she could go down and see what was inside. 
"No, it's not safe," said her mommy. "We don't know what's down there. It's better to stay away." 
Lily listened to her mommy and didn't go near the unknown pit again. Instead, she continued to race her toy cars and have fun playing.
