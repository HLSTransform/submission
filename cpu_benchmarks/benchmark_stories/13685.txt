Lily and Ben were playing in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They gave him a carrot nose and two rocks for eyes. They were very happy.
But then, a big dog came. He was hungry and he saw the carrot nose. He ran to the snowman and bit the nose. He pulled and pulled. The snowman fell down. The hat and the scarf flew away. The rocks rolled on the snow. Lily and Ben were very sad.
They saw the dog run away with the carrot. They wanted to get it back. They ran after the dog. But the dog was fast and he went to the lake. The lake had ice on it. The dog did not know. He jumped on the ice. The ice cracked. The dog fell in the water. He was cold and scared. He barked and barked.
Lily and Ben heard the dog. They saw him in the water. They wanted to help him. They found a big stick. They held the stick together. They went to the edge of the ice. They reached the stick to the dog. The dog grabbed the stick with his teeth. Lily and Ben pulled and pulled. They rescued the dog from the water.
The dog was wet and messy. He shook his fur. He dropped the carrot. He licked Lily and Ben. He was sorry and happy. Lily and Ben were happy too. They gave the dog a hug. They took him to their home. They gave him a towel and a bowl of food. They made a new snowman with a new carrot nose. They put the hat and the scarf on the dog. They played with him in the snow. They were very happy.
