Anna and Ben were best friends. They liked to play with shapes. They had many shapes: circles, squares, triangles, stars, and more. They made pictures and patterns with the shapes on the floor.
One day, Anna had a dream. She dreamed that she was in a land of shapes. Everything was made of shapes: the trees, the houses, the animals, even the sun and the moon. She saw a big castle of shapes. She wanted to go inside and see what was there.
She walked to the castle, but there was a gate. A guard was standing by the gate. He was a big shape, like a hexagon. He said, "Who are you? What do you want?"
"I am Anna. I want to see the castle of shapes. It looks so pretty and fun," Anna said.
"Sorry, you cannot enter. The castle is not available for you. Only shapes can go inside. You are not a shape. You are a human. Go away," the guard said.
Anna felt sad and angry. She said, "That is not fair. I like shapes. I play with shapes. I dream of shapes. Why can't I see the castle of shapes?"
The guard said, "Because you are different. You do not belong here. This is our land, our castle, our shapes. You have nothing to do with us. Now, leave, or I will make you leave."
Anna was scared. She turned around and ran away. She woke up from her dream. She was in her bed, in her room. She saw Ben sleeping on the floor. He had come over for a sleepover. She saw their shapes scattered on the floor. She felt sorry for her dream.
She got up and woke Ben. She said, "Ben, I had a bad dream. I dreamed that I was in a land of shapes, but they did not let me see their castle. They said I was different and did not belong. They were mean to me."
Ben hugged Anna. He said, "That is a bad dream. I am sorry. But you know what? It is not true. You are not different. You are my friend. You belong with me. We both like shapes. We both play with shapes. We both dream of shapes. We are the same. We are happy."
Anna smiled. She said, "You are right, Ben. You are my friend. We are the same. We are happy. Thank you for being nice to me."
They hugged again. They picked up their shapes and made a new picture. They made a picture of a castle of shapes. They said, "This is our castle. It is available for everyone. Everyone can see it. Everyone can play with it. Everyone can dream of it. Because everyone is special. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is a friend."
The moral of the story is: Do not judge people by their appearance. Do not exclude people because they are different. Be kind and friendly to everyone. Share your dreams and your toys with everyone. Everyone is special. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is a friend.
