Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was a very frightened girl. She did not like loud noises or big animals. One day, she went for a walk in the park with her mommy.
In the park, Lily saw a small cat. The cat was stuck in a tree. "Meow," said the cat. Lily wanted to help the cat. She looked around and saw a long stick. She picked up the stick and tried to solve the problem.
Lily said, "Mommy, can you help me?" Her mommy came and helped her use the stick. Together, they saved the cat from the tree. The cat was happy and said, "Meow, thank you!" Lily was not frightened anymore. She was brave and felt proud that she could solve the problem.
