Once upon a time, there was a small girl and her parents. She wanted to help them with their chores, but she was often too young. Her parents, however, wanted her to be obedient so they gave her a task that she could do.
The parents bought her a big hose and they told her to weigh it. The girl didn't know how, but being obedient, she tried. First, she lifted the hose up and down, but it didn't feel heavy. Then, she tried counting on her fingers how many times the hose was heavy, but it was too hard. 
Finally, her parents showed her how to use a special tool called a scale. They placed the hose on the scale, and it weighed exactly 5 pounds. The girl was proud of herself for being obedient and doing the task.
The girl's parents were proud of her for being obedient and for completing her task. From that day onward, the girl was able to help out with lots of chores and was even more obedient than before.
