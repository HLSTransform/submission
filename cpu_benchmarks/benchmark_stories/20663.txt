Once upon a time there was a big yard full of grass and trees. Every day, the mommies and daddies and kids would come outside and play.
One day, something special happened. Something important went missing from the yard! It was a big white ball. No one could find it anywhere!
The people in the yard looked and looked for the white ball, but it was gone. They searched all around the yard, but it seemed to have vanished!
The people were so sad. Where did the ball go? They asked each other, but no one had an answer. 
Then, a small voice said, “Maybe the ball went to play with the clouds!” All the people in the yard smiled. That must be where the ball had gone! 
The people in the yard were happy again. The important white ball had just vanished to go play with the clouds!
