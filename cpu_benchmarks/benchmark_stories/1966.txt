Once upon a time there was a boy named Tom. Tom had an uncle who he loved very much. One day Tom wanted to do something special for his uncle, so he decided to climb a high tree. 
He asked his uncle to help him get up, but his uncle said he had to do it by himself. Tom was determined to do it, so he made his way up the high tree. He was so proud when he made it to the top and looked down at his uncle below. 
His uncle was so impressed that he gave Tom a big hug when he got down safely. Tom and his uncle decided to do this every week and have lots of fun together. 
The end.
