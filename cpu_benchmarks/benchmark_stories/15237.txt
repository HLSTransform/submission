Once upon a time, in a big nation, there lived a restless ball. This ball loved to roll all day long. It would roll up and down the hills, and through the fields. The ball was always happy when it was rolling.
One day, the ball met a little boy. The little boy was sad because he had no friends to play with. The restless ball wanted to help the boy. So, the ball started to roll around the boy, making him laugh and smile. They played together all day long, rolling and laughing.
As the sun began to set, the boy and the restless ball were tired from all the rolling. They sat under a big tree and rested. The boy hugged the ball and said, "Thank you for playing with me. You are my best friend." The ball was happy, and from that day on, the boy and the restless ball rolled and played together in the big nation, always happy and never alone.
