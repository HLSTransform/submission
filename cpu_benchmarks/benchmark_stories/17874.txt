Once there was a person. They were lovely and kind. One day, they decided to go on an adventure. They went deep into the woods and suddenly, they heard a loud sound. It sounded like a warning.
The person was scared, but they kept walking and eventually, they came to a beautiful garden. The garden was full of colourful flowers and it felt so peaceful. The person felt so happy and decided to stay for a while.
Then, the person heard the warning sound again. It was louder this time. The person knew that it was time to go back home. So, they said goodbye to the garden, and thanked it for being so lovely. 
The person went back home safely, but warned all their friends never to go too deep into the woods. They wanted to make sure that everyone stayed safe and happy.
