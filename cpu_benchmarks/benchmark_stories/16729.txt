Ben likes to print. He has a big box of paper and many colors of paint. He dips his hands in the paint and makes handprints on the paper. He also uses a rod to make lines and circles. He thinks his prints are very pretty.
One day, Ben wants to print a gift for his mom. He finds a big sheet of paper and some red paint. He prints a big heart with his hands and writes "I love you" with the rod. He is very proud of his print and wants to show it to his mom.
He runs to the living room, where his mom is sitting on the couch. She is reading a book and looks very comfortable. Ben says, "Mom, look what I made for you!" He holds up his print and smiles. His mom sees his print and smiles too. She says, "Wow, Ben, that is a beautiful print! Thank you so much! I love you too!" She hugs him and kisses him. She puts his print on the wall and says, "That is the best gift ever!"
Ben is very happy. He loves his mom and his print. He thinks printing is fun and easy. He wants to print more things for his mom and dad and friends. He thinks they will like his prints too. He goes back to his box of paper and paint and prints some more. He is a good printer.
