Once upon a time there was a family with two kids. One day, when they were outside, it started to rain hard. The rain came down really fast and soon the ground was all wet. The kids said to their parents, "Look, it's a flood!"
The water was coming up higher and higher and it started to come into the house. The parents were worried and said, "Come on, let's go upstairs so we can be safe." Upstairs, the family watched as the flood water kept coming in. The water was so high that it was touching the roof.
The kids were getting scared and started to cry. Their mom said, "It's okay, sweeties. Everything will be alright." But soon the water kept getting higher and the family had to go outside.
The flood was so strong that it hurt the family. They had to hold onto each other to stay safe. Finally, the flood stopped and the family was safe. The family was so happy to be safe and said, "We made it!"
