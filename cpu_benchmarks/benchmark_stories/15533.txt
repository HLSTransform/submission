Once there was a man who wanted to find the clearest reindeer in the world. The man looked around his house, but he could not find one. So, he decided to go on an adventure to find one. He searched everywhere, but could not find any reindeers.
Finally, he stumbled upon a magical forest. He peeked inside and saw a big group of reindeers. The man began to sort through them, looking for the clearest one. He looked and looked, until he found it! 
The man grabbed the reindeer and took it home with him. He was so excited to have the clearest reindeer in the world. From that day onwards, the man and the reindeer were always together.
