Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toy top. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her toy. She spun the top with all her might and it spun around and around. 
Suddenly, the top spun too fast and flew out of her hand. It went to the left and landed in the bushes. Lily tried to find it, but it was too dark. She was sad and started to cry. 
Just then, a powerful voice said, "Don't cry, little one. I will help you find your top." It was a kind old man who saw her crying. Together, they looked for the top and found it in the bushes. 
The old man said, "Always be careful when you spin things too fast. You might lose them. It's important to be responsible and take care of your things." Lily thanked the old man and promised to be more careful. From that day on, she played with her top with caution and never lost it again.
