Once upon a time, a boy named Tim was very excited. He was going on vacation with his mom and dad. They were going to the beach. Tim loved the beach. He could not wait to play in the sand and water.
On the way to the beach, they had to take a car. Tim had his own seat in the car. He felt like a big boy. He looked out the window and saw trees and birds. He was so happy.
But then, the car stopped. Tim's dad looked sad. The car was broken. They could not go to the beach. Tim felt sad too. Their vacation was not fun anymore. They had to go back home.
