John was worried. He was only three years old, and he had to prepare for a trip to nature. He grabbed his backpack and filled it with snacks, juice and some toys. His mom and dad helped him, and told him what to bring. He was excited but also a little bit scared.
The next day, they all got in the car and drove to a park. John was amazed at all the trees, flowers and animals that he saw. He ran around and explored the area. He smiled as he watched the birds flying and was delighted by the colourful flowers.
After a few hours of exploration, John started to get hungry. His parents opened a blanket and prepared a picnic for him. They set him up with some sandwiches, fruit, and milk to drink. John was happy to have something to eat. 
As the sun began to set, John realised it was time to head home. He was tired but had had so much fun! He thanked his mom and dad for bringing him to the calming nature and getting him prepared for the trip. John waved goodbye to the animals and said he'd be back soon.
