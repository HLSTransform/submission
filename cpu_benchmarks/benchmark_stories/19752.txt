Once upon a time, there was a family who loved to celebrate. One day, the family was having a celebration for milkshakes. Everyone made their own milkshake - some liked them sweet, and others liked them sour. The family's little 3 year old was especially excited. He wanted to make his own milkshake.
The family put all the ingredients in a jar and let the little one mix everything together. He added some ice cream, and then he added some fruits - he wanted it to be sour! When he was finished, he poured his milkshake into a cup and the family toasted and celebrated with him.
The little one was very happy - it was the best milkshake he had ever tasted! He kept the jar with the leftovers so he could enjoy more of his sour milkshake later. 
The family celebrated together, laughing and telling stories. It was a day to remember!
