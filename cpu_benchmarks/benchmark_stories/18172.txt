Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sally. She liked to send packages to her friend, Tom. Sally was very patient when she waited for Tom to get the package.
One day, Sally sent a big package to Tom. She waited and waited for Tom to say "thank you." But Tom did not say anything. Sally was sad.
Sally found out that the package was lost. It did not get to Tom. The package was gone forever. Sally and Tom were both sad. The end.
