Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his colorful cubes. One day, he felt uncomfortable and itchy on his arm. His mom told him to rub some cream on it, but Timmy didn't want to stop playing with his cubes.
As he continued to play, he accidentally knocked over his tower of cubes. He tried to put them back together, but one cube was missing. Timmy felt sad and frustrated. He searched everywhere for the missing cube, but it was nowhere to be found.
Eventually, Timmy gave up and went to bed feeling sad. In the middle of the night, he woke up to a loud noise. His dog had eaten the missing cube and was now very sick. Timmy felt terrible and wished he had been more careful with his toys. The next day, his dog passed away, and Timmy learned a hard lesson about being responsible and taking care of his things.
