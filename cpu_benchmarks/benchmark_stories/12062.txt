Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, her mommy asked her to prepare a special snack for their picnic. Lily was very excited and asked her mommy what they were going to have.
Her mommy said, "We are going to have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and some tasty fruit."
Lily was very happy and started to prepare the sandwiches. She spread the peanut butter and jelly on the bread and cut them into little triangles. Then, she washed the fruit and put them in a basket.
As they were walking to the park, Lily noticed that her mommy was breathing heavily. She remembered that her mommy had told her about oxygen and how important it was for our bodies. So, she asked her mommy to take deep breaths and they both took a few deep breaths together.
When they reached the park, they had a lovely picnic and enjoyed their tasty snacks. Lily was happy that she could help her mommy and also learned something new about oxygen.
