Once upon a time, there was a naughty duck. She liked to do naughty things like not listening or playing where she shouldn't.
One day, she was running around and suddenly she sneezed. It was a loud sneeze, not like any other!
The naughty duck jumped in surprise and the noise of her sneeze made other animals come out of their homes. They looked at the duck and said "What's wrong?"
The duck said, "I'm afraid I sneezed a bit too loud, and now everyone can hear me!"
The other animals laughed and said, "It's okay! Everyone sneezes sometimes. Let's all have a little fun!"
The duck was so happy and they all went off and had a great time playing. From then on, the naughty duck was a bit nicer and remembered to be quieter when she sneezed!
