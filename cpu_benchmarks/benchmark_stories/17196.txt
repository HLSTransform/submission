Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a friendly dog named Max. They loved to play together in the park. One day, they saw lightning in the sky. Timmy was scared, but Max settled him down by licking his face. They went back home and cuddled up under a blanket. Timmy fell asleep, feeling safe and warm.
