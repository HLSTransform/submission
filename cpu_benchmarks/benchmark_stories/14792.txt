Lily liked to dress up in different clothes. She had a big box of clothes in her room. She had dresses, hats, shoes, and scarves. She liked to pretend she was a princess, a doctor, a teacher, or a superhero.
One day, she wanted to play with her friend Max. She called him on the phone and asked him to come over. Max said yes and came to her house. Lily was very happy. She ran to her room and opened her box of clothes. She picked out a pink dress, a purple hat, a yellow scarf, and a pair of red shoes. She put them on and looked at herself in the mirror. She smiled and said, "I am a princess!"
She went to the living room and saw Max. He was wearing his normal clothes: a blue shirt, a green jacket, and jeans. He had a toy car in his hand. He looked at Lily and said, "Hi, Lily. What are you doing?"
Lily said, "I am a princess. Do you want to play with me?"
Max said, "Sure, but I don't have any clothes like yours. Can I borrow some from your box?"
Lily said, "No, you can't. These are my clothes. You can't touch them. You have to play with your car."
Max felt sad and angry. He said, "That's not fair. You have so many clothes and I have none. You are not a good friend. You are selfish."
Lily said, "No, I am not. I am a princess. And princesses can do whatever they want. You have to do what I say. I demand that you play with me and my clothes."
Max said, "No, I don't. You are not a princess. You are a bossy girl. I don't want to play with you anymore. I want to go home."
He turned around and walked to the door. Lily felt confused and sorry. She realized that she had hurt Max's feelings. She remembered that Max was her friend and that he always shared his toys with her. She thought that she had been very mean and rude. She wanted to make up with Max and have fun with him. She decided to be more thoughtful and kind.
She ran after Max and said, "Wait, Max. Don't go. I'm sorry. I was wrong. You can play with my clothes. You can be whatever you want. You can be a prince, a doctor, a teacher, or a superhero. I don't care. I just want to play with you. You are my friend and I love you."
Max stopped and looked at Lily. He saw that she was sincere and sorry. He smiled and said, "It's okay, Lily. I forgive you. You are my friend and I love you too. Let's go to your room and play with your clothes. Maybe we can both be superheroes and save the world."
Lily hugged Max and said, "Yes, let's do that. That sounds like fun."
They went to Lily's room and opened her box of clothes. They picked out different outfits and put them on. They laughed and played and had a great time. They were both happy and thoughtful. They were both good friends.
