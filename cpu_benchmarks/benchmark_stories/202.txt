Ben and Tom are friends. They like to play football in the park. One day, they find a big box near the trees. They open the box and see many things inside. There are books, toys, clothes, and a shiny football.
"Wow, look at this football!" Ben says. "It is new and red. Can we play with it?"
Tom nods. He likes the football too. He takes it out of the box and kicks it to Ben. Ben kicks it back to Tom. They have fun with the football.
But then, a man comes to the park. He looks angry. He sees the box and the football.
"Hey, you kids!" he shouts. "That is my box and my football! Give them back to me!"
Ben and Tom are scared. They do not know the man. They do not want to give back the football.
"But we found them here," Ben says. "They are not yours."
"They are mine!" the man says. "I left them here for a while. They are very useful to me. The football is a gift for my son. The books are for my work. The toys and clothes are for charity. Now, give them back or I will call the police!"
Ben and Tom do not want to make the man more angry. They do not want to go to the police. They decide to give back the football and the box. They are sad. They liked the football.
"Sorry, mister," Tom says. "We did not know. Here is your football and your box."
The man takes the football and the box. He does not say thank you. He walks away.
Ben and Tom look at each other. They are still friends. They do not need the football to play. They can play with other things. They go to the swings and have fun.
