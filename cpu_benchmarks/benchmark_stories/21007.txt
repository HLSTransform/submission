Once there was a doggy who was tumbling around on the grassy field. The doggy was very happy! Then he saw a man and asked the owner, "who are you?". The man smiled and said, " I am your new owner and I will take very good care of you". The doggy barked with excitement and followed the man to his house.
When the doggy arrived he was very surprised. The house was much bigger than he expected and it was very modern. He raced around and explored the new amazing home! Later, the doggy asked his owner, "what is this box that makes noise?". The man replied, "well, that is the radio. It will play music and stories". The doggy knew he was going to love his new home. 
The doggy curled up and fell asleep in his ownerâ€™s lap. He was very happy he had asked the man who he was. It was the best decision he ever made!
