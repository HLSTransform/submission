Once there was a pretty girl, her name was Katie. One day, she went outside and was running about in her garden when suddenly she fell over and hurt her knee. She was very sad and started to whimper, but then her mummy came outside and she felt better. Mummy put a bandage on the knee and gave her a big hug.
Mummy then said to her, "Don't worry, I'm here to support you and you will feel better soon." She gave Katie a warm smile, then they went inside and had some yummy cookies. 
Katie was all better after a few days and she decided to show her mummy her knee. When she lifted up the bandage, her knee was all better and the bandage was still pretty! She thanked her mummy for supporting her and gave her a big hug.
