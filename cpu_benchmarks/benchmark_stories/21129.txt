One day, a boy named Tim found a dirty staff in the park. It was big and brown. Tim liked the staff and took it home. He wanted to find something that would match the staff.
Tim saw his friend, Sue, and showed her the staff. "Look, Sue! I found a dirty staff! Can you help me find something to match it?" Sue said, "Yes, let's look for something together!"
They looked and looked but could not find anything to match the dirty staff. They were sad. Then, they saw a big, dirty rock. They thought it was perfect. But when they tried to pick it up, the rock was too heavy and fell on their toes. Tim and Sue cried because it hurt. They never found a match for the dirty staff and went home with sore toes.
