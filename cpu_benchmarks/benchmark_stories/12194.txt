Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy. She was three years old and loved exploring the world. One day, she decided to explore the back garden. 
As she stepped outside, she felt something soft beneath her feet. She bent down and poked it with her finger. Suddenly, a bubble of lotion shot up into the air and landed on her face! 
Lucy laughed. It tickled! She jumped up and down, giggling and running around the garden.
Suddenly, she saw something incredible in the trees. It was a big, bright lizard! "Hello," said Lucy. She poked the lizard gently with her finger. 
The lizard blinked his eyes and smiled. "Hello!" he said. Lucy couldn't believe it. She had found an incredible talking lizard! 
The two became friends and continued to explore the garden together. Lucy had an incredible day and never forgot her special friend the lizard.
