Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a task to do. His mom asked him to clean his room. But Tim did not want to do the task. He wanted to play with his toys.
Tim's mom told him again to clean his room. She said, "Tim, you must do your task before you can play." Tim did not listen. He insisted on playing with his toys. His mom was not happy.
After playing for a long time, Tim's room was very messy. His toys were everywhere. When it was time for bed, Tim could not find his favorite toy. He felt bad. He cried and cried. His mom said, "If you did your task, you would not feel bad now." Tim promised to clean his room the next day.
