Once upon a time, there was a shy little girl named Annabel. She was only three years old. Every day, her mother would take her for a walk in the park. But today, Annabel's mother was delayed.
Annabel waited in the living room, watching the clock go around and around so slowly. She was beginning to get impatient. "Why is Mummy delayed?" Annabel asked.
Just then, Annabel's mother came home. "Mummy!" Annabel cried in delight. "Where were you?"
"I'm sorry I was delayed," her mother said, smiling. "I got held up at work."
Annabel was relieved. She smiled and hugged her mother.
From then on, Annabel's mother never delayed again. And the two of them spent every day together, enjoying their walks in the park.
