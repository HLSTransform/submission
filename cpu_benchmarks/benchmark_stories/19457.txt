John and his mom were playing in the park. John pointed at a great rope. He was very excited and asked if he could play with it. His mom said yes and handed him the rope.
John held the rope in his hand and smiled. He started swinging it around and laughing. He enjoyed feeling the breeze on his face. John saw other children playing and he wanted to join in with them.
He pointed the rope in their direction and yelled, "Let's play together!" The other kids smiled and agreed. They held one end of the rope each and then, together, started spinning it around.
John smiled as he twirled and jumped around with the rope. He had made new friends and was having a great time. He had discovered a great new toy!
