John was a jolly infant. He enjoyed running around in the park every day. He liked to climb the slide and swing from the monkey bars.
On Saturday, he and his family went to the beach. John put on his swimsuit and waded into the cool water. He laughed as the waves splashed against him. 
When he came out of the water, he had a big smile on his face. He enjoyed chasing the seagulls and digging in the sand. Later, he and his mom built a sandcastle together. 
At the end of the day, John was tired but very happy. He had enjoyed playing at the beach all day.
