Once upon a time, there was a happy boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, he went to the park and saw a big group of kids playing soccer. Timmy watched them from a distant and thought it looked like fun. 
Suddenly, one of the players kicked the ball towards Timmy. Timmy was scared at first, but then he kicked the ball back and everyone cheered! They all celebrated together and Timmy felt so happy. 
From that day on, Timmy practiced every day and became a great soccer player. He made lots of new friends and they celebrated together after every game. Timmy was so grateful for the day he first watched those players and decided to join in on the fun.
