Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to spin around and around in circles until she was dizzy. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. 
Lily's friend, Timmy, was having trouble finding his toy car. "I can't find my car. It's lost!" he said. 
Lily had an idea. "Let's all look for it together. If we work together, we can find it faster," she said. 
So, they organized themselves and searched the playground. After a few minutes, Lily found the car under a bush. "I found it!" she said. 
Timmy was so happy and gave Lily a big hug. "Thank you for helping me find my car. You bring peace to my heart," he said. 
Lily smiled and felt happy too. She loved helping her friends and making them feel peaceful. And of course, she couldn't wait to spin around again!
