Once upon a time, there was a fish named Nemo. Nemo lived in a big ocean with his mom and dad. One day, Nemo went too far and got lost. He swam and swam until he found a beautiful reef. 
Nemo was scared and sad because he didn't know how to get back home. But then he met a friendly crab who showed him the way back. Nemo was so happy that he forgave himself for getting lost. 
When Nemo got back home, he told his mom and dad all about his adventure. They were happy he was safe and available to play with him. From that day on, Nemo knew that it's okay to make mistakes and that forgiveness is important.
