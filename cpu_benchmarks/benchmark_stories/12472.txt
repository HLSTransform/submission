Tom and Lily liked to play with the computer. They liked to watch funny videos and play games. But they had to share the computer, because it was rare and expensive. Their mom and dad told them to take turns and be nice.
One day, Tom wanted to play a new game on the computer. He asked Lily if he could have a turn. Lily said no, because she was watching her favorite show. Tom got angry and tried to take the computer from Lily. Lily screamed and held on to the computer.
"Stop it, Tom! It's my turn!" Lily said.
"No, it's not! You had a long turn! Give me the computer!" Tom said.
They pulled and pushed the computer until it fell on the floor. The screen cracked and the computer made a loud noise. Tom and Lily stared at the broken computer. They felt scared and sad.
Their mom and dad heard the noise and came to see what happened. They saw the computer on the floor and their children crying. They were very angry and disappointed.
"Tom, Lily, what did you do? You broke the computer! How could you be so careless and selfish? Don't you remember what we told you about sharing and being nice?" their mom and dad said.
Tom and Lily said they were sorry, but it was too late. Their mom and dad said they had to go to their rooms and think about what they did. They said they would not buy them a new computer for a long time. Tom and Lily felt very bad. They wished they had listened to their mom and dad and shared the computer. They learned a hard lesson.
