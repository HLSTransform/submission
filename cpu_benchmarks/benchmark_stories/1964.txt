Once upon a time there was a little girl named Hannah. She was three years old. She enjoyed playing outside with her toy cars. The cars had little engines that made a buzzing sound.
One day, while she was outside, her mom called to her.
"Hannah, don't ride your cars too fast! It's dangerous," said her mom. 
But Hannah was very curious. She wanted to find out what it felt like to ride her car fast.
So, she revved up the engine and sped away. As she was riding, the engine got louder and louder. Suddenly, the car wouldn't stop! It was going faster and faster. Hannah was scared!
Hannah started screaming for help. Suddenly, her mom ran out of the house and ran after her. Hannah's mom caught up with her daughter, and stopped her.
"I told you not to ride your car fast, Hannah! You could have been in danger!" said her mom.
Hannah learned her lesson, and she never rode her car fast again.
