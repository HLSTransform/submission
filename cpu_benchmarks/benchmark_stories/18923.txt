Lila and Leo were twins who loved animals. They had many toys of different animals, but their favorite was a big leopard. They named him Spot and played with him every day. They hugged him, fed him, and pretended he was their friend.
One day, their mom said they had to go to grandma's house for a week. She said they could only bring one toy each. Lila and Leo looked at each other and then at Spot. They did not want to separate from him. They both wanted to take him with them.
They tried to think of a way to share him. Maybe they could cut him in half, but that would hurt him. Maybe they could take turns, but that would make them miss him. Maybe they could hide him in their bag, but that would be naughty. They did not know what to do.
Then, they had an idea. They asked their mom if they could give Spot to grandma as a gift. They said grandma would love him because he was so adorable and soft. They said they would visit him often and play with him when they came. Their mom smiled and said that was a very kind and thoughtful thing to do.
Lila and Leo packed their bags and hugged Spot goodbye. They told him they loved him and he was the best leopard ever. They gave him to grandma, who was very happy and surprised. She thanked them and said he was a wonderful gift. She said he would keep her company and make her smile. Lila and Leo felt happy too. They knew they did not separate from Spot, they just shared him with someone else.
