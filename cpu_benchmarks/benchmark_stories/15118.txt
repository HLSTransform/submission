Once upon a time, there was a naughty little dog. He loved exploring around the house, and one day he decided to investigate the kitchen. When he opened the door, he found a big bowl filled with a delicious looking mixture. The little dog was feeling really curious, so he started to stir it with his paw. 
His owner, who was in the other room, heard the sound of the spoon. She rushed into the kitchen, and saw the little dog with a spoon in his mouth. She said in surprise, "What are you doing?"
The naughty little dog looked up and replied, "I'm stirring the mixture to see what's inside. Can I try it?"
His owner shook her head and said, "No, that's not for you. You're still too naughty!"
