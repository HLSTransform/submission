Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around in the park. One day, she went to the park with her friend Timmy. They were playing hide and seek when Timmy discovered a shiny object on the ground. "What is it?" asked Lily. "It's a top!" Timmy replied. "It's a toy that spins around!"
Lily was curious about the top and asked if she could play with it. Timmy said yes and showed her how to spin it. Lily was amazed at how fast it went and how flexible it was. "Wow, this is so cool!" she exclaimed.
As they continued to play, Lily accidentally broke the top. Timmy was upset, but Lily knew she had to take responsibility for her actions. "I'm sorry, Timmy. I didn't mean to break it," she said. "I'll buy you a new one with my allowance."
The moral of the story is that it's important to take responsibility for our actions and make things right when we make mistakes.
