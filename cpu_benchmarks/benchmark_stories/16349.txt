One day, a boy named Tim went to the theater with his mom. The theater was big and impressive. Tim was very happy to see a show with his mom.
In the show, there was a man who could freeze things. He would point at something and say "freeze!" Tim thought this was very cool. During the show, the man asked for a helper. Tim's mom pushed him to go up on stage.
The man asked Tim, "What do you want me to freeze?" Tim thought for a moment and said, "A ball!" The man pointed at a ball and said "freeze!" The ball stopped moving. Everyone clapped and Tim felt proud. After the show, Tim and his mom went home and talked about the fun they had at the theater.
