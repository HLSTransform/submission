Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play together. They had many toys, but their favorite was a firework that their dad gave them. It was big and shiny and made loud noises when they pressed a button.
One day, Ben and Lily went to the park with their mom. They brought their firework with them and showed it to their friends. The other kids were amazed and wanted to try it. Ben and Lily let them have a turn, but they also wanted to play with it themselves.
"Can I have the firework now?" Ben asked Lily, who was holding it.
"No, it's my turn. You had it before," Lily said.
"But I want it. It's mine too," Ben said.
They started to fight over the firework. They pulled and pushed and shouted. Their mom saw them and was angry.
"Stop it, you two. You are being very naughty. You have to share your firework or I will take it away," she said.
Ben and Lily did not listen. They were too jealous of each other. They kept fighting until the firework slipped from their hands and fell on the ground. It broke into pieces and stopped working. Ben and Lily cried. They had lost their favorite toy.
Their mom came and picked up the broken firework. She was sad and disappointed.
"Look what you have done. You have ruined your firework and your fun. You have to learn to be nice and share. Now you have nothing to play with. Come on, we are going home," she said.
She took them by the hand and walked away. Ben and Lily felt sorry, but it was too late. They had no firework and no friends. They had to rest in their room and think about what they had done. They wished they had been better twins.
