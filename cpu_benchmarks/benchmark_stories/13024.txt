Once upon a time there was a little fish named Harry. He was very hungry so he went out swimming in the sea looking for food. As he was swimming, he saw a big crab holding a jar of glue. Harry got closer and the crab dived away.
Excited, Harry chased after it and dived into the water. He was so busy chasing the crab, that he did not realize how deep he was swimming. He soon found himself in a dark cave. Suddenly, he saw the crab on a rock covered in glue!
Harry was so hungry that he decided to try to eat the glue. He swam right up to the rock - but it was really sticky! He tried and tried, but he just could not get the glue off. Eventually, he was so hungry that he just ate the glue.
Harry gasped as the glue filled his belly. He was so full that he did not even want to go back home. But he soon realized that he had to get going and so he quickly swam back to shore. He was happy that he had something to eat - but never again did he try to eat glue!
