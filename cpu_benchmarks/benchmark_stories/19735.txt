There was a slow caterpillar who wanted to study the ground. He inched his way along the dirt and peered around each leaf. He wanted to understand why things worked the way they did.
After a while he learned that the ground was full of interesting things. Worms and bugs moved through the soil, while plants and flowers grew. He also noticed ants carrying pieces of food in their tiny jaws.
The caterpillar studied each of these things carefully and learned a lot. He knew that if he kept studying, he might learn more.
One day he saw a butterfly fluttering near and he thought he would like to one day become like that. He kept studying the ground and soon he found himself becoming very strong and brave.
When it was time for the caterpillar to finally turn into a butterfly, he knew he had learned a lot from studying the ground. He spread his wings and flew away, feeling happy that he had taken the time to learn.
