Once there was a bunny who loved to hop. Every day he hopped around the meadow, searching for interesting things to explore.
One day, the bunny found something strange. He saw something white and flat. Suddenly the bunny realized it was a newspaper! It was all crumpled up, so the bunny hopped around the paper, trying to figure out what it said.
But then he saw something even stranger- the newspaper was fake! He realized it had nothing written on it, not a single word.
The bunny was so puzzled that he hopped around the fake newspaper for hours, wondering what it was. Then he decided to hop away, as he had other important places to explore.
And so the bunny hopped away into the meadow, never to find out what the fake newspaper was all about.
