Once upon a time there was a gorgeous, little kitten called Fluffy. He loved exploring and chasing butterflies, and he was very mischievous. One day, he followed a group of children on a nature walk and got lost.
He ended up at a camp in the middle of the woods. Everything was so new and exciting, but Fluffy was feeling very scared. He wanted to escape. 
When night fell, the little kitten started exploring the camp. Suddenly he met a friendly rabbit with beautiful, long ears. They both looked at each other, and the rabbit asked,
"Hello little one, why are you here?" Fluffy meowed and said, "I'm trying to escape". 
The rabbit kindly showed him the way out. As Fluffy said goodbye, the rabbit said, "Be careful little one". 
Fluffy slowly made his way home, and when he arrived, his family was delighted to see their adorable, furry friend again. They were so relieved that he was safe, and they all spent the night playing together in their garden. 
The next day, Fluffy was feeling adventurous and ready to explore again. He didn't want to escape the camp again - he wanted to explore all the wonderful nature around him!
