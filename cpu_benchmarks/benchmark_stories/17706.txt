Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She wanted to travel, so she put on her shoes and went outside. The sky was very bright and sunny, so Lucy was happy.
After walking a little ways, she came to a river. She did not know how to get across, so she started to feel embarrassed. Suddenly, she saw a little boat in the river! Inside was a light and Lucy was so excited. She jumped in the boat and began to travel across the river.
When she reached the other side, Lucy got out and smiled. She had traveled across the river and she was so proud. She waved goodbye to the boat and went home.
The End
