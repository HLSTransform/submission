Anna and Ben like to play in the snow. They make snowmen, snowballs and snow angels. One day, they see a big lake with ice on top. They wonder if they can walk on the ice.
"Can we go on the ice?" Anna asks Ben.
"I don't know. It looks slippery and cold," Ben says.
"Maybe we can slide on it. Like penguins!" Anna says.
They decide to try. They hold hands and walk slowly to the edge of the lake. They put one foot on the ice and feel it crack.
"Uh-oh. The ice is breaking!" Ben says.
They quickly pull back their foot and run away from the lake. They are scared and cold.
"Let's not go on the ice again. It is not safe," Anna says.
"OK. Let's go back to the snow. It is more fun," Ben says.
They go back to their snowmen and snowballs and snow angels. They are happy and warm.
They see a bird flying over the lake. It is a swan. It lands on the ice and glides smoothly. It is graceful and beautiful.
"Wow. Look at the swan. It can go on the ice," Anna says.
"It is different from us. It has wings and feathers and webbed feet," Ben says.
They watch the swan for a while. They admire it. They discuss how it can go on the ice and we can't. They learn something new. They are curious and smart.
