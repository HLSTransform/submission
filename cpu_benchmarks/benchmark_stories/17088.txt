Once upon a time, a nosy boy named Tim went for a walk. He saw a big statue in the park. Tim felt worry because he did not know what the statue was. He went closer to see what it was.
Tim met a girl named Sue. Sue said, "Do not touch the statue, Tim." But Tim did not listen. He wanted to know more about the statue. Sue felt worry too. She knew the statue was not good.
Tim touched the statue. It came to life and was very mad. The statue chased Tim and Sue away. They ran and ran but could not get away. The statue caught them, and they were very sad.
