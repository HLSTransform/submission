Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun and have fun. One day, she saw a post in the ground and wanted to climb it. Her mom said, "Be careful, Lily. That post might fall down." 
Lily climbed up the post and felt proud. She saw the sun start to set and the sky turn orange. Suddenly, the post started to shake and Lily fell down. She hurt her arm and started to cry. 
Her mom ran over to her and said, "Don't worry, Lily. We'll get you to the hospital." As they walked away, Lily saw the post start to glow. She didn't know what it meant, but it looked pretty. 
Later, they found out that the post was struck by lightning and caught on fire. It burned down the whole park and Lily's favorite tree. She was sad, but her arm was dry and she felt better soon.
