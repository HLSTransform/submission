Once there was an infant who wanted to soar. He asked his mommy and daddy if he could, and they said yes. He was very excited! The infant found some wings that were available nearby and he quickly put them on.
He began to flap his wings and fluttered around the room. He then flew to the window and opened it up. He started to soar through the sky and up above the clouds. Everything looked so small down below him.
The infant was having so much fun soaring through the sky. He flew with the birds and looked at all the big clouds. He stayed up there for hours and hours and time flew by. 
When the sun was about to set, the infant knew it was time to go home. He flew back to the window and said goodbye to the sky. Then he returned home to his mommy and daddy, where he could tell them all about his amazing flight.
