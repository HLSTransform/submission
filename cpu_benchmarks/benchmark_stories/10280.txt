Once upon a time, there was a blue bird. The blue bird was very healthy and loved to sing. One day, the blue bird flew to a tree and saw a little girl. The little girl said, "Hello, blue bird. You have a pretty blue color." The blue bird replied, "Thank you. I like my blue color too. What's your name?" The little girl said, "My name is Lily. Can I call you Blue?" The blue bird said, "Yes, you can call me Blue. That's a nice name." Lily and Blue became friends and sang together every day.
