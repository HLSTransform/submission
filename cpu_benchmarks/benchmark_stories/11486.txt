Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a baby bunny. The bunny was so adorable and had a pocket on its back. Mommy said, "Come on, let's go for a spin!" The baby bunny hopped around in circles, spinning so fast and having so much fun.
The bunny twirled and spun around and around. Mommy laughed and said, "That looks like so much fun! Can I have a turn?" The bunny stopped spinning and hopped right over to Mommy. Mommy smiled and said, "Now it's my turn to spin!" 
She started to twirl around and around just like the bunny. She spun faster and faster and soon she was laughing like the bunny! When Mommy finished spinning, the bunny hopped right up to her, looked up into her eyes, and gave her a big hug. Mommy smiled and said, "That was so much fun! Now let's go and find something else to do!" 
The bunny hopped around, with Mommy close behind. It was a wonderful day, and they were off to have more fun!
