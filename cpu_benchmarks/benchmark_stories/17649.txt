Once upon a time, there was a really big and mighty elephant. He was so big and powerful! He was walking through a thick jungle, and all the other animals were scared of him. He could hear them hiding and he wanted to give them a big surprise! 
So he opened his big trunk and let out a great big roar. BOOM! It was so loud! All the other animals were scared, even the biggest ones. They were so scared that they all ran away. 
The elephant was really happy. He went around the jungle and everyone was so scared of him. He let out another loud roar and everyone ran away again. 
The elephant was the king of the jungle, and he showed that he was the most powerful animal. He roared loud, and all the other animals knew he was in charge. 
And that's why elephants roar: to remind everyone that they are the most powerful creatures in the jungle.
