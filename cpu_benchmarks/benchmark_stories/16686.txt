Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy and his friends found a shiny copper penny on the ground. Timmy picked it up and held it up to the sun. "Wow, it's so clear!" he said.
Suddenly, Timmy's mom came outside and started to yell for him to come inside for dinner. Timmy ran over to his mom and showed her the copper penny. "Look, Mommy! I found a shiny penny!" he said.
His mom smiled and said, "That's great, Timmy. Let's go inside and eat now." Timmy put the copper penny in his pocket and followed his mom inside. He couldn't wait to show his shiny treasure to his dad when he got home from work.
