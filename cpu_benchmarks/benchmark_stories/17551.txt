Lily and Ben were playing in the park with their friends. They had a lot of fun running, jumping and sliding. But they also got very dirty. Their clothes had mud, grass and sand on them.
"Look at us, we are so dirty!" Lily said to Ben.
"Yes, we are. But we had fun, right?" Ben said.
"Yes, we did. But now we have to go home and dress in clean clothes. Mom and dad will be mad if we stay dirty," Lily said.
They said goodbye to their friends and ran to their bikes. They were in a group of four. Lily and Ben had red bikes, and their friends had blue and green bikes. They rode fast to their homes.
When they got home, they saw their mom and dad waiting for them. They looked at their dirty clothes and frowned.
"What happened to you two? You are so dirty!" mom said.
"We were playing in the park, mom. We had fun, but we also got dirty," Ben said.
"Well, you need to dress in clean clothes now. Go to your rooms and change. Then come back and wash your hands and face," dad said.
Lily and Ben nodded and ran to their rooms. They took off their dirty clothes and put on clean ones. They looked at themselves in the mirror and smiled. They were not dirty anymore. They went back to their mom and dad and hugged them.
"Sorry for being dirty, mom and dad. We love you," they said.
"We love you too, Lily and Ben. But next time, try to be more careful and not get so dirty, okay?" mom and dad said.
"Okay, mom and dad. We will try," Lily and Ben said.
They all went to the kitchen and had a yummy snack. They talked about their day and laughed. They were a happy group.
