Once upon a time there lived a powerful man named Joe. Joe was a master at chopping wood and everyday he would take his axe out and chop logs in the woods. Joe was always so happy when he was chopping wood and he would smile.
One day, Joe heard a noise in the woods and he looked up to see a little 3 year old boy. The boy was so scared and he couldn't stop crying. Joe knew what he had to do, so he took his axe and chopped down a tree so the boy could climb up and get back to his family, safe and sound.
Joe smiled a big smile and the boy stopped crying. The boy thanked Joe for saving him and Joe said, "It was no problem, I'm glad I could help." Then Joe gave the boy a ride home so he could be with his mommy and daddy.
Joe and the boy said goodbye, and Joe went back to chopping wood with his axe. Joe still smiles when he takes out his axe, because he knows that he did something good that day with his powerful axe.
