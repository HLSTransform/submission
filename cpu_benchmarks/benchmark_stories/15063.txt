Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived on the edge of the woods. She was very curious and always wanted to explore new things.
One day, while walking in the woods, she saw a big, sparkly star. She wanted to help the star become bigger, so she asked her mom to help. Her mom said, “Maybe we can take it home and make it bigger and brighter.”
The little girl was very excited and quickly ran to the star. She picked it up, and it was very, very messy! She was a bit disappointed and asked her mom, “Can we still help make it brighter?” Her mom said, “Yes! We can clean it up and give it lots of love.”
So, with a bit of time, patience, and lots of love, the little girl and her mom helped make the star brighter and more sparkly than ever before! It was the most beautiful star that the little girl had ever seen, and she was very proud of their accomplishment!
