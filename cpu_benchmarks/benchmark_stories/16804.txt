Once upon a time, a little birdie named Tweety was looking for a cozy nest to call home. She searched high and low, but all the nests she found were already taken. One day, she saw a big tree with a big nest on top. She was eager to see if it was empty.
As she flew up to the nest, she saw a big, mean birdie named Big Bird. Big Bird didn't like Tweety and wanted her to leave. Tweety didn't want to leave because she was tired and needed a place to rest. Big Bird appeared to be very angry and Tweety knew she had to be careful.
Tweety thought for a moment and then had an idea. She asked Big Bird if they could share the nest. At first, Big Bird was hesitant, but then she realized that it was a good idea. They both settled into the nest and became friends. From that day on, they shared the nest and lived happily ever after. The end.
