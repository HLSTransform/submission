Once there was a large dog named Max. Max loved to play in the park with his friends. One day, Max saw a swing in the park. He wanted to try it.
Max went to the swing and tried to sit on it. But he was too big! His neck got stuck on the swing. Max was scared and called for help.
His friends heard him and came running. They helped Max get his neck out of the swing. Max was happy and thanked his friends. From that day, Max never tried to sit on the swing again. He only watched his friends play and had fun with them.
