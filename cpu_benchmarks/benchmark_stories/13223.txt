Once upon a time there was a boy named Sam. He was three years old and he liked to travel.
One day Sam went on a very special journey. He took his cane with him, just in case he needed it. 
Sam traveled to a very special place. He saw animals that he had never seen before. Some were big, some were small. 
Sam felt so happy walking around this new place. He was so excited to be away from his normal home. He explored until it was time to go back home.
He took his cane and walked slowly back home. When he got home he was very tired, but very happy with the new things he had seen! He knew he would have to travel to this special place again soon.
