Sara and Ben were playing in the garden. They saw a big well with a bucket and a rope. Sara wanted to look inside the well and see what was there. She asked Ben to help her.
"Ben, can you hold the bucket for me? I want to see the well," Sara said.
"OK, Sara, but be careful. Don't fall in the well," Ben said. He held the bucket and the rope for Sara.
Sara leaned over the well and looked down. She saw some water and some stones. She also saw a frog. The frog was green and brown and had big eyes. Sara liked the frog. She wanted to touch it.
"Ben, look! There is a frog in the well. I want to pinch it," Sara said.
"No, Sara, don't pinch the frog. It might jump or bite you. Leave it alone," Ben said.
But Sara did not listen to Ben. She reached down with her hand and tried to pinch the frog. The frog did not like that. It jumped and bit Sara's finger. Sara screamed and let go of the rope. The bucket fell into the well and made a big splash.
"Ow, ow, ow! The frog bit me! It hurts!" Sara cried.
"See, Sara, I told you not to pinch the frog. Now you are hurt and the bucket is gone. You are not helpful. You are naughty," Ben said.
Sara felt sorry. She knew she was wrong. She said sorry to Ben and to the frog. She asked Ben to help her get the bucket back.
"Ben, I am sorry. I was naughty. Can you help me get the bucket back?" Sara said.
Ben was still angry, but he was also helpful. He said yes and helped Sara. They pulled the rope and got the bucket back. They also saw the frog. The frog was still in the well. It looked at them and croaked.
"Ribbit, ribbit. Don't pinch me again. I don't like it," the frog said.
Sara and Ben nodded. They said sorry to the frog again. They learned their lesson. They decided to play with something else. They left the well and the frog alone.
