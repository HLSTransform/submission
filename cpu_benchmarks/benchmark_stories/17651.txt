Once there was a little boy named Billy. He wanted to be a soldier when he grew up. His mom told him he could, but first he had to sell something. Billy thought and thought, but he didn't know what to sell. 
Then he saw an old toy in his closet. It was weird shaped and painted yellow. Billy thought it was perfect to sell. So he took it outside and put it on the sidewalk.
The sun was shining and soon some people stopped to look at Billy's toy. They asked him how much it cost, and Billy said he didn't know. One nice lady offered to buy it for a dollar, and Billy was so excited.
He ran inside to tell his mom that he sold the toy. She was so proud of him and gave him a big hug. From that day, Billy knew he could be a soldier. He just needed to be brave, like a soldier, and he could do anything.
