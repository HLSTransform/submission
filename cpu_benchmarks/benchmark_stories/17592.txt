Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite strip shirt that she loved to wear. One day, Lily's mom washed the shirt and it accidentally got a hole in it. Lily was sad because she would miss wearing her favorite shirt.
Lily's mom promised to buy her a new shirt, but Lily wanted the same one. Her mom said it was too expensive to buy the same shirt again, but Lily didn't understand what expensive meant. She just wanted her favorite shirt back.
Lily's dad overheard the conversation and decided to surprise her. He went to the store and found the same shirt, even though it was expensive. When he came home, Lily was so happy to see her favorite shirt again. She hugged her dad and said, "I missed you, shirt!"
