Once upon a time there was a little girl who was gifted. She loved to bake in her fireplace. One day, in the middle of making a tasty cake, she heard a rumbling noise from the kitchen.
The little girl went to the kitchen to investigate. Suddenly she noticed an old lady by the fireplace. She was holding a kitchen spoon. 
The old lady said,"What a gifted little girl, making a cake all by herself. May I help?"
The little girl was delighted. She said, "Yes please!" 
The old lady smiled and began to stir the batter. Then she said, "This cake needs some bubbles to make it even tastier." She blew on the fire in the fireplace and the flames roared up. 
The old lady put the cake in the fireplace and soon the sweet smell of cake spread around the room. 
At last, the cake was ready. It was golden and delicious. Everyone enjoyed the cake and praised the little girl for her baking.
