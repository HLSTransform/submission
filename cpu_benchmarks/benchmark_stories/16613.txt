Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play outside in the snow. They make a snowman and a snow fort. They throw snowballs at each other and laugh.
But Lily is cold. Her coat is not thick enough. She shivers and rubs her arms. Ben sees that Lily is cold. He wants to help her.
"Here, Lily, you can have my vest," Ben says. He takes off his thick vest and gives it to Lily. "It will keep you warm."
"Thank you, Ben, you are very kind," Lily says. She puts on the vest and feels warmer. "Your vest is very thick and soft."
"You're welcome, Lily, I'm glad you like it," Ben says. He smiles and hugs Lily. "You are my best friend."
They play some more in the snow. They are happy and warm. They share the vest and the coat. They are good friends.
