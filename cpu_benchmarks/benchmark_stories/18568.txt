Once upon a time, there was a big ocean. In the ocean, there was a funny shark. The shark liked to swim around and play with his fish friends. One day, the shark saw a little fish who was lost. The shark asked the fish if he needed help. The little fish nodded his head and the shark swam with him to find his family. The shark made a new friend that day and they swam together every day after that. The end.
