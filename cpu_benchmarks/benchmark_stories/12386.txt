Once upon a time, there was a family who went on an adventure. They wanted to buy something special that they could enjoy together. 
The family drove to a lovely park and, when they got out of the car, they could see an amazing view. They could see a huge lake and green trees stretching out as far as the eye could see. 
"Wow!" the dad said, "This is so lovely!"
The children were so excited! 
"What are we going to buy?" the 3 year old asked, jumping up and down.
"Let's buy a nice picnic basket," the mom said.
So, the family went to the shop and bought a colourful picnic basket. Inside it, they found lots of lovely food and drinks. 
The family spent the rest of the day enjoying their picnic and the beautiful view. They hugged each other and agreed that it had been a lovely day.
