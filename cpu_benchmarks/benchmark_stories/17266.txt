Once upon a time, a little boy named Timmy went to the park to play. He brought his toy car with him. While he was playing, he accidentally dropped his toy car and it rolled away.
Timmy looked for his toy car but he couldn't find it. Then, a little girl named Jenny came and asked Timmy what was wrong. Timmy told Jenny that he lost his toy car and he was confused. 
Jenny said, "Don't worry, Timmy. Let's use my magnet to find your toy car." They searched for Timmy's toy car with the magnet and finally found it under a bench. Timmy was so happy and he thanked Jenny for helping him. He said, "Jenny, you are my best friend. You lay the best magnets!"
