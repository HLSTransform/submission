Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the circus with his mommy and daddy. One day, they went to the circus and saw a clown. Timmy was scared of the clown because the clown had a big red nose and a painted face. 
Timmy's mommy noticed that he was scared and asked him, "What's wrong, Timmy?" Timmy replied, "I'm scared of the clown. He looks funny." 
His mommy said, "It's okay to be scared, Timmy. Sometimes clowns can be scary. Do you want to pause and take a break from watching the clown?" 
Timmy nodded his head and they took a break. After a few minutes, Timmy felt better and wanted to watch the clown again. He even laughed when the clown did a silly dance. From that day on, Timmy wasn't scared of clowns anymore.
