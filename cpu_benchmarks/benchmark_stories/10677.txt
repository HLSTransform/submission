Once upon a time, there was a spoiled little boy named Joe. He was always given whatever he wanted. One day, Joe wanted some ice cream. Even though his mother said no, Joe got it anyway. As he ate, he started to suffer from a sore tummy. He cried and wriggled in pain for many hours.
Joe's mother was worried about him and asked, "What is wrong?". Joe replied with a whimper, "It hurts". 
Joe's mom was so worried, she took him to the doctor to find the reason why Joe was suffering. The doctor told them Joe had a bad memory of eating too much ice cream.  
Joe's mother felt very guilty and swore to never spoil him again. From that day forward, she fed Joe lots of healthy food and made sure to give him only what he needed. Joe still remembers what it feels like to suffer and makes sure not to eat too much ice cream.
