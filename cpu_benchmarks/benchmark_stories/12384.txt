Once upon a time there lived two neighbors. One neighbor, called Sarah, was very worried. Every day she spoke in a worried voice with her neighbor.
One day her neighbor asked her, "Why are you so worried?" Sarah replied, "I have no food to eat." Her neighbor said, "That's not good. I will help you."
So the neighbor gave Sarah some food. Sarah was so happy. She thanked her neighbor and said, "Now I don't have to be worried anymore."
But then Sarah heard something. She looked out the window and saw a thief had broken into her neighbor's house. She shouted, "Help! We must get help!"
But it was too late. The thief had already taken the neighbor's things and run away.
Sarah was very sad. She had been so worried about food, but now she was even more worried about her neighbor.
