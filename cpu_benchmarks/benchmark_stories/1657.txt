Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, she saw her little brother crying because he didn't have a cushion to sit on. She felt sad for him and decided to help.
Lily went to her room and found a cushion. She brought it to her brother and he was very happy. He thanked her and gave her a big hug. Lily felt proud of herself for being able to supply her brother with what he needed.
Later that day, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her toys. Lily didn't want to do it because she was tired. But then she remembered how happy she made her brother by supplying him with a cushion. She realized that doing things for others can make them happy.
From that day on, Lily made sure to help her family whenever she could. She learned that being kind and helpful is never disgusting, but always the right thing to do.
