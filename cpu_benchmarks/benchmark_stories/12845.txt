Once upon a time there was a little boy who walked out by the pond. He saw a very spoiled and pretty duck. The duck did not recognize the little boy at first, but the boy recognized the duck. 
The boy said hello, but the duck waddled away very quickly. The little boy sat down to the edge of the pond and watched. 
After a while, the duck slowly came back and this time the duck recognized the boy. The duck quacked and waddled up to the little boy. The boy was so happy to find a new friend. 
He carefully picked up the duck and hugged it. The duck quacked again and the boy knew he had found a new, spoiled friend. They both stayed at the pond for hours, playing in the sunshine.
