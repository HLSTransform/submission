Once upon a time, there was a family. They wanted to go on a trip. But they did not have a lot of money. So they had to find a cheap way to go.
The father had a dream. In his dream, he saw a boat. So he decided to try and find one.
He looked everywhere. He found one near the lake. The boat was old, but it was very cheap. So the family bought it.
They set sail. The wind blew and they went far away on the boat. They saw many new things on their journey. They had a great time on their boat adventure.
The family wanted to take the boat with them wherever they went. But it was too big. So they had to leave it behind. But they all remembered the dreamboat and how much fun they had.
