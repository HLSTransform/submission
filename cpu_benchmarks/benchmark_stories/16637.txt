Lila and Ben are at the park with Mom. They see a truck with a picture of ice cream on it. They run to the truck and ask Mom for some ice cream.
"Can I have a cone with chocolate and vanilla, please?" Lila says.
"Can I have a cone with strawberry and banana, please?" Ben says.
Mom gives the man some money and he gives them their cones. Lila and Ben lick their ice cream and smile.
They see a big slide and want to go on it. They run to the slide with their cones.
"Wait, Lila and Ben," Mom says. "Don't bring your cones on the slide. They will fall and make a mess. Put them on the bench and come back for them later."
Lila and Ben put their cones on the bench and go on the slide. They have fun sliding down and climbing up.
They see a purple bird on a tree. They want to look at it. They run to the tree with their cones.
"Wait, Lila and Ben," Mom says. "Don't bring your cones to the tree. The bird will peck them and take them away. Put them on the bench and come back for them later."
Lila and Ben put their cones on the bench and go to the tree. They watch the bird and listen to its song.
They see a swing and want to go on it. They run to the swing with their cones.
"Wait, Lila and Ben," Mom says. "Don't bring your cones to the swing. They will fly out of your hands and land on the ground. Put them on the bench and come back for them later."
Lila and Ben put their cones on the bench and go to the swing. They swing high and low and laugh.
They are done with the swing and want to eat their ice cream. They run to the bench with their cones.
But their cones are gone! They see a dog licking the last bits of their ice cream. The dog has a purple tongue and a happy face.
"Hey, that's our ice cream!" Lila and Ben say.
"Sorry, kids," the dog says. "It was too yummy to resist. Next time, don't leave your cones alone. Or better yet, bring them to me!"
Lila and Ben are sad and angry. They look at Mom.
Mom smiles and says, "Don't worry, Lila and Ben. I have a surprise for you. Look, the ice cream truck is still here. Let's go and get some more cones. And this time, don't bring them anywhere but your mouths!"
