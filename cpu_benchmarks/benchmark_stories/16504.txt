Once upon a time, there was a nosy little bunny named Benny. Benny always wanted to know what was happening in the forest. One day, Benny met a wise old owl named Ollie. Ollie said to Benny, "Hello little bunny, what brings you this way?"
Benny replied, "I'm just looking for a way to mark my path so I don't get lost."
Ollie said, "Well, you can use these colorful rocks to mark your way. That way, you will always know how to get back home."
Benny was very happy and thanked Ollie for the great idea. From that day on, Benny marked his way with colorful rocks and never got lost again.
