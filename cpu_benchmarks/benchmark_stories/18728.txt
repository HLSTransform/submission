Once upon a time, there was a big jolly bear named Benny. Benny loved to play in the forest and eat honey. One day, he saw a little rabbit named Rosie who was lost. 
"Hello, little rabbit. Are you lost?" asked Benny. 
Rosie said, "Yes, I can't find my way home." 
Benny said, "Don't worry, I'll help you. Let's follow this path." 
As they walked, Benny saw a jar of honey with a label that said "Delicious Honey". He squeezed the jar and gave some to Rosie. 
"Mmm, this is yummy," said Rosie. 
They continued walking until they found Rosie's home. 
"Thank you, Benny. You're so kind," said Rosie. 
Benny smiled and said, "It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help you." 
From that day on, Benny and Rosie became good friends and played together in the forest.
