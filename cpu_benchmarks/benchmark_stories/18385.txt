Once upon a time, there was a gray cat named Tom. He liked to play with water. One sunny day, Tom found a big bowl of water in the kitchen. He was very happy.
Tom started to play with the water. He used his paw to splash the water all around. Soon, the floor was all wet. Tom didn't know that the floor was now a big mess.
Tom's friend, a little girl named Sue, came into the kitchen. She saw the wet floor and said, "Oh no, Tom! The floor is all soaked!" Sue got a towel and helped Tom clean the wet floor. They both laughed and had fun while cleaning. And from that day, Tom learned not to make a mess with water.
