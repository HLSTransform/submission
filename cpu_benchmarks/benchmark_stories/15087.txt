Once upon a time, there was a family with a mommy, a daddy and a little toddler. One morning, the dad said to the little one, “Today, you will meet someone special.” Excited, the toddler asked, “Who will we meet?” 
The dad pointed towards the door and said, “Someone who can help us.” The toddler opened the door and saw a tall, open gentleman. He said, “Hello, I am your lawyer.” 
The lawyer smiled at the toddler and asked, “Do you want to feed the ducks with me?”. The toddler smiled and said, “Yes!” 
The lawyer and the toddler walked together to the duck pond. They fed the ducks some pieces of bread and watched them swim around. The toddler had so much fun that he didn’t notice the lawyer was actually helping his parents. 
The lawyer was helping the family make sure that they had a safe and open future. The toddler didn’t know it yet, but he had made a new friend who would help take care of his family.
