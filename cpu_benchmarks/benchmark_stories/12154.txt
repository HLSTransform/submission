One day, Joe went to the river with his friend Dan. Joe was carrying his flute and Dan had a bucket in his hand. When they arrived at the river, Dan started splashing around in the river. Joe watched with a smile on his face as he dropped his flute into the water.
Dan said, "What did you do that for, Joe?"
"I want to see what happens when I splash the flute," said Joe.
Suddenly, an ugly creature popped out of the water. It had green scales and yellow eyes. Joe and Dan were shocked.
The creature said, "I'm the guardian of the river. What were you doing, splashing things around in here?"
Joe said, "I was just playing with my flute."
The creature nodded and said, "Well, no more splashing around in here. I don't want to see any ugly creatures in the river."
Joe and Dan nodded and then quickly left. From then on, they made sure to not splash things around in the river.
