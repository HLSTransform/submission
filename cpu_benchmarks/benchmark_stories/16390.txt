Anna and Ben were going on a journey with their mom and dad. They packed their bags and got in the car. Anna was nervous. She did not like new places. She held her teddy bear tight.
"Are we there yet?" Ben asked. He was excited. He wanted to see the big lake and the boats.
"Soon, honey," mom said. "We just have to cross the bridge and then we'll be there."
Anna looked out the window and saw the bridge. It was very high and long. She felt scared. She closed her eyes and hugged her teddy bear harder.
"Don't worry, Anna," dad said. "The bridge is safe and strong. Nothing bad will happen."
But something bad did happen. When they were halfway across the bridge, a big storm came. The wind blew hard and the rain poured down. The car shook and the bridge creaked. Anna heard a loud crack and a scream.
The bridge broke and the car fell into the water. Anna and Ben were trapped inside. They could not open the doors or the windows. They could not breathe. They cried and called for mom and dad.
But mom and dad did not answer. They were gone.
