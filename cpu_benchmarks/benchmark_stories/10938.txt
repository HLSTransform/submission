Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She liked to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, Lily's mommy told her to dress up for a special party. Lily put on her favorite pink dress and matching shoes. She looked so pretty!
At the party, Lily saw a big table with lots of yummy foods. She saw cupcakes, cookies, and a big cake. She took a bite of a cupcake and said, "Mmm, this is delicious!" Lily's mommy smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it, sweetie."
After the party, Lily went home and played with her dolls. She remembered how much fun she had and how delicious the cupcakes were. She felt happy and excited for the next party.
