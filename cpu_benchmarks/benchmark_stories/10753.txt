One day, a little boy named Tim went to the zoo with his mom. They saw many animals like big elephants, tall giraffes, and funny monkeys. Tim was very happy.
At the zoo, Tim met a sad monkey named Momo. Momo said, "I want to leave the zoo and go home." Tim asked his mom if they could help Momo. His mom said, "We can't take Momo home, but we can make him happy here."
So, Tim and his mom bought Momo a big banana. Momo ate the banana and smiled. He was not sad anymore. Tim and his mom were happy too. They said goodbye to Momo and left the zoo.
