Once upon a time, there was a big and enormous radio. It was so big that it took up the whole room.
Every day the friendly radio would lay in the corner, happily playing music. The happy music filled the room and the people couldn't help but smile when they heard it.
One day, the radio wasn't playing music anymore. Everyone was very sad and confused. Where was their happy music?
But then, something special happened. A little boy came into the room and lay down beside the enormous radio. He put his ear right up to the radio and listened very carefully.
The little boy smiled and then shouted out loud: "I hear it! I hear the music!"
The little boy had heard the happy music in the enormous radio. Everyone was so happy and they laughed and danced while they listened.
The little boy and the enormous radio stayed friends forever, filling the room with happy music.
