Once there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three years old and had bright pink cheeks. She loved to explore the world. One day, when she was walking in the forest, she spotted something furry and green at the foot of a tree. When she looked closer, it revealed itself to be a caterpillar. 
The caterpillar was resting in a little nest it had made in the grass and it took Lucy's curiosity. She reached out her hand and asked the caterpillar, "What are you?" The caterpillar just looked at her and smiled. 
Lucy stayed in the forest for a while longer, talking to the caterpillar and playing in the grass. Eventually it started to get late, so she said goodbye and started walking home. Before she left, the caterpillar gave her one last smile and told her she could return the next day if she wanted to. 
The next day, Lucy put on her best outfit and went back to the forest. She was excited to see her furry, green friend again. But when she arrived, she was shocked! In the place where she had found the caterpillar was now a beautiful butterfly, with brightly coloured wings and antennae. The caterpillar had revealed itself to be a butterfly! 
Lucy was so happy to see the caterpillar had transformed - it was even more beautiful than before. She thanked it for showing her its transformation, and they said goodbye. Lucy
