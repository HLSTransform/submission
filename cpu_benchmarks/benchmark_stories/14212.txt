Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack. Jack was very sad because he had to pack up his room. He had to pack all his toys and waste into boxes. It was very hard for Jack because he was very attached to his toys.
But with a big effort, he packed all his things up. But then he found some of his old toys deep in the back of his closet. He realized he had to pack those too, and it made him even more sad.
Jack slowly packed the toys up and filled two large cardboard boxes full of waste and toys. He had to take them away to the garbage to be recycled.
At last, Jack finished packing and put the boxes in his car. He put his hands on the car and sighed sadly. It was hard to see his old toys go away. But Jack realized it was good to get rid of the waste.
And so, Jack and his family set off to the recycling depot to start a new and exciting chapter of their lives.
