Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint pictures of bugs. She would sit outside and watch the bugs crawl around, then paint them on her paper.
One day, Lily met a wealthy lady who saw her paintings. The lady loved them and asked Lily to paint a big bug for her. Lily was so excited and worked very hard on the painting.
When Lily finished the painting, the wealthy lady was very happy. She gave Lily a big bag of candy as a reward. Lily was so happy and ate all the candy.
But the next day, Lily got a tummy ache from eating too much candy. She learned that even though it was nice to get a reward, it was important to be careful and not eat too much. From that day on, Lily painted bugs and ate candy in moderation.
