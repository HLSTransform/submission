One day, a little girl named Lily wanted to play with her new doll. She asked her mom if she could go outside and show it to her friends. Her mom said yes, but she had to be careful and stay close to the house.
Lily was very happy and ran outside with her doll. She saw her friends Tom and Anna and they liked her doll too. They played together for a while, until they heard a loud bark. It was a big dog that lived in the next street. The dog was not nice and sometimes chased the kids.
Lily was frightened and hugged her doll. She wanted to run back to her mom, but the dog was blocking the way. Tom and Anna were also scared and did not know what to do. They wished someone would help them.
Then, they saw a woman walking by. She had a leash in her hand and a small dog with her. She saw the big dog and the kids and decided to help. She walked towards them and said in a calm voice, "Hello, big dog. You are very strong and brave, but you are not allowed to scare these kids. They are just playing with their doll. Why don't you go back to your home and leave them alone?"
The big dog looked at the woman and her small dog. He was surprised that she was not afraid of him. He felt a little ashamed and lowered his head. He turned around and walked away, leaving the kids alone.
Lily, Tom and Anna were very relieved and thanked the woman. She smiled and said, "You're welcome, kids. I'm glad you're safe. Remember, if you ever see a dog that scares you, don't run or scream. Just stay calm and look for help. And always ask your mom or dad before you go outside."
The kids nodded and agreed. They learned a valuable lesson that day. They went back to their mom and told her what happened. She hugged them and praised them for being brave and smart. She also thanked the woman for her kindness and invited her and her small dog for some cookies and milk. They all became friends and played happily ever after.
