Tom and Lily lived in a small house in a green valley. They liked to play outside with their dog Spot and their toys. One day, they saw dark clouds in the sky and heard loud noises.
"Look, Lily, it will rain soon. We should go inside," Tom said.
"But I want to play more. Maybe the rain will not come here," Lily said.
She picked up her ball and threw it to Spot. Spot ran after the ball and barked happily.
Tom shook his head. He knew that rain was good for the plants and the animals, but he did not like to get wet and cold. He took his truck and his teddy bear and walked to the house.
"Come on, Lily, Spot, let's go. Mom will be worried about us," he called.
Lily did not listen. She was having too much fun with Spot and the ball. She was gifted at throwing and catching. She thought she was faster than the rain.
But soon, the rain came. It came fast and hard. It made the ground wet and muddy. It made Lily's hair and clothes wet and sticky. It made Spot's fur wet and dirty. It made the ball slippery and hard to hold.
Lily did not like the rain anymore. She dropped the ball and ran to the house. She was cold and sad. She wished she had listened to Tom.
She reached the house and knocked on the door. Tom opened it and smiled.
"Hi, Lily, Spot. You are very wet. Come in, I have something for you," he said.
He led them to the living room, where Mom had made a fire in the fireplace. He gave Lily a towel and a blanket. He gave Spot a bone and a rug.
He also gave Lily a small box with a bow on it.
"What is this?" Lily asked.
"It is a gift for you. I made it with Mom. Open it and see," Tom said.
Lily opened the box and saw a necklace with a shiny stone. It was blue like the sky after the rain.
"It is beautiful. Thank you, Tom. You are very kind," Lily said.
She hugged Tom and put on the necklace. She felt warm and happy.
She looked out the window and saw a rainbow over the valley.
She smiled and said, "Maybe the rain is not so bad after all."
