George was a man who was pretty popular. Everyone liked him; he had very nice friends. But one day, George began to hate. He didn't know why - he just felt it inside, like a sickness. He stopped talking to his friends, and stayed away from the other people.
He tried to get rid of his hate, but it was like a big cloud that clouded over his head. He felt like a prisoner in his own mind.
One day, he decided to tell his story to a young girl who was playing nearby. He told her how he hated, and she listened. She smiled kindly. Then, she said something that changed George's life forever. She said, "It's ok to feel hate. But don't let it rule you. You can make it better one step at a time".
George realized that the girl was right. He was able to push away the hate, little by little. He started talking to friends, and he even made new ones. He was popular again, just like before. And he was happy.
