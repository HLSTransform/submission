Once upon a time, there was a chubby cricket named Jim. Jim loved to sing and hop around in the grass. One day, Jim hopped into a hole and couldn't get out. He cried out, "Help! Help! I'm stuck!"
Just then, a little girl named Lily walked by and heard Jim's cries. She peeked into the hole and saw Jim's chubby body. "Don't worry, Jim. I'll get you out!" she said. She reached in and pulled him out of the hole.
"Thank you, Lily!" said Jim. "You saved me."
Suddenly, a big storm came and lightning struck a tree nearby. Lily and Jim were scared, but they stuck together and waited for the storm to pass. After the storm, they said goodbye and Jim hopped away, singing a happy song.
