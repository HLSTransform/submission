One day, there was an enormous steam engine. It was so big and so heavy that no one knew what to do with it.
But one little girl had an idea. She got some of her friends together and they all put their hands on the steam engine.
After a lot of pushing, they finally got it to the top of the hill. When they released it, the enormous steam engine rolled down the hill with a loud thud!
The little girl was so excited that she cheered, and all of her friends cheered too. They had put the steam engine to good use! 
They all ran down the hill to see where the steam engine had ended up. It had crashed into a big pile of hay, just the way they wanted it!
The little girl and her friends celebrated their success, jumping up and down with joy. Never before had they seen an enormous steam engine like this!
