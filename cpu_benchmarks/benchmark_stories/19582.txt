Once upon a time there was a playful kitty. Her name was Tina and she loved to dream. Every day, Tina dreamed up the most amazing places.
One day, as she was dreaming, Tina spotted a long, dark tunnel. It was so magical and fun! She wanted to explore, so she went inside. As she walked through the tunnel, it changed colors and shapes. Suddenly, a soft light filled the tunnel and music started playing. Tina was so excited and playful.
Tina looked around and spotted a bunch of her friends. They were all playing together and having the best time. Together they danced, sang and laughed.
The tunnel was the most perfect place. Every day, Tina loved to return and dream her magical dreams.
