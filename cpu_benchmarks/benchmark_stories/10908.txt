Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Max. Max was very lonely because he didn't have any friends. One day, Max was walking in the forest and he smelled something yummy. It was cheese! Max was so happy and he ran towards the smell. 
When Max got to the cheese, he saw a big bird eating it. Max was scared, but he wanted the cheese so much. He decided to be brave and ask the bird if he could have some. The bird listened to Max and said yes! Max was so happy and he ate the cheese with the bird.
After that day, Max and the bird became good friends. They would listen to each other and share cheese all the time. Max was not lonely anymore because he had a friend.
