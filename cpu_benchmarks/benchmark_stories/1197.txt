Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat pasta for dinner every night. Her mom always made a generous amount of it, so she never went hungry.
One day, Lily's mom promised to take her to the park after dinner. Lily was so excited! She ate all her pasta as fast as she could so they could go to the park.
At the park, Lily saw a big slide that she wanted to go on. But there was a long line of kids waiting to go down. Lily's mom told her to be patient and wait her turn.
Finally, it was Lily's turn to go down the slide. She climbed up the ladder and slid down, feeling so happy. She realized that sometimes it's worth waiting patiently for something good.
