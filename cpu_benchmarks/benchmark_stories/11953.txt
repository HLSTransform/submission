Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with her crayons and always had them nearby. One day, Lily's little brother came and took her favorite crayon without asking. Lily got very upset and started to cry.
Her mom came over and asked what was wrong. Lily said, "He took my crayon and I can't draw without it." Her mom hugged her and said, "It's okay, let's find another crayon you like." Lily stopped crying and started to gaze around the room for another crayon.
After a few minutes, Lily found a comfortable spot on the floor and started to draw again. She forgot all about the conflict with her brother and was happy to be creating art once more. From then on, Lily learned to share her crayons and not get too upset when things didn't go her way.
