Once there was a small girl named Jeannie. Jeannie loved to design things and she was very creative.
One day, Jeannie saw a big box of purple cardboard sitting in the corner of her room. She was so excited! She immediately started to design something with all the cardboard.
Jeannie made a very special house with all the different pieces of purple cardboard. She was so proud of her creation.
She then decided to make a purple dog to go inside her house. She used the cardboard to cut out the shape of a dog and painted it purple.
Jeannie was so happy with her designs. She showed her mom and dad her purple dog and purple house! They were so impressed with all she had done. 
From that day on, Jeannie enjoyed designing things and making her own creations from the cardboard.
