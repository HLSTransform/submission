Once upon a time a girl named Lisa believed in a bicycle. It was a special bicycle because it was purple. Lisa wanted to ride the purple bicycle, but she was too little. 
One day, Lisa asked her mommy for help. Her mommy said she could ride the purple bicycle if she believed she could. So Lisa tried her very best. She used her little feet to push on the pedals and soon she was riding the purple bicycle all by herself. 
Lisa was so excited she wanted to ride it everywhere. She rode it to the park, the store, her school, and even around the block. Every time she rode it, she believed that she could do it. She never stopped believing in her purple bicycle.
