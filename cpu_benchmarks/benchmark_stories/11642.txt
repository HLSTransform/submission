Once upon a time there was a small girl named Daisy. She was three years old and always had a big smile on her face. One day, Daisy was playing in her backyard when she noticed something old and brown near the tree. It was a small leather bag. She pointed to it and shouted with excitement.
Daisy ran towards the bag and tried to open it but it was stuck. Daisy started to cry as she was not able to open the bag. She felt so helpless. Suddenly there was a loud thud and the old bag opened.
It was full of colorful toys and sweets! Daisy's eyes were wide with excitement. She quickly took out her favorite item - a small teddy bear. But then she saw something in the corner which made her sad. It was a very old and broken doll. 
Daisy felt a little bad for the broken doll. She carefully took it out and pointed her finger towards her own teddy bear. She smiled and said "We can fix you" and ran off towards the house to get some glue.
