Lily liked to watch television with her big sister. They saw many things on the screen, like animals, people, and colors. Sometimes they laughed, sometimes they learned, and sometimes they sang along.
One day, Lily found a bottle of water with a spray on it. She wondered what it could do. She pressed the button and saw a mist come out. She thought it was fun and tried to spray the air, the plants, and the toys.
Then she had an idea. She wanted to see what would happen if she sprayed the television. She ran to the living room and aimed the bottle at the screen. She pressed the button and saw the water hit the television. She heard a loud noise and saw sparks. She was scared and dropped the bottle.
Her big sister came and saw what happened. She was angry and sad. She told Lily that the television was delicate and that water could break it. She said that Lily should not spray things that could get hurt or damaged. She said that Lily should say sorry and help clean up.
Lily felt bad and said sorry. She hugged her big sister and helped wipe the water. She learned her lesson and never sprayed the television again. She only sprayed things that liked water, like flowers, or herself. She still liked to watch television with her big sister, but only from a safe distance.
