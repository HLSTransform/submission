Mum had a brown owl. It was very cute. Mum used to sell it to people. She would go to the market and show it to anyone who wanted to buy it.
One day, Mum saw a little girl. She had a dolly. The girl wanted to buy Mum's owl. Mum said yes and the girl paid her with lots of coins.
The girl was very happy to have the owl. She said "thank you" to Mum. Then she hugged her owl and walked away.
Mum was happy too. She had sold her owl and now she had lots of coins. It was a very good day.
