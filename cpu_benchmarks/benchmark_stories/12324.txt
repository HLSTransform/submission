Once upon a time there was a old man and an old woman. They were very kind. One day the old woman mentioned that she wanted a lamp. She said it would make her room brighter. The old man wanted to make it easier for her, so he asked the children for help.
The children gladly agreed and went out searching for a lamp. After a few hours the children came back with the perfect lamp! It was very easy for them to find.
The old woman was so happy when she saw the lamp. She thanked the children for helping her. From then on, the old woman lit the lamp every day.
The moral of the story is that by helping others, we can make things easier for them.
