Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had a pretty dress that she loved to wear every day. One day, Lily's mom said, "Lily, your dress is dirty. Let's wash it." So, Lily and her mom washed the dress and hung it up to dry.
The next day, Lily wanted to wear her dress again. But when she put it on, she saw that it was too long. "Mom," said Lily, "my dress is too long. Can you cut it for me?" So, Lily's mom cut the dress to make it the right length.
Lily was so happy with her dress. She twirled around and around, feeling like a princess. "Thank you, Mom," said Lily. "I love my pretty dress!"
