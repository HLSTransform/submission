Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah. One day, Sarah wanted to do something fun, so she made a plan.
She ran to her mom and said, "Mommy, can I plan a party?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, you can plan a party. What do you want to do?"
Sarah said, "I want to have some friends over and play games. We can have a prize for the winner!"
Her mom thought it was a wonderful idea, so she helped Sarah plan the party. The next day, Sarah's friends came over and they all had a great time playing games. After all the games were done, Sarah's mom announced the winner and gave them the prize.
Everyone was happy and laughed a lot. They all had a friendly time together. Sarah was so proud of herself for planning such a fun party.
