Once there was a baby who loved to sleep. Every night, the baby would crawl into bed, close her eyes and go to sleep. But one night, the baby woke up feeling scared. Something smelly was in the room! 
The baby listened carefully and heard a noise coming from the corner. Suddenly, the baby saw something turn and she screamed! It was a mouse!
The baby quickly hid under the covers and the little mouse ran away. After that, the baby felt safe and went back to sleep. And the next morning, the baby woke up feeling happy and not so scared of the smelly mouse!
