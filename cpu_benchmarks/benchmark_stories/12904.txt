Once there was a nice little boy named Ted. He liked to climb lots of things like fences, trees and rocks. Today Ted woke up feeling extra special. He decided to explore a new place and try something he had never done before.
Ted thought that climbing a mountain would be exciting. So he asked his mom, “Mom can I go mountain climbing?”
“Oh my,” said his mom, “that's a little too difficult for you right now Ted, but I know a place you can go. It has a kind of flame at the top. It's called a lighthouse.”
Ted's face lit up with excitement. He knew his mom was right, climbing a lighthouse would be much better than climbing a mountain.
Ted put his best shoes and grabbed his hat. He said goodbye to his mom and started running towards the lighthouse.
As Ted was getting closer he could see the huge tower and the kind flame at the top. He stopped to take a breath and then climbed the stairs until he reached the top.
Ted looked around, he could see for miles in every direction. He felt so happy for his new adventure.
The sun was setting and it was time for Ted to go home, but he knew he would be back to climb his lighthouse again soon.
