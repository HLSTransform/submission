Sara and Ben like to paint. They have many colors of paint and big papers. They put on old shirts and sit on the floor. Sara paints a flower with red and yellow. Ben paints a car with blue and green.
"Look at my flower!" Sara says. "It is pretty!"
"Look at my car!" Ben says. "It is fast!"
They show each other their paintings. They smile and clap.
But then Ben sees a spot of red on his car. He does not like it. He thinks Sara did it. He gets angry.
"Hey, you put red on my car!" Ben says. "That is not nice!"
He takes his paintbrush and puts green on Sara's flower. He thinks that is funny.
"Hey, you put green on my flower!" Sara says. "That is not nice!"
She takes her paintbrush and puts yellow on Ben's car. She thinks that is funny.
They start to put paint on each other's paintings. They do not smile and clap. They yell and frown.
Mom hears them and comes to see. She sees the mess. She sees the paint on the floor, on the shirts, on the faces. She does not like it. She gets angry.
"Stop it, both of you!" Mom says. "That is not how you paint!"
She takes the paint and the papers away. She makes them wash their faces and hands. She makes them put on clean shirts. She makes them sit on the couch. She says they cannot paint anymore today.
Sara and Ben feel sad. They do not like to sit on the couch. They do not like to be angry. They look at each other. They say sorry.
"I'm sorry I put red on your car," Sara says.
"I'm sorry I put green on your flower," Ben says.
They hug and make up. They say they still like each other's paintings. They say they will be nice next time.
Mom sees them and smiles. She says they are good. She says they can paint again tomorrow. She says they can have a snack now.
Sara and Ben feel happy. They like to paint. They like to snack. They like to be nice. They go to the kitchen with Mom. They forget about the tight couch. They forget about the slap of the paintbrush. They remember the fun of the colors.
