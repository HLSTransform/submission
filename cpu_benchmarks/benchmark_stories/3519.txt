The family went for a walk in the park. The sun was shining and the sky was a bright blue. Daddy asked his two daughters if they wanted to play. The little girl, who was three, said she wanted to go to the swings. Daddy said it was a great idea so off they went.
The little girl ran to the swings and started to swing. She squealed with delight as Daddy pushed her higher and higher. Soon, her sister wanted to join in. Daddy asked her if she wanted to swing on the big swing or the small one, and the little girl said the small one. So Daddy put his two daughters on the swing, one on each side and they swung together, laughing and singing. They had a great time.
When they were done swinging, Daddy asked the little girl what she wanted to do next. She pointed to the slide and said, “Slide!” Daddy said that was a great idea, so he carried them both to the top of the slide. He showed them how to sit down and slide down the slide easily. The little girl had a great sight when she looked down the slide. She smiled and said, “Let's do that again!” So they did, again and again, until the girls were ready to go.
