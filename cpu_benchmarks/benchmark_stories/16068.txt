Once upon a time there was a bright little girl named Abigail who loved to play in the park.
One day while Abigail was playing, her mom shouted out her name. 
Abigail, come back! I have to mention something important.
Abigail ran back to her mom, curious to hear what it was. 
Mom said, “We need to take a trip to the hospital. It's an emergency.” 
Abigail’s eyes lit up. “Yay! Is it an adventure? Can I bring my favorite toy?”
Mom laughed. “No sweetie, it’s not an adventure. But don’t worry, you’ll still have lots of fun.”
They drove off to the hospital in their bright car. When they arrived, Abigail was in for a treat. She made some new friends, played with new toys, and even got to explore the hospital!
When it was time to go, Abigail was sad to leave, but happy about the new adventure she had. “I can’t wait to tell my friends about my emergency trip to the hospital!” she mentioned as they drove home.
