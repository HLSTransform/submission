Once there was a stubborn little spark. It buzzed around in the sky but it did not want to go away. No matter how hard the wind blew, the spark refused to leave. It resisted every gust and clung on tight.
One day, a raindrop spotted the spark in the sky. He flew up to try and convince the spark to leave. He said, "It's too wet up here. Come with me and be free!" But the spark shook her head and held firm. She was stubborn and she would not go. 
The raindrop was determined to make the spark leave. He tried every trick he knew but nothing worked. The spark continued to fly around. Suddenly, he heard a loud thundering noise. It was a lightning bolt!
The lightning bolt sped towards the spark. It was too fast for her to move out of the way. But just before it could strike, the spark put up a strong resistance. To the surprise of the raindrop, the spark managed to stand against the lightning and stayed in the sky. 
The stubborn little spark had proven her strength. She would not be moved.
