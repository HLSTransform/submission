Lily and Max were twins who liked to play with their toys. They had a lot of toys, but their favorite was a big castle with a queen and a king. They liked to pretend they were the queen and the king and have fun adventures.
One day, they decided to play with the castle in their room. Lily wanted to be the queen and Max wanted to be the king. They put the queen and the king on the castle and made them talk.
"Hello, queen. How are you today?" Max said in a deep voice.
"Hello, king. I am fine, thank you. But I am very sleepy. Can we go to bed?" Lily said in a high voice.
"Of course, queen. Let us go to our room and sleep." Max said.
They took the queen and the king and walked to their bed. But on the way, they bumped into a chair and dropped the queen. The queen fell on the floor and split in two. Lily and Max gasped.
"Oh no! The queen is broken!" Lily cried.
"It's okay, Lily. We can fix her. Don't be sad." Max said.
They picked up the two pieces of the queen and tried to put them together. But they did not fit. The queen was split for good.
Lily and Max felt very sorry for the queen. They hugged her and said they were sorry. Then they put her on their pillow and covered her with a blanket.
"Good night, queen. We love you." They said.
They lay down next to the queen and closed their eyes. They were very sleepy too. They dreamed of the castle and the king and the queen. They dreamed of happy adventures.
