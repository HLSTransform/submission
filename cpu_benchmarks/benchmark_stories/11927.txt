Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the forest. One day, she saw a deer. The deer was very clear and beautiful. Lily wanted to poke it, but her mom said no. 
Lily was sad, but she listened to her mom. She went to play with her toys instead. But then, she heard a loud noise. It was a hunter! The hunter wanted to poke the deer too, but he had a gun. 
Lily was scared and ran to her mom. She told her what she saw. Her mom called the police, but it was too late. The hunter shot the deer. Lily was very sad. She wished she could have poked the deer before it was too late.
