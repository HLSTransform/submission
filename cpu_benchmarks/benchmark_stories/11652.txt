Once there was a lion who lived in the zoo. He was very jealous of all the other animals in the zoo, because he couldn't go outside and explore like they could. Every day the lion watched the other animals and wished he could sleep outside.
One day the lion asked the zookeeper, "Can I leave the zoo and sleep outside?" The zookeeper said, "No, lions cannot leave the zoo. You must stay here." The lion felt very sad.
But later that night, the lion found a way out of the zoo. He picked the lock of his cage and crept out into the night. He followed the moonlight, and soon he was sleeping outside the zoo. 
It was a bad idea. In the morning, wild hunters found the lion and put him in a cage. Now he was back in the zoo, but this time he was in a caged so small he couldn't move. He was very unhappy, and he never got a chance to explore outside again.
