Once there was a little girl called Daisy. Daisy was a very tidy little girl and enjoyed tidying her room. One sunny day she decided to tidy her room even more. She took a prune from her special jar and started to notice a funny thing. As Daisy waved the prune around in the air, it started to disappear! Daisy couldn't believe her eyes. "Where did it go?" Daisy exclaimed.
Suddenly, Daisy heard a voice. It was coming from behind the door. It was her Grandma. Grandma said, "Daisy, I know what happened to the prune. I used my magic to make it disappear. Now use your magic to tidy your room!"
Daisy was so excited. She waved her hands around her room and in a flash everything became tidy. Daisy laughed with joy and thanked Grandma for her help. 
The prune never turned up again, but Daisy knew it was in a special place. She learned that with a little magic, Daisy could make anything tidy and disappear!
