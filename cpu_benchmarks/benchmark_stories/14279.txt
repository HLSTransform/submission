Once upon a time there was an old man who had a very special staff. He took it everywhere he went and polished it every day.
When the old man held his staff it made a loud noise. He liked to show it off to his friends and they would all be astonished with how shiny it was. 
One day the old man was walking around town with his staff. A small boy saw the staff and was very excited. He asked the old man if he could polish it too. 
The old man said yes, and the boy started using a small cloth to make it shine. When the boy was done he said “look how shiny it is!” and everyone was so happy. 
The old man thanked the boy for his hard work and from that day on they were the best of friends. 
They would take turns polishing the staff, giving it that extra shine. 
Everyone around them smiled when they heard the loud noise of the staff. It was a sign that the old man and the little boy were still friends.
