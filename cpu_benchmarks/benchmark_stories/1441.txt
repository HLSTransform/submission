Once upon a time there was a girl named Lucy. She loved nature. Every day, she would take a thin stick and go walking in the forest.
One day, Lucy saw a bird flapping his wings in the sky. She wanted to fly like the bird, so she asked her mom for help. She requested for some wings.
Her mom smiled lovingly and told Lucy that only nature can give her wings. She said, “Look around you, Lucy! Nature has many gifts to offer.”
Lucy looked around. The trees were waving in the breeze, the little birds were chirping happily and the sun was shining brightly. Lucy smiled and said, “Yes, nature is a wonderful place!”
From that day on, Lucy would always take a thin stick and explore her beautiful nature. She knew that if she was patient, nature would reward her with the gift of wings one day.
