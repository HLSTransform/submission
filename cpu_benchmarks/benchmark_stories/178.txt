Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a best friend named Timmy. They loved to play together all the time. One day, Timmy wanted to play with his toy trucks, but Lily wanted to play with her dolls. 
Timmy said, "I don't want to play with dolls. Let's play with my trucks." 
Lily felt sad because she really wanted to play with her dolls. But then she had an idea. "Let's complete our own game. We can play with your trucks and my dolls. It will be fun!" 
Timmy thought it was a good idea and they played together happily. Lily was happy that she didn't have to give up playing with her dolls and Timmy was happy that he could play with his trucks too. They were both friends and didn't want to be bossy to each other. They knew that playing together and being happy was more important than being bossy.
