Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very kind and loved to play with her toys. One day, Lily's mom asked her to please clean up her toys before dinner. Lily happily said "yes" and started to pick up her toys.
As she was cleaning, Lily found a big surprise hiding under her bed. It was a shiny red balloon! She was so happy and couldn't wait to show her mom. But instead of putting her toys away, Lily started to play with the balloon.
Suddenly, the balloon popped and scared Lily. She started to cry and her mom came rushing in. Unfortunately, Lily had hurt her hand and couldn't play with her toys or balloons anymore. She learned that it's important to listen to her mom and be careful with surprises. The end.
