Once upon a time, there was a big elephant named Elly. Elly lived in a nice, clean house with her friend, Tim. They liked to play and have fun together.
One day, Tim showed Elly a fake toy elephant. Elly was happy to see it. They played with the toy elephant all day long. They laughed and laughed, and had a great time.
When it was time to go to bed, Elly and Tim cleaned up their toys. They put the fake toy elephant away and said good night. They were happy to live in a clean house and to have each other as friends.
