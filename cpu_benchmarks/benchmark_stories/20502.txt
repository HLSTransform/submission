Once upon a time there was a man. His name was Tom. One day Tom was walking in a park. He saw a box by his foot.
Tom was curious. He opened the box and inside saw a bright light. The light was so bright Tom had to look away. Suddenly the light vanished.
Tom checked to see what had happened. Inside the box was a bad pain! Tom was scared so he closed the box and ran away.
The next day Tom went back to the park. The box was gone! The box had vanished. 
Tom was glad it was gone. He opened his eyes and smiled. The pain had disappeared too!
