Jimmy was very excited because his mum gave him a new bag. The bag was soft and brown, like a teddy bear. He held the bag and looked around. He saw many interesting things, but nothing was as interesting as his special bag.
Then something magical happened! Jimmy put his hand in the bag and he felt something furry. Suddenly, the bag became alive. Out popped a small, soft kitty, who purred and mewed. Her fur was soft and fluffy, and she looked so cuddly.
Jimmy was so excited to have a real pet. He named her Daisy, and he gave her some food and played games with her. They were best friends and did everything together. Jimmy and Daisy were now inseparable.
