Once upon a time, there was a lizard. He was very smooth and liked hopping around. He was always looking for something fun to do. One day he saw an old tree. He thought it was the perfect place to explore!
He hopped up the tree and found a special surprise - an acorn! He was so happy. He wanted to show his friends, so he promised them he would bring the acorn to play with.
The next day, he hopped back up the tree and grabbed the acorn. Then, he hurried back to show his friends. When they saw it, they all cheered! They were so excited to play with the acorn.
They came up with some fun games and ran around with it everywhere! It was a perfect day. The lizard kept his promise and showed his friends a really fun time.
