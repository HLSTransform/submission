Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat celery because it was crunchy and tasty. One day, Lily's mom went to the store to buy some more celery, but she didn't come back right away. Lily started to worry that her mom was lost. 
But then, Lily's mom came back and she was very excited because she found a new kind of celery that was even yummier than the one they usually ate. Lily was happy that her mom was back and even happier that they had a new kind of celery to try. From then on, they always ate the new kind of celery and were very happy. The end.
