Tommy was playing in the park when he spotted a big, shiny fridge. He was very curious and went closer to the fridge to take a closer look. He tried to open it, but it was locked. 
“What do I do?” he asked.
Suddenly, he heard a soft voice behind him. He turned around and saw an old man standing next to him. 
“Be patient, my boy. Everything will unlock in time!” the man said.
Tommy smiled politely, thanked the old man and returned home. When he got there, he realised he had been patient and hadn't forced things. Tommy learnt something important that day: sometimes it is better to wait than to be in a hurry.
