Once upon a time there was a girl named Lucy. She loved to decorate her room. She would put pretty bows on her dresser and hang colorful balloons on the wall. 
One day, Lucy saw something very special. It was a huge box of candy! "Oh my!" she said, eyes wide open with excitement. 
Lucy quickly opened the box and found sparkly candies in every color of the rainbow. She decided to decorate her room with them. She hung the candy on the walls, on the window sill, and even around her bed. 
When her mom saw the candy decorations she said, "Lucy, your room looks so bright and sweet!" Lucy smiled and said, "Thanks, Mom! It was fun to decorate!"
