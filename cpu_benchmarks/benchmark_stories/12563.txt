Sara has a pink scarf. She likes her scarf very much. She wears it every day when she goes out. Her scarf is soft and warm and pretty.
One day, Sara goes to the park with her mom. She sees a dog. The dog is big and brown and friendly. Sara wants to pet the dog. She asks her mom if she can.
"Yes, you can, but be careful," her mom says. "The dog might not like your scarf."
Sara goes to the dog. She says hello. The dog wags his tail. He likes Sara. Sara pets the dog. She says, "You are a nice dog. What is your name?"
The dog barks. He says, "My name is Max. I like your scarf. It is pink. Can I have it?"
Sara is surprised. She says, "No, you can't have my scarf. It is mine. I like it very much."
The dog looks sad. He says, "But I am cold. And I like pink. Please, can I have your scarf?"
Sara thinks. She likes the dog. He is nice and friendly. But she likes her scarf too. She does not want to give it away. She has an idea.
She says, "You can't have my scarf, but you can share it. We can both wear it. Then we will both be warm and pretty."
The dog smiles. He says, "OK, that sounds good. Thank you, Sara. You are a kind girl."
Sara and Max wrap the scarf around their necks. They look at each other. They are happy. They are friends. They play in the park with the pink scarf.
