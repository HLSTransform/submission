Today, Little Willy was playing in the garden. He was running around the garden and when he got a bit too hot, he decided he wanted to have a nice cool bath. He ran into the bathroom, and jumped straight into his big bath. He splashed around, laughing and giggling. There were lots of bubbles in his bath, and they felt nice and soft on his skin. 
He used his toy boat to splash the bubbles around. It felt delicious! Little Willy liked taking baths, and he knew he would enjoy this one too. He splashed the water all the way up to the bathroom ceiling! 
After enough splashing around, Little Willy decided it was time to get out of the bath. He dried off, got dressed and he was ready to go back to playing in the garden. It had been a delicious bath!
