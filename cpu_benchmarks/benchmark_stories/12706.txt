Once upon a time, there was a happy family. Mama and Papa wanted to have a special day together. Mama brought home a special bottle of wine and Papa set out two cups. He filled the cups with a thick, purple liquid. 
Mama said to Papa, "Let's make a toast!" They hugged each other and clinked their cups together. Papa said, "Let's drink this yummy wine and be happy!" He took a big sip of the thick liquid.
Mama smiled. She said, "Let's hug each other and then drink the wine together." They hugged tightly and laughed. Then they each took another sip of the special wine. Papa said, "This wine is delicious! Let's do this again soon." 
They hugged once more and finished their cups of wine. The happy family smiled, grateful that they could be together and have such a special moment. They agreed to do this again soon.
