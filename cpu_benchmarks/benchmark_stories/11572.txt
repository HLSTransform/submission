One day, a tall boy named Tim went for a walk. He wanted to observe things around him. He saw a big tree, a small dog, and a red ball. Tim loved to see all the things in his town.
As he walked, Tim found a letter on the ground. He picked it up and looked at it. It had a picture of a cat on it. Tim wanted to find the person who lost the letter. He asked a girl he saw, "Is this your letter?"
The girl looked at the letter and said, "No, that is not my letter. But I think it is my friend's letter. She loves cats." Tim and the girl went to find her friend. When they found her, she was so happy to get her letter back. Tim felt good that he could help.
