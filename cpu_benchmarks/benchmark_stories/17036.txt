Mia and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and books. One day, they find a big box in the living room. They wonder what is inside.
"Let's open it!" Mia says.
"OK!" Ben says.
They lift the lid and see a small, furry animal. It has long ears, a pink nose and a fluffy tail. It looks at them with big, brown eyes.
"A bunny!" Mia says.
"It's so charming!" Ben says.
They take the bunny out of the box and hug it gently. The bunny makes a soft noise and wiggles its nose. Mia and Ben laugh.
"Can we keep it, Mom?" Mia asks.
Mom comes into the living room and smiles. She sees the bunny and the twins.
"Of course, you can keep it. It's a gift from Grandma. She knows you love animals. But you have to take good care of it. It needs food, water and a clean cage," Mom says.
"What does it eat?" Ben asks.
"It eats carrots, lettuce and hay. I have some in the kitchen. Come on, let's feed it," Mom says.
Mia and Ben follow Mom to the kitchen. They give the bunny some food and water. The bunny eats happily and makes a crunching noise. Mia and Ben watch it with joy.
They decide to name the bunny Fluffy. They play with Fluffy every day and make sure it has everything it needs. Fluffy is a charming and friendly bunny. It loves Mia and Ben and they love it too. They are very happy with their new pet.
