Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to wear her favorite jacket with a zipper. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. She saw a boy named Max who had a very hairy dog with him. 
Lily asked Max if she could pet the dog, but Max said no because the dog was very protective. Lily felt sad and left to play with her other friends. Later that day, Lily and Max decided to have a race to see who could run the fastest. 
Lily was nervous because she didn't think she could win against Max, who was very fast. But then she remembered something her dad had taught her. He said, "If you want to win, you have to believe in yourself." So, Lily took a deep breath, and when the race started, she ran as fast as she could. 
To everyone's surprise, Lily won the race! Max was amazed and said, "Wow, you're really fast!" Lily smiled and said, "Thanks, I believed in myself." Max then let Lily pet his dog, and she was happy. From that day on, Lily knew that if she believed in herself, she could do anything she wanted.
