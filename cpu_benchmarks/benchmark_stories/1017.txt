Once there was a big pool. The water was shiny and one day a bell began to ring. Everyone was so excited because it meant that it was time to have fun.
The children ran to the pool and dashed in. They laughed and splashed around in the big pool. One of the kids found a big floaty and floated around for a while. Then they started playing games like diving for toys and having races.
When the bell rang again, it was time to get out and dry off. Everyone was so tired from the fun they had been having. They dried off know that they had had a great time in the big pool.
