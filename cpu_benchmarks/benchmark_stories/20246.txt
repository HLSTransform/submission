Once upon a time, there was a fireman named Tom. Tom was a little unusual because he had a big, red hat and a very long nose. He was always happy and loved to help people.
One day, a little girl named Jane saw Tom and had a question. She asked, "Why do you have such a big, red hat and a long nose?" Tom smiled and said, "It's because I am special and different from other firemen. But that's what makes me good at my job."
Later that day, there was a fire in a big house. Tom and the other firemen went to put out the fire. The fire was very hot and scary, but Tom's big, red hat and long nose helped him get close to the fire and put it out quickly.
After the fire, Jane saw Tom again and said, "Thank you for saving the house! Now I know that being different is not bad, but it can be very good." Tom smiled and said, "That's right! Being unusual makes us special, and we can use our differences to help others."
And so, Jane learned a valuable lesson: it's good to be different, and we should celebrate our unusual qualities because they make us who we are.
