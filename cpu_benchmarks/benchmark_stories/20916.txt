Once there was a boy named Ben. Ben was curious, but he struggled to understand words. One day he saw an old saw in his Grandad's shed. It was a special purple saw! Ben wanted to pick it up but he knew not to. 
Beside the saw, Ben found a purple hammer with a spiked head. He tried pounding it on the shed wall, but it made a loud noise that made him suffer. He knew he shouldn't make too much noise, so he put it down. 
Finally, Ben decided to take the purple saw outside. He rolled it along the grass and watched as the bright purple sparkled in the sun. Ben was so happy that he jumped for joy, not suffering at all!
