George was very excited one day. He was going on a jet! He had never been on a jet before and he couldn't wait. When he got on the jet, he saw something rare. He saw a butterfly! It was a very pretty blue and pink butterfly. 
George watched the butterfly as the jet flew high up in the sky. Eventually, he got so sleepy that he had to take a nap. He was happy when he woke up, because he looked out the window and saw the butterfly again. He was so lucky to see something so rare!
The jet soon arrived at their destination. George was sad that his jet ride was over, but he was happy that he had seen the rare butterfly. He couldn't wait to tell everyone about his adventure!
