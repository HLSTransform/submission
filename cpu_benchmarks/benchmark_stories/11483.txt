Once upon a time, a humble pony was walking along the meadow. He felt very lonely, so he decided to look for a friend. As he was looking around, he spotted a little girl playing with a ball. The pony trotted over to her and asked if he could join her.
The little girl was surprised to see the pony and said, “Can you lift the ball?”
The pony smiled and said, “Yes, I can lift it.”
The little girl smiled too and said, “Great! You can be my friend.”
The pony and the little girl spent the rest of the day playing together. The pony lifted the ball and the little girl chased after it, laughing as she went. 
At the end of the day, the little girl said to the pony, “Thank you for being my friend.”
The pony said, “No problem. That’s what friends do.”
The moral of this story is that it’s always nice to be humble and help your friends when they need it.
