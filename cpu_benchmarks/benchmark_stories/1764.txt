Joey was standing outside the church, dreaming. He wanted to go inside, but he was too young. It was rare that kids were allowed inside.
Mama was walking towards him. "Do you want to come inside with me, Joey?"
"Yes, Mama!" Joey said excitedly.
She put her hand on his shoulder and said, "I'm sorry, sweetheart, but you can't come inside yet."
Joey hung his head and his little lip started to tremble. Mama cupped his chin and said, "I promise, soon you will be able to come in."
The weeks went by and soon it was time for Joey's fourth birthday. As a special gift, Mama took him to the church. Joey was filled with joy - he was finally able to go inside.
"See, I told you that you would be able to come in," Mama said with a smile.
Joey looked around the big room and smiled. He had been dreaming of this moment for a long time. Mama was right - dreams do come true, even if they seem rare.
