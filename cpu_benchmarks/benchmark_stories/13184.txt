Once upon a time, there was a big, strong bird. He had wings to help him fly. He was always looking for ways to protect his family and friends.
One day, the bird saw something moving in the tree. It was a small, furry creature. The bird knew the creature was ignorant about the world so he decided to look after it. He told the creature he would take care of it, and protect it from danger.
The bird spread his wings and let the creature climb onto his back. He then flew very high, and showed it the most beautiful sights in the sky. The furry creature smiled and said how happy he was.
The bird smiled as he knew he'd done the right thing. He had used his wings to protect the ignorant creature and make it feel safe. From then on, the bird and the creature were friends forever.
