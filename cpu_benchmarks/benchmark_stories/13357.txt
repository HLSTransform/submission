Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was scared of the dark and always had a night light on. One day, her mom gave her a special pill that would prevent bad dreams. 
Lily took the pill and went to bed feeling happy and safe. She fell asleep quickly and had a wonderful dream about unicorns and rainbows. 
The next morning, Lily woke up feeling refreshed and not fearful at all. She told her mom about her good dream and how the pill helped her. Her mom was happy to hear that the pill worked and that Lily wasn't scared anymore. 
From that day on, Lily took the pill every night and never had a bad dream again. She was no longer fearful of the dark and was able to sleep peacefully.
