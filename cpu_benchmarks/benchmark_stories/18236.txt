One day, a boy named Tim and a girl named Sue went to play in the park. They liked to run and laugh. They were very happy. Tim liked to tell jokes to make Sue laugh. 
But there was a big boy in the park too. His name was Max. Max was ignorant and did not like jokes. He saw Tim and Sue running and laughing. Max did not like that. He wanted them to stop. So Max went to Tim and Sue and told them to stop laughing and running.
Tim and Sue did not want to stop. They just wanted to have fun. So Tim told Max a joke to make him laugh. Max did not laugh at first, but then he started to smile. Max learned to like jokes and running too. Now, Tim, Sue, and Max all played together in the park, running and laughing. They were all happy friends.
