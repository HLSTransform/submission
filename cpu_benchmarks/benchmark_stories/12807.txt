Henry was always eager to spend time in the park. One day he asked his mum if he could go. His mum said yes and off he went.
Henry could see the slide in the distance. He ran towards it and as he got closer, he noticed that it was filthy. He couldn't believe his eyes-- it was caked in mud and leaves. But his curiosity got the better of him, and he still wanted to enter.
He called out to his mum, "Mum, please help me. I want to go on the slide, but it's so filthy!" His mum laughed and said, "Henry, you need to clean it off first."
With a determined look in his eyes, Henry grabbed a nearby bucket and filled it with water. He mixed in some soap and vigorously scrubbed each part of the slide. After a few minutes, the slide was back to its original state.
Henry proudly entered the slide and he enjoyed a long, fun ride. After he finished, he noticed that all the other park slides were in a similar condition. Henry decided to help tidy up the entire park. Before long, the park was looking good as new.
Henry's mum was proud of her little helper. She smiled proudly and gave Henry a big hug. Henry was glad that he had done something good for the park.
