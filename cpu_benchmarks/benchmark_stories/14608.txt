Mum put the popcorn in the bowl. It was crunchy and smelled so yummy. But the popcorn was very bitter. All the kids made a face and pulled their tongues. "No I don't want it. It's too bitter." said the little girl.
But then, Mum had an idea. She put some butter and sugar on the popcorn and stirred it up. It started to look more appetising. She put it in the bowl and gave it to the kids.
The kids tried a bit of the popcorn. They chewed and swallowed and waited for the taste. As they ate, the tasty popcorn flavours filled their mouths. "Mmm..." They said it was so delicious. The popcorn was crunchy, sugary and yummy. They ate it all up, licking the bowl too!
