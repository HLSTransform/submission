Once upon a time, there was a green frog who lived in a pond. The little frog was very nosy and liked to watch all the other animals in the pond. One day, the frog saw a fish in the water who was stuck in some weeds. The frog wanted to help, so he hopped over to the fish and started to pull the weeds. The frog worked very hard, and soon the fish was free! The frog had saved the fish! The fish thanked the frog with a smile and then hopped away. The frog was happy he could help his new friend and he smiled too. The end.
