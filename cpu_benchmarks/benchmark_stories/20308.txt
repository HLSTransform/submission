Lena and Tom are playing in their room. They have a big sheet and some chairs. They want to make a tent with the sheet. Lena says, "I will stand on this chair and hold the sheet. You stand on that chair and hold the other end." Tom nods and does what Lena says.
But then, their dog, Spot, comes into the room. Spot is a lively dog. He likes to run and jump and bark. He sees the sheet and thinks it is a toy. He runs to the sheet and pulls it with his teeth. Lena and Tom shout, "No, Spot, no! Let go of the sheet!"
Spot does not listen. He tugs harder on the sheet. The sheet slips from Lena's hand. Lena falls off the chair and lands on the floor. She cries, "Ow, ow, ow! Spot, you are a bad dog!" Tom jumps off his chair and runs to Lena. He hugs her and says, "Are you okay, Lena? I'm sorry, Spot is a silly dog."
Spot drops the sheet and looks at Lena and Tom. He wags his tail and licks their faces. He thinks they are playing with him. He barks, "Woof, woof, woof! I love you, Lena and Tom!" Lena and Tom are not happy. They push Spot away and say, "Go away, Spot! You ruined our tent!" They pick up the sheet and the chairs and try to make the tent again.
