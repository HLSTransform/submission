Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim wanted to build a sandcastle at the beach. He had a yellow bucket and a yellow shovel to help him. Tim filled the bucket with sand and started to build the castle. 
Suddenly, the sun came out and it was very bright. Tim's mom gave him a pair of sunglasses to wear. They were yellow too! Tim put on the sunglasses and continued to build his sandcastle. 
After a while, Tim's sandcastle was finished. It was the best sandcastle he had ever built! He was so happy and proud of himself. Tim took off his sunglasses and went to show his mom his amazing creation.
