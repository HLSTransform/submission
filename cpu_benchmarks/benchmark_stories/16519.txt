Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and pretend they were real. One day, she found a figure that looked just like her favorite doll, but it was fake. 
Lily asked her mom, "What is this figure?" Her mom replied, "It's a toy, but it's not real like your other dolls." 
Lily didn't like that the figure was fake, so she decided to give it to her little brother. When her brother saw the figure, he was so happy and said, "Thank you, Lily!" 
Lily smiled and replied, "You're welcome, little brother. I'm glad you like it." From that day on, Lily learned that even though something might be fake, it can still make someone else happy.
