Once upon a time, there was a wealthy family with a mom, a dad, and their two children. Every night, the family would sit together at the dinner table and share stories. 
One night, the mom opened a bottle of wine to share with the family. "This wine is so special," she said. "It's from the most grand vineyard in the world!" 
The dad smiled and took a sip. "Mmm. Delicious!"
The children looked wide-eyed at the bottle. "What's wine?" asked the youngest.
Mom and dad looked at each other and chuckled. "Wine is a special drink," mom said. "It's only for grownups!" 
Both children put their hands behind their backs and nodded. "We will listen carefully," the eldest said. 
The mom smiled and filled each glass with wine. They drank, laughed and shared stories until bedtime. 
At the end of the night, the mom told the two children, "Let's remember to listen carefully and also be thankful for all our blessings. We're a very lucky and wealthy family!" The children nodded in agreement. 
The family gave each other a hug and went to bed.
