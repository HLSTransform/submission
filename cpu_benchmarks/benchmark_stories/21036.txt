Mama and Jack went to the park. Jack was eager to play with the other kids.
"I want to perform with them," said Jack excitedly.
Mama laughed and agreed. They both got out of the car and followed the other children.
The kids handed Jack a toy and told him to perform. Jack was so happy to do it. He put on a show for everyone. He sang, danced, and juggled. Everyone congratulated him.
Suddenly, Mama saw Jack getting ahold of ice-cream from one of the children. She was worried he would make a mess. But Jack eagerly took a big bite of it. Mama was too late!
Jack had to go home right away and no more playtime. Mama was sad and mad. Poor Jack!
