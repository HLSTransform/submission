Billy was a regular boy who loved to play with toys. His mom gave him a new toy one day - it was a little bow with a handle. He was so happy to have it and he laughed and smiled as he played.
Billy found a very special spot to put the bow. It was with the other toys in his toy box. He carefully put it in and shut the lid.
But then something terrible happened. The handle of the bow got caught on to the toy box and it wouldn't come off. Billy tried to pull the bow out but it wouldn't budge. He started to cry and his mom came to help him. But it was too late - the handle was stuck tight.
Billy was so sad. His mom tried to help but it was no use. The special toy was ruined and he couldn't play with it anymore. He had to give the bow away. So his mom took him to the shop and he said goodbye to his toy forever.
