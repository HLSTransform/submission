Once upon a time, there was a big green ship. It sailed on the sea and had lots of fun. One day, the ship saw a little fish. The fish was scared and wanted to hide. The ship was kind and said, "Don't worry, little fish. I will close my eyes and you can hide behind me." The fish felt safe and hid behind the ship. The ship was happy to help the little fish. From that day on, the ship and the fish became good friends and sailed on the sea together.
