Once upon a time there was a young boy. He had a special hat. He wanted to wear it but it was broken. So he asked his mom to help him fix it. 
Mom took a look and saw that the hat was torn on one side. She got out her sewing kit and picked out a blue thread. She threaded her needle and slowly stitched the hat together again.
When she was done, the hat looked as good as new. The young boy put it on his head and jumped up and down with joy. He thanked his mom and said it was the best hat ever.
The young boy was so happy that he began to run around outside playing games with his friends. Everywhere he went, he proudly wore his fixed hat. 
The hat continued to stay strong and healthy, no matter how much he ran and played. The boy was very thankful he was able to fix his hat with his mom's help.
