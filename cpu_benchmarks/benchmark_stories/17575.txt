Lila was a fairy who liked to shine. She had a wand that made bright sparks when she waved it. She loved to fly around the garden and make the flowers and the bugs glow. She was happy and free.
One day, she saw a big glass jar on the grass. It had a shiny lid and a label that said "Jam". Lila was curious. She flew closer to the jar and saw a red and sticky stuff inside. It looked yummy. She wanted to taste it.
She pushed the lid with her wand, but it was too heavy. She tried to pull it with her hands, but it was too tight. She thought of a clever idea. She used her wand to make a hole in the lid. Then she squeezed through the hole and flew into the jar.
She dipped her finger in the jam and licked it. It was sweet and sour. She liked it a lot. She ate more and more, until her tummy was full. She felt sleepy. She decided to take a nap in the jar.
She closed her eyes and snored. She did not hear the footsteps of a big boy who came to the garden. He saw the jar and picked it up. He saw Lila inside and smiled. He liked fairies. He wanted to keep her as a pet.
He carried the jar to his room and put it on his shelf. He screwed the lid back on, with the hole still there. He did not know that Lila needed air to breathe. He did not know that she would suffocate in the jar. He did not know that he had killed her.
He went to play with his toys and forgot about the jar. Lila never woke up. She never shone again. She was not happy and free. She was not safe.
