Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to school because he got to learn new things every day. One day, Timmy's teacher told the class they were going on a field trip to a big, enormous museum. 
Timmy was so excited because he had never been to a museum before. He couldn't wait to discover all the cool things inside. When they arrived, Timmy's teacher told them they were going to see a dinosaur exhibit. 
Timmy had always been fascinated by dinosaurs, so he was thrilled. As they walked through the exhibit, Timmy's eyes grew wider and wider. He couldn't believe how enormous the dinosaur bones were! Timmy was so happy he got to discover something new and exciting at the museum.
