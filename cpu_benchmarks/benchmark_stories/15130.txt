Bob and Max were best friends. Bob had a big red firetruck which he loved to play with. But one day, he drove his firetruck over a big rock, and it broke. Max could see that Bob was sad. So he said, "Don't worry Bob, I will help you fix your firetruck".
Max went to the store, and he saw a box with a new gear inside. He asked the storekeeper to sell him the gear, and the storekeeper said "Yes, this gear is reliable and it will replace the broken gear in your firetruck". So Max bought the gear and he took it to Bob.
Bob was so happy! He carefully put the gear in the firetruck and it worked again. Bob and Max hugged and they were so glad they were able to fix the firetruck. Bob's firetruck was reliable and it was ready to go.
