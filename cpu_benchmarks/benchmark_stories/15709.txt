Once upon a time, there was a big scary monster. He had big pointy teeth, green scales and mean eyes. He hated people and always made lots of sound.
One day, there was a brave girl. Her name was Amy. She had a plan to make the monster happy.
She gathered all her equipment and went to find the monster. When she saw him, she said: "Hi, big guy! I have presents for you!"
The monster did not recognize Amy. He stared at her like she was bad. Amy held up her equipment and said: "Look, I brought you cool things!"
The monster recognized the presents. His eyes twinkled and he made a happy noise.
Amy was glad the monster was happy now. She said good-bye and went home. The monster smiled and waved as she left.
