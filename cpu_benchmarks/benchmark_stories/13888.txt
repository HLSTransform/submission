Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Billy. Billy lived in a high tree with his family. He loved to fly and play with his friends all day.
One day, Billy saw a big red ball stuck in his tree. He wanted to play with it, but he didn't know how to get it down. So, he asked his friend, Tommy the squirrel, for help. "Tommy, please help me get the ball down," said Billy. "What is your opinion on how to do it?"
Tommy thought for a moment and said, "I think we can work together. I will climb the tree, and you can fly and push the ball. Then, it will fall down, and we can play with it."
Billy liked Tommy's opinion, so they worked together to get the ball down. They played with the ball all day and had lots of fun. In the end, they were very happy that they had helped each other and learned the importance of teamwork.
