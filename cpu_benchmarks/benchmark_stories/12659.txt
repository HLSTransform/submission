Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a big, modern house with her mommy and daddy. One day, while playing outside, Lily found a shiny, red balloon. She was so happy and played with it all day long.
But when it was time for bed, Lily realized the balloon was gone. She looked everywhere but couldn't find it. She started to cry and suffer because she loved that balloon so much. Her mommy and daddy tried to comfort her, but it didn't work.
The next day, Lily's mommy took her to the store to buy a new balloon. They picked out a beautiful blue one with a number 5 on it. Lily was happy again and played with it all day. But when it was time for bed, she remembered what happened to the red balloon and was afraid she would lose this one too. However, this time she made sure to hold it tight and not let it go. From that day on, Lily learned to take care of her things and not suffer when she lost them.
