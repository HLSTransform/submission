Once upon a time, there lived a young girl named Jamie. She was so sad that she often cried and always seemed a bit down. Her best friend, Maria, always tried to cheer her up. 
On a sunny day, Jamie was out in the garden with Maria, when Jamie started to weep. Maria asked her why she was so sad and Jamie explained that she had messed up in school that week and didn't want to tell her parents. She was feeling very ashamed.
Maria hugged Jamie and promised to help her. She suggested they put some food on the grill and have a picnic in the garden. Jamie smiled, feeling a little better.
When they were having their picnic, Jamie's parents joined them. When they asked what was going on, Jamie felt scared. But Maria spoke up and said that Jamie was sad because she had made a mistake in school. 
Jamie's parents were sad to hear it but they were more proud of Jamie for telling the truth. They smiled at her and said that everyone makes mistakes â€“what's important is to learn from them. Jamie smiled and hugged her parents, feeling much better. 
Maria had helped Jamie through her difficult time and Jamie was grateful for her friend. With Maria's help, Jamie knew she would never be too ashamed to tell the truth again.
