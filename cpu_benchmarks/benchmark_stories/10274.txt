Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and kick his ball around. One day, he found a mystery box in his backyard. The box was big and had a clear window on the front. Timmy was curious and wanted to know what was inside. 
He tried to open the box, but it was locked. Timmy kicked the box to see if it would open, but it didn't work. He asked his mom for help, but she didn't know what was inside either. The mystery box remained a mystery. 
Timmy continued to play outside, kicking his ball around and enjoying the sunshine. Even though he never found out what was inside the box, he was happy just being outside and having fun.
