Lily and Tom are brother and sister. They like to play in the garden with their ball and their dog. One day, their mom calls them from the kitchen. "Lily, Tom, come inside! The beef is ready!" she says.
Lily and Tom hear their mom and run to the door. But their dog sees a cat and chases it. The dog barks and the cat hisses. Lily and Tom want to see what happens. They forget about the beef and follow their dog.
Their mom waits for them in the kitchen. She has cooked a big beef roast with potatoes and carrots. She is hungry and wants to eat with her children. She looks at the clock and wonders where they are. She calls them again. "Lily, Tom, where are you? The beef is getting cold!"
Lily and Tom hear their mom again. They see that their dog has caught the cat and is playing with it. They think it is funny and laugh. They do not listen to their mom and stay in the garden.
Their mom gets angry and sad. She decides to eat the beef by herself. She cuts a big slice and puts it on her plate. She takes a bite and says, "Mmm, this is delicious. Too bad Lily and Tom are missing it."
Lily and Tom smell the beef from the garden. They remember that they are hungry and want to eat too. They leave their dog and the cat and run to the kitchen. They see their mom eating the beef. They say, "Mom, we are here! Can we have some beef too?"
Their mom looks at them and shakes her head. She says, "No, you cannot. You did not listen to me when I called you. You did not come when the beef was ready. Now the beef is gone. You have to wait until the next meal."
Lily and Tom feel sorry and ashamed. They realize that they were rude and selfish. They say, "Mom, we are sorry. We should have listened to you. We should have come when you called us. We love you and your beef."
Their mom smiles and hugs them. She says, "I love you too, my children. But you have to learn to obey and respect me. And you have to appreciate what I cook for you. Maybe next time you will come when the beef is ready."
Lily and Tom nod and promise to do better. They hug their mom and their dog and their cat. They learn their lesson and never miss the beef again.
The moral value of the story is: Listen to your parents and appreciate what they do for you.
