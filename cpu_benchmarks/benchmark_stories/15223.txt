Once upon a time, there was a thoughtful little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play and pretend with his toys. One day, Tim decided to pretend that there was a big flood in his room.
He took a big blue blanket and put it on the floor. The blue blanket was the flood water. Tim and his toys had to be very careful not to touch the blue blanket. They had to jump from one safe spot to another, like from his bed to a chair.
In the end, Tim and his toys saved the day. They used a long rope made from his socks to pull the flood away. The room was safe again, and Tim was happy. He knew that being thoughtful and using his imagination could make any day a fun adventure.
