Lily liked to swim in the sea with her dad. She loved to see the fish and the shells and the seaweed. But she was afraid of the big octopus that lived in the cave. Her dad told her not to go near the cave, because the octopus was bitter and mean. He said the octopus did not like anyone who came to his home.
One day, Lily saw a shiny thing in the water. It looked like a necklace with a star on it. She wanted to have it for herself. She swam closer and closer to the shiny thing. She did not see that it was near the cave of the octopus. She reached out her hand to grab the necklace.
Suddenly, a big tentacle came out of the cave and wrapped around Lily's arm. She screamed and tried to pull away, but the octopus was stronger. She saw his big eyes and his sharp beak. He looked angry and hungry. She was very scared.
Her dad heard her scream and swam as fast as he could. He saw the octopus and Lily. He grabbed a rock and hit the octopus on the head. The octopus let go of Lily and went back to his cave. He was hurt and mad. He remained bitter and mean.
Lily hugged her dad and cried. She was sorry for being naughty and not listening to him. She did not want the necklace anymore. She just wanted to be safe and happy with her dad. Her dad kissed her and told her he loved her. He said they should go back to the shore and have some ice cream. Lily agreed and smiled. She learned her lesson. She never went near the cave of the octopus again.
