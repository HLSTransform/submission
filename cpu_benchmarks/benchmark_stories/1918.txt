Once upon a time, a little boy found a big boot. It had a sparkle in it, so he decided to keep it. He named the boot Lucky and carried it with him wherever he went.
One day, while he was walking across the meadows, he saw an old man stuck up in a tree. The little boy was so scared that he wanted to run away, but then he remembered his lucky boot. He knew it could come in handy, so he decided to stay.
He called up the old man and said, "Please don't be scared, I will help you." Then he put on the large boot and started to push the tree aside. The old man thanked the little boy and said, "You are so brave and so lucky. You were able to save me with your boot."
The little boy was very lucky to have his boot, but it also reminded him of how important it is to help people in need. If you are ever in trouble, make sure to ask for help, because someone will be there for you.
