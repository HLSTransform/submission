Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a beautiful pink dress and loved to play outside. One day, she was walking in the park when she saw a big dog. The dog started barking and Lily began to panic. She didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, she saw a post nearby and ran to it. She climbed up the post and felt safe up high. The dog couldn't reach her anymore. But then, she realized she was stuck up there and couldn't get down. She started to cry and panic even more.
Luckily, her mom heard her cries and came to rescue her. She helped her down from the post and hugged her tight. Lily felt relieved and happy to be safe again. From that day on, she knew to be careful around big dogs and always look for a safe post.
