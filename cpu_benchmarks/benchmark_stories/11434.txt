Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Daisy. She was very curious. One day, she heard an engine and she wanted to find out what it was. 
Daisy's mom said, "OK, let's go and see it."
So Daisy and her mom went to go and find the engine and when they got there, Daisy was so amazed. 
Daisy said, "Wow! What is this?"
Her mom said, "This is an engine."
Daisy said, "Can I let it go?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, let it go and see what happens."
So Daisy let the engine go and it started spinning around and around so quickly. Daisy felt a bit dizzy looking at it. 
Daisy's mom said, "Look how fast it's going!" 
Daisy said, "Wow!" and smiled. 
The engine kept spinning around until Daisy and her mom had to go home. Daisy was so happy that she had got to see and let the engine go.
