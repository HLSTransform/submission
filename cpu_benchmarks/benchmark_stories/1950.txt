Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was 3 years old and full of joy. Every day she liked to skip around her neighbourhood with her friends. 
One day, when she was out skipping, she noticed something strange. There were lots of different kinds of cars in the street. Some were moving quickly and some were standing still. The little girl had never seen so many cars before. 
She asked her friend, "What are these things?". Her friend said "That is traffic. It is modern". The little girl couldn't understand what that meant, so they decided to skip away. 
But the little girl still remembered the busy traffic, and she knew that something different and modern was happening.
