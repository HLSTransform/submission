Tim and Sam were best friends. They liked to play with toys and pretend to be knights. One day, they found a big sword in the garage. It was shiny and sharp.
"Wow, look at this sword!" Tim said. "It is so cool! I want to play with it!"
"Me too!" Sam said. "Can I have a turn?"
"No, it is mine!" Tim said. He grabbed the sword and ran away. Sam was sad and angry.
Tim played with the sword for a while. He swung it in the air and made loud noises. He felt very powerful and happy. But then, he saw a big spider on the wall. He was scared of spiders. He screamed and dropped the sword.
Sam heard Tim scream. He ran to the garage and saw the spider. He was not scared of spiders. He picked up the sword and chased the spider away. He saved Tim from the spider.
"Thank you, Sam!" Tim said. He hugged Sam and felt sorry. "I am sorry I was mean to you. You are a good friend. Can you please share the sword with me?"
"Of course, Tim!" Sam said. He smiled and handed the sword to Tim. "You are a good friend too. I am grateful you said sorry. Let's play together!"
Tim and Sam learned to share and be kind. They had fun playing with the sword and pretending to be knights. They were happy and proud.
