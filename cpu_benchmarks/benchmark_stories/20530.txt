Once upon a time, there was a brown bear who lived deep in the forest. One day, he heard a loud whistle and became scared. He knew he had to protect himself. So he gathered some leaves, twigs and mud to build a home to keep himself safe from the loud whistle.
When bear was done, he climbed inside and snuggled up with leaves. A few minutes later, he heard a big, brown bird land nearby. It had a long beak, big wings, and a bright red chest. The bird was holding a whistle in its beak. Bear was still scared and wanted to protect himself.
But the bird said, "I just want to play. Would you like to join me?" Bear thought for a moment and then smiled. He got up, took the whistle from the bird and started to blow. The sound was so soft and peaceful that bear and the bird had a wonderful time playing together.
From then on, they were best friends. Whenever the bird came back to the forest, he would bring a whistle for bear to protect himself and play. Bear was so happy. They had even more fun when they played together!
