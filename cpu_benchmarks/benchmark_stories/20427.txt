Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to run and play outside. One day, he found a shiny chain on the ground. It was easy for him to pick it up and he thought it was very cool. He ran around with the chain, showing it to all of his friends. 
As Timmy was running, he accidentally tripped and the chain fell off his neck. He was very sad and didn't know what to do. But then, his friends came to help him. They all looked for the chain together and finally found it. Timmy was so happy that he hugged all of his friends. 
From then on, Timmy made sure to keep the chain safe and secure. He never ran too fast with it again, but he still loved to run and play with his friends every day.
