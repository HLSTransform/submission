Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to run and play outside in the sunshine. One day, she saw a beautiful rose in her garden. It was red and smelled so nice. 
Lily's mom came outside and saw the rose too. "That rose is so pretty," she said. "Can you pass it to me?" 
Lily picked the rose and passed it to her mom. "Thank you, Lily," her mom said. "You are so kind." 
Later that day, Lily's big brother came home from school. He was very fierce and always liked to play rough. "Hey Lily," he said. "Want to play catch?" 
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "No, I want to go see the pretty rose again." 
Her brother looked at her and smiled. "Okay, let's go see the rose together." 
And so, Lily and her brother went outside to see the rose. They passed it back and forth to each other, smelling its sweet scent and enjoying the beautiful day.
