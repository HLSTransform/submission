Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack who loved to follow his friends everywhere they went. One day, Jack saw his friends wearing charming pants that he wanted to wear too. Jack begged his mom to buy him the same pants, but she said no.
Feeling sad, Jack decided to take the pants from his friends when they weren't looking. But when Jack put on the pants, he found out they were too big for him. He tripped and fell, tearing the pants and hurting himself.
Jack learned that it's not right to take things that don't belong to him. He apologized to his friends and his mom and promised to never do it again. The moral of the story is to always ask before taking something and to be content with what you have.
