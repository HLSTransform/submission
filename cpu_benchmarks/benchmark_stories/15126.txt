"Good morning," Daddy said to his 3 year old as he woke up. He was filled with joy at the start of the day.
The two were about to go for a walk in the park. The 3 year old was curious, looking around and wondering with joy.
But then something unexpected happened! A surprise rainstorm started and the 3 year old was not able to enjoy the morning outdoors.
Daddy looked around and tried to think of something fun they could do indoors. "How about a game of hide and seek?" he said.
The 3 year old smiled and said, "Let's play!", full of jolly excitement. Daddy and the 3 year old had a great time playing and wondering where the other one was.
