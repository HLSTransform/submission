One day, a boy named Tom wanted to eat yogurt. He was very hungry. He went to the kitchen and saw a big yogurt cup. Tom was very happy. He wanted to eat it all.
Tom's sister, Lily, came into the kitchen. She saw the yogurt too. She said, "I want some yogurt too!" Tom did not want to share the yogurt. He wanted it all for himself. This made Lily sad.
Tom thought about it for a moment. He wanted to be a generous brother. So, Tom said, "Okay, we can share the yogurt." But when he tried to open the yogurt cup, it was very hard. He pulled and pulled, and then the yogurt cup broke!
Yogurt went everywhere! Tom and Lily looked at each other and started to laugh. They knew they had to clean up the mess. After cleaning, they both learned to share and be more careful with their food. And from that day, Tom and Lily always shared their snacks and became more generous with each other.
