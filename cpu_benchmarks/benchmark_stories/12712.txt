Once upon a time, there was a princess who was very dizzy. She spun around and around until she got so tired that she fell over.
The princess thought she had been spinning for a long time, but it had only been one minute. She asked the king to send someone to help her.
The king sent two strong knights to carry the princess back to her castle. It only took a minute for them to get there.
When she arrived at the castle, the princess was still feeling a bit dizzy, but happy to be home safe. She thanked the knights for their help and gave them both a hug.
The princess was no longer dizzy and she soon forgot all about her dizzy adventure. She went back to living happily at the castle.
