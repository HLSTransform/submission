Once upon a time, there was a big box. The box was in the east part of a room. The box was very special because it could fit many things inside it. One day, a little girl named Lily found the box. She was very excited to see what she could fit in the box.
Lily tried to fit her toys in the box. She put her teddy bear, her ball, and her blocks inside. They all fit perfectly! Lily was very happy. She decided to put more things in the box, like her shoes and her hat. They fit too!
One day, Lily found a lemon under the table. She thought it was a toy and put it in the box. Later, she took a bite of the lemon and it was very bitter! She made a funny face and laughed. Even though the lemon was bitter, Lily still loved her box and all the things that fit inside.
