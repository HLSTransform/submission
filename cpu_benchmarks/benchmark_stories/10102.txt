Sara and Tom are twins. They like to play together. One day, they find a big box in the garage. They decide to make an office with the box. They cut a window and a door in the box. They draw a sign that says "Sara and Tom's Office".
They take some paper and pens from their room. They also take a phone and a calculator. They pretend to work in their office. They write and draw on the paper. They talk on the phone. They press the buttons on the calculator.
"Hello, this is Sara from Sara and Tom's Office. How can I help you?" Sara says into the phone.
"Hi, this is Tom from Sara and Tom's Office. I need some water. My mouth is dry." Tom says into the phone.
"OK, I will bring you some water. Please hold on." Sara says. She puts down the phone. She goes to the kitchen. She fills a cup with water. She brings it to Tom.
"Here you go, Tom. Drink some water. It will make you feel better." Sara says. She gives Tom the cup.
"Thank you, Sara. You are very kind. You care about me." Tom says. He drinks the water.
"You are welcome, Tom. I care about you too. You are my brother." Sara says. They hug each other.
They are happy. They like their office. They like to play together.
