Once upon a time there was a dog. He was weak and couldn't do things like a strong dog. Every day he watched other dogs run and play and it made him feel sad that he couldn't do it too. 
One day the dog spotted a little boy in the park. The boy walked up to him and said, “Hello, doggy. What’s your name?”
The dog replied, “My name is Max. I wish I could play with the other dogs, but I’m so weak.” 
The boy said, “I can help you do that! Close your eyes and count to three.” 
Max followed the boy’s instructions and when he opened his eyes he discovered he could run and play with the other dogs! He was so happy that he started barking and wagging his tail. 
The boy said cheerfully, “Good job, Max! Now you can do anything you want!”
