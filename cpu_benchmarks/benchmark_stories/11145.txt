Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toys and run outside. One day, Timmy went outside to play and he saw a big sack on the ground. He wanted to see what was inside, so he opened it up. 
Suddenly, a persistent dog came running towards Timmy and bit him on the mouth. Timmy cried and ran back inside his house. His mom took him to the hospital, but the doctor couldn't fix his mouth. Timmy couldn't talk or eat anymore. 
Timmy was very sad and missed playing with his toys and running outside. He wished he never opened the sack and met the persistent dog. From that day on, Timmy learned to be careful and never open strange sacks again.
