Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to clean up her toys on the floor. Lily didn't want to because it looked like a terrible mess. But then, she remembered that she liked to organize things. 
So, Lily started to pick up her toys one by one and put them in their proper places. She put the dolls on the shelf, the blocks in the box, and the cars in the bin. It took a little while, but soon the floor was all clean and tidy. 
Lily's mommy was very proud of her for organizing her toys. And Lily felt happy because she knew where everything was. From that day on, Lily made sure to always put her toys away so the floor would stay nice and clean. The end.
