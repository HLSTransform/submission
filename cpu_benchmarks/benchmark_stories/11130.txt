Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy trumpet that he loved to play. He played it all day long. It made a loud noise, but Tim did not care. He thought it was fun.
One day, Tim's mom said, "Tim, you must resist playing the trumpet. It is making a terrible noise." Tim felt sad, but he wanted to be a good boy. So, he tried very hard not to play the trumpet. But it was not easy for him.
The next day, Tim's mom saw that he was trying to be good. She said, "Tim, I am proud of you for not playing the terrible trumpet. Let's go to the park and play with your friends." Tim was very happy. He knew that being a good boy made his mom happy too.
