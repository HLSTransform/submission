Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to listen to music on her pink radio. Every night, she would turn on the fan in her room to keep her cool while she slept.
One day, Lily's mom told her they were going to the park. Lily was so excited! She packed her favorite pink blanket and her radio. When they arrived at the park, Lily saw a big stage with lots of people. She asked her mom if they could go see what was happening.
As they got closer, Lily heard the music and saw the big fan blowing on the stage. She was so happy to be there! Suddenly, the music stopped and everyone started clapping. Lily looked up and saw her favorite singer on the stage. She listened to every word he sang and danced along with the music. It was the best day ever!
