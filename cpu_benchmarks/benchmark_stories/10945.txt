Once upon a time, there was a big box. The box had many toys inside. It also had a fake button. The button was red and shiny. A little boy named Tim found the box. He was very happy.
Tim showed the box to his friend, Sue. "Look what I found!" he said. Sue looked at the button. "What does it do?" she asked. "I don't know," said Tim. "Let's find out!"
They pressed the button. Nothing happened. They pressed it again. Still nothing. They were sad. They wanted the button to do something fun. But it was a fake button. So, it did not work.
Tim and Sue played with the other toys in the box. They had fun for a little while. But they kept thinking about the button. They wished it was real. They wished it could do something amazing.
In the end, they put the toys back in the box. They closed the lid. They walked away feeling sad. The fake button had made them feel bad. They wished they had never found the box.
