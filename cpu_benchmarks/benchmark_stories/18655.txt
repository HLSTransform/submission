Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved music so much. He would use his toy guitar to play music every day. But one day, Timmy's guitar broke. He tried to fix it but it was too hard for him. 
Timmy was sad because he couldn't play music anymore. Then, his mom came and saw him crying. She asked him what was wrong. Timmy told her about his broken guitar. His mom hugged him and said, "Don't worry, Timmy. We can buy you a new guitar so you can use it to play music again." 
Timmy was happy and hugged his mom back. They went to the store and bought a new guitar. Timmy was so excited to use it and play music again. He thanked his mom and played his new guitar all day long. From that day on, Timmy learned that when something is hard, he can always ask for help.
