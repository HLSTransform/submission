Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tim. Tim had a very pretty voice. He loved to sing all day long. One day, a big, mean cat heard Tim's voice. The cat wanted to catch Tim.
Tim was scared but he was a clever bird. He knew he needed to protect himself from the cat. Tim thought of a plan. He flew high up in the tree and hid behind some leaves. The cat could not see Tim.
The cat tried to climb the tree, but it was too hard for him. He got tired and went away. Tim was safe now. He was very happy that he could protect himself. From that day on, Tim always sang from high up in the tree, so the big, mean cat could never catch him.
