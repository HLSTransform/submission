It was a sunny day and two kids were running around the garden. They were having a lot of fun when all of a sudden they heard a loud noise coming from the ground. It was a black mineral that had cracked open. 
The two kids started to panic and tried to get away, but the mineral started to shake and started to crack even more. It was growing bigger and bigger, and was releasing a strange gas. The kids were very scared, they didn't know what to do.
But then the kids saw someone walking towards them. It was their mom, and she told them not to panic. She said that the mineral was special and harmless, and that it would soon disappear. 
The kids were still a bit scared, but when the mineral started to shrink, they felt calm again. Before long, the mineral was back to normal and the kids were happy that it was gone. They gave their mom a big hug and thanked her for calming them down. 
The kids were so relieved that the scary mineral was gone forever. From then on, they made sure to be careful around minerals so they never had to panic like that again!
