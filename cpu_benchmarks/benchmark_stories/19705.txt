Once upon a time, there was a small girl who was very lonely. She didn't have anyone to play with, so she had to play with imaginary friends. Every night she would sit and talk to them.
One night, when the girl was feeling very lonely, she saw a strange glowing light. She stepped closer and noticed it was coming from a small box. Inside the box was a single memory. It was a memory of the little girl with a special friend from long ago.
The girl thanked the memory and said goodbye. As she said goodbye, the light faded away. But, the girl still felt happy. She knew that the memory had given her comfort and company, even if only for a moment.
The girl was no longer lonely because she had something to smile about. She would always remember her special friend and the wonderful moment she had shared. From then on, she would never feel lonely again.
