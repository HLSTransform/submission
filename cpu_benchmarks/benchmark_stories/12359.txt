Once upon a time, there were two best friends called Sue and Bill. Sue and Bill were having a fun day playing together. They decided to go to the beach. When they arrived, it was very sunny and warm.
Sue said "Let's put our feet in the water". But Bill said "I'd rather relax in the sand". So, Sue and Bill lay in the sand for a while.
They soon started to get very hot, so Sue said "Let's have an ice". Bill said "Yes, that sounds good". They went to the store and bought some ices.
Once they were back in the hot sand, the ices quickly turned boring and Sue and Bill started to feel bored too. Sue said "We should go home now", but Bill said "No, let's stay".
Suddenly, the sky went black and it began to rain very heavily. Sue and Bill got very wet and cold. They had to run home and didn't get to relax in the sand. It was a bad ending to their day.
