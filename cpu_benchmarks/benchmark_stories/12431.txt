Once upon a time there were two friends named Jimmy and Lucy. They were the best of friends and always did things together. 
One day, Jimmy called Lucy and asked her to come over. He had something special to show her. 
When she arrived, he said, "I'm going to make crazy onions!" Lucy asked, "What's that?"
Jimmy explained, "I'm going to take an onion, put it on a plate, then take a knife and cut it into little pieces. Then I'm going to put the pieces back together!" 
Lucy said, "That sounds crazy!" But Jimmy said, "I know it does, but I'll support you if you want to try it. We can do it together!" 
So they both cut up the onion, put it back together and created a delicious salad! It was so yummy they had to do it again the next day. 
They couldn't believe how much fun it was! From that day on they were always there to support each other in doing crazy things.
