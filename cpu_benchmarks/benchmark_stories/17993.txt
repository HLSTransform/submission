Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden. One day, she found a shiny rock and picked it up. She showed it to her mother and said, "Look, Mommy! This rock is so pretty!" 
Her mother replied, "Yes, Lily, it's very pretty. But be careful, it's slippery. You might drop it." 
Lily didn't listen and continued to play with the rock. Suddenly, a thick mist rolled in and Lily couldn't see anything. She called out, "Mommy, where are you?" 
But her mother couldn't hear her. Lily started to panic and dropped the rock. She tried to find it, but couldn't see anything in the mist. 
When the mist cleared, Lily saw that the rock was gone. She was very sad and said, "I lost my pretty rock. I wish I had listened to Mommy and polished it inside."
