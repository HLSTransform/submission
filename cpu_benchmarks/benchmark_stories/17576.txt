Tom and Anna liked to play circus in the backyard. They had a big tent, a ball, and a whip. Tom pretended to be a famous lion tamer, and Anna pretended to be a brave lion.
"Roar!" Anna said, jumping on the ball. "I am a big and strong lion!"
"Watch out, lion!" Tom said, raising his whip. "I am the best tamer in the world!"
He cracked his whip in the air, making a loud noise. Anna pretended to be scared, and ran around the tent.
"Come back, lion!" Tom said, chasing her. "You have to do tricks for me!"
He caught up with her, and tickled her with the whip. Anna laughed, and rolled on the grass.
"OK, OK, you win!" she said. "You are a great tamer, and I am a good lion!"
They hugged, and went inside for a snack. They liked to play circus, and they liked to be friends.
