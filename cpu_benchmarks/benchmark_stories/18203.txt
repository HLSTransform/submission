Once upon a time, there was a messy horse named Dotty. Dotty liked to play in the mud all day. She would roll and jump in the puddles. Her friends, the birds, would sing and laugh as they watched her play.
One day, a little girl named Lily came to the farm. She saw Dotty and said, "Oh, what a messy horse! Can I play with her?" The farmer said, "Yes, you can play with Dotty. But first, let's give her a bath."
Lily and the farmer took Dotty to the water. They used soap and a big brush to clean her. Dotty liked the bath and soon she was clean and shiny. Lily said, "Wow, Dotty, you look so pretty now!"
Lily and Dotty played all day. They ran and jumped in the grass. The birds sang and laughed as they watched them play. As the sun went down, Lily hugged Dotty and said, "I had so much fun today. I will come back to play with you again."
From that day on, Dotty stayed clean and pretty. She would still play in the mud sometimes, but she always took a bath after. And Lily came to visit her messy horse friend, Dotty, every week. They had lots of fun together, and they were very happy.
