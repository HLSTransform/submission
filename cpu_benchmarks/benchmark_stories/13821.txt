Lisa and Tom were twins who liked to play pretend. They had a big box that they used as a restaurant. They put some plates, cups, and spoons inside the box. They also had some toy food, like pizza, cake, and juice.
One day, they decided to invite their friends over for a pretend lunch. They made a sign that said "Lisa and Tom's Restaurant" and hung it on the box. They put on some aprons and hats and waited for their customers.
Soon, their friends came and saw the sign. They were curious and excited. They knocked on the box and said, "Hello, can we eat here?"
Lisa and Tom smiled and said, "Yes, welcome to our restaurant! What would you like to order?"
Their friends looked at the toy food and said what they wanted. Lisa and Tom pretended to cook and serve the food. They said, "Here you go, enjoy your meal!"
Their friends pretended to eat and drink. They said, "This is delicious, thank you! You have a very successful restaurant!"
Lisa and Tom felt happy and proud. They believed that they were the best chefs in the world. They said, "Thank you for coming, please come again!"
They all had a lot of fun playing pretend. They learned that with a little imagination, they could make their dreams come true.
