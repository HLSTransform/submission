Sara was very sleepy. She wanted to go to bed and have a nice dream. But she had to brush her teeth first. She went to the bathroom and took her toothbrush. She put some paste on it and started to brush.
"Good girl, Sara," said Mom. "But don't forget to rinse your mouth with water."
Sara nodded and brushed some more. She liked the minty taste of the paste. She looked at the mirror and saw her white teeth. She smiled and opened the tap. She filled a cup with water and drank it.
But she drank too fast. The water was thick and bubbly. It made her cough and spit. Some of the water went on her face and hair. She felt wet and sticky.
"Oops, Sara," said Mom. "You forgot to spit out the paste before you drank the water. It's okay, don't worry. Let me help you dry off."
Mom took a towel and wiped Sara's face and hair. She gave her a hug and a kiss. "Now you're ready for bed, sweetie. Let's go to your room and read a story."
Sara nodded and followed Mom. She felt better. She hoped she would have a nice dream. Maybe she would dream of a big rainbow or a cute puppy. She climbed into her bed and snuggled with her teddy bear. Mom read her a story and tucked her in.
"Good night, Sara," said Mom. "I love you."
"Good night, Mom," said Sara. "I love you too. And I won't forget to spit out the paste next time."
She closed her eyes and fell asleep. She had a nice dream.
