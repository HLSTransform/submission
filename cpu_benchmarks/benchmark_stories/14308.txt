Once upon a time, there was a cute little girl named Mia. She was very adorable and loved to laugh and giggle. One day, she decided to make some celery for a snack. Mia carefully plucked the stalks of celery from their home in the garden. She was having such a good time that she started to laugh as she popped them into her basket.
When she got back to the house, she quickly got to work making her snack. She get all the celery chopped up and added some yummy sauce to it. She was very excited and couldn't wait to try it.
However, the celery was not very tasty. In fact, it tasted really bad! Mia made a very yucky face and started to cry. No matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't make it taste any better. She wanted to laugh and enjoy her snack, but she couldn't help feeling so sad.
Mia eventually decided to give up and threw away all of the celery. She was so disappointed that she didn't want to laugh anymore. Poor Mia, her bad ending did not turn out like she had hoped.
