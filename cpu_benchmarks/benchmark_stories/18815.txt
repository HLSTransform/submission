Anna and Ben are playing in their room. They have many toys and books, but they are bored. They want to do something new and fun.
"Look, Ben!" Anna says. "The window has a curtain. We can play with it!"
She runs to the window and pulls the curtain. It is blue and soft. She wraps it around her like a dress. She feels like a princess.
"Wow, Anna, you are pretty!" Ben says. He wants to play too. He grabs the other end of the curtain and pulls it. He makes a cape and pretends to be a superhero.
They laugh and run around the room. They are having fun.
But they do not notice that the curtain is coming off the rod. It is hanging by a thread. They pull harder and harder.
Snap!
The curtain falls to the floor. The window is bare. The sun is bright.
"Oh no!" Anna and Ben say. They are scared. They know they did something bad.
They hear footsteps. It is their mom. She comes into the room. She sees the curtain on the floor. She sees the window without the curtain. She sees Anna and Ben with guilty faces.
She is angry.
"Anna! Ben! What did you do?" she says. "You broke the curtain! You made a mess! You are in trouble!"
Anna and Ben feel sorry. They do not want to make their mom angry. They do not want to be in trouble.
They hug each other. They look at their mom with big eyes.
"We are sorry, mom," they say. "We were just playing. We did not mean to break the curtain. We love you, mom."
Their mom sighs. She is still angry, but she loves them too. She picks up the curtain. She hugs them back.
"I love you too, Anna and Ben," she says. "But you have to be careful. You have to respect the things in the house. You have to listen to me. Do you understand?"
Anna and Ben nod. They understand. They promise to be good.
Their mom smiles. She is not angry anymore. She is glad they are sorry. She is proud they are her children.
She takes them to the kitchen. She gives them cookies and milk. She tells them a story. They are happy.
