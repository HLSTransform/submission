Once upon a time there was a boy. He was walking in the park with his mum. It was a very wet day and the ground was full of puddles. The boy saw a board and he couldn't resist the temptation to jump on it. It was so much fun splashing the water around. His mum saw him and smiled.
After a while the boy said it was time to leave. He said goodbye to the board and ran back to his mum. She was holding a big, green umbrella so he was not very wet at all. They both smiled and went home.
The end.
