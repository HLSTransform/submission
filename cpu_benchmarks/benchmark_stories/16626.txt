Lily was a big sister. She had a baby brother named Max. Max was very small and fragile. He cried a lot and needed Mom and Dad to feed him and change him and cuddle him.
Lily felt angry and sad. She wanted Mom and Dad to play with her and read her stories and give her hugs. She felt like they did not love her anymore. They only loved Max.
One day, Mom and Dad asked Lily to help them with Max. They said, "Lily, you are a big sister. You can help us take care of Max. He loves you very much. Can you give him a toy and talk to him?"
Lily did not want to help. She wanted to ignore Max. She said, "No, I don't want to. Max is boring and noisy. I don't love him. Go away!"
Mom and Dad looked sad. They said, "Lily, that is not nice. Max is your brother. He needs you to be kind and gentle. You can have fun with him. He likes to listen to your voice and see your smile. Please, don't ignore him."
Lily felt a little sorry. She saw Max in his crib. He was looking at her with big eyes. He made a small sound. He reached out his hand. Lily walked over to him. She gave him a toy. She said, "Hi, Max. I'm Lily. I'm your big sister. Do you want to play with me?"
Max smiled. He grabbed the toy. He made a happy sound. Lily smiled too. She said, "You are cute, Max. I love you. I'm sorry I ignored you. Can I give you a hug?"
Mom and Dad smiled too. They said, "That's wonderful, Lily. You are a good big sister. We love you and Max very much. You can both play with us and read stories and get hugs. We are a family."
