Once upon a time, a small boy named Jimmy wanted to lift the big mill that was near his house. His parents had always warned him not to play near the mill andJimmy knew he shouldn't lift it, but he was curious and wanted to try.
He grabbed the mill and tried to lift it,but it was too heavy for him. He tried a few times, but nothing happened. He was getting frustrated, feeling like he couldn't do it.
He heard his mom's voice from afar calling him, "Jimmy! Where are you?!" Panic started to rise, so he quickly let go of the mill and tried to run to his house. But he was so embarrassed that he wanted to hide!
Unfortunately, Jimmy's mom had seen him and yelled "Jimmy, what have you done!? You know you shouldn't touch the mill!" She was really angry, and Jimmy was so ashamed. She scolded him and told him to never go near the mill again. 
Jimmy learned his lesson and was very sorry. He promised he would never touch the mill again, and his mom was pretty glad that he had learned his lesson. 
The end.
