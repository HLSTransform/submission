Grandma was glad to see the little girl. She lay down on the floor, patting her stomach.
The little girl laughed and lay down next to her. They stayed like that for a long time, playing and giggling.
Suddenly, Grandma said, "Let's go for a walk!" They jumped up and ran outside into the sunshine.
Grandma and the little girl laughed and skipped down the path. They lay down in the soft grass and admired the birds singing in the sky.
Grandma was glad they had taken a walk. She hugged the little girl tightly and they ran inside, ready to play some more.
