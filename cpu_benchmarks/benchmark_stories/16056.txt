Once upon a time, there were two very good friends, a dog and a cat. The dog was furry and the cat was furry too. They liked to play together.
One day the dog said to the cat: "Let's do a trade!"
The cat was very excited and said: "Let's do it!"
The dog said: "We can give each other something nice."
The cat was so thrilled and said: "Let me go first!"
The cat gave the dog a big, furry hug and said: "This is my trade to you."
The dog was so happy and said: "I love it! Here's my trade to you." He gave the cat a big bowl of yummy food.
The cat smiled and said: "Thanks, my friend. That's very kind of you."
The dog and the cat hugged each other and said: "Friends forever!"
