One day, Billy and Sally went to the park to play. They brought a cooler with snacks and drinks. Billy was thirsty and asked Sally for a drink. Sally said no and Billy got upset. 
Billy wanted to play a game but Sally didn't want to. She said, "I want to draw pictures and be creative." Billy didn't like that idea and said, "No, I want to play!" 
Sally had an idea. She said, "Let's play a game where we mark the trees with our drawings!" Billy thought that was a good idea and they started to draw on the trees. They had so much fun and forgot about their argument. In the end, they shared the snacks and drinks from the cooler and went home happy.
