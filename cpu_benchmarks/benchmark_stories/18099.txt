Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat oatmeal for breakfast every day. One morning, her mom made her oatmeal but forgot to put any sugar in it. Lily didn't like it, but she didn't want to hurt her mom's feelings, so she didn't say anything.
Later that day, Lily's friend Emma came over to play. Emma brought some cookies for them to share. Lily thought it was very thoughtful of Emma to bring cookies. They started to eat the cookies, and Lily noticed that they were very sweet. She told Emma that her oatmeal wasn't sweet this morning. Emma dared Lily to tell her mom that she wanted sugar in her oatmeal tomorrow.
The next morning, Lily told her mom that she wanted sugar in her oatmeal. Her mom was happy that Lily told her what she wanted. From then on, Lily always spoke up when she wanted something. She learned that it's important to be honest and that it's okay to ask for what you want.
