Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy chest that was big and purple. One day, she put her favorite toy inside the chest and closed the lid. Suddenly, she saw the chest shrink! It became very small, like a tiny box. 
Lily was surprised and opened the lid. To her amazement, her toy was still inside, but it had also shrunk! It was now very small, like a little bug. She carefully picked up her toy and held it in her hand. 
Lily was happy to have her toy, but she didn't like that it was so small. She decided to put it back in the chest and see if it would grow back to its normal size. She closed the lid and waited. After a few moments, she opened the lid again and her toy had grown back to its normal size! Lily was very happy and played with her toy all day long.
