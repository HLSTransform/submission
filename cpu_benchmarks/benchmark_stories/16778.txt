Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big rock that looks like a leopard. They run to the rock and touch it.
"Wow, this is a cool rock!" Ben says. "It has spots and a tail and ears!"
"Can we play with it?" Anna asks. "Can we pretend it is a real leopard?"
Ben nods. "Yes, we can. But we have to be careful. Leopards are fast and strong and can bite."
They climb on the rock and pretend to ride the leopard. They make roaring sounds and laugh.
A man walks by and sees them. He smiles and says, "Hello, children. What are you doing?"
"We are playing with our leopard," Anna says. "He is our friend and he takes us to the jungle."
The man nods. "That sounds like fun. But do you know what this rock is?"
Ben and Anna shake their heads.
"This rock is very important," the man says. "It is very old and it has a story. It was made by people long ago, to honor the leopard spirit. They believed the leopard spirit protected them and gave them courage."
Ben and Anna look at the rock with wonder. They feel the spots and the tail and the ears.
"Wow, this is a special rock," Ben says.
"Yes, it is," the man says. "And you are special too, for playing with it. But remember, always respect the leopard spirit and the rock. They are part of our history and our culture."
Ben and Anna nod. They thank the man and say goodbye. They keep playing with the rock, but they also say thank you to the leopard spirit. They feel happy and brave.
