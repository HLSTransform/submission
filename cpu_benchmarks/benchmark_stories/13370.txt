Once upon a time, there was a king who had a shiny crown. He loved his crown very much, but he was worried someone might take it. So, he hid it in a secret place. One day, a clever thief came and tried to find the crown. He looked everywhere, but he couldn't find it. Then, he saw a twisty tree and thought the crown might be hidden there. And he was right! The king was very happy when he found out the thief didn't get his crown.
