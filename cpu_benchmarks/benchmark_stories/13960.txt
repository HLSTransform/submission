Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack. Jack was very rich. He had lots of money and many things to play with. One day, Jack went to the store to buy a new tap for his sink. When he got home, he realized that he had bought the wrong tap. So, he had to return it to the store. 
Jack went back to the store and gave the tap back to the man who worked there. The man gave Jack his money back and Jack felt happy again. He went home and put the new tap on his sink. Now, he could wash his hands and brush his teeth with ease. The end.
