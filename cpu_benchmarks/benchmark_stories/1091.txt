One day, a large cat was walking outside. The cat was looking for something to catch. Suddenly, the cat noticed a watch. It was shiny and sparkled in the sun. The cat wanted to catch the watch so it could have something special.
The cat ran as fast as it could and managed to catch the watch. The cat was so proud of itself. It decided to take it home as a surprise for its owner.
The cat showed its owner the large watch. The owner was so happy that the cat had managed to catch it. They gave the cat lots of cuddles and praised it for being so clever.
The cat and its owner enjoyed playing with the watch together. And after that, the cat was always proud when it was out looking for things to catch.
