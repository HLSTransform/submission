Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with her pastel crayons. She had so many colors, but her favorite was pink.
One day, Lily's little brother came and grabbed her favorite pink pastel. Lily got so angry that she started to scream. She wanted her pastel back, but her brother wouldn't give it to her.
Lily's mom came in and saw what was happening. She told Lily that it wasn't nice to scream and have a fit. She said that she should share her pastels with her brother and they could draw together.
Lily realized that her mom was right. She gave her brother the pink pastel and they drew a beautiful picture together. Lily learned that sharing is important and it's better to be kind than to scream and have a fit.
