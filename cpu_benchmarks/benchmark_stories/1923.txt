Once upon a time, there were two friends, a banana and an apple. They were very different. The banana was yellow and soft, and the apple was red and crunchy.
The two friends wanted to unite and be different at the same time. So they decided to put on colorful clothes. The banana put on a green shirt and a blue hat and the apple put on a yellow shirt and a purple hat.
When they both had on their colorful clothes, they looked very nice together. Everyone in the park noticed and smiled.
The banana and the apple decided to take a walk and found more colorful friends. They all united together and made the park full of color!
The banana and apple went back to the park every day and made more colorful friends. They all blessed the park with their joy and united to make it even more beautiful.
