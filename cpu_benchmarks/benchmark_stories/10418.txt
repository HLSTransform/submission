Once upon a time there was a man who had an axe that he loved. He kept the axe hidden and would never let anyone touch it.
One day, he brought the axe out to chop some wood. The man left it outside and went back into his home for a cup of tea. But when he returned, the axe had disappeared!
The man asked, “Where has my axe gone?” but everyone had no answer. He looked around but the axe was nowhere to be seen.
The man became worried. He asked everyone he saw if they had seen his axe, but the answer was always the same: no one knew where the axe had gone.
The man searched and searched, but the axe was nowhere to be found. He was starting to think that his axe had disappeared forever, until he heard a sound coming from near the trees. 
The man followed the sound until he came to a clearing. In the clearing, he saw a young girl playing with his axe.
The man smiled. He had found his axe! But he knew he needed to hide it again to make sure it wouldn’t disappear again. He showed the girl how to put the axe away and thanked her for finding it.
