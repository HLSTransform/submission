Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit named Rosie. Rosie lived in an open field with her family. They liked to hop and play all day long.
One day, Rosie's mom said, "Rosie, we need to find more food. Our family is getting bigger, so we need to increase the food we have." Rosie nodded and hopped away to look for food.
Rosie hopped through the open field and found some yummy carrots. She saw a big pile of carrots and said, "Wow, this will increase our food a lot!" Rosie picked up as many carrots as she could carry and hopped back to her family.
When Rosie got back, her family was so happy to see all the carrots. Rosie's mom said, "Great job, Rosie! Our food has increased, and now we have enough to eat!" They all enjoyed a big carrot feast together.
From that day on, Rosie and her family always made sure they had enough food to eat. They lived happily in their open field, hopping and playing together.
