Once upon a time, there were three friends: a bee, a bat and a bug. One day, they decided to have a picnic in the park. So the bug gathered a large blanket and the bee brought some jam. 
The friends spread the blanket on the grass and then the bee started to spread the jam on some crackers. But then something happened: the bug heard a noise in the bushes! It was coming from a large bear. 
The friends were scared but the bear had a kind face. It said, "I love jam too! Can I join the picnic?" Everyone was so happy and the bee gave the bear some crackers with jam.
The friends and the bear talked and laughed until the sun went down. When the picnic was over, they all gave the bear a big hug and said goodbye. It was a wonderful day and they all promised to meet again soon.
