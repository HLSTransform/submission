Once upon a time there was a baby named Joe. He was only three years old and he was very curious. One day Joe was playing in his room when his mum came in and gave him a bottle. Joe was very happy and hugged his mum. His mum said “Joe, be a good boy and behave for mummy. I’m going to make dinner and need you to stay in your room.”
So Joe played with his bottle gently. He made sure to be very quiet and listen to his mum. He was good and stayed in his room until his mum came back to check on him.
When she came back she was very pleased. “Good boy, Joe! You were so gentle and behaved. You get to stay in your room and play with your bottle.” Joe smiled and hugged his mum.
Joe was very happy he had behaved. Now he could keep playing with his bottle and be a good boy. He was so proud of himself. And everyone was happy with him.
