Tommy was very excited. His mommy said he was going to go on a boat! He hopped into the car and his mommy drove very fast. They soon arrived and Tommy couldn't believe how big the boat was! He hopped out of the car and ran onto the boat. Mommy said it was a special boat because it was going to take them across the lake.
Tommy was so excited he couldn't contain himself! He ran up and down the boat and looked at all the fun features. There were buttons, switches, and bright lights!
Finally, the boat started to move. Tommy quickly realized it was going faster than he thought it would. He loved feeling the wind blow in his hair as the boat glided across the lake. It was his first time on a boat and he was so happy! 
After a fun filled day, Tommy said goodbye to the boat and hopped back in the car with his mommy. He was happy that he got to ride on the fast boat, and he didn't want the day to end!
