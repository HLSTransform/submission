One day, a cute little helicopter was flying high in the sky. It loved to see the trees and houses below. The helicopter had a best friend, a big red truck. They played together every day.
One morning, the helicopter and the truck were playing near the park. They were having so much fun. Then, a big wind came and blew the helicopter far away. The truck called out, "Come back, helicopter! I don't want to separate from you!"
The helicopter tried to fly back, but the wind was too strong. It said, "I will try, truck! I don't want to separate from you too!" The helicopter tried very hard and finally, it flew back to the truck.
The truck was so happy to see the helicopter again. They hugged and played together for the rest of the day. They promised to never separate and to always be best friends.
