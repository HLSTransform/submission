Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a shiny metal object in the grass. She didn't know what it was, so she asked her mommy.
"Mommy, what is this shiny thing?" asked Lily.
"I don't know, Lily. It's an unknown metal," replied her mommy.
Lily was curious and wanted to know more. "Can we find out what it is?" she asked.
"Sure, let's ask Daddy. He knows a lot about metals," said her mommy.
Daddy came over and looked at the shiny object. "This is a special metal called aluminum. It's a number 13 on the periodic table," he explained.
Lily was amazed and happy to learn about the unknown metal. She decided to keep it as a treasure and show it to all her friends. From that day on, she loved to learn about new things and share her knowledge with others.
