Tom and Lily wanted to play in the yard, but there was a big dog next to the fence. The dog was fierce and barked loud. It had sharp teeth and a long tail. Tom and Lily were scared of the dog and did not want to go near it.
"Let's go to the other side of the yard, where the swing is," Tom said to Lily. "Maybe the dog will not see us there."
"OK, but we have to be quiet and fast," Lily said. They held hands and ran across the yard, hoping the dog would not notice them.
But the dog did notice them. It saw them running and started to chase them. It jumped over the fence and ran after them. Tom and Lily screamed and ran faster, but the dog was faster too.
"Help, help!" they shouted. "The dog is coming!"
Their mom heard them and came out of the house. She saw the dog and grabbed a broom. She waved the broom at the dog and shouted, "Go away, bad dog! Leave my kids alone!"
The dog was afraid of the mom and the broom. It stopped chasing Tom and Lily and ran back to the fence. It jumped over the fence and ran away.
Tom and Lily ran to their mom and hugged her. They were safe and happy.
"Thank you, mom, you saved us!" they said.
"You're welcome, my loves," mom said. "I'm glad you're OK. That was a very fierce dog. How did you manage to run so fast?"
"We were very brave, mom," Tom said.
"And we had each other, mom," Lily said.
Mom smiled and kissed them. "You are very brave and very smart, my loves. I'm proud of you. Now, let's go inside and have some cookies. How does that sound?"
"Yay, cookies!" Tom and Lily said. They followed mom inside, leaving the yard and the dog behind.
