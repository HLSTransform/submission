Little Jack was a very spoiled three year old. Everywhere he went, his mom and dad gave him everything he asked for. He had lots of toys, books, and games. 
One day, Jack was in his room playing with his toys. He saw his dad walk down the hall whistling a happy tune. Jack thought it was the most beautiful sound he had ever heard. He begged his dad to whistle for him too.
His dad smiled and said, "I'll be glad to share a special song with you, but first you need to do something for me."
Jack nodded and asked, "What should I do?" 
His dad said, "When you want something special, don't always expect someone else to do it for you. Use your own strength and determination to earn it yourself. Now I'll whistle you a song."
Jack was so happy he worked hard to learn how to whistle. Even though it took a bit of practice, Jack eventually managed to whistle the same tune his dad had showed him. Jack felt so proud of himself!
The moral of the story is that you don't get something for nothing. It takes hard work and dedication to get something special.
