Once upon a time there was an ancient image. It was so old nobody knew what it was for. Every day different people would come and look at it, but no one could make sense of it. 
One day, a little girl called Lily walked up to the ancient image. Instead of looking at it, she took out a big pen and paper. She began to write around the image with her big pen. 
The more she wrote, the more of the ancient image she revealed. Soon an entire picture of a beautiful castle was revealed. Lily smiled with excitement. 
Everyone gathered around and cheered for Lily. They were so impressed that she had solved the mystery of the ancient image. From then on, the people all around always knew Lily as the one who could write!
