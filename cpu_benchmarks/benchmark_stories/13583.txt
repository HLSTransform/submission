Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her dolls. Her favorite doll was a dependable one that she always carried with her.
One day, Lily's friend Tommy came over to play. They decided to play hide-and-seek. Lily peeked behind the curtains and saw Tommy hiding under the table. She giggled and said, "I see you, Tommy!"
Tommy came out from under the table and saw Lily's dependable doll. "That's a pretty doll," he said. "Can I play with her too?"
Lily smiled and handed the doll to Tommy. "Sure, you can play with her. She's my favorite but I trust you to take good care of her," she said.
Tommy played with the doll and promised to be very dependable with her. Lily was happy to share her favorite doll with her friend. They played together all day, peeking and giggling, and having lots of fun.
