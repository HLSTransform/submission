Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play with her toys, but sometimes she would get angry if they didn't do what she wanted. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help carry a tray of cookies to the table. Lily was excited to help, but she had to balance the tray carefully so the cookies didn't fall off. 
As Lily walked to the table, she saw her cat playing with a ball of yarn. She got angry because she thought the cat might knock over the tray. But then she remembered to balance the tray and walked carefully around the cat. When she finally made it to the table, her mom gave her a big hug and said, "Good job, Lily! You balanced the tray perfectly." 
Lily felt so proud of herself and smiled. She realized that sometimes things might make her angry, but if she stays calm and balances them carefully, everything will turn out okay. From that day on, Lily always tried to balance things in her life, just like she did with the tray of cookies.
