Alice had a task to do. She wanted to try it, but John didn't agree. He said it was too dizzy for her. Alice wanted to do it though, and would not disagree.
So Alice and John had a long talk. They tried to find a way for Alice to do the task. In the end, they decided that Alice would try the task with John's help. They both smiled and hugged.
Alice tried the task, and found out that it wasn't too dizzy after all. She was happy and proud of herself.
John was happy too, and before they parted John said, "Sometimes it's good to disagree!"
