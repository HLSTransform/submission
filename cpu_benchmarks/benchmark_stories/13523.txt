Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play pretend with her toys. One day, she pretended to be a princess in a castle made of blocks. She built a triangle-shaped tower and pretended to be trapped inside.
Suddenly, a big, strong dragon came and tried to break the tower. But Lily was weak and couldn't stop the dragon. She tried to run away, but the dragon caught her and took her away.
Lily's mom came to play with her toys later that day and found the broken tower and Lily's favorite toy missing. She knew something was wrong and called the police. They searched for Lily and found her in the park, scared and alone.
The bad dragon was caught and Lily was safe, but she never played pretend with that triangle tower again. She knew it was too dangerous.
