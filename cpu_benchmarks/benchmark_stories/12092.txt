Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had long blonde hair that shone in the sun. One day, Lily was playing with her toys when her mom came in and said, "Lily, it's time for dinner."
Lily said, "But Mom, I'm not hungry. I want to keep playing."
Her mom replied, "You need to eat, or else you'll become weak and your hair won't glow anymore."
Lily didn't understand what her mom meant by "weak" and "glow," but she knew that she didn't want her hair to stop shining. So, she reluctantly went to the kitchen to eat her dinner. As she ate, she realized that she was actually very hungry and that the food tasted delicious. 
From that day on, Lily knew that she needed to eat her meals so that she could stay healthy and keep her hair glowing. The moral of the story is that it's important to take care of your body so that you can be strong and healthy.
