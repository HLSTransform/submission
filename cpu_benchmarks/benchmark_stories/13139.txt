Sam and Mom went to the cave. It was dark and fun! Inside the cave, they saw lots of yummy treats. Mom shared a tasty cookie with Sam.
It didn't seem like there was much else to do in the cave, so they took a look around. All of a sudden, a big bear appeared! Sam was scared at first, but then saw that the bear was holding a honey jar. He was so happy!
The bear smiled and offered to share the honey with Sam and Mom. They said yes, and enjoyed the sweet treat together. Then the happy bear went back the way he came, and Sam and Mom left the cave. They had a great time!
