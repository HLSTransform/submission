Little John was getting ready for bed. His mom was helping him out of his clothes so he could get into his pajamas. She told him, "It's time to take a shower. Are you ready to use it?"
Little John was so excited. He ran to the bathroom and opened the door to the shower. He was getting ready to use it when he noticed something. His dad came in and said, "There's a problem with the shower."
The shower had a deaf person inside it who couldn't hear it when it was switched on. Little John's dad asked him to be careful, so he went carefully and switched off the shower.
He then opened the door and saw an old man with a white beard and glasses. The old man smiled very sweetly at Little John. He said, "Thank you for being so kind and turning off the shower for me. I'm deaf and didn't realise the water was on."
Little John was so happy he had been able to help the deaf man. He hugged the old man and said goodbye before getting into the shower and washing himself.
When Little John finished his shower, he thanked the old man for helping and ran out to tell his mom and dad what had happened. He had a big smile on his face as he told them the story.
