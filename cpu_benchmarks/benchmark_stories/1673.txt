Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweet. Tweet liked to fly high in the sky and sing songs. One day, Tweet met a little girl named Lily. Lily said, "Hi Tweet! Do you want to be my friend?" Tweet said, "Yes, I want to be your friend!"
Lily and Tweet played together every day. They played hide-and-seek, tag, and flew around together. One day, Tweet said, "Lily, I'm scared of the dark. Can you stay with me tonight?" Lily said, "Yes, I will stay with you. You are my friend and I will always be there for you."
That night, Lily and Tweet slept under the stars. Tweet said, "Lily, you are my true friend. Thank you for being with me." Lily said, "You're welcome, Tweet. I will always be here for you." And they both fell asleep, dreaming of flying high in the sky together.
