Tom and Mia are playing with their toys in the living room. They have a lot of fun making noises and pretending to be animals. Tom has a blue car and Mia has a pink doll.
"Vroom, vroom, my car is fast and strong!" Tom says.
"Hi, hi, my doll is pretty and kind!" Mia says.
They zoom and hug their toys around the floor.
But then, Mom comes in and says, "Kids, I need you to pause your game for a minute. I have a meeting on the phone and I need you to be quiet. Can you do that for me?"
Tom and Mia nod and say, "Okay, Mom."
Mom goes to the kitchen and picks up the phone. She talks to someone with a serious voice.
Tom and Mia try to be quiet, but they get bored. They look at each other and whisper.
"Can we play again?" Tom asks.
"I don't know. Mom said to pause," Mia says.
"But I want to play. It's no fun to pause," Tom says.
He picks up his blue car and makes a loud vroom sound.
"Tom, shh! Mom will hear you!" Mia says.
She grabs his car and tries to take it away.
"Hey, that's mine! Give it back!" Tom says.
He pulls his car and pushes Mia.
"Ow, you hurt me!" Mia says.
She cries and hits Tom.
"Stop it, you two!" Mom says.
She comes back from the kitchen and sees Tom and Mia fighting over the blue car.
She is angry and sad.
"What are you doing? I asked you to be quiet for a minute. Why can't you listen to me?" Mom says.
Tom and Mia feel sorry and ashamed.
They drop the blue car and hug Mom.
"We're sorry, Mom. We wanted to play and we forgot to pause," Tom says.
"We love you, Mom. We didn't mean to make you mad," Mia says.
Mom sighs and smiles.
She hugs them back and says, "I love you, too, kids. I know you like to play, but sometimes you have to pause and be respectful. Can you do that for me?"
Tom and Mia nod and say, "Yes, Mom."
Mom says, "Thank you. Now, why don't you share your toys and play nicely? I'll be done with my meeting soon."
Tom and Mia say, "Okay, Mom."
They pick up their toys and play together.
They share the blue car and the pink doll.
They make noises and pretend to be animals.
But this time, they pause when Mom needs them to.
