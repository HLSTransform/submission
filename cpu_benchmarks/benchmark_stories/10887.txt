Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweet. Tweet loved to fly high in the sky and soar like a superhero. One day, Tweet flew over a big pile of waste and felt sad. "This is not pretty," Tweet said. "We need to be creative and find a way to clean up this mess."
Tweet went to all the other birds and asked for their help. "Let's work together and make this place beautiful again," Tweet said. All the birds agreed and they started to pick up the waste and put it in a big bin. They used their creative minds to make the bin look pretty with flowers and ribbons.
After they were done, Tweet looked up at the sky and soared higher than ever before. "Look at what we can do when we work together and use our creativity," Tweet said. All the birds cheered and flew alongside Tweet, feeling happy and proud of what they had accomplished.
