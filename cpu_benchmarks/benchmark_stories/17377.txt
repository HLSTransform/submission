Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play together. They have a big toy mountain. They put cars and animals on the mountain.
One day, Sara and Tom have a fight. Sara wants the red car. Tom wants the red car too. They pull the car. The car breaks. Sara and Tom are sad and angry. They separate the mountain. Sara takes one half. Tom takes the other half. They do not talk to each other.
Mama sees Sara and Tom. She asks them what is wrong. Sara and Tom tell her about the car and the mountain. Mama says, "I am sorry the car broke. But you can still share the mountain. The mountain is big enough for both of you. You can have fun together. You are nice friends."
Sara and Tom think about what Mama says. They feel sorry for the fight. They miss each other. They say sorry to each other. They hug. They put the mountain together again. They play with the cars and the animals. They are happy. Mama smiles. She is proud of Sara and Tom.
