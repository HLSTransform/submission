Once upon a time, there was a beautiful lion. He roared so loudly that everyone knew he was the king of the jungle. One day, the lion wanted to go on a special journey. He asked his friends to help him. So, they sent him away with lots of love and happy wishes.
The lion traveled far and wide. He saw many amazing things and met lots of new friends. After a while, the lion was starting to miss home. He was happy that his friends sent him on such a wonderful adventure but he just wanted to be back with his family and friends.
So, the lion took a deep breath and traveled back home. When he finally arrived, he saw that all his friends were waiting for him. They were so excited to see him! He was welcomed back with hugs and smiles. Everyone enjoyed the lionâ€™s beautiful stories from his journey. He was glad that his friends sent him away to have such an amazing adventure.
