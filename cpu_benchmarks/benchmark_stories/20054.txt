Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to walk outside and look at the big pictures on the tall signs called billboards. One day, she saw a billboard with a picture of a lost puppy. Lily wanted to help find the puppy, so she asked her mom for help.
Together, they searched all around the neighborhood for the puppy. They asked people if they had seen it and put up signs with the puppy's picture. After a while, they finally found the puppy hiding behind a bush. Lily was so happy that they were able to solve the problem and find the puppy.
Lily's mom was proud of her for being so helpful and modest about her good deed. From that day on, Lily always looked for ways to help others and solve problems in her community.
