Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore. One day, he went on a hike with his family. They climbed up a big mountain. Timmy was so happy and excited to see everything from up high.
As they walked, Timmy noticed something strange. He saw a little bird that looked upset. It was sitting on a tree branch all alone. Timmy wanted to help the bird, so he observed it for a while. He saw that the bird's wing was hurt. It couldn't fly anymore.
Timmy felt sad for the bird. He knew he had to do something to help. So, he told his family about the bird and they called a wildlife rescue team. The team came and took care of the bird. Timmy was happy that he could help the upset bird. He felt proud of himself for observing and noticing when something was wrong.
