Sam and Ben are brothers. They like to play with their toy soldiers and cars. They make a lot of noise and mess in their room. Sometimes they fight and yell at each other. Mom and Dad are not happy with them.
One day, Mom and Dad say they have to go to work. They tell Sam and Ben to be good and listen to Grandma. Grandma comes to watch them. She is old and kind, but she does not like noise and mess. She tells Sam and Ben to play quietly and clean their room. She also tells them to bathe before lunch.
Sam and Ben do not want to bathe. They want to play more. They say they are not dirty. They ignore Grandma and keep playing. They make more noise and mess. They pretend they are in a war with their toy soldiers and cars. They throw pillows and blankets at each other. They knock over lamps and books. They break a vase and a picture.
Grandma hears the noise and mess. She is angry. She comes to their room and sees the war. She scolds Sam and Ben. She tells them they are naughty and rude. She tells them to stop playing and bathe right now. She tells them they have to pay for the things they broke. She tells them they will have no dessert and no TV.
Sam and Ben are scared and sad. They wish they had listened to Grandma. They wish they had not played war. They wish they had bathed. They say they are sorry. They go to bathe. They hope Grandma will forgive them. They hope Mom and Dad will not be mad at them. They hope they can still have some dessert and TV. They learn their lesson. They decide to play nicely and clean their room. They decide to bathe every day. They decide to love Grandma and each other. They do not want to make war anymore. They want to make peace.
