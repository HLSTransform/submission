Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the big, open field near his house. One day, Timmy's mommy took him on a walk to see the pretty landscape. Timmy saw lots of trees, flowers, and birds. He felt safe because his mommy was with him. 
Suddenly, Timmy saw a kite flying in the sky. He wanted to play with it! His mommy helped him attach the string to the kite and they flew it together. Timmy felt so happy and excited. He loved spending time with his mommy and playing outside in the beautiful landscape.
