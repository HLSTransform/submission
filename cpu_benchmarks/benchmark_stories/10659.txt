Once upon a time there was a war. It was a very big war and very noisy too. The people in the war were very unhappy. They felt dizzy in the heat of the day.
One day, some people had a bright idea. They decided to make it rain. They opened a giant door in the sky and the rain came pouring down. Everyone was relieved by the coolness of the rain.
The rain stopped after a while and the sun came out again. Little droplets of water were everywhere and everything was wet. The people rushed to dry off with towels and clothes. Everyone was so busy getting dry they forgot all about the war. 
At night, under the sparkly stars, the people were happy. They were cool, dry, and safe. They held hands and smiled to each other. They were thankful to be so dizzy with happiness. 
The war was over and the people never had to worry about it again.
