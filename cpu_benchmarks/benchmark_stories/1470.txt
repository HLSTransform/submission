One day, there was a powerful cabinet in a room. Nothing could disturb it. But then a little three-year-old girl came along. She wanted to see what was inside the cabinet. She tugged and pulled but the cabinet was too powerful for her to open. 
The girl grabbed a nearby chair and used it to climb up to the top of the cabinet. Then she stretched her arm out and pulled the cabinet door open. Inside the cabinet, the girl found lots of interesting things!
The girl was so excited that she began jumping around the room. The powerful cabinet shook and wiggled and finally, it crashed to the ground! The girl jumped in surprise and ran out of the room.
From then on, the girl never disturbed the powerful cabinet again!
