Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Benny. Benny loved to explore the forest and he was always curious about everything he saw. One day, Benny saw a big log in the middle of his path. He wanted to climb over it, but he was too small.
Benny started to worry that he wouldn't be able to continue his adventure. Just then, he saw a rabbit hopping by. Benny asked the rabbit for help and the rabbit agreed to push the log out of the way.
But as they were moving the log, they heard a loud growl. It was a big, scary bear! Benny and the rabbit were scared, but they didn't give up. They worked together to push the log faster and faster until they were safe on the other side.
Benny was so happy that he had a new friend in the rabbit and that they worked together to solve their problem. From then on, Benny knew that no matter what worries he may face, he could always find a way to overcome them with a little help from his friends.
