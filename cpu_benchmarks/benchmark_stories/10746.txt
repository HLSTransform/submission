Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. She loved to eat and play. One day, she saw a huge tree in the park. She thought it was a special tree. Sue told her mom and dad about the tree. They said they would go see it later.
At home, Sue asked her mom, "Can we eat at the tree?" Her mom said, "Yes, we can have a picnic there." Sue was very happy. Her mom made a menu for the picnic. There were apples, sandwiches, and cookies on the menu.
The next day, they went to the park with the food. They saw the huge tree and put a blanket under it. Sue and her family had a fun picnic. They ate all the food from the menu. Sue knew the tree was special because it was where they had a great day together.
