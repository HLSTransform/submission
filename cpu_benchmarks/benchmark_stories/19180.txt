Once upon a time, there was a big dinosaur. He liked to walk in the forest. The dinosaur was green and very tall.
One day, the dinosaur was naughty. He walked too far and got lost. He was sad and scared. He wanted to go back home.
The dinosaur walked and walked. He met a small bird. The bird was nice and helped the dinosaur find his way. They walked together and the dinosaur found his home. The dinosaur was happy and said "thank you" to the bird. From that day, the dinosaur was never naughty again.
