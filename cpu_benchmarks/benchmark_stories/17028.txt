Lily and Max are playing in the park. They see a big slide with a ladder. Lily wants to go on the slide, but Max is scared.
"Come on, Max, it's fun!" Lily says. "You can go with me."
"No, no, no!" Max says. He refuses to go on the slide. He thinks it is too high and too fast.
Lily tries to make Max feel better. She points to the equipment on the slide. "Look, Max, there is a handle and a seat. They will keep you safe. And there is a cushion at the end. It is soft and harmless. You won't get hurt."
Max looks at the equipment, but he is still not sure. He shakes his head. "No, thank you, Lily. I don't want to go on the slide. I want to play with the ball."
Lily sighs. She likes the slide, but she likes Max more. She decides to play with the ball with Max. Maybe next time, he will be brave enough to go on the slide with her. She hopes so. She thinks the slide is fun.
