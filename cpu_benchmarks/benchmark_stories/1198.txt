Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play soccer with his friends. One day, Timmy's coach told him that the team had a big goal to win the championship game. Timmy was very excited and wanted to help his team win.
Before the game, Timmy's coach gave him an important job. He needed to be alert and watch the other team very carefully. He was supposed to test their skills and see how they played. Timmy took his job very seriously and watched the other team closely.
During the game, Timmy noticed that one of the players on the other team was not very good. He told his coach about it and the coach put Timmy in the game. Timmy scored the winning goal and his team won the championship!
The moral of the story is that it's important to be alert and pay attention, even when you're playing a game. You never know when you might be able to help your team and achieve your goal.
