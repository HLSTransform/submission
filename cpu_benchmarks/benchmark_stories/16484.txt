Lila was a very intelligent girl. She liked to learn new things and ask questions. She also liked to help her mom and dad with chores. One morning, she wanted to surprise her mom with a cup of coffee. She knew her mom loved coffee and always drank it when she woke up.
Lila went to the kitchen and saw the coffee machine. She remembered how her mom used it. She pushed some buttons and waited for the coffee to come out. She found a mug and poured some coffee into it. She was very careful not to spill or burn herself. She added some milk and sugar, just like her mom liked.
She carried the mug to her mom's bedroom. She saw her mom sleeping on the bed. She smiled and walked quietly. She wanted to put the mug on the nightstand, but she saw something on the way. It was a big spider. It was crawling on the floor, near the bed. Lila hated spiders. She thought they were scary and gross. She wanted to scream, but she didn't want to wake up her mom.
She decided to protect her mom from the spider. She put the mug down on the floor and grabbed a shoe. She aimed at the spider and threw the shoe. She hoped to hit the spider and make it go away. But she missed. The shoe hit the wall and made a loud noise. Her mom woke up and saw Lila holding another shoe.
"Lila, what are you doing?" her mom asked, rubbing her eyes.
"Mom, I'm sorry, I wanted to make you coffee, but there was a spider, and I tried to protect you, but I missed, and I made a noise, and I'm sorry, and I love you," Lila said, all in one breath.
Her mom looked at the mug of coffee, the shoe on the wall, and the spider on the floor. She smiled and hugged Lila.
"Lila, you are so sweet and intelligent. Thank you for making me coffee and trying to protect me. I love you too. But next time, please don't throw shoes at spiders. They are not so bad. They are just animals. They don't want to hurt us. They are more afraid of us than we are of them."
Lila nodded and cuddled with her mom. She felt happy and proud. She gave her mom the coffee and watched her drink it. She thought her mom was the best mom in the world. And she thought maybe spiders were not so bad after all.
