Once upon a time, there was a big hippo. He was very fit and strong. One day, he went to play in the mud. He had so much fun, but when it was time to go home, he was very dirty. His mommy said, "Hippo, you need to wipe yourself clean!" So, he took a towel and wiped himself all over. He felt much better and hugged his mommy. The end.
