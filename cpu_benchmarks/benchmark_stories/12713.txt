Once upon a time there was a little boy named Sam. He had a bright blue ice-cream cone. Sam loved his cone and all the colors it had.
One day, Sam was out playing in a park. Suddenly, a fake ice cream man came by. He said he had a great surprise. The man asked Sam to push his cart.
Sam was so excited he didnÂ´t think twice. He was pushing the cart with all his might. All of a sudden, the man said he had to go. He gave Sam a fake ice cream cone and ran away.
Sad and disappointed, Sam slowly made his way back home. He realised he should have been more careful when dealing with strangers.
The moral of this story is to be careful and not trust strangers easily. Don't accept anything before asking an adult for help.
