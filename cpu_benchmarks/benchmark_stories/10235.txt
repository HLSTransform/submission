Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He was a spoiled boy who always wanted to have his way. One day, Tim went to the store with his mom. He saw a big, red ball and he wanted it very much.
Tim asked his mom for the ball, but she said no. He was sad and began to stare at the ball. He stared and stared, hoping his mom would change her mind. But she did not. Tim felt upset and did not want to leave the store without the ball.
His mom took his hand and they walked to the exit. Tim looked back at the ball one last time before they left. He knew that he could not have everything he wanted. Maybe next time, he would be a good boy and his mom would buy him a toy.
