Sara loved to sing and play her guitar. She wanted to be a musician when she grew up. She practiced every day and learned many songs.
One day, she saw a poster for a talent show at her school. She decided to sign up and share her music with everyone. She was a little nervous, but also excited.
On the day of the show, she waited for her turn backstage. She saw other kids do magic tricks, tell jokes, and dance. She clapped and cheered for them. Then, it was her time to go on stage.
She walked up to the microphone and smiled. She said, "Hello, everyone. My name is Sara and I'm going to sing a song for you. I hope you like it." She strummed her guitar and began to sing. She sang with a clear and sweet voice. She sang about the sun, the moon, and the stars. She sang about her family, her friends, and her dreams.
The audience listened and enjoyed her song. They clapped and cheered for her. She felt happy and proud. She had succeeded in sharing her music with everyone.
She bowed and thanked the audience. She walked off the stage and saw her teacher waiting for her. Her teacher hugged her and said, "Sara, you did a wonderful job. You are a very talented musician. I'm so proud of you."
Sara thanked her teacher and said, "Thank you, teacher. You are very generous. You always encourage me and help me learn. You are the best teacher ever."
They smiled and walked together to join the other kids. Sara felt happy and proud. She had succeeded in sharing her music with everyone. She had also made her teacher happy. She loved to sing and play her guitar. She wanted to be a musician when she grew up.
