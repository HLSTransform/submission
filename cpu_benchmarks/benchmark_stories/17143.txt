Once upon a time, there was a little birdie named Tweet. Tweet loved to fly and play with his birdie friends. One day, Tweet's mommy told him that they were going on a long journey to find fuel for their nest.
Tweet was excited to go on an adventure with his mommy. They flew and flew until they found a big tree with lots of branches. Tweet's mommy said they could rest there for a while. Tweet was so tired from flying that he started to yawn.
As they rested, Tweet noticed a foolish squirrel gathering nuts. The squirrel was so busy that he didn't see a big owl flying towards him. Tweet knew the squirrel was in danger, so he flew over and warned him. The squirrel quickly ran away and the owl flew past them.
Tweet's mommy was proud of him for being so brave and smart. They continued their journey and finally found some fuel for their nest. Tweet was happy that he could help his mommy and his friend the squirrel. From that day on, Tweet knew that even the smallest birdie could do big things.
