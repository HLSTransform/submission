Toby was a brave little boy. He loved to explore outside and always had big adventures. One day he heard the sound of a vehicle coming down the street. It made a very loud noise that he had never heard before.
Toby was afraid because he didn't know if it was dangerous or not. He wanted to hide so he shut his front door and stayed inside. It was very quiet on the inside and he felt safe. 
The vehicle stopped outside and Toby tried to look through the windows to see what was going on. He soon noticed that it was a big truck. It looked dangerous and he was scared. He shut the curtains so no one would know he was there. 
After a few minutes, Toby heard the loud truck drive away down the street. He felt excited and safe now that the vehicle was gone. He opened the door again and went back outside to play. Toby was a brave boy, and he had found a way to stay safe from the dangerous vehicle.
