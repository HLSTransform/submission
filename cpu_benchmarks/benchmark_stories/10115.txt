Tim and Sam like to play in the park. They run and jump and swing and slide. They have a lot of fun.
One day, they see a big billboard near the park. It has a picture of a man with a big nose and a funny hat. He is selling soap. Tim and Sam think he is ugly. They laugh at him.
They want to get closer to the billboard. They climb on a fence and a wall. They are very high. They can see the man's nose and hat very well. They laugh more.
But then, Tim slips on the wall. He loses his balance. He falls. He falls very fast. He falls on the ground. He hurts his arm and his leg. He cries.
Sam is scared. He calls for help. He sees a lady with a dog. She hears him. She comes to Tim. She is nice. She helps Tim. She calls his mom. She gives him a hug.
Tim's mom comes. She is worried. She takes Tim to the doctor. The doctor gives him a bandage and a sticker. He says Tim will be okay.
Tim is sorry. He says he was silly. He says he will not climb on the wall again. He says he will not laugh at the ugly man. He says he will be careful.
Sam is sorry too. He says he is Tim's friend. He says he will play with him in the park. He says he will be nice.
They hug. They are happy. They learn a lesson.
