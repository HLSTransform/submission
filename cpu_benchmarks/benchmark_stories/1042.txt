Once upon a time, there was a naughty little boy called Jack. He loved looking out of the window to see the view outside. Every morning, Jack's mommy would thank him for not being too naughty and remind him to keep looking out the window. 
One day, Jack saw something very exciting in the view. He could hardly believe his eyes. A big elephant was walking through the grass and eating all the juicy plants! Jack was so excited that he started shouting and jumping around. 
His mommy heard Jack from the other room and ran to see what was happening. When she came to the window, she saw the elephant. She thanked Jack for bringing to her attention the magnificent view outside. 
From that day on, Jack thanked his mommy every morning for appreciating the view he often showed her. Seeing the view made them both so happy.
