Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was playing with her toys when she heard a loud noise outside. She looked out the window and saw an ambulance with flashing lights and a loud siren.
Lily ran to her mommy and asked, "What's that noise, mommy?" Her mommy said, "Oh, that's an ambulance. It's like a big car that helps people who are hurt or sick."
Lily thought that was really smart and said, "I want to be like the ambulance when I grow up and help people too!" Her mommy smiled and said, "That's a great idea, Lily. You can increase the number of people who are helped in the world."
From that day on, Lily played with her toy ambulance and pretended to be a smart doctor who helped people in need. She knew that one day, she would be just like the real ambulance and help even more people.
