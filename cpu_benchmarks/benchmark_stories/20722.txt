Once upon a time, there was a mom and a daughter. They were walking on a sunny day in the park and they saw a big red pan. The daughter got excited and ran to it. She hugged the pan tightly and said, "I love this red pan!" 
The mom smiled and said, "Let's take it home with us." So they picked up the pan and carried it all the way home.
Once they got back to their house, the mom and the daughter put the pan in the kitchen. They hugged each other and said together, "Let's make some yummy food with our red pan!"
So that is what they did. They made all kinds of delicious treats with their red pan. They laughed, sang and hugged each other while they were cooking. 
The mom and the daughter were very happy that they had found such a wonderful red pan. And from that day on, they made yummy treats with it every day!
