Lila loves to dance. She likes to move her feet and arms to the rhythm of the music. She likes to imagine that she is a fairy or a princess or a star. She likes to wear her pink dress and her shiny shoes when she dances.
One day, Lila's mom takes her to a big hall. There are many people and many chairs. Lila's mom says they are going to watch a show. Lila is excited. She wonders what kind of show it is.
The lights go off and the music starts. Lila sees some dancers on the stage. They are wearing colorful costumes and they are dancing very fast and very well. Lila is amazed. She thinks they are beautiful and graceful. She wants to dance like them.
She whispers to her mom, "Mom, can I dance like them?"
Her mom smiles and hugs her. She says, "Of course you can, my sweetie. You can dance like anything you want. You just have to practice and believe in yourself. And you have to keep your heart open to the magic of dance."
Lila nods and smiles. She watches the show with wonder and joy. She claps and cheers when the show is over. She thanks her mom for taking her to the show. She says, "Mom, I love you and I love dance. Can we dance together when we go home?"
Her mom says, "Yes, we can, my darling. We can dance together anytime you want. And we can imagine that we are anything we want. Because dance is a way of expressing ourselves and having fun."
Lila and her mom hold hands and walk out of the hall. They are happy and they are ready to dance.
