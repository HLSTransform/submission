Once upon a time, there was a bright spider who had a special pass. Every day she would go on an adventure with the pass, but never use it. 
One day, while on her adventure, she saw a river. The water was very deep, and it was dangerous. But, the spider thought she could make it across the river without help. 
She scurried close to the river, and began to walk across. Suddenly, the water started to swirl and rise. The spider was scared and tried to turn back, but it was too late. 
The spider screamed for help, but nobody was around to help her. She had no choice but to drop her special pass, and try to save herself. But, it was too dangerous. 
The bright spider didn't make it across the river. She was never seen again.
The moral of the story is never to put yourself in danger without help. No matter how bright you are, you can always use a little help.
