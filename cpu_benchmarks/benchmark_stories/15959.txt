Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a gift from her mom, a shiny new bike. Lily loved her bike so much that she rode it everywhere she went. One day, while she was riding her bike, she fell into a big puddle of mud and got all dirty.
Lily's mom saw her and said, "Oh no, Lily! You got all dirty! We need to clean you up." Lily replied, "But mom, I don't want to clean up. I want to ride my bike." Her mom said, "You can ride your bike after we clean you up. It won't take long."
After Lily got cleaned up, she went back to riding her bike. Her dad came out and asked, "Lily, what are you doing?" Lily said, "I'm riding my bike. I love my bike." Her dad replied, "That's great, Lily. But don't forget to study for your school tomorrow." Lily said, "Okay, dad. I will study after I'm done riding my bike." And she rode off into the sunset, happy and carefree.
