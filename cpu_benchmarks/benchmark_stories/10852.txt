Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved playing soccer with his friends. One day, his team won a big trophy. Timmy was very happy and thought it was the most beautiful trophy he had ever seen.
But then, Timmy accidentally broke the trophy while playing with it. He felt very sad and told his friend, "I regret breaking the trophy. It was so beautiful."
His friend said, "Don't worry, Timmy. It's just a trophy. We can always get another one. The important thing is that we had fun playing together."
Timmy felt better and realized that his friend was right. It wasn't about the trophy, but about the memories they made while playing soccer. From that day on, Timmy learned to value experiences more than material things.
