Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went for a walk in the forest. It was very dark and she couldn't see very well. Suddenly, she stumbled over a big rock and fell down. 
As she got up, she saw something shiny in the distance. She walked towards it and found a velvet ribbon lying on the ground. It was so soft and pretty, she decided to keep it. 
Lily continued walking and soon she saw a little rabbit. It was also dark and the rabbit was scared. But when it saw Lily's velvet ribbon, it came out of its hiding place. Lily was happy to make a new friend and they walked together, enjoying the beauty of the forest.
