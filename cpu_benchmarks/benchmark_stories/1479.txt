Once there was a small boy who was very cheerful. He was playing in the garden when he saw a big brick. He wanted to be cheeky so he decided to break the brick. He made a loud noise as he broke it into lots of smaller pieces.
The boy was very pleased with himself and smiled with joy. He knew he had been naughty, but it was fun!
He looked around to make sure nobody had seen him, but he spotted his mother watching from the window. She was very cross with him and asked him why he had broken the brick. The little boy felt ashamed and apologised.
His mother told him that he should never break things that don't belong to him. She then hugged him and said she still loved him even though he had been naughty.
The little boy felt much better and learned a valuable lesson that day. He never broke anything again, but remained as cheerful as ever.
