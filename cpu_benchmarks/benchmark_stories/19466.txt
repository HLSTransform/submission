Once upon a time there was a gentle bracelet. It was very beautiful. One day, a girl was walking down a street and she saw the bracelet. She was very excited and wanted to be friends with it.
She picked up the bracelet and gave it a gentle squeeze. The bracelet seemed to come alive and smiled at her. She put it on her wrist and it stayed there. The girl and the bracelet were now best friends.
They would go to the park and play together. Every morning and evening, the girl put on her bracelet and they hugged each other. The bracelet was happy and loved to be with the girl.
One day the girl had to go away and they said goodbye. The bracelet cried but the girl promised to come back soon. She gave the bracelet a gentle kiss and said she missed it.
The girl left but she never forgot the gentle bracelet. She came back for it after a few days and now they will stay together forever.
