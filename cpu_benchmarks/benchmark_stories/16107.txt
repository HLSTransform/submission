Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Sarah who loved puzzles. One day, her mommy and daddy bought her a big, expensive puzzle. 
Sarah was so excited and quickly opened the box. She wanted to start doing the puzzle right away. She carefully took out all the pieces and scattered them around the floor. 
Her mommy looked at her and said, "Sarah, do you know what puzzles are for?" 
Sarah nervously nodded as her eyes lit up. 
"That's right," said her mommy. "Puzzles are for putting together, not scattering. Can you help me put it together?" 
Sarah smiled and quickly got to work. 
Together, Sarah and her mommy put the pieces into place one by one, until the expensive puzzle was finally completed. Sarah proudly looked at her puzzle and smiled. 
The end.
