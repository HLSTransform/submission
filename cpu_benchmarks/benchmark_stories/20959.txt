Once upon time there was a little girl who liked to wander.
She liked to wander down the street, out in the garden and in the woods.
One day she decided to wander in the dark, but she was a bit anxious.
Suddenly she saw a lamp, so she took it.
The lamp made her feel less anxious and the bright light guided her way.
She wandered deeper and soon discovered a secret garden.
The garden was full of beautiful flowers and she was so excited.
The little girl happily wandered around the garden all evening.
The lamp kept her safe and she was no longer anxious.
In the end she returned home, feeling tired but content.
The little girl had a wonderful adventure and would never forget the lamp that guided her way.
