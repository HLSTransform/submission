Once there was a monkey who lived in a dry forest. The monkey loved to listen to the sounds of the forest.
He hopped from tree to tree and heard the chirping of the birds. He listened to the sound of leaves rustling in the breeze.
One day, the monkey heard something special. It was a rustling sound that he had never heard before. He stopped hopping around and listened more closely.
The Monkey heard a whisper coming from the old dry tree. He lifted his nose up high and saw a tiny mouse peeking out from the bark.
The monkey was so surprised! The mouse was talking to him telling him a story. The monkey was mesmerised and listened the whole time. When the mouse was done, the monkey thanked her with a hug and a bow. He said goodbye and hopped away.
This monkey was happy. He learnt something new by listening!
