Sara was a bossy girl. She liked to tell other kids what to do and play. She had a big jar of candy that she did not share. She only gave candy to kids who did what she said.
One day, she wanted to have a tea party. She invited some kids to her house. She said, "You can come to my tea party, but you have to bring your own cups and spoons. And you have to do what I say."
The kids did not like Sara's rules. They did not want to bring their own cups and spoons. They did not want to do what she said. They said, "No, thank you. We do not want to come to your tea party. We want to play something else."
Sara was angry. She said, "Fine. I do not need you. I have my jar of candy. I will have a tea party by myself." She took her jar of candy and went to her room.
But when she opened her jar of candy, she saw that it was empty. Someone had taken all her candy. She did not know who did it. She felt sad and lonely. She wished she had been nicer to the other kids. She wished she had shared her candy. She wished she had friends to play with.
