Once upon a time, there was a big elephant. He was very large and had a long trunk. He loved to dance and move to the rhythm of the music. He would stomp his feet and sway his trunk to the beat.
One day, the elephant went to a party with his friends. They played music and danced all night long. The elephant was having so much fun that he didn't notice the time passing by. When he looked at the clock, it was very late.
The elephant knew he had to go home, but he didn't want the party to end. So, he decided to count to ten and stay a little longer. But when he finished counting, he realized that he had missed his ride home. He was all alone and lost in the dark.
The poor elephant felt sad and scared. He wished he had gone home earlier. He tried to find his way back, but he couldn't. He had to spend the night alone in the jungle, listening to the rhythm of the animals. From that day on, the elephant learned that it's important to be responsible and not stay out too late.
