Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, he found a big rock and wanted to carry it home. It was heavy, but he didn't give up. He carried it all the way home and felt very proud of himself.
The next day, Timmy went to the park and saw a toy sailboat in the pond. He wanted to play with it, but it was too far away. He asked his friend for help and they worked together to get the boat. They were able to sail it and have fun together.
Later that day, Timmy's mom made him some lemonade. He took a sip and made a sour face. His mom explained that sometimes things might taste sour, but it's important to keep trying new things. Timmy learned that trying new things can be fun and rewarding.
