Ben and Mia are twins. They like to play with their toys and their dog, Spot. But they do not like to eat their food. They think it is yucky and boring.
One day, Mom makes them soup and bread for lunch. She says, "Eat your food, Ben and Mia. It is nice and hot and good for you." But Ben and Mia do not want to eat. They want to play.
They look at each other and smile. They have a bad idea. They pick up their spoons and throw their soup at each other. They laugh and scream. The soup splashes on their faces and clothes and the table. Spot barks and runs away.
Mom hears the noise and comes to the kitchen. She sees the mess and gets angry. She says, "Ben and Mia, what are you doing? You are wasting your food and making a mess. That is not nice. You have to clean up and say sorry."
Ben and Mia stop throwing and look at Mom. They feel sorry. They say, "Sorry, Mom. We were just playing. We do not like soup. Can we have something else?"
Mom sighs and says, "No, you have to eat what you have. Soup is good for you. And you have to learn to be nice and not throw your food. Now, clean up and eat your bread. Maybe later you can have a cookie if you are good."
Ben and Mia nod and say, "OK, Mom." They wipe their faces and clothes and the table. They eat their bread and drink some water. They think maybe soup is not so bad. They hope Mom will give them a cookie. They hug Mom and say, "We love you, Mom. You are nice." Mom smiles and hugs them back. She says, "I love you, too, Ben and Mia. You are nice, too, when you are not throwing your food."
