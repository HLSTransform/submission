Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He lived in a small house with his mom, dad, and dog, Max. Tim loved to play outside in the wild garden. One day, he found a pipe in the garden. It was a big, old pipe.
Tim picked up the pipe and ran to Max. "Max, look what I found!" he said. Max wagged his tail and barked. Tim thought Max liked the pipe too. So, Tim and Max played with the pipe all day long. They rolled it, hid it, and even tried to make music with it.
As the sun went down, Tim's mom called him inside. "Tim, it's time to eat!" she yelled. Tim took the pipe with him and showed it to his mom and dad. They smiled and said, "Wow, Tim! You own a cool pipe now. You can play with it again tomorrow." Tim was so happy, and he went to bed dreaming of more fun with his pipe and Max in the wild garden.
