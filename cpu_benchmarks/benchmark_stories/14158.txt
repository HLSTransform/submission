One morning, a three year old boy was walking in the forest. Suddenly, he heard something scary - it sounded like a lion! The boy started to panic and he ran really fast. He couldn't find his way out of the forest. He was so scared but then he saw something wonderful. It was a house made of cocoa! He was so happy to see it!
The boy knocked on the door, and a little old lady opened the door. She was so nice and friendly. She let him inside and gave him some wonderful cocoa. The cocoa was so sweet and delicious. He felt a little less scared now.
But then, something terrible happened. The old lady said that the terrible lion had followed the boy to her house. Then they heard the lion roaring outside! They had to find a way to get rid of the lion! The old lady had an idea. She gave the boy a bowl filled with cocoa and asked him to sprinkle it around the house. 
The boy did as he was told and the lion ran away! He was so happy - he had saved the old lady's house. They all celebrated with more cocoa and the boy was so relieved to go home safe.
