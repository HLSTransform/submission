Tom and Mia were playing with their blocks. They liked to build towers and bridges and houses. They had many blocks of different colors and shapes. Some blocks had symbols on them, like stars and hearts and circles.
"Look, Mia, I made a star tower!" Tom said, pointing to his stack of blocks with star symbols.
"That's nice, Tom, but I made a heart bridge!" Mia said, showing her blocks with heart symbols.
They were having fun, but they were also getting tired. They had been playing for a long time.
"Tom, Mia, it's time to rest," their mom said, coming into the room. "You have been playing very hard, and you need to take a nap."
"But mom, we don't want to rest!" Tom and Mia said together. "We want to play more!"
"I know, sweeties, but resting is good for you. It helps you grow and learn and be healthy. And you can play more after you rest, I promise," their mom said, smiling.
She picked up Tom and Mia and carried them to their beds. She tucked them in and gave them each a kiss.
"Rest well, my loves. I'll see you soon," she said.
Tom and Mia closed their eyes and cuddled with their stuffed animals. They felt warm and cozy and safe. They thought about their blocks and their symbols and their mom. They were happy. They fell asleep and had sweet dreams.
