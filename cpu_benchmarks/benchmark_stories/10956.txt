One day, a little boy named Tim found a whistle. It was on the ground, next to an empty box. Tim picked up the whistle and blew into it. It made a loud sound. Tim was very happy with his new whistle.
Tim met his friend, Sue. Sue saw the whistle and wanted to play with it. "Can I try your whistle, Tim?" she asked. Tim didn't want to share, but he knew it was good to share with friends. He tried to resist saying no, and finally said, "Okay, Sue, you can try it."
Sue blew the whistle and it made the same loud sound. She gave it back to Tim and they played with the whistle all day long. They took turns blowing the whistle and laughing at the loud sound it made. Tim was glad he shared his whistle with Sue, and they had a fun day together.
