Once upon a time there was a brave prince who had a shiny sword. He was always ready to act when something bad happened.
One day, the prince heard a noise coming from the castle. He quickly grabbed his sword and began to act. When he reached the castle, he saw the biggest dragon he had ever seen. It had golden scales and was breathing fire! 
The prince knew he had to act fast. So, he took his sword and began to fight the dragon. The battle was hard, but the prince was brave. He finally managed to overpower the dragon, and the dragon ran away.
The prince was very tired, so he thanked the kind people of the town for their help. The people cheered for the prince and his mild manner of act. 
The prince was relieved that he had defeated the dragon and he returned back to the palace. From then on, the prince always kept his sword with him to help fight any troubles.
