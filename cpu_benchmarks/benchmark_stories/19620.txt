Once upon a time, there was a lion. The lion was big and strong and very, very fearful. The lion liked to wander around all day looking for something to eat.
One day, the lion found a big and tasty apple. The lion started to eat the apple when suddenly he heard a loud noise. It was a little girl!
The little girl asked the lion if she could have some of the apple too. The lion was scared at first, but then he allowed the girl to take a bite. The little girl thanked the lion for being so generous and went on her way.
That night, the lion was lying in the grass, looking up at the stars, when he heard the girl’s voice again. This time, she asked if she could take a nap next to the lion and he allowed her to do so.
The lion and the little girl stayed there until morning. The lion was surprised at how friendly the girl was and they both said goodbye with a hug. From that day on, the lion remembered the little girl’s kindness and was no longer as fearful.
