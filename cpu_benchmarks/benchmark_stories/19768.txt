Once upon a time, there was a generous boy. His name was John. He was very happy and kind to others.
One day, it was dark when John was playing outside. He saw a poor bird with no food. The bird was very hungry. So John decided to pay for some food for the bird. He went to the market and bought the bird some food.
The bird was so happy. It chirped and thanked John for the food. John then went on his way. He felt so happy for giving the bird food.
John's kind gesture showed how generous he was. He was a wonderful example for everyone. His generous heart was truly an inspiration.
