Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved the color pink and always wore a pink dress. One day, Lily and her family went to the harbor to see the big boats. Lily was so happy and she hoped to go on a boat ride. 
But suddenly, a big storm came and the boats started to shake. Lily's family tried to protect her, but the waves were too strong. Lily got scared and cried. She hoped the storm would stop soon. 
Sadly, the storm was too strong and the boats crashed into each other. Lily and her family fell into the water and couldn't swim. They tried to hold on to each other, but the waves were too strong. The harbor was no longer a safe place.
