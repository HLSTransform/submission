Once upon a time two friends called Jack and Jill decided to go on an exciting adventure. They decided to take a boat to a mysterious island. When they arrived the island looked very strange. High up in the sky they could see a big mountain with smoke pouring out the top. Jack and Jill knew the smoke was coming from a volcano!
The two friends decided to explore the island and act very brave. Suddenly they heard a loud rumbling sound coming from the volcano. Jack and Jill looked up to the sky and saw that the smoke from the volcano was getting thicker and thicker. Jack and Jill held hands and started to walk away.
Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard and the ground started to shake. Jack and Jill screamed with fear. They ran as fast as they could until they reached a safe spot. Then they looked back to the volcano and saw something amazing - instead of smoke, the volcano was now sending out clear sparkling stars! The two friends cheered with joy. 
They remained in the safe spot until the volcano was quiet again. Then Jack and Jill decided to explore the island more and enjoyed their exciting adventure!
