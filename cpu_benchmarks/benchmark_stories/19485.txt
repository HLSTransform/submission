Once upon a time, there was a pale nation. Every day, the people of the nation would spend their time picking flowers and fruits from the ground. They were always very careful not to pick anything that didn't look healthy and tasty.
One day, a 3 year old child ventured into the nation. They saw a tree with a beautiful, pale blooming flower. The child was excited and wanted to pick it. But, their parents told them not to pick it. 
Despite being warned, the child couldn't resist the temptation and picked the special flower. As soon as the bloom was in their hands, the pale nation lit up with color! All the trees, flowers, fruits, and plants suddenly became red, green, orange, and yellow! 
The people of the nation were amazed. They thanked the 3 year old child for bringing color to their nation. From that day on, they remembered the child as the one who made their pale nation bright and colorful!
