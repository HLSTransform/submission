One day, a little girl was walking down the street with her mom. As they went, the little girl noticed something different. She saw a big puddle in the middle of the road. She wanted to get closer to it, but her mom said no.
The little girl felt sad and confused. She didn't understand why she couldn't look at the puddle.
A few days later, the little girl and her mom were out again. As they were walking, they noticed a different kind of puddle. This new puddle was in the shape of an animal! The little girl couldn't believe it. There were lots of different animals.
The little girl was so excited that she ran to the puddle. She started playing and smiling. Her mom smiled too. This was a special puddle.
The little girl remembered the other puddle she saw the other day. She now realized why her mom didn't let her go near it. Because it wasn't special like this one. She was glad she got to come back and enjoy this special puddle with her mom.
