Once upon a time, there was a funny penguin. He liked to play in the snow and eat ice cream with his friends. One day, the penguin was walking in the snow when he noticed something strange. The snow seemed to be melting! 
The penguin called out to his friends, "Oh no! Something is happening to the snow!"
One of his friends replied, "What do you mean?"
"The snow is melting!" the penguin replied.
The other penguin said, "Oh no! That's not very fun! What should we do?"
The funny penguin thought for a moment, then said, "Let's go find the North Pole and see if we can help stop the melting." So the two penguins began their journey to the North Pole. Along the way, they made more friends, and when they finally reached the North Pole, they worked together to stop the melting snow. 
Thanks to the team of penguins, the snow was saved! From that day on, they all enjoyed lots of fun in the snow. The End.
