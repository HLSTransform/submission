Gus walked around the park, enjoying the sunshine. He saw a scooter and he grabbed it to take it for a test drive. He hopped on and started to pedal. But then he heard a voice.
"Hey," the voice said. "That's my scooter."
Gus had to stop, he knew he was in trouble. He looked over and saw Stella, standing there with her hands on her hips.
Stella had a competitive streak. She said, "Let's have a race and if you win, you can keep the scooter, but if I win, you have to give it back to me."
Gus didn't want anything to do with a race, but he figured he had no other choice. So Gus and Stella lined up and took off down the sidewalk.
Stella had been riding her scooter all summer and she was a good rider. But since Gus had never ridden a scooter before, he was having some difficulty. He was behind Stella the entire time.
Suddenly, Gus rode over a big rock, his front wheel got stuck, and he and the scooter flipped. The front wheel of the scooter was wrecked, it was off the frame and was utterly trashed. Gus was tangled in a heap with the scooter and he was about to cry, tears of frustration rimmed his eyes.
But Stella saw the disaster and both stopped and sat still
