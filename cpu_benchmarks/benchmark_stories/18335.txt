Once upon a time, there was a big cabin in the woods. The cabin was wide and had a big door. Inside the cabin, there was a chair to sit on. One day, a little girl went to the cabin. She saw the chair and sat on it. She liked it very much. She looked outside and saw the trees. They were very tall. She felt happy to be in the cabin.
