Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack. Jack always wanted to play outside, but he was not allowed to go too fast. One day, Jack couldn't help but speed around the garden. His mom saw and quickly ran to get his apron. She put it on Jack and said, now you can play out here but be sure to go at a mild speed. 
Jack was so happy to be able to play, and he happily ran around in his apron. He chased his friends and went down the slide at a mild speed. Suddenly, Jack started to speed and his apron swished in the wind. Jack's mom called for him to come back and slow down, but Jack wanted to play a bit longer.
In the end, Jack's mom let him play at a mild speed as long as he wanted! Jack enjoyed playing and having fun with his friends, all while wearing his apron and going at a mild speed.
