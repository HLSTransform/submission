Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. He had a big bag and he was very busy. He wanted to find someone to play with. One day, he saw a girl. He said, "Hi! I want to play. Would you like to come and play too?"
The girl said, "Yes! I would love to play."
So, Jack invited the girl to come with him. He opened his bag and pulled out some toys, a ball and a kite. They had lots of fun together, playing and running around in the park.
The girl was very happy and thanked Jack for inviting her to play. She said, "Thank you for being so nice!"
Jack smiled and said, "You are welcome! I'm so glad we can play together!"
