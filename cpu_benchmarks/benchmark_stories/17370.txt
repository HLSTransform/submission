Sara liked to play with her grandma's yarn. She liked the colors and the softness. She liked to make shapes and pretend they were animals or hats or scarves. One day, she found a big ball of yarn that was very old. It was gray and brown and had holes and knots. Sara wondered why her grandma kept it.
She asked her grandma, "What is this yarn for? It is not pretty or nice."
Her grandma smiled and said, "This yarn is very special to me. It is old, but it has a story. Let me explain."
She took the yarn and showed Sara a picture. It was a picture of her grandma when she was a little girl, like Sara. She was wearing a sweater that looked like the yarn. She was with her mom and dad and they were happy.
"My mom made this sweater for me with this yarn. She was very good at knitting. She used to tell me stories while she knitted. She taught me how to knit too. This yarn reminds me of her and the stories and the love."
Sara looked at the yarn and the picture. She felt something warm in her heart. She hugged her grandma and said, "I like this yarn too. Can you teach me how to knit? Can you tell me stories too?"
Her grandma nodded and said, "Of course, my dear. I would love to. Come, let's sit and knit and talk. This yarn has more stories to tell."
