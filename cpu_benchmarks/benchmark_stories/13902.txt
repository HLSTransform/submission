Once upon a time, a bird named Bob lived in a big tree. Bob loved to soar high in the sky. He had a big chest that helped him fly very high.
One day, a new bird named Tim came to the tree. Tim wanted to soar high like Bob, but he had a small chest. Bob laughed at Tim and said, "You can't fly high like me!" Tim was sad and wanted to prove Bob wrong.
Tim tried and tried to fly high. He did not give up. One day, Tim found a way to fly high, even with his small chest. Bob saw Tim and was sorry for laughing at him. They became friends and soared high together.
The moral of the story is: Never give up and never make fun of others.
