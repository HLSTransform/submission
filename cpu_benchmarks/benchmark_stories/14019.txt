Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She had a big, soft mattress in her room. She loved to jump and play on it. One day, Sally saw her friend Tim feeling sad. She wanted to help him feel better.
Sally had an idea. She was a very creative girl. She said, "Tim, let's play on my mattress! We can jump and have fun!" Tim smiled and agreed to play with Sally. They both jumped and laughed on the mattress.
After playing, Sally and Tim felt very happy. Sally's mom saw them and said, "Sally, you did a good job helping your friend feel better. You were kind and creative!" Sally learned that helping others and sharing can make everyone happy.
