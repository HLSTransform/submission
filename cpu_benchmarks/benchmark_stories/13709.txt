Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved muffins. One day, she went to the bakery to buy a muffin. The muffin was wide and looked very tasty.
Lily took a big bite of the muffin and felt very happy. But then she got tired and wanted to rest. She saw a bench and sat down to rest. A man came and sat next to her.
"Hello, little girl. That muffin looks delicious. Can I have a bite?" the man asked.
Lily smiled and gave him a small piece of her muffin. "It's yummy," she said.
The man smiled back and said, "Thank you. You're very kind. I'm feeling tired too. Let's rest here for a while."
Lily nodded and they both sat on the bench, enjoying their muffin and resting together.
