Once upon a time there was a girl named Karen. One day Karen wanted to buy something special. She decided to go to the store.
At the store Karen saw a strange vegetable. It was green and long, and it was called celery. She had never seen anything like it before! Karen was a bit scared and so she ran away.
Back at home Karen started to feel bad. She wanted to try the  weird celery! She talked to her mom: "Mom, can I go back to the store and get that strange green thing?"
Her mom smiled, "Yes, Karen. You can go back and buy the celery."
Karen put on her shoes and ran off to the store. She bought the celery, excited to try something new. She took a bite and it tasted delicious!
Karen was so happy she had returned to the store and tried the weird celery. She would never forget that day.
