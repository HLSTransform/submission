One day, there was a fight between two friends.
They argued hard over who should play first with a toy.
“It’s mine!” shouted one friend.
“It’s mine!” shouted the other friend.
The friends started to push each other.
Then something bad happened.
They started hitting each other and it looked like a real fight.
Their parents ran in when they heard the noise.
“What’s going on here?” their mom asked.
The friends stopped fighting and said, “We just wanted to play with the toy, but we both wanted it and it made us fight.”
Their mom said, “You need to share! You shouldn’t fight hard for something, you should work out a way to share it.”
They both agreed and decided to take turns playing with the toy. From then on, they would always share and never fight again.
