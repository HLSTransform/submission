Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to eat broccoli and always asked for it at dinner. But one day, he refused to eat it and got nervous when his mom told him he had to finish it. 
Timmy's mom tried to make him eat the broccoli, but he wouldn't listen. She told him he had to surrender and eat it, but he still refused. 
Days went by, and Timmy didn't eat his broccoli. He started feeling sick and went to the doctor. The doctor said he was very sick because he didn't eat his broccoli. Timmy was sad and wished he had listened to his mom. 
In the end, Timmy got even sicker and had to go to the hospital. He realized that not eating his broccoli was a bad idea and wished he had surrendered to his mom's request.
