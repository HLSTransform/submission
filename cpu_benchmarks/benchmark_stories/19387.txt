One day, a chubby comet came flying by. It was a strange sight for the 3 year old as he had never seen anything like it before. He was filled with curiosity and insisted on finding out what it was.
He asked his mum, and she said it was a comet and that it was filled with ice and dust. He asked if he could touch it and his mum laughed, she said it was too far away and he couldn't. He insisted that he had to touch it and his mum said that wasn't possible.
The 3 year old was sad he couldn't touch the comet. He wanted to touch it so he could find out what it felt like. He ran to his bedroom and grabbed a toy rocket he had, and tried to touch it. He finally gave up and said goodbye to the comet as it flew off in the distance. The chubby comet quickly vanished out of sight.
