Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and toys. One day, she found a unique chair in her grandma's attic. It was big and red and had a funny shape.
Lily sat on the chair and suddenly she felt like she was flying. She was so happy and excited! But then, she heard a voice. It was her mom calling her for dinner. She tried to get off the chair, but she couldn't. "Help! I can't escape!" she cried.
Her mom came running and saw Lily stuck on the chair. "Don't worry, I'll help you," her mom said. She lifted Lily and the chair and they both laughed. "That was a funny adventure," Lily said. From that day on, Lily loved her unique chair even more.
