Joey had been waiting a long time to join his family in the graceful town. He was so excited and couldn't wait to get there. Finally the day had come and his parents were getting ready to leave. Joey knew he had to remember what he needed to take with them. He grabbed his favourite toy and clasped it firmly in his hand.
His family walked to the edge of the town and stopped. Joey's dad kneeled down and asked him to remove his toy from his hand. Joey was nervous, but he trusted his dad and did what he said. Joey said goodbye to his toy and watched as his dad placed it safely by the side of the road.
They kept walking and then the town came into view. Joey gasped at the beauty and gracefulness of it all. His family hugged and smiled as they made their way towards the town. Joey was so happy to finally be there.
Together they entered the town and explored all the amazing things it had to offer. Joey ran around, did some shopping, and generally had a wonderful time. He will never forget this experience, and his funny goodbye to his toy at the edge of the town.
