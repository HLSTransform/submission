Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and her teddy bear. One day, Lily's mom said, "Lily, we are going to the park. Are you ready to go?" 
Lily was very excited and said, "Yes, Mommy! Let's go!" When they got to the park, Lily saw something different. There was a man kneeling on the ground, painting a picture. 
Lily went up to the man and said, "Hi! What are you doing?" The man smiled and said, "I am painting a picture of the trees and the flowers." 
Lily said, "Wow! That's so cool! Can I start painting too?" The man said, "Of course! Here is a paintbrush and some paint." 
Lily was so happy and started painting her own picture. When she was finished, she showed it to the man. He said, "That's a beautiful picture, Lily!" 
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you! I had so much fun painting with you!" And that's how Lily had a fun day at the park with a new friend.
