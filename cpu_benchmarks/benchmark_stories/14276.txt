Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lilli who wanted to bake a cake. She went to the kitchen and looked in the cupboard for what she might need. 
She saw the flour, eggs and sugar and put them next to the bowl. Then she opened a drawer looking for the rolling pin and found instead a big needle!
Lilli was scared at first, but then she looked around and saw lots of other things that she could use to make the cake. She found the spoon, bowl and whisk and got to work.
When Lilli was all done, the cake was ready, and it looked and smelled so yummy. But before she could taste it, the noisy phone began to ring.
Lilli was sad, but she knew she could bake another cake. So she put away the needle and cleaned the kitchen to get ready for her next baking adventure!
