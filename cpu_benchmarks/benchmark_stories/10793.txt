Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to read books, especially books about animals. One day, Timmy went to the store with his mom. He saw a book about lions that he really wanted. Timmy asked his mom if they could buy the book. His mom said they could, but they had to pay for it first.
Timmy's mom went to the cashier and paid for the book. Timmy was so happy! He couldn't wait to go home and read about the lions. When they got home, Timmy's sister wanted to read the book too. Timmy said it was his book, but his mom said they had to share. Timmy and his sister had a competition to see who could read the book the fastest. It was so much fun!
