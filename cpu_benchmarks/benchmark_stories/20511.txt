Once upon a time there was a musician. He had a guitar and he would strum it every day. Everywhere he went, people would gather around and listen to him play.
One day, the musician went to a school and he talked to a lot of kids. He asked the kids if they wanted to learn how to play the guitar and many of them said yes!
So the musician started teaching the kids how to play. It was difficult, but the kids stuck with it. After a few weeks, the kids had learned how to play songs on the guitar! They were so excited.
Then the musician said goodbye to the kids. He gave each of them a hug and thanked them for being brave enough to try something difficult. He told them to keep practicing and keep talking about music.
