Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very sleepy. She yawned as she walked through the forest, her eyes droopy and her steps slow. 
Suddenly, she heard a noise in the trees. She looked up to find a tall man with a basket full of shiny stones. He was sorting through them, putting some in one pocket and some in the other.
The little girl asked the man why he was sorting the stones. He told her that he liked to collect pretty rocks and had so many that he needed to sort them so he could carry them all. 
The little girl watched as he finished sorting and then waved goodbye. She was happy that he was so careful and she wondered what special things he was going to do with his basket of shiny stones.
