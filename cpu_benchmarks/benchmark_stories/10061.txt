Lily and Ben went to the big pool with their mom. They wanted to see the dolphins. The dolphins were very smart and friendly. They jumped and played in the water. Lily and Ben clapped and laughed.
One dolphin came close to the edge of the pool. He had a bandage on his tail. Lily asked her mom, "Why is he hurt, mom?"
Mom said, "He was caught in a net by some bad people. They wanted to take him away from his family. But some good people saved him and brought him here. They are serving him with food and medicine. They are helping him get better."
Lily and Ben felt sad for the dolphin. They wanted to serve him too. They asked their mom, "Can we give him something, mom?"
Mom said, "Yes, you can. You can give him your love and kindness. You can talk to him and smile at him. You can show him that you care."
Lily and Ben nodded. They leaned over the edge of the pool. They said, "Hello, dolphin. We are Lily and Ben. We are your friends. We are sorry that you are hurt. We hope that you feel better soon. We love you, dolphin."
The dolphin looked at them with his big eyes. He made a happy sound. He waved his tail. He thanked them with his heart.
Lily and Ben felt happy too. They learned that serving others is a good thing to do. They learned that serving others can make them happy too. They learned that serving others can make friends with dolphins.
