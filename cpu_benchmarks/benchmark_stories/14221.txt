Once upon a time there was a gifted girl. Her name was Annie. She had bright, curious eyes and she always wanted to explore new things. One day, Annie set out on an adventure. She knew she needed to catch something special to help her on her journey.
She went to the market and saw some luggage. She had never seen anything like it before! She ran up to it and shouted "I want this!"
The shopkeeper smiled down at her. He said, "If you catch it, you can have it."
So Annie ran as fast as she could and caught the luggage. She was so proud of herself. She waved to the shopkeeper as she continued her adventure with her new find.
Annie was so thankful she had been gifted with such agility! She knew it had helped her catch her luggage and embark on this journey. She was excited to see what else she could find.
