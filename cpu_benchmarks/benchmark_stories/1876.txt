Once upon a time, there were two friends. One friend had a game that was cheap. The other friend wanted to play with the game too. So they asked their mom if they could repair it.
But their mom said no. She said that the game was too old and it would cost too much money to fix. The friends were sad.
The two friends decided to find a way to fix the game themselves. They worked hard to find a cheap way to repair it.
After looking online and asking their dad for help, the two friends found the parts they needed to repair the game. They put the pieces together and it worked!
Their mom was very happy. She knew that their hard work would pay off! Now the friends can play the game together.
