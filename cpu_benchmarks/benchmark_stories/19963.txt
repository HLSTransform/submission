Lily and Ben were playing in the backyard. They had a big box and some old clothes. They wanted to make a house for their dolls.
"I have a hammer," Ben said. "I can make a door and a window."
"Be careful, Ben," Lily said. "Hammer is loud and hard. Don't hurt yourself or the box."
Ben nodded. He used the hammer to make a hole in the box. Then he cut out a square of cloth and taped it over the hole. He made another hole on the other side of the box and did the same thing.
"Look, Lily," he said. "We have a door and a window. Now we can put our dolls inside."
Lily smiled. She brought her dolls and some blankets. She put them in the box and made a bed for them.
"They are cozy and warm," she said. "They can sleep here."
Ben agreed. He brought his dolls and some pillows. He put them next to Lily's dolls and made another bed for them.
"They are happy and safe," he said. "They can sleep here too."
Lily and Ben looked at their house. They thought it was amazing. They were proud of their work.
"Can we sleep here too?" Lily asked.
Ben thought for a moment. He looked at the sky. It was getting dark.
"Maybe not," he said. "It is night time. We should go inside and sleep in our own beds."
Lily nodded. She understood. She took her dolls and blankets. Ben took his dolls and pillows. They left the box and the hammer in the backyard.
"Good night, house," they said. "We will play with you again tomorrow."
They went inside and hugged their mom and dad. They brushed their teeth and put on their pajamas. They went to their rooms and got into their beds.
They closed their eyes and dreamed of their amazing house. They were happy and sleepy.
