Mina and her dad were walking in the park one day. Suddenly, Mina spotted something exciting. It was a big club! She asked her dad if she could create her own club with her friends. Dad nodded and said, "Yes!".
Mina ran to all her friends and asked if they wanted to join her new club. Everyone said yes! She explained that her club would be full of fun activities like playing games, making art and telling stories. 
The new club met up every day and the friends had the best time. They laughed and talked, played games and created beautiful things. Every week, the friends would invite someone new to join the club.
The club became more and more popular. It was the most exciting place to be!
One day, the friends decided to go on a slow walk around the park to look at all the new things they had created together. They smiled, laughed and talked the whole time. 
Mina was so happy to have started her very own club! It was one of the best things she had ever done.
