Mary was happy because she liked to watch. She liked to watch all the sights around her. 
Today she was watching the popular park in town. She saw lots of children playing and dogs running around. 
She watched the children laugh and smile and play with each other. It was so much fun to watch.  
Mary watched the ducks swimming on the pond, and the birds in the sky. She watched the flowers sway in the wind. 
Mary watched all the sights until it was time to go home. She had so much fun watching!
