One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. He saw a girl playing with a black ball. The girl spoke a different language. Tim did not understand her words. He felt sad and said, "Mom, I hate not knowing her language."
His mom smiled and said, "Tim, you can still play with her. Just use your smile and body to show you want to be friends."
The next day, Tim went back to the park. He saw the girl with the black ball again. This time, he walked up to her and smiled. He pointed at the ball and then at himself. The girl understood and nodded. They started to play together, laughing and having fun.
As they played, Tim's mom watched from a bench nearby. She knew that her wise words had helped Tim make a new friend, even without speaking the same language. Tim learned that you don't always need words to make friends and have fun.
