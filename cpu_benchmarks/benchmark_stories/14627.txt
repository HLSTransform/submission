Once upon a time there was a miner. He was looking for a good mineral to match. The good mineral was very special, it was very pretty and sparkly. 
The miner went looking for it in a very deep mine. He searched for a long time and eventually he found the good mineral! It was exactly what he wanted and it matched his other minerals. 
The miner was so happy that he wanted to show all of his friends his new find. He took them down to the mine to have a look and everyone was amazed. They all admired the beautiful, sparkly mineral and agreed that it was very good indeed! 
The miner was so pleased that he decided to keep his good mineral forever. He set up his tools in the mine so that he could take care of the mineral and keep it safe. From then on, the miner was very proud of his pretty mineral, which always managed to put a smile on his face!
