Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie lived on a street with lots of trees. Every morning, the birdie would sing a happy song to wake up the other animals.
One day, the birdie met a humble mouse. The mouse was very shy and didn't like to talk much. But when the birdie sang a song, the mouse started to dance and sing too! The birdie and the mouse became friends and would sing and dance together every day.
Soon, all the animals on the street joined in and they had a big party! The birdie sang the loudest and the mouse danced the best. They all had so much fun together. From that day on, the street was always filled with music and laughter.
