Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go camping with her family. They had a big tent that they would sleep in. One day, Lily noticed that the wind was getting stronger and the rain was falling harder. The weather was becoming harsh. 
Lily's dad said, "The wind and rain will increase, so we need to make sure our tent is secure." They added more pegs to the tent and tightened the ropes. Lily helped her mom put blankets on the ground to make it cozy inside the tent. 
That night, the wind and rain increased even more, but Lily and her family were safe and dry inside their tent. Lily felt proud that she helped make their tent strong. She fell asleep listening to the sound of the rain tapping on the tent.
