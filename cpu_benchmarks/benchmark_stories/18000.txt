Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a tiny plant growing in the dirt. It was so small and cute!
Lily wanted to take care of the plant, so she watered it every day. Soon, the plant grew bigger and bigger. It was so pretty! Lily was very happy.
One day, Lily's friend came to play. Her name was Emily. Emily saw the plant and said, "Wow, that's a pretty plant! Can I have one too?" Lily thought about it for a moment and then said, "Sure, we can share it!"
Emily was very happy and they both took care of the plant together. They watered it every day and watched it grow. After a while, the plant was so big that it needed a bigger pot. Lily and Emily got their hands dirty and repotted the plant. Their hands were filthy, but they didn't mind because they were having so much fun sharing and taking care of their plant.
