Sam looked out of the window. He was excited to go out and observe. He grabbed his umbrella, put it over his head and ran out the door.
Outside it was bright and sunny. Sam looked around, observing everything. He saw the tall trees, the flowers and the birds. He was so enthusiastic that he started jumping with joy.
Sam ran around, exploring different parts of the garden. He stopped under the trees and watched the leaves move in the wind. He looked up and saw an umbrella above him, slowly moving as the wind blew.
Sam was so curious he wanted to touch it. He grabbed the umbrella and looked at it intently, watching it twirl around. He had never seen an umbrella before, and he was amazed. He was so enthusiastic that he ran around with the umbrella above his head, making the leaves dance around him.
It was a lovely day, and Sam enjoyed every second of it. He enjoyed every minute of his observations and discoveries.
