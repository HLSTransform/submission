Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a room with lots of furniture in it, like a bed and a dresser and a big chair. Lily loved to play in her room and jump on her bed.
One day, Lily got a new puppy named Max. Max was very obedient and always listened to Lily. Lily loved Max very much and believed he was the best puppy in the world.
Lily and Max played together in her room every day. Max loved to jump on Lily's bed with her and cuddle in her big chair. Lily was so happy to have Max as her friend and believed they would always be together.
