A squirrel was sitting in a tree, looking very frustrated. Suddenly, a small voice called up from below. It was a little girl, and she was asking the squirrel a question.
"What's wrong, squirrel?" she said.
The squirrel shook her head and looked away. The little girl watched for a moment, then took a few steps back.
"I'll come back later," she said softly.
The squirrel watched as the little girl walked away. She couldn't help but feel sad.
The little girl returned the next day with a surprise. She had a big bag with her, and when she opened it, two of her friends came out. They each had a big smile on their faces and were holding up a big acorn.
The squirrel looked at the acorn in surprise. She quickly ran down the tree and snatched the acorn away. Then, she scampered back up with a happy chirp.
The little girl and her friends smiled. They had solved the squirrel's problem. The acorn was enough to make her feel full and soothe her frustrated spirit.
