Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was playing with her favorite toy, a red ball. Suddenly, her little brother Jack came and took her ball. Lily was very upset and started to cry.
"Jack, give me back my ball!" Lily said.
"No, I want to play with it now," Jack said.
Lily didn't want to share her ball because she was afraid Jack would break it. Jack didn't understand why Lily was so upset, he was ignorant of her feelings. 
"Please hurry and give it back to me, Jack," Lily said.
Jack finally understood that he had upset his sister and gave her back the ball. Lily was happy again and they played together. From that day on, Jack learned to be more careful with Lily's objects and they never had another conflict again.
