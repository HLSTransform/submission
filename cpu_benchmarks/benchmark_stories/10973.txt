Once upon a time, in a clean little town, there lived a boy named Tom. Tom loved to play outside with his friends. They would run, jump, and laugh all day long. The sky was always blue and the sun was always shining.
One day, a magic man came to the town. He had a special power to freeze things. He could freeze water, trees, and even the air. Tom and his friends thought it was so cool. They asked the magic man to show them how to freeze things too.
The magic man smiled and waved his hands. Suddenly, the sky was filled with big, white snowflakes. The clean town was now covered in soft, cold snow. Tom and his friends were so happy. They played in the snow, making snowballs and snowmen. The magic man laughed and said, "Now you know how to freeze things too!"
