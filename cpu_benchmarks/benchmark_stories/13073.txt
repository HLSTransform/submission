Once upon a time there was a big man. He had a big mustache and he was nice. His name was Joe. Joe liked to go for long walks. He liked to stop and look at the birds and the trees.
Joe remembered when he was a child, he used to love to explore. He would run around and try to find new things and new places. He would get so excited and be so full of adventure.
Joe never forgot his big mustache. He always kept it nice and neat. Everyone told him it looked nice on him and he liked it very much.
One day, Joe went for a walk in the park. He remembered the things he used to explore when he was a child. He thought about the adventure he had as a little boy and smiled. Joe put his hands on his big mustache and kept walking. Whenever he felt like smiling, he remember his big mustache.
