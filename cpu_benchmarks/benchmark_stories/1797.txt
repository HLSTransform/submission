Once upon a time, there was a girl who was very worried. She wanted to make herself look pretty, like all the other girls, but she didn't have any makeup. Without the makeup, she felt dull and strange.
She asked her mom for some makeup, but her mom said she was too young. The girl was still worried and couldn't stop thinking about it.
One day, the girl saw her mom putting on makeup, and it looked so pretty and special! She asked her mom if she could use it too, and her mom said yes. The girl put it on, and she felt so much better! She was no longer worried and felt beautiful and unique. 
The girl smiled and hugged her mom, thankful that she could make herself feel better after all.
