Once upon a time, there was a young girl called Bonnie. She was very excited because she was about to try something new.
Bonnie's best friend, Danny, asked: "What are you up to?"
Bonnie smiled and said: "I'm going to try to build a sandcastle!"
Danny cheered and said: "That's so charming! I bet you'll succeed."
So Bonnie got to work building a sandcastle. She used her hands and some toys to help her. She worked very hard until it was finished.
When Danny saw the sandcastle, he was so surprised! It was bigger and more beautiful than he had expected.
Bonnie said: "I think I succeeded!"
Danny laughed and said: "You sure did - it's the most charming sandcastle I've ever seen!"
