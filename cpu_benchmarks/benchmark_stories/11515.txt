Once upon a time, there was a normal boy named Tim. Tim loved to play a game with his ball. One day, while playing, his ball rolled far away. Tim went to find his ball.
As Tim searched, he heard a small voice. It was a little bird. The bird said, "Help, I am stuck! Can you save me?" Tim saw the bird in a bush. He was very careful and saved the bird.
"Thank you," said the bird. "Let's play your game together!" Tim and the bird played the game with the ball. They had a lot of fun. From that day on, they were best friends and played the game every day.
