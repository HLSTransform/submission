Once upon a time, there was a wealthy lady. She had a pretty foot that she liked to show off. 
One day, the lady was walking along, enjoying the sun in the sky. Suddenly, she came across a very small man. She smiled down at him and asked him what he was doing.
The man said he was looking for a foot to take for a walk. The lady smiled and nodded her head. She said that he could take her foot for a walk if he wanted. 
 
The man nodded with a big smile on his face. He held the lady's foot and proudly took it for a walk. The lady smiled back and walked away. 
From then on, the small man always took the lady's foot for a walk. They were very happy together.  The end.
