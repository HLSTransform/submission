Once upon a time, there was a little bird. The bird had a very long neck, which he loved to turn all around. One day, the bird was flying when he saw a big, scary cat. The cat wanted to eat the little bird, so the bird turned his neck to see where the cat was.
The little bird was very scared, but he had an idea. He flew up high into the sky and the cat couldn't reach him. The bird was so grateful that he could fly away from the cat. He knew that he was lucky to have wings and to be able to fly.
From that day on, the little bird was very careful when he flew. He always turned his neck to make sure there were no cats around. And he was very grateful for his wings, which kept him safe from danger.
