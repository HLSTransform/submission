Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three-years-old and she was very brave. One day, she was playing with her friends when suddenly, it became dark outside and it started to rain. All of Lucy's friends were scared of the dark and the rain and they ran away.
But Lucy was not scared. She bravely walked up to her house that was next to a tall building. When she looked up at the tall building, she saw that it was dark inside.
Lucy: What is happening inside the building?
Just then, Lucy heard some people rushing around inside. She wanted to find out what was going on. So, she bravely walked up to the building even though it was dark outside.
When Lucy walked inside the building, she saw that everyone was running around doing errands and helping people who needed help. Lucy felt so good that she wanted to help.
Lucy learned a valuable lesson, even in the darkness and confusion, everyone can help one another and make a difference.
The moral of the story is, no matter how dark and scary a situation might seem, kindness, courage and helpfulness will always prevail.
