Lily liked to draw with ink. She had many colors of ink in her box. She liked to make pictures of flowers, stars, and animals. She used a brush to put ink on paper.
One day, Lily wanted to show her ink pictures to her mom. She took her box and her paper and went to the living room. She saw her mom sitting on the couch, reading a book. She said, "Mom, look at my pictures! I made them with ink!"
Mom smiled and put down her book. She said, "Let me see, Lily. I'm sure they are very pretty." She took the paper from Lily and looked at the pictures. She said, "Wow, Lily, these are wonderful! You are very good at drawing with ink. I like the colors and the shapes. You are very creative."
Lily felt happy and proud. She said, "Thank you, Mom. I like to draw with ink. It is fun and pretty."
Mom said, "Yes, it is. But you know what, Lily? You have to be careful with ink. Ink can make a mess. It can stain your clothes and the furniture. Do you know how to use ink safely?"
Lily nodded. She said, "Yes, Mom. I know. I have to put a cloth under the paper. I have to close the ink bottles when I'm done. I have to wash my hands and my brush. I have to be careful not to spill the ink."
Mom said, "That's right, Lily. You are a smart and responsible girl. I'm glad you know how to use ink safely. But do you know what else you have to do?"
Lily thought for a moment. She said, "What else, Mom?"
Mom said, "You have to look at yourself in the mirror."
Lily was confused. She said, "Why, Mom?"
Mom said, "Because you have ink on your face, Lily. You have a blue nose, a red cheek, and a yellow forehead. You look like a rainbow."
Lily gasped. She ran to the mirror and saw her face. She felt embarrassed. She said, "Oh no, Mom. I have ink on my face. How did that happen?"
Mom said, "I think you touched your face with your brush when you were drawing. You didn't notice because you were so focused on your pictures. But don't worry, Lily. It's not a big deal. We can wash it off with some soap and water. It will come off easily. And you know what? You still look very cute. You shine like a star, Lily. You shine with your talent and your joy."
Lily smiled. She said, "Thank you, Mom. You are very nice. You make me feel better. Can I give you a hug?"
Mom said, "Of course, Lily. I love you very much. And I love your ink pictures. They are very special. Just like you."
