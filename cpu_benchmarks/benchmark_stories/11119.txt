Once upon a time, there was a big bookcase. The bookcase had many books. One day, a little boy named Tim wanted to find an original book to read. He looked and looked, but he could not find it.
Tim felt sad and let out a big sigh. His friend, the cat named Max, saw Tim and wanted to help. Max climbed up the bookcase, looking for the original book. But Max could not find it, too. Max sighed just like Tim.
Then, Tim had an idea. He asked his mom for help. His mom looked at the bookcase and found the original book. Tim was so happy, and Max was happy too. They sat down and read the book together. The conflict was over, and they lived happily ever after.
