Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to bake cookies with his mom. One day, they decided to make some thick and yummy chocolate chip cookies. 
As they were mixing the dough, they heard a loud noise outside. Tim looked out the window and saw a cop car parked in front of their house. 
Tim's mom went outside to see what was happening. She saw that the cop was helping an old lady cross the street. When she came back inside, Tim asked, "Mom, why was the cop here?" 
"He was helping someone," his mom replied. "Now, let's finish baking these delicious cookies!" 
Tim and his mom continued to bake the cookies and soon the whole house smelled wonderful. They sat down and enjoyed their treats, feeling happy and content.
