Once upon a time, there was a happy little bird. He loved to sing all day long. His favorite song was about zipping through the sky.
One day, he decided that he wanted to fly like the other birds he saw around him. He looked up and thought, "I can do it!" So he spread his wings and began to sing his special song.
He flew up and up, feeling the wind beneath him. He sang and sang as he zoomed higher and higher. Soon, he was able to zip around in the sky with ease. His song was so joyful that he forgot how scary it felt to fly at first.
He kept on singing and zipping through the air, feeling more and more free. He no longer thought that flying was hard; it was easy. 
Finally, he came down and plopped back onto his favorite tree branch. He felt so happy and proud of himself. He knew that he would never forget this day and his special song.
