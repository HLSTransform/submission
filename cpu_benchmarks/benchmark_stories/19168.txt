Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. Amy loved to pretend. She would pretend to be a princess, a doctor, and even a pigeon. She would flap her arms like a pigeon and make funny pigeon sounds. Amy was very good at pretending.
One sunny day, Amy was pretending to be a pigeon in the park. She saw a real pigeon nearby. The pigeon was very persistent. It kept trying to fly up to a high branch on a tree. Amy watched the pigeon try again and again. She knew the pigeon really wanted to reach that branch.
Amy wanted to help the pigeon. She had an idea! She ran to the tree and pretended to be a pigeon again. She flapped her arms and made pigeon sounds. The real pigeon noticed Amy and came closer. Amy climbed the tree, and the pigeon followed her. Together, they reached the high branch. The pigeon was so happy, and Amy felt like a real pigeon-helper. The end.
