Peter the Panda was walking through the forest one day when he stumbled upon a gem. It was dull in colour but sparkled in the sun. Peter was so excited that he decided he wanted to keep it forever. It was a struggle for him to pick it up, as it was so big and heavy. Even though it was difficult for him, he managed to carry it all the way home.
Once he got home, Peter was really proud of himself. He wanted to show everyone his new special gem. But when everyone went to see it, the gem had become dull and grey. Peter was so disappointed. He had worked so hard to carry it home, but now it was worthless.
That's when Peter realised his lesson. He remembered that nothing lasts forever and he shouldn't become attached to material possessions. He thought that it was best to enjoy the moment and not worry too much about the future.
Moral of the story: Nothing lasts forever - enjoy the moment!
