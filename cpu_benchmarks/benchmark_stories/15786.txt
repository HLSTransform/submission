Once upon a time, there were two friends: a little bird and a frog. They were walking together through the forest when the bird stopped and said, "I am so tired, let's have a rest."
The frog said, "That's a good idea. Maybe we can do some singing?"
The little bird said, "Yes! That is a great plan."
So the two friends settled down next to each other and began to sing. Their voices were sweet and dependable, echoing through the forest.
Suddenly, the little bird noticed a cord on the ground. It was shiny and long. She said to the frog, "What is that?"
The frog smiled and said, "That is the cord to tie friends together." 
He tied the cord around the bird and frog's feet and said, "Now we will always be together."
The bird and the frog were happy. They held hands and sang together. From that day forward, they were the best of friends and always dependable to each other.
