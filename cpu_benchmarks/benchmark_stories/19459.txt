Once upon a time there was a charming little mouse who liked to play all day. One day, the mouse was looking for something to eat and he noticed a big pile of powder. It smelled delicious, so the mouse decided to take a bite. Sadly, it was not as tasty as it smelled. It was too spicy and it made the mouse's nose tingle. 
The mouse was feeling brave though, so he decided to take another bite. But this time, the powder was so spicy that it made the mouse's eyes water. He had to do something fast!
Suddenly, he had an idea. He found a piece of cheese and he put a bit of cheese in with the powder. Then he took a bite. It was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted! He gobbled it all up, and even saved some for later.
The mouse was so happy that he danced around the house all night, twirling and whirling to the charming music he heard in his head. 
From that day on, the little mouse always added a bit of cheese to all his powder snacks!
