Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They like to act like animals. Anna is a lion and Ben is a monkey. They run and jump and roar and chatter.
"Look, Anna, there is a big tree!" Ben says. "Let's climb it and find some shade. It is very hot today."
"OK, Ben, but be careful. The tree is very high and the branches are very thin. We don't want to fall and hurt ourselves." Anna says.
They climb the tree and find a nice spot in the shade. They can see the whole park from there. They see other children playing, dogs barking, birds singing, and flowers blooming.
"This is fun, Anna. We are like king and queen of the jungle. We can see everything and everyone." Ben says.
"Yes, Ben, this is fun. But we should not stay here too long. We should go back to our mom and dad soon. They are waiting for us on the bench. They might get worried if we are gone for too long." Anna says.
"OK, Anna, let's go then. But first, let's act like animals one more time. I will be a monkey and you will be a lion. Ready? Go!" Ben says.
They act like animals one more time. They make loud noises and swing from the branches. Then they climb down the tree and run back to their mom and dad. They hug them and tell them about their adventure. Mom and dad smile and say they are proud of them. They are happy and tired. They go home and have a nice nap.
