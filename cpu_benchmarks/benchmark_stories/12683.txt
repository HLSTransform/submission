Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and imagine all sorts of things. One day, she was playing with her friends when she saw a big, mighty tree in the distance. She knew she had to cross the field to get to it.
Lily and her friends started walking towards the tree, but they soon realized there was a big river in their way. They didn't know how to cross it. Lily thought for a moment and then had an idea. She remembered the cross her grandma had given her and decided to use it as a bridge. 
Her friends were amazed as Lily carefully placed the cross over the river and they were able to cross safely. From that day on, whenever they played outside, they would always remember the mighty tree and the cross that helped them cross the river.
