Once there was a child who wanted to go on a vacation. He asked his mom if he could go. She said that he could if he was careful.
The child was so excited. He ran around the house, jumping with joy.
His mom said, “Now, remember – you have to be careful. No diving into water until you know it is shallow. You don’t want to get hurt.”
The child smiled and nodded. He was so excited to go on his first vacation.
On the first day, he found a lake and wanted to dive in. He looked around but he couldn't tell how deep it was. He asked his mom if it was okay to dive in.
His mom said, “No, it looks too deep. You could get hurt. Why don't you float for a little bit and then you can dive in if you want.”
The child agreed and floated in the water until it felt safe. Then, he jumped in and dove as deep as he could. It was so much fun!
He had a great time on his vacation and never got hurt. He was so happy and he couldn’t wait to go on another one.
