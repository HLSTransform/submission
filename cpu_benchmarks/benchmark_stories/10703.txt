Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play with her toys and eat snacks. One day, her mom gave her an expensive tray to carry her snacks. Lily was happy and said, "I have a pretty tray!"
But then, Lily accidentally dropped the tray and it broke into many pieces. She cried and said, "My pretty tray is broken!" Her mom tried to fix it, but it couldn't be fixed. Lily was sad and didn't have a tray to carry her snacks anymore.
From that day on, Lily learned to be more careful with her things. She didn't want to have any more broken things. Even though she didn't have a tray, she still enjoyed her snacks and playing with her toys.
