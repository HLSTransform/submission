Once upon a time, there were two friends named Timmy and Tommy. They both lived in the same nation and loved to play together every day. One day, they found an old toy car in the park and both wanted to play with it at the same time.
Timmy said, "I want to play with the old toy car first."
Tommy said, "No, I want to play with the old toy car first."
They started to argue and couldn't agree on who would play with the car first. So, they decided to separate and play with their own toys for a while. After some time, they both realized that playing alone was not as much fun as playing together.
They then came back together and Timmy said, "Let's take turns playing with the old toy car."
Tommy agreed and they happily played with the toy car together, taking turns and having fun. They realized that sharing and taking turns was more important than having the toy all to themselves. From that day on, they were the best of friends and never fought over toys again.
