Tom and Anna like to play knights and dragons. Tom has a big shield made of cardboard. Anna has a soft toy dragon that can roar. They go to the park and find a big hill. Tom says, "This is my castle. I am the brave knight. You are the scary dragon. Try to take my shield!"
Anna nods and makes her dragon fly in the air. She roars and pretends to breathe fire. Tom holds his shield in front of him and says, "You cannot get me, dragon. My shield is too strong. Go away!"
Anna laughs and lands her dragon on the hill. She tries to push Tom's shield with her dragon's nose. Tom pushes back and says, "No, no, no. You cannot have my shield. It is mine!"
Anna smiles and says, "Okay, okay, okay. You can keep your shield. But can I have a hug? You are my brother and I love you."
Tom lowers his shield and says, "Yes, you can have a hug. You are my sister and I love you too." He gives Anna a gentle hug and kisses her dragon. Anna hugs him back and kisses his shield. They are happy and play some more.
