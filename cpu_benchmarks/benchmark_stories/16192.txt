Once upon a time, there were two friends, John and Adam. They liked to join together and have fun. One day, they both decided to build something. John suggested they make a coal castle.
Adam said, "That sounds like a great idea! What will we use to make it?"
John said, "Let's get some coal from the mountain!"
So John and Adam went to the mountain and gathered some coal. Back at home, they began building their coal castle. It was a big and beautiful castle. When it was finished, Adam and John looked at it with a big smile.
Then, John said, "Let's join hands and make a wish for this castle!"
So, Adam and John joined hands, closed their eyes and made a wish.
Suddenly, a small fairy appeared from the sky. They both were so surprised! The fairy said in a sweet voice, "I heard your wish. I will turn your castle into a beautiful place and make it sweet to the touch."
The fairy flicked her wand and with a twinkle of light the castle was covered in beautiful, sweet candy! John and Adam both laughed with joy.
They had made the sweetest coal castle ever!
