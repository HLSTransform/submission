Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was a normal boy who lived in a small house with his mom, dad, and dog, Spark. Spark was a happy dog who loved to play with Tim all day long.
One day, Tim and Spark were playing outside when they saw a big tree. Tim wanted to climb the tree, but he needed help. "Spark, I need help," said Tim. Spark wagged his tail and helped Tim climb the tree. They both felt very happy.
As they climbed higher, they saw a little bird who was sad. "Why are you sad?" asked Tim. The bird replied, "I need a friend." Tim and Spark smiled and said, "We can be your friends!" From that day on, Tim, Spark, and the little bird were the best of friends. They played together every day, and they all lived happily ever after.
