One day there was a little boy called Bill. He wanted something to eat. So his mum gave him a pear, which looked good. But when he tasted it, he was very disappointed! It was not sweet, it was a bit sour. He was not happy and he thought his mum didn't know what was good. 
This reminded Bill of something his mum had said earlier that day. She had said, "We all have to hope for the best, even if there are times when things don't turn out right".
Bill thought about this for a minute. Then he tried the pear again and enjoyed it. He realised that his mum was right. Even though things don't always turn out how we want, we must always hope for the best. 
This is a valuable lesson Bill learnt, and he will remember it for a long time.
