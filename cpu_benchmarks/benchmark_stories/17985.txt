One day, a tough dog named Max found a big barrel. He wanted to spend time playing with it. So, he pushed it with his nose and it rolled down the hill. He barked and ran after it, wagging his tail.
As the barrel rolled, a little cat named Lily saw it too. She thought it was a fun game. She said, "Let's play together, Max!" Max agreed, and they both chased the barrel, laughing and having fun.
Finally, the barrel stopped at the bottom of the hill. Max and Lily were tired but happy. They spent the whole day playing with the barrel and became good friends.
