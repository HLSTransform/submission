Once upon a time, there was a mama bear with her two cubs. The cubs were very hungry, so Mama Bear took them to find something to eat.
They went into the woods and stopped in front of a big tree. Mama Bear put her paw on the trunk and smiled. She started to chew on the bark, which tasted sweet. The cubs watched and tried it too.
MamaBear then reached up and cut off some of the leaves. The cubs smelled the leaves, but they didn't like them. They were sour! Mama Bear laughed and gave them something else to eat-- some sweet, juicy wild berries. The cubs liked that much better. 
Mama Bear was happy that her cubs were full. She gave them a hug and then took them back home.
