Once upon a time, there was a little robot named Robby. Robby liked to dress up in fun clothes. One day, he found a big box of dress-up clothes. He was so excited!
Robby tried to put on a hat, but it was too big. He asked his friend, Sally, "Can you help me dress up?" Sally was patient and kind. She said, "Of course, I will help you, Robby!" Sally helped Robby put on a small hat and a pretty scarf. They laughed and played together.
The moral of the story is to be patient and help your friends. When you are kind and patient, you can have a lot of fun together.
