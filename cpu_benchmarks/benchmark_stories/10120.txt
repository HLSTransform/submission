Tim and Sam were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big cane in the snow. It was shiny and red and had a hook at the end. They wanted to touch it and see what it was.
They ran to the cane and grabbed it. It was very cold and icy. They felt a sharp pain in their hands. They looked and saw little teeth marks. The cane was not a cane, but a snake! It was hiding in the snow and bit them when they touched it.
They screamed and dropped the snake. They ran back to their house and told their mom what happened. She was very scared and angry. She wrapped their hands in a cloth and took them to the doctor. The doctor gave them some medicine and said they would be okay.
Tim and Sam learned a lesson. They should not touch things they do not know. They should be careful when they play outside. They should listen to their mom and stay away from snakes.
