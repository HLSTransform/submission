Tim and Kim were twins who liked to play in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat, a scarf and a carrot nose. They gave him two eyes and a mouth with coal. They named him Sam.
One day, a new boy came to their street. His name was Max. He had a sled and a dog. He saw Tim and Kim playing with Sam. He wanted to join them, but he was shy. He did not know how to ask.
He waited until Tim and Kim went inside for lunch. Then he ran to Sam and took his hat and scarf. He put them on his sled and rode away with his dog. He thought he was very clever.
But Tim and Kim saw him from the window. They were very angry. They put on their coats and boots and ran outside. They shouted at Max to give back Sam's hat and scarf. They chased him down the street.
Max was scared. He did not want to fight. He realized he had been mean. He stopped his sled and gave back Sam's hat and scarf. He said he was sorry. He asked Tim and Kim if he could join them and be their friend.
Tim and Kim looked at him. They saw he was not bad, just unknown. They decided to give him a chance. They said he could join them and play with Sam. They invited him to their house for lunch. Max was happy. He thanked them and smiled. He had made new friends.
