The little girl was angry. She was angry because her big sister had taken away her doll. So she went to the steel box in her room to find something to throw.
She found two rocks that were heavy and smooth. She put them in her pocket and went outside. She saw her sister sitting in a chair in the garden.
The little girl pulled out a rock and threw it at her sister. It hit the chair and made a loud sound. Her sister turned around and was very mad. 
The little girl was brave and threw the other rock at her sister. This time it hit her and she started crying. 
The little girl was not so angry anymore. She knew that it was wrong to throw things but sometimes you have to do something to get what you want.
