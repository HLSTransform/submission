Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color with her crayons. One day, she found a gray crayon that she had never used before. She started to color a picture, but then she got bored and wanted to stop. Her mom told her to finish what she started, so Lily kept coloring until the picture was all done.
Later that day, Lily's mom asked her if she had finished cleaning up her toys. Lily said no, but her mom reminded her that it was important to finish what she started. So, Lily went back and cleaned up all of her toys until everything was well-organized.
From that day on, Lily always made sure to finish what she started. She learned that it's important to see things through to the end and that doing so can make her feel proud and accomplished.
