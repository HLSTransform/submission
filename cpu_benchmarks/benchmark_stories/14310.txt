Once upon a time there was a little girl named Katie. She was three years old and loved to play dress-up. One day she found a gray suit hanging in her closet. She tried to put it on and it fit her perfectly.
"Wow!" said Katie. "This looks really nice!"
Katie put her arms out and twirled around. She felt like a princess in her new suit. She went downstairs to show her mom.
"Oh, that's your grandfather's old suit!" said Katie's mom. "It looks like it fits you perfectly!"
Katie was so excited. She twirled around some more and felt so proud in her new gray suit. She knew she looked just like a princess. She smiled and asked her mom if she could keep the suit.
"Of course you can," said her mom with a smile.
And so Katie was able to keep the suit and she loved wearing it every day. It fit her perfectly, like a princess!
