Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was three years old. One day she went to the hospital with her mommy. She was very scared and her mommy held her tight. 
At the hospital, she saw a lot of doctors and nurses wearing white clothes. She wondered what they were doing. She wanted to see some of the toys in the hospital, but her mommy said they had to stay in the waiting room. 
The little girl kept wondering. She thought it was strange to see everyone in white clothes and to stay in one place. Then, her mommy told her that the hospital was a special place with lots of sick children who needed help. 
The little girl felt happy when she heard this. She looked around and smiled, feeling very lucky to have her mommy there to keep her tight and safe. The hospital wasn't scary after all!
