Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a brown horse named Brownie. Timmy loved to ride Brownie in the fields. One day, Timmy saw a big pitch on the ground. He thought it would be fun to ride Brownie over it. 
Timmy climbed on Brownie's back and they rode towards the pitch. But as they got closer, Brownie got scared and started to buck. Timmy fell off and got hurt. He realized that he should have listened to his parents when they told him not to ride over dangerous things. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to listen to your parents and not take unnecessary risks. Sometimes things that look like fun can be dangerous.
