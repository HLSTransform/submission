One day, a little girl named Sally and her friend Tom went to the park. They saw a dead bug on the ground. Sally pointed with her finger and said, "Look, Tom! A dead bug!"
Tom looked at the bug and said, "Yes, it's not moving. Let's discuss what happened to it." They sat down and talked about the bug. They thought maybe it was too old or maybe another bug hurt it.
As they were discussing, a big bird flew down and picked up the dead bug with its beak. Sally and Tom watched as the bird flew away with the bug. They waved goodbye to the bird with their fingers and continued to play in the park.
