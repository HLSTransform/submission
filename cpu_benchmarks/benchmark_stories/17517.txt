Anna and Ben are going to the airport with Mom and Dad. They are very happy because they are going to visit Grandma and Grandpa. They have a big bag with clothes and toys.
"Can I add my teddy bear to the bag?" Anna asks Mom.
"Sure, honey, but the bag is already very full. You have to squeeze it in," Mom says.
Anna tries to push her teddy bear into the bag, but it is hard. She pulls and pushes, but the bear does not fit.
"Let me help you, Anna," Ben says. He takes the bear and finds a small space in the bag. He zips the bag closed.
"Thank you, Ben. You are a good brother," Anna says. She hugs Ben and the bear.
They go to the car and drive to the airport. They see many planes in the sky. They are excited to fly in a plane too. They hope Grandma and Grandpa will like their gifts.
