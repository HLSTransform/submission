Mum and Jimmy were at the pool.  Jimmy's fingers clutched tightly to his orange and blue swim float. He couldn't contain his excitement and it bubbled out of him.
Mum smiled and said "Ok, Jimmy, let's get in."
But Jimmy hesitated. The water looked deep and he was scared. He didn't want to delay, but he just wasn't sure.
Mum put her arm around him, and then she said, "It's ok Jimmy, why don't we start with the shallow bit. Or maybe I'll carry you?"
Jimmy looked at the broken diving board and laughed. He didn't want to delay anymore! He said "Mummy, I'm ready to swim!"
Mum tickled him and they walked over to the shallow part. As they went in, a wave of excitement washed over Jimmy. He was ready to swim and conquer the pool!
