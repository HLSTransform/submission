Sally was so excited! She was going on a holiday and had to pack her suitcase. She started packing her favourite toy and her clothes. Then she thought about something else she wanted to bring. She wanted to bring something reliable so she decided to pack her rubber duck, which she called Thunder. 
Thunder was the most reliable thing she owned! He always made her feel safe and secure. She packed him into her suitcase and smiled. 
The next day, Sally and her family hopped in their car, and left on their holiday. And when they arrived at their destination, Sally opened her suitcase and Thunder was still there, reliable as ever! 
Sally was overjoyed and hugged her rubber duck tight. She was excited to explore her new holiday location with Thunder by her side.
