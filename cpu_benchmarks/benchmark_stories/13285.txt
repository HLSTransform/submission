Once there was a flea who was very happy. He lived on the neck of a big dog. He would jump and play every day on the furry neck of the dog. But one day the flea began to worry. It seemed like the dog was scratching more than usual! He was scared the dog would scratch him away. He jumped and jumped looking for a new place to live. He finally found a new place to call home, a small mouse! He was so happy and jumped up and down as he settled into his new home. The flea was finally safe and happy again.
