Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a red dress and loved to climb trees. One day, she saw a big tree and wanted to climb it. "Can I climb that tree, Mommy?" she asked.
Her mommy said, "Sure, but be careful." Lily climbed up the tree and saw a bird's nest on a branch. She looked around and saw a tray on the ground. "Mommy, can you bring the tray?" she yelled.
Her mommy brought the tray and Lily carefully climbed down with the bird's nest in the tray. "Look, Mommy! I found a bird's nest!" she exclaimed. Her mommy smiled and said, "That's wonderful, Lily. You're a great climber."
