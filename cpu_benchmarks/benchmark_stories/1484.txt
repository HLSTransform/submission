Once there was a little boy. He was poor, and he was very, very tired. He had been working all day and he wanted to sleep. He decided to take a nap. 
He looked for a place to sleep and found a soft blanket on the floor. He lay down and closed his eyes. Just then, he heard a loud noise. He opened his eyes and saw a big ball. It had dropped from the sky. 
He rolled the ball around and played with it, until he felt sleepy again. Then he curled up on the blanket and went to sleep. But he was so tired that he dropped the ball. 
He didn't wake up again until the morning. Even though he was still poor, he smiled when he remembered the ball and the nap he had taken.
