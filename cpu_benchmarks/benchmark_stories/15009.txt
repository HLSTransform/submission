Once upon a time there was a little boy named Ben. He was a curious three year old who liked to explore and have fun. 
One day, Ben woke up from a long, peaceful sleep. He was hungry, so he had some cereal for breakfast. After he finished, he decided to take a bath.
Ben ran to the bathroom and saw his mom inside with a big, white bar of soap. 
"What's that, Mommy?" he asked.
"It's soap. We use it to get clean," his mom replied.
Ben smiled and said, "I want to climb in the tub and play!" So his mom filled the tub with warm water and Ben splashed around with the soap and bubbles. When he was finished, Ben felt nice and clean and more hungry than ever. 
His mom then called him to the kitchen, and she served Ben a big bowl of soup. He was so happy and ate it all up.
The End.
