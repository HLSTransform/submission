Once there was a shy little girl named Annie. Annie liked to design things with paper and crayons. One day, she came up with a very special design in her brain. She wanted to make it real, so she asked her mom for help.
Annie's mom smiled and said, "Let's make it!" Annie was so excited that she ran to the living room to find Ribbon, colored paper, and crayons.
Annie carefully designed the special thing that was in her brain and decided to make a robot. She used Ribbon to make the legs and arms, colored paper to make the body, and the crayons to give it a bright, colorful face.
When she was done, she proudly showed it to her mom. Her mom clapped and said, "That's so creative! I love it!" Annie was so happy, she gave her robot a big hug. From then on, Annie and her robot were very close friends.
