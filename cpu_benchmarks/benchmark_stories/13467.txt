Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat yummy food, especially her mom's homemade cookies. One day, Lily's mom made her a big plate of spaghetti for dinner. Lily was so excited to eat it!
As she was about to take a bite, her little brother Jack appeared in the kitchen. Jack had a hairy spider toy in his hand and he was pretending to scare Lily with it. Lily got scared and knocked over her plate of spaghetti, making a big mess.
Lily's mom came into the kitchen and saw the mess. She asked Lily what happened and Lily told her about Jack and the hairy spider. Her mom said, "Lily, it's not nice to scare others. You should always be kind and considerate." Lily felt bad and apologized to her mom.
From that day on, Lily always remembered to be kind to others and not to scare them, even if it was just a pretend spider. And she learned that accidents can happen, but it's important to clean up and try again.
