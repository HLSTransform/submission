There was once a tree that lived in a park. Every day it let the children play below it. It was happy and content until one day something strange happened. The park became very quiet. 
The tree was confused. It couldn't understand what was happening. Then it heard something that made it confused even more. Someone said that the park was not permitting anyone to be there. 
The tree was very sad. It didn't understand why the people wouldn't be able to play in the park anymore. But then, one day, it heard a noise. The park was alive with children's laughter again! 
The tree was so happy. It understood that the people had been given permission to play in the park again. The tree was glad that it could now once again watch the children playing and having fun, just like it had been doing all along.
