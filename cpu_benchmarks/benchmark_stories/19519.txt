Jimmy and Tommy were very excited. They had a special surprise for the day. Tommy's mom had something to lend them. It was a little toy car. They were so happy. They ran around the house playing with their car. They took turns driving and created a race track. 
But as they were racing around, Jimmy forgot to look where he was going and bumped into a chair. He felt a lot of pain and started to cry. Tommy's mom quickly came to help. She held him in her arms, kissed him and said it was okay. 
Jimmy's pain quickly went away and he was excited to continue playing with his car. He and Tommy spent the whole day playing in the race that they created. They had so much fun!
