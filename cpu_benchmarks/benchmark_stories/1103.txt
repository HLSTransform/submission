Once upon a time there was a chubby mouse. He wanted to make a special sauce for his friends. He went all around the house looking for things to put into the sauce. He found some carrots, a bit of butter and some pepper. But he still needed something extra.
He decided to go outside to find what he was looking for. After a while he saw a big juicy tomato. That was it! He quickly grabbed it and ran back home.
He began to cut up everything and mix it together to make his special sauce. When he was finished he tasted it and it was delicious! He was so happy he had completed his sauce.
He took the sauce to his friends and they all loved it. They had lots of fun eating it together.
The chubby mouse was very proud of his special sauce. He wished he could make it again, but he knew it had been really lucky to find that special tomato.
