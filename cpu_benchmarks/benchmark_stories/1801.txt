Once there was a noisy alligator. He liked to cause a lot of commotion and he frequently made loud noises. One day, he was walking through the swamp, loudly singing and causing a ruckus.
He came across a duck who said to him, “Please be quiet! You’re being very noisy.” But the alligator refused to listen and kept singing.
He walked a bit further and came across a frog who said the same thing to him. “Please don’t be so noisy!” But the alligator continued to sing and be disruptive.
Finally, the alligator came across a wise old turtle and she said to him, “It’s nice to be happy, but it’s not nice to be too loud. You’d be better off if you kept your voice down and behaved more politely.”
The alligator heeded the turtle’s advice and from then on he made sure to stay quiet and not be too disruptive. He learned that sometimes it’s better to be polite than to be too noisy.
