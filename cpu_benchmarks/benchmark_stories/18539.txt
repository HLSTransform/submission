Anna and Ben are excited. They are going to help their dad paint the wall. Dad is a painter. He has many colors of paint and brushes.
First, dad has to measure the wall. He uses a long tape that has numbers on it. He tells Anna and Ben to hold one end of the tape while he holds the other end. They stretch the tape along the wall and dad reads the numbers.
"Good job, kids. The wall is four meters long and two meters high. Now we can choose the paint color. What color do you like?" dad asks.
Anna likes pink and Ben likes blue. They tell dad their favorite colors. Dad smiles and says, "How about we mix pink and blue and make purple? Purple is a nice color for the wall. Do you want to try?"
Anna and Ben nod. They are curious. They watch dad pour some pink paint and some blue paint into a big bucket. He stirs the paint with a big stick. The paint changes color. It becomes purple.
"Wow, that's amazing!" Anna and Ben say. They want to paint the wall with dad. Dad gives them each a small brush and shows them how to dip it in the paint and stroke it on the wall. They follow dad's instructions and start painting.
They have fun painting the wall. They make purple shapes and patterns. They laugh and talk. They are proud of their work. They can't wait to show mom their purple wall.
