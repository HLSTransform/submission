Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the mud and get very dirty. His mom would always tell him to wash his hands and face, but Timmy didn't like to. 
One day, Timmy got very sick because he didn't wash his hands and face. His mom took him to the doctor, who said he had caught a bad germ. The germ made Timmy's whole body feel very bad. 
The doctor told Timmy's mom that the germ was spreading to other people in the nation. Timmy felt very sad and sorry for not washing his hands and face. He promised to always wash from then on. 
Sadly, the germ spread all over the nation and many people got very sick. Timmy learned that it is important to wash to keep yourself and others healthy.
