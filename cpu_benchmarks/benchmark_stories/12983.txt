Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was very excited because he had just got a new bicycle. But then it started to rain and Tom's bicycle got wet.
Tom was disappointed. He said to his mom, "Mommy, my bicycle is wet. What do I do?"
Mom said, "Don't worry, Tom. I have an idea. I will scatter some towels on the floor. You can use the towels to put your bicycle on, so it won't get wet again."
Tom did what his mom said and put his bicycle on the towels. Then he went out and had lots of fun riding his bicycle. But then it started raining again, so he had to come back inside.
But instead of getting his bicycle wet again, he had an idea. Tom said, "Mommy, can I scatter the towels on the floor again, so I can put my bicycle on them and it won't get wet?"
Mom smiled and said, "Of course you can, Tom. That's a great idea!"
And so, Tom was able to enjoy riding his bicycle without getting it wet.
