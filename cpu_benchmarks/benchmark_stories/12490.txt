Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy cube that she loved to play with. It was red and blue and had letters on it.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. They saw some ducks in the pond. Lily wanted to feed them, so her mommy gave her some bread. Lily broke the bread into little pieces and threw them to the ducks. The ducks were happy and quacked loudly.
As they were leaving the park, Lily noticed that the sky was getting dark. She looked up and saw a bright light shining in the sky. It was a shooting star! Lily made a wish and closed her eyes tightly. She wished for a new toy cube to play with. When she opened her eyes, the shooting star had disappeared. But Lily felt happy and excited anyway.
