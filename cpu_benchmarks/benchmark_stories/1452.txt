Once upon a time, there was a little bird. He had the softest, fluffiest feathers and the cutest little beak. The bird loved to sing. Every morning, he would wake up, flutter his wings, and sing the sweetest songs.
One day, the little bird met a bigger bird. The bigger bird taught him some new songs. They sang together and flew around the sky, creating a beautiful melody. The little bird loved learning the new songs and he practiced them every day.
The little bird kept singing the new songs and he soon became the best singer in the forest. All the other birds came to listen to him and he even began teaching them the new songs. He taught them how to chirp in perfect harmony and soon, the whole forest was singing together!
