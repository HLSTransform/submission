Anna and Ben are playing in the kitchen. They see a big bowl on the table. It is full of something white and sticky. They do not know what it is.
"Let's touch it!" says Ben. He puts his hand in the bowl and feels the white stuff. It is cold and wet. He laughs and pulls his hand out. He has white stuff on his fingers.
"Me too!" says Anna. She also puts her hand in the bowl and feels the white stuff. She thinks it is funny and makes a face. She has white stuff on her hand.
They look at each other and smile. They have a new game. They slap each other's hands and make the white stuff fly. They giggle and slap harder. The white stuff goes everywhere. It lands on their hair, their clothes, their faces. It also lands on the floor, the walls, the chairs.
They do not hear Mom coming. She opens the door and sees the mess. She is very angry. She shouts at them.
"What are you doing? That is my cake mix! You ruined it! You are very naughty! Go to your room now!"
Anna and Ben are scared. They drop their hands and look at Mom. They see her red face and her big eyes. They feel sorry. They did not know it was cake mix. They did not know it was bad. They just wanted to play.
They say "Sorry, Mom" in a small voice. They run to their room. They cry. They do not like to make Mom angry. They do not like to slap. They do not like the unknown bowl.
