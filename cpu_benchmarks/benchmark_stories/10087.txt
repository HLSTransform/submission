Anna and Ben are twins. They live on a farm with their mom and dad. They like to help with the animals and the plants. Every morning, they rise early and go outside.
One day, they see a big pile of hay in the barn. They want to play with it. They climb on top of the hay and make a fort. They pretend they are kings and queens of the hay.
"Look, Ben, I have a crown of hay!" Anna says. She puts some hay on her head.
"You are a gentle queen, Anna," Ben says. He makes a sword of hay and swings it in the air.
"Whoosh, whoosh, I am a brave king, Ben," he says.
They laugh and have fun. They do not see their mom coming into the barn.
"Hello, my little kings and queens," their mom says. She smiles and hugs them.
"Mom, we are playing with the hay," Anna says.
"I can see that," their mom says. "But do you know what the hay is for?"
"No, what is it for?" Ben asks.
"The hay is for the cows and the horses. They eat it and sleep on it. It keeps them warm and happy," their mom says.
"Really?" Anna and Ben say. They look at the hay with new eyes.
"Can we help you feed the animals, mom?" they ask.
"Of course, you can. You are very good helpers," their mom says. She takes their hands and leads them to the animals.
They give some hay to the cows and the horses. They pet them and talk to them. They are gentle and kind.
The animals moo and neigh. They thank Anna and Ben for the hay.
Anna and Ben are happy. They love the farm and the animals. They love their mom and dad. They love each other. They are the best twins ever.
