Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside, but today it was raining. Lily put on her raincoat and boots and went outside to jump in puddles. She was having so much fun that she didn't notice her hat was blown away by the wind. 
Later that day, Lily's mom saw her outside without her hat and scolded her for being careless. Lily felt sad and wanted to make it right. She remembered where she lost her hat and went outside to look for it. After searching for a while, she found her hat stuck in a bush. She carefully removed it from the bush and brought it back to her mom. 
Her mom was proud of Lily for being responsible and caring about her things. From that day on, Lily made sure to always keep track of her belongings, even on rainy days.
