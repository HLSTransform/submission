Once upon a time, there was a happy girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she found a shiny diamond on the ground. It was so pretty and sparkly! She picked it up and put it in her pocket.
Later that day, Lily's mom asked her to help fill up the bird feeder with seeds. Lily was happy to help and poured the seeds into the feeder. The birds chirped cheerfully as they flew down to eat the seeds. Lily felt happy knowing she helped the birds.
As the sun set, Lily went back inside and showed her mom the diamond she found. Her mom was surprised and told Lily how special and rare diamonds are. Lily felt proud and cheerful knowing she found something so valuable.
