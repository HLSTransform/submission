Once upon a time, there was a big, long line at the grocery store. A little girl named Lily was waiting with her mommy. Lily was getting bored and asked her mommy when they could go home. Her mommy said they had to stay in line for a little while longer. 
Lily saw some candy on a shelf nearby and wanted to get it, but her mommy said no. Lily felt sad and wanted to leave the grocery store. But her mommy said they needed to stay and get food for dinner. 
Finally, after a long time, it was their turn to pay. Lily helped her mommy put the groceries in the cart and they walked out of the store. As they walked home, Lily felt happy that they got all the food they needed to make a yummy dinner.
