Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. He had a new uniform for school. Tim was very happy to wear it. He loved how it looked on him.
One day, Tim's mom washed his uniform. But, she made a mistake. She used hot water. The uniform started to shrink. It became very small. Tim was sad. He could not wear it anymore.
Tim's mom said sorry. She took him to the store. They bought a new uniform. This one was loud and colorful. Tim liked it even more. He was happy again.
