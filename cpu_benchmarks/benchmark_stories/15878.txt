Once upon a time there was a girl called Sarah. She was three years old and loved to take photos.
One day, Sarah said to her mom, "I want to buy a camera!" Her mom smiled and said, "That's great, Sarah. Let's go shopping."
So off they went to the store. There were many different cameras, but Sarah knew exactly what she wanted.
“Mommy, I want to buy the flexible camera,” she said. Her mom agreed that it was the perfect one.
They bought it, and Sarah was so happy! She couldn't wait to take pictures.
That night, Sarah and her mom went outside and looked at the stars. She took lots of pictures of the night sky with her new camera.
 
Sarah smiled and said, "I love my flexible camera!"
