Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. It was his birthday and he was very happy. His mom made him a thick cake with lots of frosting on top. Timmy loved it so much that he ate too much of it!
Later that day, Timmy's friend came over to play. Timmy wanted to show his friend all of his new toys. But he couldn't find his favorite toy car. He looked everywhere, but it was nowhere to be found. Timmy was very sad.
His mom told him to think about where he last had it. Then Timmy remembered he had let his little sister play with it earlier. He went to her room and found his toy car. He was so happy to have it back. He learned that it's important to share, and when you return something you borrowed, it makes others happy too.
