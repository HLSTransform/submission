Sam and Mia are twins. They like to play with their toys. They have many toys, but they want more. They see a big shop with many modern toys. They see cars, dolls, robots, and games. They pull their mom to the shop.
"Mom, mom, can we go in?" they ask.
Mom looks at the shop. She sees the price tags. They are very high. She shakes her head.
"No, sweeties, we can't go in. Those toys are too expensive. We have enough toys at home. Maybe for your birthday, we can get one treat each."
Sam and Mia are sad. They want the modern toys. They pout and whine.
"Please, mom, please. Just one toy. We will share. We will be good."
Mom sighs. She loves her twins, but she can't buy them everything they want. She has an idea.
"Look, there is a park across the street. Why don't we go there and have some fun? They have swings, slides, and a sandbox. Maybe we can find some friends to play with. And if you are good, I will buy you an ice cream on the way home. How does that sound?"
Sam and Mia think about it. They like the park. They like ice cream. They like friends. They nod and smile.
"Okay, mom, let's go to the park. That sounds like a good treat."
Mom smiles and hugs them. She takes their hands and crosses the street. They go to the park and have a lot of fun. They forget about the modern toys. They are happy with their treat.
