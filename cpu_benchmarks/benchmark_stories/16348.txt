Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a boy named Tom. He liked to play with his friends and explore unknown places. One day, he found a big box with a knot on top. Tom was very excited to see what was inside the box.
He called his friend, Sue, to help him open the box. Sue said, "Tom, we should ask our moms if we can open this box." But Tom didn't want to wait. He said, "No, let's open it now!" They worked together to untie the knot and finally, they opened the box.
Inside the box, they did not receive toys or candy. Instead, they found a big mess of smelly trash. Tom and Sue felt very sad and their moms were not happy. The moral of the story is to always listen to your friends and ask for help from grown-ups when you find something unknown.
