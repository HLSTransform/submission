One day, a boy named Tim and his friend Sam went to the cool pool. They wanted to play and have fun. They saw a big float in the water. Tim wanted to sit on it, but he was scared.
"Don't worry, I will support you," said Sam. So, Tim got on the float and Sam held it to help him. They laughed and had a good time. They splashed water at each other.
But then, the sky got dark and it started to rain. Tim and Sam were sad, they had to leave the cool pool. They said goodbye to their fun day and went home. The rain made their day end bad.
