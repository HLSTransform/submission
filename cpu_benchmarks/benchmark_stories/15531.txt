There once was a bad jazz band. They really wanted to play their music loud and clear. But one day, their instruments broke. They were so sad that their instruments wouldn't make beautiful jazz music anymore. 
The band had to find new instruments to make music. They went to the store and bought new instruments, but they still weren't happy. The new instruments didn't sound like their old ones.
The band decided to try something different. Instead of playing jazz, they decided to make rap music with their instruments! They made loud, fast music that everyone enjoyed! They were so happy that their broken instruments could still make beautiful music.
