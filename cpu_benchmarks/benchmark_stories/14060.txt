Once there was a youth called Tom. He was very adventurous and loved exploring the world. One day, he was walking through a nearby forest and he noticed a beautiful tree with yummy fruits. He was curious and decided to take a look.
Tom filled his basket with the deliciously ripe fruits and felt so happy. He couldn’t wait to share them with his family. He ran all the way home and when everyone saw what Tom had gotten them, they were so excited.
After dinner, everyone enjoyed the fruits that Tom had found. They were so tasty and everyone smiled with each delicious bite. Tom had filled everyone’s hearts with joy and they loved him so much.
Tom’s family was so grateful and blessed that he had filled their day with so much happiness.
