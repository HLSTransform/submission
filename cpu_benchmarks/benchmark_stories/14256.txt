Once there was an old man who wanted to play. He went outside and listened carefully. He heard a very strange noise.
It was coming from the bushes nearby. The old man walked slowly over and saw a little rabbit. The rabbit was hopping around and playing by itself.
The old man smiled and listened as the rabbit hopped and played. He watched the rabbit and the rabbit watched him. They both had a lot of fun.
"I'm so happy I got to listen to you play," said the old man. The rabbit nodded in agreement and hopped away.
The old man went back home, feeling warm and happy inside. He was glad that he had listened to the little rabbit play.
