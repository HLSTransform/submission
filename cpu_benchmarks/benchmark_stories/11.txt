Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom had a special belt that he loved to wear. One day, he could not find his belt and felt very sad.
Tom's mom saw him and asked, "Why are you sad, Tom?" Tom replied, "I can't find my belt, and I miss it." His mom wanted to comfort him, so she said, "Let's look for it together."
They looked and looked, and finally, they found the belt under Tom's bed. Tom was so happy, and his mom gave him a big hug. From that day on, Tom always remembered to keep his belt in a safe place.
