Once upon a time, there was a pretty kid named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside with his friends. They would run and jump and laugh together. One day, they found a toy gun and decided to play cops and robbers. Timmy pretended to be a cop and he had to shoot the robbers. But don't worry, it was just pretend! They all had fun playing together and Timmy felt happy to have such great friends. The end.
