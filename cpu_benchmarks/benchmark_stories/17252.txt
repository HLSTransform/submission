Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the sun. One day, Timmy's mom told him to come inside because it was getting dark outside. Timmy didn't want to come inside because he was having too much fun.
As the sun started to move down, the sky got dark. Timmy started to feel scared because the dark was tough for him to handle. He tried to move closer to his mom, but she was busy cooking dinner. Suddenly, Timmy heard a noise coming from the bushes.
Timmy's mom heard the noise too and went to investigate. She found a little kitten stuck in the bushes. Timmy's mom helped the kitten move out of the bushes and brought it inside. Timmy was so happy to have a new friend to play with, even in the tough dark. From that day on, Timmy wasn't scared of the dark anymore because he knew he had his new friend to keep him company.
