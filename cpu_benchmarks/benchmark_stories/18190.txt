Once upon a time, in a big sea, there was a sleepy fish named Bob. Bob lived near a reef with many other fish. One day, Bob woke up and saw that his friend, the starfish, was gone. He felt sad and decided to search for his friend.
Bob swam around the reef and asked his other friends, "Have you seen the starfish?" They all said no. But one fish told Bob, "I heard a big fish talking about a starfish. Maybe it's your friend!" Bob thanked the fish and continued his search.
Bob found the big fish and asked, "Have you seen my friend, the starfish?" The big fish smiled and said, "Yes, I found him stuck in the reef. I helped him get out, and he went home." Bob was happy and swam back to the reef. There, he found his friend, the starfish, safe and sound. They were both so happy to see each other and played together all day long.
