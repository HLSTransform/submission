"Mama," called Bob. He was three years old and ready to go play.
Bob's mother stood up from the couch. "Yes Bob, what is it?"
Bob handed her a broken toy. "I need to replace this," he said.
His mother smiled and took the broken toy. "Let's go to the store and get you a new one," she said. Bob smiled and nodded.
The two of them put on their shoes and headed out the door. They were soon in the store and Bob's mother helped him find a new toy to replace the broken one.
Bob was so excited! He picked out a nice new toy and thanked his mother. They paid for the toy and headed home.
Once home, Bob was ready to play with his new toy. He hugged his mama and thanked her for taking him to the store and helping him find the perfect replacement.
