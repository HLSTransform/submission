Once upon a time, there was a big man named Jack. Jack was very rich and had a big house with a big garden. One day, Jack found a magic bow in his garden. When he used it, he started to shrink smaller and smaller until he was as small as a bug! Jack was scared, but he knew he had to find a way to get back to his normal size. 
He saw a butterfly with big wings and asked for help. The butterfly carried Jack on its back and flew him to a wise old owl. The owl told Jack that he needed to eat a special berry to grow back to his normal size. Jack found the berry and ate it. Suddenly, he grew bigger and bigger until he was back to his normal size. 
After that, Jack realized that he didn't need to be rich to be happy. He was just happy to be back to his normal size and to have his big house and garden. Jack decided to share his wealth with others and help people in need. From that day on, Jack lived a happy life and never used the magic bow again. The end.
