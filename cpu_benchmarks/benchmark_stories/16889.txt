Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to bake with his mommy. They would make yummy cookies and cakes together. One day, Timmy's mommy said they should make something healthy. Timmy didn't like the sound of that, but he trusted his mommy.
They decided to make a piece of bread with lots of seeds and grains. Timmy helped mix the dough and put it in the oven to bake. He was so excited to try it! When it was ready, they took a piece out and Timmy took a big bite. But it didn't taste good at all. It was dry and hard and not sweet like he was used to.
Timmy was very sad that he didn't like the healthy bread. He wished they had made cookies instead. From that day on, Timmy didn't want to bake anything healthy with his mommy. He just wanted to make sweet treats.
