Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play in the kitchen. They see a big stove. The stove is hot. Mama says, "Do not touch the stove. It can hurt you."
Anna and Ben want to make cookies. They see a bowl, a spoon, and a bag of flour. They open the bag and pour the flour into the bowl. They stir the flour with the spoon. They make a big mess.
Mama comes back to the kitchen. She sees the flour on the floor, on the table, and on the twins. She says, "Oh no! What did you do?" Anna and Ben say, "We make cookies, Mama. We help you."
Mama smiles. She says, "You are very sweet, but you need to clean up first. Here, take this cloth and wipe the flour. Then, wash your hands and face. They are very dirty."
Anna and Ben do what Mama says. They use the cloth to wipe the flour. They go to the sink and turn on the faucet. They wash their hands and face with water and soap. They make bubbles. They have fun.
But they forget to turn off the faucet. The water keeps running. The sink gets full. The water spills over the edge. The floor gets wet. Mama sees the water. She says, "Oh no! Now the floor is wet. Be careful, do not slip. Turn off the faucet, please."
Anna and Ben run to the faucet. They turn it off. They say, "Sorry, Mama. We forget." Mama says, "It's okay. Accidents happen. But next time, be more careful. Water can make things wet and slippery. And do not play with the stove. It can make things hot and burny."
Anna and Ben nod. They say, "We understand, Mama. We love you." Mama says, "I love you too. Now, let's make some real cookies. But first, let's dry the floor." They get a mop and dry the floor. Then, they make some yummy cookies with Mama. They eat the cookies and drink some milk. They are happy.
