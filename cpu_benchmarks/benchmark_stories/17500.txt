Sara and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the yard every day. They had a big ball, a red wagon, and a yellow swing. They shared everything and had fun.
One day, they found something unusual in the yard. It was a shiny rock with many colors. Sara and Ben both wanted the rock. They grabbed it at the same time and pulled hard.
"Let go! It's mine!" Sara shouted.
"No, it's mine! I saw it first!" Ben yelled.
They began to quarrel and tug on the rock. They did not hear their mom calling them for lunch. They did not see the big dog running towards them. The dog liked shiny things too.
The dog barked and jumped on Sara and Ben. He snatched the rock from their hands and ran away. Sara and Ben fell to the ground and looked at each other. They felt scared and sorry.
They hugged and said, "I'm sorry. You can have the rock."
"No, I'm sorry. You can have it."
They got up and ran to their mom. They told her what happened and asked for a sandwich. They decided to play with their ball, their wagon, and their swing instead. They learned that a rock was not worth losing a friend.
