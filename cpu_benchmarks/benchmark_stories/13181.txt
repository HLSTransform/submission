Once upon a time, there was a very cute wagon. Every day it went with its owners, a boy and a girl, to special places. Everywhere the wagon went, it was carried, because the boy and girl wanted to protect it.
One day, the boy and girl took the wagon to the park. They wanted to play in the grass and go down the slide. They had lots of fun, but the girl thought the wagon was a little lonely. She had an idea!
The girl ran back to the wagon and brought out her teddy bear. She put it in the wagon and smiled. Now the wagon had a friend. The boy and the girl played together with the teddy bear and the wagon, pushing it around the park until the sun started to set.
Before the two went home, they hugged their wagon and the teddy bear tightly, knowing they would always protect them on their special adventures.
