Tom and Ben are friends. They like to play baseball in the park. They have a bat, a ball and a glove. They take turns to hit and catch.
One day, a big dog comes to the park. The dog is black and brown. He has sharp teeth and a loud bark. He runs to the ball and picks it up in his mouth. He shakes it and chews it. The ball is terrible now. It has holes and dirt.
Tom and Ben are sad and angry. They want their ball back. They shout at the dog. "Hey, dog! Give us our ball! That is not your toy! That is our baseball!"
The dog does not listen. He growls and runs away with the ball. He goes to a tree and lies down. He puts the ball under his paw. He looks at Tom and Ben with his eyes.
Tom and Ben do not know what to do. They are afraid of the dog. They do not want to fight him. They think of a plan.
They find a stick and a bow. They tie the stick to the bow. They make a noise with the bow. The dog hears the noise. He is curious. He lifts his paw and looks at the bow.
Tom and Ben see their chance. They run to the tree and grab the ball. They run back to the park. They are happy. They have their ball again.
The dog is confused. He does not understand. He looks at the bow. He looks at the tree. He looks at the park. He barks. He is lonely. He wants to play.
