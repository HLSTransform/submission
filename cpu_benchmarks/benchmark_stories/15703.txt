Once there was a big bear called Frank. He was the toughest bear in the woods. One day, Frank had a big nap in a pile of leaves.
When he woke up, Frank noticed something strange. He soon realized that he had shrunk to only one inch tall! He tried to become big again, but all his attempts failed.
Frank looked up and saw a giant, who was amazed by the tiny bear. Frank was scared, but he spoke in a brave voice:
"Please help me! I need to get back to my normal size."
The giant smiled, and said: "Don't worry, I have an idea."
He lifted his giant hand and put Frank on one of his fingers. He then blew a special magic breath on Frank.
Slowly, Frank began to grow and grow back to his normal size. When he was big enough, the giant said:
"You are a tough bear, Frank!"
Frank thanked the giant for his help, and promised that he would never forget this adventure.
