Anna likes to play with her model cars. She has many cars of different colors and sizes. She makes them roll on the floor, on the table, and on the sofa. She pretends they are racing or going on a trip.
One day, Anna's mom tells her to tidy her room. She says there are too many toys everywhere and Anna could trip and hurt herself. Anna does not want to tidy her room. She wants to keep playing with her cars. She thinks her mom is not fun.
Anna decides to hide her cars under the bed. She thinks her mom will not see them there. She puts some books and dolls on the bed to make it look tidy. She hopes her mom will be happy and let her play.
But Anna's mom is not fooled. She sees the bump under the bed and lifts the blanket. She finds all the cars and scolds Anna. She tells her to put them away in the box. She says Anna has to learn to be tidy and respectful.
Anna feels sad and sorry. She knows her mom is right. She loves her cars, but she loves her mom more. She says she is sorry and hugs her mom. She puts her cars in the box and promises to be tidy next time. Her mom smiles and kisses her. She says she loves her and lets her play with one car for a while. Anna is happy and rolls her car on the floor. She thinks her mom is fun.
