Once upon a time, a boy named Timmy was going to a party. He put on his cap and left his house. He walked for a long time until he arrived at the party. 
When Timmy got there, he saw that all the other kids were playing with toys. But Timmy's toy was dull and nobody wanted to play with him. Timmy felt sad and lonely. 
He went to the table where the snacks were and started eating some chips. Another boy came up to him and asked, "Why do you look so sad?" Timmy replied, "Nobody wants to play with me because my toy is dull." 
The other boy said, "I have an idea! Let's play a game where we have to find the hidden cap. Whoever finds it first wins!" Timmy thought it was a great idea and they started playing. Timmy found the cap and won the game! He was happy and made a new friend.
