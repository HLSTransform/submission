Once upon a time, there was a big purple dragon named Puff. Puff loved to fly high in the sky and blow smoke out of his nose. One day, Puff met a little girl named Lily who wanted to learn how to fly like him. Puff decided to teach her how to fly.
Puff showed Lily how to flap her wings and soar through the clouds. Lily was so happy that she could fly just like Puff. They flew together for hours until it was time for Lily to go home. As she was leaving, Puff blew a big cloud of smoke to say goodbye.
Lily went home and told her mom all about her adventure with Puff the dragon. She was so excited that she drew a picture of Puff with his purple scales and big wings. Her mom hung the picture on the fridge so they could remember their fun day with Puff forever.
