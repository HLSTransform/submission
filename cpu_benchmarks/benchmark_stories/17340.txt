Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play together every day. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big puzzle. The puzzle had many pieces and colors. It was fun to solve the puzzle and see the picture.
One day, a new girl came to their class. Her name was Mia. She had long hair and a pretty dress. She also had a new toy. It was a shiny robot that could talk and move. Mia showed her robot to everyone. The other kids were amazed and wanted to play with it.
Lily and Ben felt envious. They wanted to play with the robot too. But Mia said no. She said it was her toy and she did not want to share. She said their puzzle was boring and old. She said they were silly and stupid.
Lily and Ben were sad and angry. They did not like Mia. They did not want to be her friend. They went back to their puzzle and tried to solve it. But they could not. They were too upset. They could not find the right pieces. They could not see the picture.
Then, they heard a loud noise. It was Mia's robot. It had broken. It had fallen from the table and smashed on the floor. Mia was crying. She did not know how to fix it. She did not have any other toys. She was alone.
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They felt sorry for Mia. They knew how it felt to lose a toy. They knew how it felt to be lonely. They decided to do something nice. They took their puzzle and walked to Mia. They said they wanted to help her. They said they wanted to share their puzzle. They said they wanted to be her friends.
Mia was surprised. She did not expect them to be kind. She felt ashamed. She said she was sorry. She said she was rude and mean. She said she wanted to play with them. She said she wanted to solve their puzzle. She said she wanted to be their friends.
Lily and Ben smiled. They forgave Mia. They gave her some pieces. They showed her the picture. They solved the puzzle together. They had fun. They became friends. They learned to share and care. They were happy.
