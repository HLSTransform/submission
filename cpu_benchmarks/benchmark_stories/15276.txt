Once upon a time, there was a little boy who went on a great big adventure. He was looking for something special, something he had never seen before. He looked and looked, but he couldn't find it. Finally, one day, he saw something hidden under the leaves. He bent down and picked it up. It was a peanut! He knew it had been hidden there all along. He was so excited and ran home to show his mom what he had found. He showed her the peanut and told her all about his adventure.She was so proud of him and they both enjoyed a big hug. The little boy was happy because he had found something special and enjoyed sharing it with his mom.
