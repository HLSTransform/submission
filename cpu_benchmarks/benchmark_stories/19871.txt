Once upon a time, there was a big jungle where many animals lived. One day, a group of animals decided to make a team to explore the jungle. They wanted to see all the wild animals and plants. They stood together and started their journey.
As they walked, they saw many wild animals like lions, tigers and monkeys. They also saw tall trees and colorful flowers. The team was very happy to see all these things together. They stood there for a while and enjoyed the view.
After exploring for a long time, the team got tired and decided to go back home. They stood together one last time and said goodbye to the jungle. They promised to come back soon and explore more. And with that, they left the jungle and went back to their homes.
