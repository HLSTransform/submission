Once upon a time there was a farmer. He was a very hard worker and he cared for the animals on his farm. Every morning, he would bow down to the animals and say good morning. He was very friendly and the animals loved him.
One morning the farmer noticed that the barn was not available to give the animals protection from the wind. He knew that the animals needed a place to stay warm and so he had to find a different solution. He got to work and began building a new barn.
At the end of the day, the farmer had finished the barn and he was very proud. He bowed down to the barn and thanked it for the protection it provided. The animals were thrilled to have a place to stay warm and dry.
The farmer and the animals lived happily ever after in the new barn. They thanked the farmer for always being available to care and protect them. Every morning, he would bow down to them to show his appreciation and the animals would bow back to him.
