Once upon a time there was a man. He was big and strong. He liked to have fun. One day he found a new swing. He was so excited! He couldn't wait to swing on it.
The man sat down in the swing and started to push himself. He went higher and higher. He held his arms out and shouted "Whee!" He was having so much fun!
The man went so high he almost hit the leaves of the tall trees. He went even higher and higher. Finally, he came back down to the ground.
The man smiled and said, "That was great!" He was so happy with his new swing. He couldn't wait to do it again!
