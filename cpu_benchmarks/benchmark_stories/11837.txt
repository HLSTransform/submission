Once there was a princess who lived in a castle. Her chamber was a very dark, quiet place. One day, the princess was very scared because she heard a noise coming from her chamber. She was afraid to go inside by herself.
The King of the castle wanted to help. He led the princess to the chamber and said he would not leave until she was brave enough to go in. The King said, "I will allow you to go in the chamber if you promise to be safe." The princess was very brave and nodded her head yes.
She carefully opened the door and slowly stepped into the dark chamber. To her surprise, there was nothing scary in the chamber. She felt relieved, and she thanked the King for allowing her to go inside.
The Princess and King then opened the windows and let the light into the chamber. Soon it was a bright and happy place once again. The princess was very happy and said she was no longer scared of the dark.
