Once there was a little girl named Bea who liked to go for walks in the woods. On one of her walks she found something special, a stick. She picked it up and held it tightly. Suddenly the stick started to bite her! Bea was surprised and scared.
"What's wrong stick?" said Bea. "Why are you biting me?"
The stick stayed silent. So, Bea tried to put it down on the ground, but it wouldn't let go. Finally, she put it in her pocket and continued on her walk.
Bea went further into the woods and soon came to an empty lake. She could see the stick in her pocket, and it started to move around. Bea opened up her pocket to see what was going on, and found the stick swimming around in the lake!
Bea was so happy to see her stick swimming around in the lake. She got down on her knees and watched it move around, until the stick was empty again. 
Bea took the stick out of the lake, waved goodbye and went back home. She loved her stick, and never went for a walk without it from that day on.
