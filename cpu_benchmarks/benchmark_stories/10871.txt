Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the park with her mom and dad. They would swing and slide and play together. One day, they went to a new park they had never been to before. It was very big and had lots of trees and flowers.
As they played, Lily's mom noticed some nice flowers growing near the exit of the park. She told Lily they would gather some on their way out. Lily was excited to help. They played for a while longer and then it was time to go. As they walked towards the exit, Lily remembered the flowers. She ran over to the spot where her mom had seen them, but they were gone!
Lily was sad, but her mom had a surprise for her. She had gathered some flowers earlier and hidden them in her bag. Lily was so happy and hugged her mom tightly. From then on, they always gathered flowers before they left the park.
