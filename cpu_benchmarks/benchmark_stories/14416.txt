Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the forest near her house. One day, she met a bird that could whistle very well. 
"Wow, you can whistle so beautifully!" exclaimed Lily. 
"Yes, I can," replied the bird. "Would you like to learn how to whistle too?" 
Lily was very excited and said, "Yes, please!" 
The bird taught Lily how to whistle and they had a lot of fun together. After a while, the bird said, "I have to go now, but I'll be back tomorrow. Will you be available to play with me again?" 
Lily happily replied, "Yes, I will be available! Thank you for teaching me how to whistle!" 
From that day on, Lily and the bird became great friends and would often play together in the forest, whistling and singing songs.
