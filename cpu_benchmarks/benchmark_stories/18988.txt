One day, a tall giraffe named Gerry was walking in the forest. He saw a little mouse named Molly. Molly was trying to reach a cord hanging from a tree. She wanted to play with it, but it was too high for her.
Gerry asked, "Do you need help?" Molly said, "Yes, please. Can you help me get the cord?" Gerry was happy to help. He used his long neck to reach the cord and gave it to Molly.
Molly was very thankful for Gerry's help. They played with the cord together and became good friends. They requested other animals to join them, and they all had a fun day in the forest.
