Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She was three years old and loved to take naps. Every day, Sarah would take her journal and sneak away to her special nap spot. 
At the nap spot, Sarah would find a cushion to lie on and write in her special journal. In the journal, she wrote about all the unknown things she saw when she was napping. She wrote about birds flying, jumping bunnies and even glowing stars. 
Sarah loved writing in her journal so much, she chose to take a nap there every day she could. As she fell asleep, she would think of all the exciting and unknown things that surrounded her. 
The end.
