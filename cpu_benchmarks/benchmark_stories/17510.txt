Lily was a very independent girl. She liked to do things by herself, like dressing up, reading books, and playing with her toys. She did not like to share or ask for help. She wanted to be big and strong.
One day, Lily's mom made beef for lunch. Lily loved beef. It was her favorite food. She wanted to eat it all by herself. She did not want to give any to her little brother, Max. Max was only two years old. He liked to copy Lily and follow her around. He also liked beef.
When Lily saw the beef on the table, she ran to get a big piece. She put it on her plate and started to eat. She did not say thank you to her mom. She did not look at Max. She just ate and ate.
Max saw Lily eating the beef. He wanted some too. He walked to the table and reached for a piece. But Lily saw him and shouted, "No, Max! This is my beef! You can't have it! Go away!"
Max was sad and scared. He started to cry. He did not understand why Lily was so mean. He just wanted to eat with her. He ran to his mom and hugged her.
Lily's mom heard the noise and saw what happened. She was not happy with Lily. She said, "Lily, that was not nice. You should share your food with your brother. He is hungry too. And you should say thank you when I give you something. That is polite. How would you feel if Max did not share with you or say thank you to you?"
Lily thought for a moment. She realized that she was wrong. She felt sorry for Max. She did not want to make him cry. She wanted to be a good sister. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, Max. I was selfish. I will share my beef with you. And thank you, mom, for making it. It is very yummy."
Lily's mom smiled and said, "That's good, Lily. I'm proud of you. Sharing is caring. And saying thank you is kind. Come, let's eat together."
Lily and Max hugged and sat down at the table. They ate the beef and talked and laughed. They were happy. Lily learned to be more independent, but also more generous and grateful.
