Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color on paper with her crayons. One day, Lily was playing in the park with her friends when she found a piece of paper on the ground. She thought it was a treasure and picked it up. But when she looked at it, she saw something disgusting on it. It was a picture of a bug that made her feel sick.
Lily tried to throw the paper away, but her friends stopped her and said it was a secret message. They wanted to find out who drew the bug and why they did it. So, they went on a hunt to find the person who left the paper. They searched everywhere, but they couldn't find anyone.
Days went by, and Lily started feeling sick. She had caught a bug from the paper that made her very ill. She had to stay in bed for many days and couldn't play with her friends. Lily learned a lesson to never pick up disgusting things and to tell an adult if she finds something strange.
