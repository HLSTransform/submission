Once upon a time, there was a little boy. His name was Jim. Jim was very happy, but he was scared too. But one day Jim found something to make him feel brave. He found a hug. 
The hug came from a steam. It was not hot like fire, but a gentle steam. It was like a warm hug. It made Jim feel safe and happy. 
But the steam was fragile. Jim had to be very careful so it wouldn't break. He gave it a gentle hug, and the steam hugged him back. 
From then on, Jim was no longer afraid. He felt brave and he knew that the hug would always be there, waiting for him.
