Once upon a time there was a little boat. It wanted to explore the world, so it sped away. It moved along very fast, but it didn't feel free. Despite going as fast as it could, it never seemed to get anywhere.
One day, the little boat had an idea. It realized it needed something to slow it down and help it stay safe on its journey. The boat decided it should get an anchor!
The anchor was dropped into the water and the boat felt secure. Now the boat could explore the world, but at a slower, safer speed. Whenever it needed to take a break and recharge, the anchor was there to keep the boat in one place.
The little boat was still creative and vivacious. It explored and discovered many new things, as it travelled and experienced life at a slower pace.
The moral of this story is to stay creative while being mindful of your own safety. Enjoy exploring, but always make sure you have a safe anchor to hold you back.
