Lucy was always searching. She never stopped looking for new and interesting things. One day she was searching around the house when she saw something in the bathroom. It was a bottle of lotion. It was bright and shiny, so she decided to take it.
She picked up the bottle and asked her mom, "What's this?" Her mom looked at the bottle and said, "Oh, that's lotion. It's like cream that we put on our skin to make it feel soft and smooth." Lucy was so excited. She opened up the lid and sniffed the lotion. It had a pleasant, calming smell.
"Can I put this on?" Lucy asked her mom. Her mom smiled and said, "Sure, you can put some on, but only a tiny bit." Lucy put a tiny drop of lotion on her hands. It felt wonderful. She smelled the calming scent and rubbed her hands together. Everything was so peaceful and relaxing.
Lucy had found something new and exciting on her search. She was so happy that she had discovered something so wonderful. From now on, she would always be searching for something new.
