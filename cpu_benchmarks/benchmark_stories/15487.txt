Nina was a girl with a broken hat. She liked to push her toys around her room. One day, when she was pushing her toys, her broken hat got stuck on the floor. She tried and tried, but she could not push the hat off the floor.
Then, something special happened. Nina's mom came into the room and saw the hat on the floor. She bent down and with a big push, the hat came off the floor. Nina was so happy! She smiled and hugged her mom.
From then on, Nina was extra careful with her broken hat. She never pushed it around and was gentle with it. She was so glad that her mom was there to help her with the hat.
