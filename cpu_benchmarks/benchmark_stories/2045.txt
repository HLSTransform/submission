Once upon a time, there was a big, strong horse named Brownie. Brownie loved to run and play in the fields all day long. One day, Brownie met a little duck named Ducky. Ducky was lost and didn't know how to find her way back home. Brownie knew he had to help Ducky, so he led her back to her family.
As they were walking, Brownie noticed that Ducky was very tired and weak. He asked her if she had eaten anything, and Ducky said no. Brownie knew he had to do something to help her. He went to the farm and found a whip of hay. He brought it back to Ducky and she ate it all up.
After that day, Brownie and Ducky became the best of friends. Brownie learned that it was important to help others, even if they were different from him. And Ducky learned that sometimes, the strongest friends are the ones who are the most caring and kind.
