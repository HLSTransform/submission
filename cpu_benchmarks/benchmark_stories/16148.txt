Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved to listen. He could often be seen tilting his head and cupping his ears.
One day, the boy was walking in the woods and he heard something. He stopped and listened very carefully. Suddenly he heard a voice coming from a deep, dark well! He listened to the voice carefully and it said "Come find me!"
The little boy was so excited so he ran to the well. When he arrived, he peered inside but he could not see the voice. He shouted down into the well and listened carefully. Suddenly, he heard the voice respond! The voice was singing a happy song and it was so beautiful. The boy stood and listened for a long time. 
When he was happy again, the boy thanked the voice and said goodbye. Then, he ran home with a smile on his face. From that day on, he always stopped to listen when he was walking in the woods.
