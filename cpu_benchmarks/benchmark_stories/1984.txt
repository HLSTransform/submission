It was a sunny morning and Jake was playing outside with his toy rake. He loved to use the rake to move the leaves around the garden, like a little farmer.
Suddenly, his dad came out to the garden and he had a big smile on his face.
"Hey, Jake! We have an important job to do", his dad said.
Jake was very excited. What was the important job?
His dad explained. "You need to help me rake all of the leaves in the garden. This is a very important job!"
So Jake and his dad got to work. They raked and raked and it wasn't long before all of the leaves had been collected. 
When they were finished, Jake was feeling very tired.
"That was hard work," he said.
His dad nodded and said, "Yes, it was! Why don't you have a nap now to rest up?"
So that is what Jake did. He had a nap and felt much better afterwards.
