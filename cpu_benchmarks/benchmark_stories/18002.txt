Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and watch cartoons all day. He never wanted to do his homework or help his mom with chores. 
One day, Timmy's mom told him that he wasn't allowed to watch TV until he finished his homework and cleaned his room. Timmy was shocked! He had never heard his mom say that before. 
At first, Timmy thought it was weird that he had to do work before he could have fun. But then he realized that his mom was trying to teach him a lesson. She wanted him to learn that sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do in order to enjoy the things we like. 
So, Timmy put down his toys and got to work. He finished his homework and cleaned his room. And when he was done, he felt proud of himself. He had learned that sometimes we need someone to allow us to do the right thing, even if it's hard.
