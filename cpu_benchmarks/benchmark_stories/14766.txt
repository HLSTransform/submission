Lily liked to write. She wrote on paper, on walls, on books, on anything she could find. She wrote her name, she wrote shapes, she wrote letters. She was very proud of her writing.
One day, she saw a big crane outside her window. It was lifting heavy things and making loud noises. Lily wanted to write on the crane. She thought it would look charming. She took her crayons and ran outside.
She climbed on the crane and started to write. She wrote LILY in big letters. She wrote a heart and a star. She wrote a smiley face. She was having fun.
But then, the crane driver saw her. He was angry. He shouted at her to get down. He said she was naughty and dangerous. He said she ruined his crane. He called her mom.
Lily's mom came and took her away. She was sad and scared. She said sorry to the crane driver. She said sorry to her mom. She learned that she should not write on things that are not hers. She learned that writing is good, but only in the right place. She learned to be careful and respectful.
