Sara and Ben were adventurous kids. They liked to play outside and explore new places. One day, they found a big hole in the ground. They wondered what was inside.
"Maybe there is treasure in there," Sara said. "Let's go and see."
They climbed down the hole. It was dark and cold. They used a flashlight to look around. They saw shiny things and old things. They were excited.
"Look, Ben, a necklace!" Sara said. She picked up a silver chain with a blue stone. "It's so pretty. I want to keep it."
But then they heard a loud roar. A big bear came out of a corner. It was angry. It saw the kids and the necklace. It wanted the necklace. It growled and ran towards them.
"Freeze!" Ben said. He was scared. He hoped the bear would stop. But the bear did not stop. It came closer and closer.
Sara and Ben did not freeze. They ran. They ran back to the hole. They climbed up as fast as they could. They left the necklace behind. They did not care about the treasure anymore. They only wanted to be safe.
They reached the top of the hole. They saw the sun and the grass. They felt the warm air. They were happy. They hugged each other.
"That was too scary," Sara said. "Let's never go there again."
"OK," Ben said. "Let's go home and have some cookies."
They walked away from the hole. They did not look back. They learned a lesson. Sometimes, being adventurous can be dangerous.
