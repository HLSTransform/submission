One day, in the spring, Tom was feeling very enthusiastic. He skipped around and laughed as he smelled the fresh air. Tom loved being outside in the sunshine.
He saw a friend off in the distance and ran over to say hello. His friend was also feeling very enthusiastic and they ran together around the garden with their arms stretched out wide. They laughed and spun around, feeling so much joy.
At one point, they stopped and looked around. The sky was a brilliant blue and the flowers were in full bloom; it was a beautiful spring day. Tom was filled with love for everything around him.
After a while, Tom said goodbye to his friend and ran off, continuing to enjoy his special spring day. He raced through the fields, twirling around with enthusiasm. He loved being outside in the gorgeous sunshine and was determined to make the most of it.
