Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a box full of cubes. The cubes were red, blue, green, and yellow. Lily loved to play with them and build towers.
One day, Lily's friend came over to play. They decided to sort the cubes by color. Lily was patient as they worked together to put each cube in the right group. They had so much fun!
After they finished sorting the cubes, they built a big tower with all the red cubes. It was so tall! Lily's friend was amazed. They played with the cubes all day and had a great time.
