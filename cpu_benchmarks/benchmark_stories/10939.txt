Once upon a time, in a cold land, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim lived in an igloo with his family. The igloo was made of ice and snow. It was a small and cozy home.
One day, Tim saw a poor bird outside his igloo. The bird was cold and hungry. Tim wanted to help the bird. So, he filled a small bowl with food for the bird. The bird was very happy and ate all the food.
Tim and the bird became good friends. They played together every day. The bird would sing songs for Tim, and Tim would fill the bird's bowl with food. They were both very happy, and the igloo was always filled with love and laughter.
