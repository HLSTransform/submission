Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved learning. One day, her parents introduced her to a book that was filled with exciting words. As the little girl opened the book, she saw the word ‘spell’. She said it out loud and realized it was hard to say. 
The little girl became very frustrated. She tried to spell it out a few times, but she couldn’t get it right. She kept trying and eventually, she was able to spell it!
The little girl was so excited. She proudly showed her parents that she was able to spell ‘spell’. Soon, she was learning more words and she was feeling more confident with reading and writing. 
The end.
