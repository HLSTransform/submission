Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was all alone. She was very lonely, and she always felt sad. One day, she went outside and saw a big tree with many branches. She smiled, and as she looked closer, she saw something very surprising.
A little bird was sitting on a branch, and it was frowning. The girl wondered why the bird was looking so sad. She wished she could help it, but she didn't know what to do. So she just looked at the bird and tried to understand why it was so unhappy.
Then, the bird suddenly flew away. The little girl was very sad, and her brow scrunched up in a frown. She felt like she didn't have enough time to help the bird, and she was very lonely without it.
But then, a few days later, the girl went back to the tree and saw the little bird again. This time it was smiling, and the girl couldn't help but smile too. She was happy that the bird was happy, and she knew that it would never be lonely again.
