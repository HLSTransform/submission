Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the zoo with his mom and dad. One day, they went to see the elephants. Timmy saw a big elephant and he pointed at it. "Mommy, look at the big elephant!" he said.
Suddenly, the elephant started acting crazy and ran around its enclosure. Timmy was scared and held onto his mom's hand tightly. "What's happening?" he asked. 
His dad explained that sometimes animals get excited and do silly things. Timmy felt better and continued to watch the elephant, but he made sure to stay far away from the crazy elephant.
