Once upon a time there was a little boy called Jake. Jake loved to read. He liked to read books about jewelry and Adventure.
One day Jake went to the library and picked out a book about jewelry. The cover of the book was shiny and had lots of pretty pictures of jewelry. Jake was so excited about the book that he started to read it right away.
But Jake was not careful and he read the book too loud. Someone heard him and came over to see what he was reading. It was the librarian! She said to Jake, "You need to read quietly, or you'll disturb everyone else in the library."
Jake nodded and said he was sorry. He went back to reading his book - only this time he was quiet! Jake enjoyed reading and found out lots of really interesting things about jewelry. 
The End.
