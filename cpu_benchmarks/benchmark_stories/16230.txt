Once upon a time there was a sailor. He was wearing a brown coat and he had a brown hat. One day, he was walking on the beach and he saw a tiny creature. He shouted "Hello! What are you?
The creature replied. "I'm a seagull! What are you?"
The sailor said, "I'm a sailor. I sail the seas looking for adventure!"
The seagull was happy to hear this and shouted "Wow! That sounds exciting!"
The sailor said "Would you like to come sailing with me?"
The seagull replied "Yes! I'd love to!"
So the sailor and the seagull sailed away into the sunset. They had lots of fun and they made many new friends. They were very happy.
