Once upon a time, there was a lazy bird named Bob. Bob liked to sleep all day in his nest. One day, his friend, a squirrel named Sam, came to visit him.
"Bob, will you help me unpack my nuts?" Sam asked. "I have so many and I need help."
Bob yawned and said, "Okay, Sam. I will help you." So, Bob and Sam went to Sam's tree and started to unpack the nuts.
As they unpacked the nuts, they talked and laughed. They had a lot of fun together. After they finished, they went back to Bob's nest and took a nap. They were very happy to be friends.
