Sara and Tom like to play in the big park. They run and jump and slide and swing. They have fun with their friends and their toys. But sometimes they get bored of the same games. They want to try something new and unusual.
One day, they see a big gray door in the park. It is behind some trees and bushes. They are curious. They want to know what is behind the door. They go closer and closer. They see a lock on the door. They look for a key. They find a key under a rock. They are happy. They think they can open the door.
They put the key in the lock and turn it. The lock makes a click sound. The door opens a little bit. They push the door more and more. They see a dark and scary place behind the door. They hear strange noises and see weird shapes. They are afraid. They want to go back to the park. They try to close the door. But the door is stuck. They cannot move it. They are trapped. They cry and scream for help.
But no one hears them. No one knows they are there. They are alone in the dark and scary place. They wish they never opened the door. They wish they never tried something new and unusual. They wish they stayed in the park and played with their friends and their toys. They wish they were safe and happy.
