Once upon a time there was a bell. Every day it would ring loud and clear. Everyone who heard it smiled and danced.
One day a little boy found a pin. He was so excited that he did not see the broken part. He picked it up, and ran to the bell with the pin.
He carefully put the pin in the bell and then he stepped back to watch the magic. He watched and waited, and then, at last, the bell began to ring.
The little boy smiled and danced. He was so happy that he had made the bell ring. And so everyone in the village could enjoy the beautiful sound of the bell.
