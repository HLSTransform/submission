Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Annabel. She was three years old and very curious. Every day she opened drawers to explore, hoping to find something new and exciting.
Today, Annabel opened a drawer and found a big, pink eraser. She was so happy she smiled from ear-to-ear and picked it up carefully.
Annabel held the eraser gently in her little hands and rubbed it against her cheek. She was amazed by how soft and smooth it was.
Annabel kept the eraser close to her and took it everywhere she went. She never wanted to be without it. Whenever she felt scared or lonely, Annabel just held the gentle eraser and felt better.
The end.
