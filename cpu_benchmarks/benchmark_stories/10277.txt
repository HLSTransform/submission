Once upon a time, there was a princess who wore a pretty veil on her head. She was very sad and troubled because she lost her favorite toy. She searched everywhere but couldn't find it. 
One day, she heard a scream coming from the garden. She went outside and saw her toy in the hands of a naughty monkey. The monkey was screaming and jumping around with the toy. 
The princess felt happy and relieved to find her toy, but also scared of the monkey's screams. She slowly approached the monkey and gently took the toy back. From that day on, she made sure to keep her toy safe and never let it out of her sight.
