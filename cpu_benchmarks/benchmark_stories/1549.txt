Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ponies and always wanted one. One day, her parents surprised her with a beautiful pony named Daisy. Lily was so happy and welcomed Daisy with open arms.
But one day, Lily woke up to a gloomy day. She didn't feel happy and didn't want to play with Daisy. Daisy was sad and didn't understand why Lily didn't want to play. Lily's mom noticed how sad Daisy was and asked Lily what was wrong. Lily told her mom that she was feeling sad and didn't want to play.
Her mom explained to Lily that sometimes we have bad days, but it's important to still be kind and welcoming to others. Lily realized that she had been ignoring Daisy and not being kind. She went outside and welcomed Daisy back with open arms. From that day on, Lily learned that even on gloomy days, it's important to be kind and welcoming to others.
