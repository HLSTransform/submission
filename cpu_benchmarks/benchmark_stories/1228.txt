Once upon a time, a little bird named Tweety lived in a tree. One day, Tweety met a friendly squirrel named Nutty. Nutty said, "Hi Tweety, do you want to make a home together?"
Tweety said, "Yes, let's make a gentle home in this tree." They worked hard and made a cozy home with soft leaves and twigs.
One day, a big storm came and destroyed their home. Tweety and Nutty were sad and had to find a new home. They learned that even when you work hard, bad things can happen sometimes.
The moral of the story is that we should be kind to others and help them when they need it, because we never know when we might need help ourselves.
