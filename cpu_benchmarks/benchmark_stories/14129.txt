One day, Jack was bored and looking for something to do. He wanted to organize his room and make it neat so he started to clean. He picked up all his toys and put them in the right places. Everywhere he chose was nice and tidy. He made sure to clean up the dirty areas first, working until they were sparkly and perfect.
After the room was organized, Jack decided to try something new. He wanted to see what different tastes were like, so he got out some fruits and vegetables from the kitchen. He tried everything from sweet apples to sour lemons. Jack really liked the different flavors and felt happy that he tried something new. 
When all the tastes were gone, Jack realized he was tired and needed to rest. He put everything away and returned the kitchen to how he found it. With his room clean and all the tastes explored, Jack slept peacefully. Everything was in the right place and Jack felt happy and safe.
