Tom was a clever boy. He loved to ride his scooter. Every morning, he would slip on his helmet and ride around the park.
Tom was getting quite good at riding his scooter. He liked to make it slip around corners. But one day, he went too fast and lost his balance. Tom slipped from his scooter and fell on the ground.
He started to cry, but soon noticed something shiny. It was the key to his scooter! Tom was so relieved and happily put the key back in the scooter.
Tom climbed back on the scooter and started riding again. He remembered to not go too fast this time. He felt relieved and clever for having remembered the key.
