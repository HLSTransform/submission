Once upon a time, there was a little mouse who wanted some cheese. He went to the store to order some cheese, but the store was a big maze. The little mouse got lost in the maze and couldn't find his way out.
As he walked around the maze, he saw a big cat who wanted to eat him. The little mouse was scared and didn't know what to do. He kept walking and walking until he found a piece of cheese.
But then, the big cat saw the little mouse with the cheese and wanted to take it from him. The little mouse didn't want to give the cheese away, so he had to run away from the big cat. He ran and ran until he found his way out of the maze and went home with his cheese. The end.
