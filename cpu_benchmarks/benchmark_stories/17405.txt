Tom and Lily were playing outside in the park. They liked to run, jump and slide on the grass. But then the sky became dark and they heard a loud boom. It was going to rain!
"Quick, we have to go home!" Lily said to Tom. "Or we will get wet and cold!"
Tom nodded and grabbed his jacket. He saw that Lily had left hers on the bench. He ran to get it and put it on her shoulders.
"Thank you, Tom!" Lily said. "You are a good friend."
They started to walk home, but the rain came faster and harder. They saw a big puddle on the road. Lily wanted to jump in it, but Tom stopped her.
"No, Lily, we have to stay dry!" Tom said. "Or we will get sick!"
Lily pouted, but she listened to Tom. He held her hand and they crossed the road. They saw their mom waiting for them at the door. She smiled and opened her arms.
"Come here, my little ones!" she said. "You are so brave and smart!"
She hugged them and carried them inside. She gave them warm milk and cookies. They told her about their adventure in the park. She kissed them and said she was proud of them.
Tom and Lily felt happy and cozy. They had fun, they helped each other, and they came home dry. They loved their mom and each other. They were a good team.
