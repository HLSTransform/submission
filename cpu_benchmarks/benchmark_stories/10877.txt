Once upon a time, there was a big park with lots of trees and flowers. In the middle of the park, there was a statue of a cute puppy. The puppy was so adorable that everyone who saw it smiled. 
One day, a little girl named Lily came to the park with her mom. When she saw the statue, she ran towards it and hugged it tightly. She loved the puppy so much that she pretended it was her own pet. 
Lily's mom took a picture of her with the statue and said, "Look how happy you are, Lily! The statue must be very special to make you feel that way." Lily replied, "Yes, the puppy is my friend. It can't move or play, but it can always be here with me." 
From that day on, Lily visited the park every week to see her adorable statue friend. She knew it would always be there, just like a true friend should be.
