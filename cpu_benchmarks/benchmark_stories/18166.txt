Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She had a pretty curtain in her room. The curtain was pink and had flowers on it. Sally liked to play hide and seek behind the curtain.
One day, Sally found a fake toy snake. She thought it would be fun to play a trick on her brother, Tom. Sally put the fake snake on the floor and went to hide behind the curtain. She called Tom to come to her room.
Tom walked into the room and saw the snake. He was scared at first, but then he saw the snake was fake. He laughed and said, "Silly Sally, you can't trick me!" Sally came out from behind the curtain and they both laughed. From that day on, Sally and Tom had lots of fun leading each other on adventures and playing tricks with the fake snake.
