Once upon a time, there was a bird. The bird lived in an ancient tree. The tree was very big and had many branches. The bird had a nest on one of the branches. The nest was made of sticks and leaves.
One day, a big wind came and blew the nest out of the tree. The bird was very sad. It didn't know what to do. It couldn't carry the nest because it was too heavy. 
Then, a kind rabbit saw the bird and asked what was wrong. The bird told the rabbit about the nest. The rabbit said it could help. It carried the nest back up to the tree and put it back on the branch. The bird was very happy and thanked the rabbit. From that day on, the bird and the rabbit were good friends.
