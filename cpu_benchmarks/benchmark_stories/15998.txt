Once upon a time, there was a brown piece of fabric. It was so big that it could cover the whole house. It was so soft and comfortable that the whole family loved it.
Two siblings, Sara and Tim, were playing in their family's livingroom. Sara held a brown piece in her hands and was very excited. She said to Tim, "Look, brother! I wrap this piece around my body and look like a superhero!"
Tim smiled and replied, "Let me do it too!" He grabbed the brown piece and quickly wrapped it around his body. He started running around the house and imagined he could fly.
Sara laughed. She said, "Now, we both can be superheroes!" The two of them ran around the house, pretending to be superheroes and playing with the brown piece.
