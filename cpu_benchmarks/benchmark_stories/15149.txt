Mum and Dad had something special planned for Johnny. It was a surprise! They drove him to a special place with a big house on the top of the hill. Johnny said, “What’s that? I don’t know.” Mum and Dad smiled. 
When they got to the house, it was hot. They all took off their shoes and went inside. Johnny was so excited. He saw swings, a big tree and a big puddle of water that was cool and sparkly in the sun.
Mum and Dad said, “Johnny, you can play here all day. We will be right here so you don’t have to worry.” Johnny couldn’t believe it! He was so happy.
But then, they all heard a loud noise. It was the other kids. They were making so much noise and they were splashing in the water. Johnny didn’t know what to do! He was so surprised and he didn’t know what to think. 
Mum and Dad said “It’s okay Johnny. They’re your friends and you can play with them.” So Johnny played with his friends and he had lots of fun. He knew that day was still super hot but it was also cool surprise from his mum and dad.
