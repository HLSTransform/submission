Once there was a small girl named Sarah. She was only three years old and very curious. She loved to see new things, and explore her world. One day Sarah was walking in the park with her mother. As she walked, she noticed something strange.
"Look Mommy, a pole!" said Sarah, pointing ahead of her.
Mommy looked and smiled. "Yes, that is a pole," she said.
Then Sarah saw something even more interesting. There was a strange light coming from the pole. She had never seen anything like it before.
"Mommy, what is that light?"
"That is the result of something called mixing," Mommy said. "People mix together different colors of light and make this special kind of light."
Sarah was very excited. She had learned something new. Sarah kept walking and exploring the park with her mom, but from then on, every time she saw a pole with a special light, she would remember what Mommy said and smile.
