John was very restless. He wanted to find something to do and create an adventure. So, John decided to go find tuna. He grabbed his lunch bag and set off on his search.
John soon came across a lake near his house. As he looked across the lake, he saw something shiny and silver. He saw a huge tuna swimming around in the lake. 
John dashed across the lake and scooped the tuna in his lunch bag. He was so excited to show his parents the tuna he found. 
But before he could bring it back home he heard a soft growling coming from behind him. He turned around to see a bear! The bear was standing right in front of him, ready to use its sharp claws.
John dropped the tuna and ran, but it was too late. The bear caught up with him and he was never seen again. 
John's parents were devastated by the news. They had a feeling something bad would happen when John was so restless. Unfortunately, their fears came true.
