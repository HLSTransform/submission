Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She had an empty box but she could not decide what to do with it.
One day, she asked her mom, “What should I do with this empty box?”. Her mom looked thoughtful and then suggested, “Let’s have a look. Maybe you can use it to do something special?” 
The little girl thought and then had an idea - she could use it to make a special home for her special toy. She looked inside and out and then smiled.
The little girl got some paint and pencils to decorate the box and brought in some pillows and blankets to make it comfy. Then, she put her favourite toy in the box and made it nice and warm.
The little girl was very happy with her new home for her toy. She smiled and said, “Thank you, Mom. I love my new look!”.
