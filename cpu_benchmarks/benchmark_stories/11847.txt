Molly and her mommy were walking in the park. They looked up and saw the sun. It was a beautiful day.
Molly felt excited. She saw a tree and said, "Mommy, I need to shoot the sun!" Molly grabbed a stick and pretended it was a gun. She pointed the stick towards the sun and made shooting sounds.
Her mommy laughed. She said, "Molly, you can't actually shoot the sun! That's okay, though. You can pretend!"
Molly smiled and said, "I like pretend!" Together, they watched the sun. It was a beautiful sight.
Molly and her mommy stayed at the park for a long time, just watching the sun. When it started to get dark, Molly said goodbye to the sun and thanked it for a beautiful day.
