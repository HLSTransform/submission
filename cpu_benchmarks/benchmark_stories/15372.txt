Mary was a very independent girl. She was already learning to sign and she wanted to go to school to learn more.
Mary knew that she had to show that she was ready to learn more. So one day, she stood in front of her house and signed to her mom. She wanted her mom to know that she was ready for school. 
Her mom was very proud of Mary. She knew that Mary was a smart, independent girl. So she got Mary a school bag and an outfit for school. 
The next day, Mary was ready to go to school. She waved goodbye to her mom as she stepped inside the school. Mary was a bit nervous but she was also excited to learn new things.
Mary was a little independent, but she was brave too. She knew she was ready for school and she was ready to learn more.
