Once upon a time, there was a nice boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy's mom said it was time to bathe. Timmy didn't want to stop playing, but he knew he had to be clean.
After his bath, Timmy went outside to play again. He found a long stick that looked like a spear. He pretended to be a brave knight and fought off the dragons. Timmy had so much fun playing with his spear and imagining he was a hero.
When it was time for bed, Timmy cuddled up with his favorite stuffed animal and fell asleep. He dreamed of being a brave knight and saving the day with his trusty spear.
