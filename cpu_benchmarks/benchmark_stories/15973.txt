Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toys, but he was very sad because he had no friends to play with. One day, he saw a big building with lots of children playing inside. Timmy wanted to go inside and play too, but he was too scared.
He sat outside the building and watched the children play. Suddenly, a little girl came up to him and asked why he was sad. Timmy replied that he had no friends to play with. The little girl smiled and said she would be his friend.
Timmy was very happy and played with his new friend all day. They had so much fun together and Timmy felt calm and happy. He was so glad that he had replied to the little girl and made a new friend.
