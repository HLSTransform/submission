Sam and Ben liked to play on the beach. They made sand castles and dug holes. They looked for shells and crabs. They had fun in the sun.
But they had to be careful of the tide. The tide was the water that came and went. Sometimes the water was far away and they had more sand to play on. Sometimes the water was close and they had less sand to play on. Sometimes the water came very fast and they had to run away.
One day, they saw a big boat on the water. It was red and white and had a flag. They wanted to see it better. They walked towards the water, but they did not notice the tide. The tide was coming in and it was coming fast.
They got closer and closer to the boat, but they did not hear their mom calling them. She saw the tide and she was worried. She ran after them, but she was too far away.
Then, they saw something else on the water. It was a big, round, yellow thing. It was a lifebuoy. It was useful for people who fell in the water. It had a rope that was tied to the boat. The boat was throwing it to them.
They grabbed the lifebuoy and held on to the rope. The boat pulled them in. They were safe. They met the people on the boat. They were nice and gave them cookies and juice. They told them to always watch the tide and listen to their mom.
Their mom came on the boat and hugged them. She was happy and relieved. She thanked the people on the boat. They took them back to the beach. They learned their lesson. They never went too close to the water again. They still played on the sand, but they always watched the tide.
