Once upon a time, there was a big, red truck. The truck was very strong and loved to play in the dirt. One day, the truck was driving around and accidentally drove on a pretty flower. The flower was sad and the truck felt bad. 
To make it up to the flower, the truck decided to plant a new one. The truck dug a hole in the ground and put a new flower in it. The flower was grateful to the truck and thanked it with a smile. 
But then, a big storm came and the wind was very strong. The wind blew so hard that it destroyed the flower and the truck was sad again. But the truck knew what to do. It went back to the store and bought more flowers to plant. The truck was happy again because it knew it could always make things better.
