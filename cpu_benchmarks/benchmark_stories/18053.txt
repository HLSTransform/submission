Once upon a time, there was a yellow bird named Sunny who lived in a big city. One day, Sunny was flying around when he saw a little boy crying on the sidewalk.
"What's wrong?" asked Sunny.
"I lost my toy car," said the boy. "It fell out of my pocket."
"Don't worry," said Sunny. "I'll help you find it."
Sunny flew around the city, looking for the toy car. Finally, he saw it on a roof, too high for the boy to reach.
"I can't get it," said the boy, sadly.
"Don't worry," said Sunny. "I'll support you."
Sunny flew up to the roof and brought the toy car back down to the boy. The boy was so happy that he hugged Sunny.
"Thank you for helping me," said the boy.
"You're welcome," said Sunny. "That's what friends are for."
