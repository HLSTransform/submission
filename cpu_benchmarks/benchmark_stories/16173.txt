Once upon a time there was a girl named Anna who loved to ride her bike. She went to her grandma’s house and saw a big party. There were lots of people at the party.
Anna asked her grandma, “What’s happening?”
Her grandma said, “It’s my birthday party! Would you like to ride your bike?”
Anna was so excited! She jumped on her bike and started riding around. She laughed and smiled as she rode around the messy party.
At the end of the day, Anna was tired but happy. She said goodbye to her grandma and thanked her for the fun party. She hopped on her bike and rode home. Anna was smiling the whole way home.
