Sara liked to help her mom in the garden. She liked to dig and water and watch the plants grow. One day, mom gave her a peanut. She said, "This is a seed. You can plant it and see what happens."
Sara was curious. She dug a hole and put the peanut in. She covered it with dirt and watered it. She waited and waited. She checked every day. Nothing happened.
Then, one morning, she saw a green sprout. She was happy. She watered it some more. The sprout grew bigger and bigger. It had leaves and flowers. The flowers were yellow and bright. Sara smiled. She said, "Look, mom, the peanut bloomed!"
Mom smiled too. She said, "Yes, it did. You did a good job, Sara. You know what? The peanut is not just a flower. It is also a food. The flowers make more peanuts under the ground. Do you want to dig them up and eat them?"
Sara nodded. She liked peanuts. She liked flowers. She liked gardening. She said, "Thank you, mom. This is fun. Can we plant more seeds?"
