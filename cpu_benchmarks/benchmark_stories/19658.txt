Once upon a time there was a poor girl called Sally. Sally wanted to go on an adventure, so she decided to enter the forest. As she stepped onto the path, she saw a glimmering pebble on the ground. She bent down and picked it up. It was so beautiful! 
Sally kept the pebble in her pocket and carried on walking. Suddenly, she heard singing! The sound was coming from a tree. Sally walked towards it and could see a bird perched on the branch. 
Sally was so excited, she wanted to ask if the bird wanted be friends. But before she could say anything, the bird flew off. Sally felt sad that had scared the bird away, so she picked up the pebble and tossed it in the pond nearby. 
Sally watched as the pebble entered the water and disappeared. She smiled and knew she would find more adventures in the forest.
