Lily and Tom were friends. They liked to play outside. One day, they saw a huge hill near their house. They wanted to climb it.
"Let's go up the hill!" Lily said. "It will be fun!"
"OK!" Tom said. "But it is very high. We have to be careful."
They started to walk up the hill. They saw flowers, rocks, and bugs. They stopped to look at them. They had fun.
But the hill was very steep. They got tired. They wanted to rest.
"Can we finish?" Tom asked. "I am thirsty and hungry."
"No, we can't finish!" Lily said. "We have to reach the top. It will be beautiful!"
They kept walking up the hill. They were almost there. They saw the sky and the clouds. They felt happy.
They reached the top of the hill. They looked around. They saw their house, their garden, and their toys. They saw the sun and the birds. They saw other hills and trees.
They smiled at each other.
"We did it!" Lily said. "We finished!"
"We did it!" Tom said. "We finished!"
They hugged. They were proud. They sat down and ate their snacks. They enjoyed the view.
They had a great day.
