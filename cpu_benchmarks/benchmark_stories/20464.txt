Once upon a time, there was an elderly pony. She was often tired and sometimes she would pause to rest.
One day, a three year old saw the elderly pony resting and he wanted to help her. He gently patted her back and fed her carrots. The pony really enjoyed the carrots and seemed much happier.
The three year old was pleased, as he had made an elderly pony feel better. He decided to visit the pony every day to check up on her and see how she was feeling.
The two of them soon became friends and the pony looked forward to the visits from the three year old. 
Once the pony started feeling stronger, she and the three year old enjoyed playing tag in the meadow. 
They would race and pause for breaks in between. The three year old was so happy to have made a special connection with an elderly pony.
