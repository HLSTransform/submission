Once upon a time, in a big garden, there was a little flower. The flower was very patient. It waited and waited for the sun to shine and the rain to fall.
One day, the sun came out and the rain fell softly. The little flower started to grow. It grew taller and taller. The flower was so happy to grow.
Soon, the flower was the tallest in the garden. All the other flowers looked up to it. The little flower was proud to be so tall. It knew that being patient helped it grow big and strong.
