Lily likes to dress up in her mom's clothes. She finds a big hat, a long scarf, and some shiny shoes in the closet. She puts them on and looks in the mirror. She feels very pretty and fancy.
She sees an ashtray on the dresser. It is round and has some gray stuff inside. She thinks it is a bowl for snacks. She picks it up and tries to eat the gray stuff. It tastes bad and makes her cough. She spits it out and drops the ashtray. It breaks and makes a loud noise.
Mom hears the noise and comes to the room. She sees Lily in her clothes and the broken ashtray on the floor. She is not happy. She tells Lily to take off her clothes and go to the bathroom. She says the ashtray is not for eating and it is dangerous. She says she will clean up the mess.
Lily feels sorry and sad. She does what mom says and goes to the bathroom. She washes her mouth and face. She wishes she had a real snack. She wonders if mom has any cookies available. She hopes mom will forgive her and hug her. She loves mom and wants to make her happy.
