Toby was a happy three year old. He loved to explore new places and play with his friends. One day, Toby's parents suggested he go for a picnic in the park. Toby couldn't wait! He excitedly packed up his backpack and headed off.
At the park Toby played tag with his friends and rode his bike. Later, his parents found him lying peacefully on a patch of grass. He had decided to relax. He laid on his back and looked up at the clouds, feeling the light breeze against his cheeks. 
Suddenly, he heard a voice. It was a wise old man standing by a tree. “Why don't you take a moment and relax?” the old man said. Toby was confused and wondered why he should relax.
“Relaxation can give you wisdom and make you feel happy,” the man explained. Toby liked the idea so he closed his eyes and let his worries drift away. Soon he felt calm and content. 
When Toby opened his eyes, the old man was gone. Toby felt different, he had learned a special lesson. He could be happy by taking moments to relax.
