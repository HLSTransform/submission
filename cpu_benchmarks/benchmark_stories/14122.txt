Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She was very brave and she loved to explore the world. One day, Sarah decided to go for a walk in the forest.
As Sarah was walking, she came across a big black bird. She was scared but wondered what the bird would do next. Suddenly, the bird flew to the ground and opened up a bag of waste. Sarah gasped in horror and the bird looked at her.
The bird said, "Do you remember me Sarah? I am here to take the waste away to another place". Sarah shook her head in fear and stepped back.
The bird began to laugh and said, "I remember now! You are the one who is always picking up waste in the forest". All of a sudden, the bird jumped onto Sarah and grabbed her in its claws. Sarah started to cry and the bird flew away with her.
The black bird flew away with Sarah and, sadly, she was never seen again. Moral of the story: never pick up waste in a forest!
