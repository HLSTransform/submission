Once there was a little boy. He loved to play in the garden. One day he saw a tiny thing on the ground. It was so small he almost didn't see it. He carefully picked it up. As he held it in his hands he saw it was shrinking. He laughed and was excited. He wanted to know what it was.
The little boy put the thing in his pocket and ran to his mom. He said, "Mom, look what I have! What is it?" She smiled and said, "That's a shrinky thing. It's special magic that's available for you to play with."
The little boy was very excited that he had found something so special. He carefully took it out of his pocket and looked at it. It was getting smaller and smaller. He wanted to see what would happen if it got really small. He watched as the shrinky thing got smaller and smaller until it was a tiny speck. 
He couldn't believe his eyes! He was fascinated by the shrinky thing and wanted to play with it every day. So, mom put the shrinky thing in a slightly bigger container so that it wouldn't get lost. 
The little boy was so excited to play with the shrinky thing every day. He loved watching it get smaller and smaller. He was never bored with this special thing that was available for him!
