Once upon a time, there were two friends who loved playing together. They always had fun and laughed a lot. One day, they found a toy they both really liked. They both wanted to play with it at the same time, but there was only one toy. They didn't know what to do.
One of the friends had an idea. "Let's separate the toy and each play with one part," he said. The other friend didn't like this idea. "I don't want to do that," she said. "I think we should take turns playing with the whole toy."
They talked about it for a while, but they couldn't agree. They each had a different opinion. Finally, they decided to be honest with each other and say how they really felt. They both listened to each other and then came up with a solution they both liked. They took turns playing with the whole toy and had fun together again.
