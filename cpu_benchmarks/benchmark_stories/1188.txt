Once upon a time, there was a wise cat. The cat lived in a big house. In the house, there was a drawer. The cat would wonder what was inside the drawer.
One day, the cat saw a little mouse. The mouse wanted to play with the cat. But the cat did not want to play. The cat wanted to see what was inside the drawer. The mouse wanted to help the cat. But the cat said no.
The cat tried to open the drawer. The mouse tried to help again. The cat said no again. The cat got mad at the mouse. The drawer opened, but it fell on the cat. The cat was hurt. The mouse was sad. The end.
