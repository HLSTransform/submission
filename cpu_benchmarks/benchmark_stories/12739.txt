Once upon a time there was a little girl named Baby. One day, Baby was playing at the park with her friends. She saw a big red slide and thought it would be fun to try it. As Baby started to go down, she had a big shock!
"Oh no," Baby said as she stopped at the bottom. All of her friends laughed at her.
"Why did that slide give you such a shock?" one of them asked.
Baby thought for a moment. "Perhaps it was so boring that it needed to wake up!" she said as she giggled. Everyone laughed and agreed with her. From that day onwards, Baby was always careful when she went down the slide.
