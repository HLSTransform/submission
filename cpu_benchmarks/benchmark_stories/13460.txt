Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat treats. One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. She saw a butterfly and tried to catch it, but she tripped and fell. 
Mommy picked her up and gave her a treat. It was a yummy lollipop. Lily was happy again. Then, she saw a fake spider on the ground. She thought it was real and got scared. Mommy told her it was just a fake spider and it couldn't hurt her. 
Lily laughed and continued to play at the park. She had so much fun and didn't fall again. When it was time to go home, Lily thanked her mommy for the treat and said she couldn't wait to come back to the park again. The end.
