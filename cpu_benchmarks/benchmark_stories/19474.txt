Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She really wanted to build a house but she had no tools. She called her mommy for help.
Mommy brought some tape and said, "Here, use this tape to hold the pieces together." The little girl was so happy and began to build a house.
Soon enough, the little girl had built a house. It was very ugly but she was very proud of her work. She hugged it and said, "All done!"
Then the little girl held the house and showed it to her mommy. Mommy said, "It looks so good! You worked so hard!" The little girl smiled and said, "Yes, and I used the tape you gave me too!" Mommy gave her a big hug and said, "You did a great job!"
