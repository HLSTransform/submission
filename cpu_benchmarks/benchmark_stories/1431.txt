Once there was a small girl called Lucy. She lived on a farm with her family and they loved to make jam together. Lucy always helped her family make jam and she loved it.
One day, a big storm came to the farm. It was so strong that it destroyed the jam. Lucy was very sad and she felt helpless.
But then, an idea came to Lucy. She wanted to make more jam, so she asked for help from her family. She worked really hard and eventually, she was able to make a new jar of jam.
Lucy was so happy and she had a big smile on her face. With the help of her family, she had destroyed the storm and made jam again.
