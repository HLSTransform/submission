Little Sue was so excited. She was finally allowed to explore her new house. She skipped down the hall with a grin on her face. She examined every detail of the modern decorations.
Sue came across a door she had never seen before. She slowly opened it. Inside the room was a mysterious box. It was covered in multicolored shapes and buttons.
 
"What is that?" asked Sue.
"Oh, that's a toy box," explained her mom. "It has all of your toys in it. Would you like to examine it?"
Sue shook her head and said, "Yes, please!" She carefully examined the box, touching the buttons and shapes and admiring their colors.
Finally, when she was finished exploring the toy box, Sue grinned and said, "Can I explore the rest of the house now?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Absolutely, have fun!" She skipped off, examining the rest of her modern house.
