Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. Jack wanted to buy a movie so he went to the store with his mom.
Jack's mom said, “What movie do you want to buy?”
Jack replied, "I want the thick one!"
His mom smiled and said, “Let’s find the thick movie!” 
So they started looking around until Jack found the thick movie he wanted. He was so excited that he jumped up and down with joy!
His mom said, “Let’s pay for it and then we can go home and watch the movie.”
So they paid for the movie and went home.
The two of them were so excited that they couldn't wait to watch the movie! They put it in the DVD player and Jack snuggled up with his mom to watch the movie. 
It was perfect and Jack was so happy.
