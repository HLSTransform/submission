Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a modern bike that she loved to ride around the park. One day, while she was riding her bike, she fell down and hurt her leg. 
"Ouch! My leg hurts!" cried Lily.
Her friend, Timmy, heard her cry and came running over. "Are you okay, Lily?" he asked.
"No, my leg is sharp and hurts a lot," said Lily.
Timmy helped her up and they walked to the nearby bench. Timmy got some ice and put it on Lily's leg to make it feel better. After a while, Lily felt much better and they continued to ride their bikes together.
