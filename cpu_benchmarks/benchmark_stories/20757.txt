Once upon a time, there was a bear. The bear was very wise and knew many things.
One day, the bear went to explore some new woods. He came to a big tree and gave it a big squeeze. He was hoping to find some wisdom inside.
Suddenly, he heard a voice come from the tree. "What do you seek?" it said.
The bear was very surprised. He told the tree: "I seek wisdom".
The tree said: "Give me a big squeeze and wisdom will come".
The bear smiled and squeezed the tree with all his might. When he finished, a fine wisdom was released from the tree.
The bear was very thankful. He now knew many things and had some magnificent wisdom to share.
