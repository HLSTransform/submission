Once upon a time, there was a brown dog named Max. Max loved to play with his friends in the park. One day, Max went to the park and saw a new toy. It was a big, brown ball with a long string.
Max wanted to play with the ball, but he needed to attach the string to something. He looked around and saw a big tree. Max ran to the tree and tried to attach the string to a branch. He jumped high, but he could not reach it.
A little girl saw Max and wanted to help. She used a stick to attach the string to the branch. Now, Max could play with the ball. He was so happy to touch the ball with his nose and watch it bounce. Max and the little girl played together all day.
