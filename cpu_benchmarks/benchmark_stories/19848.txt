Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mommy promised to take her to the park to play. Lily was very happy and excited. 
When they got to the park, Lily saw a big slide and ran towards it. But her mommy called her back and said, "Wait, Lily! Let's put a label on your jacket so we don't lose you." 
Lily's jacket was pink and had a label with her name on it. She felt safe and happy knowing that her mommy was taking care of her. 
As they played in the park, Lily found a rare butterfly on a flower. She wanted to catch it, but her mommy said, "No, Lily. We can't catch the butterfly. We need to let it fly free." 
Lily listened to her mommy and watched as the butterfly flew away. She felt proud of herself for being kind to the butterfly.
