Once upon a time there was a young girl called Sally. She loved animals and was always on the lookout for them.
One day, Sally was walking in a meadow when she spotted a sheep. She slowly crept closer and peeked over the grass to get a better look.
Sally asked the sheep, “What’s your name?” The young sheep replied, “I’m Baa-Baa.”
Sally smiled and said, “It’s nice to meet you Baa-Baa. Will you be my friend?”
Baa-Baa nodded and said, “Yes, I’d love to be your friend.”
Sally was so excited. She had made a new friend. From that day onwards, Sally and Baa-Baa were the best of friends and they spent every day playing together in the meadow.
