Once upon a time, there was a beautiful little bird. He had wings that sparkled in the sun and he was very charming, beloved by all the animals.
The bird's name was Peter and he always wanted to soar high up into the sky, so his dream came true one day. When Peter awoke the next morning, the sun was shining, and he was ready to fly!
So he opened his wings and flapped them gently in the air, and he rose up up and away into the beautiful sky. He soared and soared, until he flew high above the clouds and he could see the colourful rainbow below.
But then a big grey shadow passed over the rainbow. It was an eagle! Peter was terrified, so he called out to his friends:
"Help me! The eagle wants to catch me!"
Just then, a flock of friendly birds swooped in and rescued Peter from the eagle's shadow. The birds surrounded Peter with their wings and brought him safely back home.
Peter was so relieved and happy. He thanked the friendly birds for taking care of him and promised to never fly too high again.
And that's how Peter the charming little bird learned to stay safe and stay close.
