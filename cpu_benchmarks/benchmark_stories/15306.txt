Once upon a time, there was a big carpet. On the carpet was a slow bunny. The bunny wanted to escape. He looked up and saw the sky. He hoped to find a way out. He hopped around for a long time, but nothing changed. Suddenly, he heard a noise. He looked around and found a door. He hopped over and pushed the door open. He ran out of the door and escaped! He was so happy and free. He hopped across the grass, feeling the sun on his fur. He felt happy and safe. He was glad he escaped!
