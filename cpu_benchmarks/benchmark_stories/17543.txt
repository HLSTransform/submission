Sara liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls on a shelf in her room. She wanted to get the doll with the pink dress and the yellow hair. But the shelf was too high for her. She needed a chair to reach it.
She found a chair in the kitchen. It was a broken chair. One of the legs was shorter than the others. But Sara did not care. She dragged the chair to her room. She put it under the shelf. She climbed on the chair. She stretched her arm to get the doll.
"Be careful, Sara!" her mom said from the door. "That chair is broken. It might fall."
But Sara did not listen. She wanted the doll. She stepped on the edge of the chair. The chair wobbled. The chair tipped over. Sara fell to the floor. The shelf shook. The dolls fell too. They landed on Sara. Sara cried.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Sara said. "Mommy, help me!"
Her mom ran to her. She lifted the dolls off her. She hugged her. She checked her for injuries. She was not hurt. But she was scared and sad.
"I'm sorry, Sara," her mom said. "Are you okay?"
Sara nodded. She looked at the dolls. Some of them were broken too. Their heads or arms or legs were off. She felt sorry for them.
"I'm sorry, dolls," she said. "I did not mean to break you."
Her mom smiled. She kissed her. She said, "It's okay, Sara. We can fix the dolls. And we can get a new chair. And we can put the shelf lower. But next time, please listen to me. And be careful."
