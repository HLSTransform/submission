Once there was a little girl named July. July loved to play all kinds of invented games, but today, she wanted something different.
July asked her mother if she could go outside in her new pants. Her mother said no, and July became frustrated. July asked three more times, but her mother refused all of them.
July was very disappointed. She sat in the corner, and refused to speak to her mother at all. Her mother asked her why she was so angry, but July just said "No!"
Finally, her mother gave in and let July go outside with her new pants. July was so happy and thanked her mother for understanding. Now she could go play with her friends, wearing her favorite pants!
