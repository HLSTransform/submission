Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing outside in his backyard. One hot day, Timmy's mom gave him a brown hose to play with. Timmy was so happy!
He turned on the hose and started spraying water all over the place. Suddenly, his sister came outside and said, "Can I play too?" Timmy said, "Sure, but be careful not to shoot the water in my face."
They played with the hose for a while, giggling and splashing each other. Then, Timmy's mom called them inside for lunch. Timmy said, "Can we play with the hose again later?" His mom said, "Of course, but don't forget to put it away when you're done." Timmy nodded and ran inside, excited to play with the hose again later.
