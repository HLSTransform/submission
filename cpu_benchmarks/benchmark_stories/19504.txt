Once upon a time, there was a deer who was feeling very empty. He wanted to do something special and find a way to serve the world. So he set off on a journey and explored many places.
First, he went to the beach. He saw the waves crashing against the shore and thought of how he could help. So he decided to use his antlers to dig a hole and make a place for the little crabs to hide and keep them safe.
Then he went to a field. He saw that it was so dry and nothing was growing. He remembered a story he had heard long ago about how to help the land. So he used his hooves to dig deep holes in the ground and plant some seeds to help them grow.
Finally, he ended up in the forest. There were so many animals around and he wanted to help them too. He started to gather the fallen leaves from the trees and made a big pile. He used this to make a shelter so the animals could keep warm during the cold winter nights.
By the end of his journey, the deer felt fulfilled. He had served the world around him in the best way he knew how and his heart was full.
