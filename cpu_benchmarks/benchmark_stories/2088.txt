Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack. Jack had a wife named Jill. They lived in a small house on a hill. One day, Jack and Jill talked about what to eat for dinner. Jack wanted pizza, but Jill disagreed. She wanted to eat salad instead.
"I want pizza," said Jack.
"I don't want pizza. I want salad," replied Jill.
Jack felt upset because he really wanted pizza. But he knew he had to be humble and listen to his wife. So, he said, "Okay, we'll have salad then."
Jill smiled and said, "Thank you for being humble, Jack."
And so, Jack and Jill had a delicious salad for dinner. They both felt happy because they listened to each other and came to an agreement.
