Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to swing and slide and run. They saw a big dog with brown fur and a long tail. The dog was barking and jumping. Lily and Ben wanted to pet the dog.
"Hello, doggy!" Lily said. She walked to the dog and reached out her hand. The dog growled and showed his teeth. He did not like Lily. He was a wild dog.
"Be careful, Lily!" Ben said. He ran to Lily and tried to pull her away. The dog was faster. He bit Lily's hand and made her cry. He was a terrible dog.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lily screamed. She was hurt and scared. Ben was angry and brave. He slapped the dog on the nose and made him yelp. He was a good brother.
"Go away, doggy!" Ben shouted. He picked up a stick and waved it at the dog. The dog was not afraid. He snarled and jumped at Ben. He bit Ben's leg and made him fall. He was a mean dog.
"Help, help, help!" Lily and Ben cried. They needed help. They hoped someone would hear them and save them. But no one came. The dog was hungry and strong. He ate Lily and Ben and licked his lips. He was a happy dog.
