Once upon a time, there was a lively girl. Every day, she liked to perform her favourite dance moves outside in the sunshine. Every day, the girl felt happy and full of life when she danced.
One day, the girl's mother found her outside and asked, "What are you doing, my dear?"
The lively girl replied, "I'm dancing, mummy!"
The mother smiled and said, "That's lovely my dear. But you should perform your dancing inside today."
So the lively girl did as her mother said and started to dance in the house. She had even more fun inside because she was able to dance freely and make even more creative moves.
At the end of the day, the lively girl had learned a valuable lesson. Even though dancing outside in the sunshine was nice, it was even more fun to perform her dancing inside.
