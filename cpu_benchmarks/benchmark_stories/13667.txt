Tim and Mia like to play in the forest. They look for bugs and flowers and birds. One day, they see a big mushroom. It is red and white and round.
"Wow, look at that mushroom!" Tim says. "It is so big and pretty. Can we touch it?"
Mia shakes her head. "No, no, no. Mommy said some mushrooms are bad. They can make you sick or hurt. We should not touch it."
Tim frowns. He wants to touch the mushroom. He thinks it looks soft and fun. He moves closer to the mushroom.
"Stop, Tim, stop!" Mia shouts. "Don't touch it!"
Tim stops. He hears a loud noise. He turns around and sees a big bear. The bear is angry and hungry. It growls and shows its teeth.
"Run, Mia, run!" Tim yells. "There is a bear!"
Mia and Tim are very scared. They run away from the mushroom and the bear. They are very alert. They look for a safe place to hide. They find a big tree. They climb up the tree and wait.
The bear follows them. It sniffs the mushroom. It does not like the mushroom. It spits it out. It looks for Mia and Tim. It sees the tree. It tries to climb the tree.
Mia and Tim hug each other. They hope the bear will go away. They hope Mommy will find them soon. They are very brave. They do not cry. They sing a song to calm down.
The bear hears the song. It does not like the song. It gets bored and tired. It gives up and walks away.
Mia and Tim see the bear leave. They are very happy and relieved. They wait for Mommy. They see Mommy come. She is very worried and happy. She hugs them and kisses them.
"Mommy, Mommy, we saw a big mushroom and a big bear!" Mia and Tim say.
"Wow, you did? That is very exciting and scary. I am so glad you are safe and smart. You did not touch the mushroom and you ran away from the bear. You are very alert and brave. I am very proud of you." Mommy says.
Mia and Tim smile. They love Mommy. They love the forest. But they do not love mushrooms and bears. They go home and have a snack and a nap. They dream of bugs and flowers and birds.
