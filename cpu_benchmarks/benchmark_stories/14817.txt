Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play in the park. Every Sunday, their mom took them there after lunch. They had a lot of fun on the swings, the slide and the seesaw.
One Sunday, they saw a new thing in the park. It was a big red ball with a rope. It looked like a balloon, but it did not fly. It was tied to a pole. Lily and Ben wanted to play with it.
"Can we try it, mom?" they asked.
"Sure, but be careful. It is not a toy. It is for exercise. You have to pull the rope and the ball will bounce back. Do not hit your face or your brother or sister," mom said.
Lily and Ben nodded. They took turns to pull the rope and watch the ball bounce. It was fun, but hard. The ball was heavy and fast. Sometimes they missed it and it hit the ground. Sometimes they caught it and it pushed them back.
Ben was clumsy. He did not pull the rope well. He pulled it too hard or too soft. He did not catch the ball well. He caught it with his hands or his chest. He did not dodge the ball well. He dodged too late or too early.
"Ouch!" he said. The ball hit his nose. It hurt.
"Are you okay, Ben?" Lily asked. She was worried.
"I am okay, Lily. It is just a little bump. Do not worry," Ben said. He was brave.
Lily was good. She pulled the rope well. She pulled it just right. She caught the ball well. She caught it with her arms. She dodged the ball well. She dodged just in time.
"Wow, Lily, you are good. You are strong and fast. You are better than me," Ben said. He was proud.
"Thank you, Ben. But you are good too. You are funny and kind. You are my best friend," Lily said. She was happy.
They hugged each other. They smiled. They played some more.
Mom watched them. She was glad. She loved them. She urged them to have fun.
"Come on, kids, play some more. It is still Sunday. We have time. Enjoy the park. Enjoy the ball. Enjoy each other," mom said.
Lily and Ben nodded. They did. They had a lot of fun. They had a good Sunday.
