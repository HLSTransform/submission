Lucy was excited to go for a walk and see new things. She grabbed Mommy's hand and started skipping down the street. She noticed the jolly mailbox on the corner.
"Mommy, what's that?" she asked pointing up at it.
"That's a mailbox, my love. It's where people send mail to each other," Mommy said.
Lucy craned her head back to take a better look. "Can we look inside it?"
Mommy laughed. "No, honey, we can't look inside. But it sure is exciting to think about all of the different letters and packages that go in there, right?"
Lucy agreed and took a few steps forward to get a closer look. She wondered why it was so jolly and colorful.
"Let's keep walking and maybe we'll see something else exciting soon," Mommy said and they continued down the street.
