Tom and Lily were twins. They liked to play outside in the snow. They made a snowman and threw snowballs at each other. They laughed and had fun.
But one day, the snow melted and turned into ice. The ice was hard and slippery. Tom and Lily could not play outside anymore. They had to stay inside and watch the ice from the window. They were miserable.
"Mom, can we go outside?" Tom asked.
"No, dear, it's too cold and dangerous. You might fall and hurt yourself on the ice." Mom said.
"But we are bored. We have nothing to do." Lily said.
Mom thought for a moment. She had an idea.
"Why don't you watch a movie with me? I have a DVD of Frozen. It's about a princess who can make ice and snow with her magic. Maybe you will like it." Mom said.
Tom and Lily agreed. They liked movies. They cuddled with Mom on the couch and watched the movie. They saw the princess make a snowman and a castle of ice. They heard her sing and laugh. They forgot about the ice outside. They were happy.
