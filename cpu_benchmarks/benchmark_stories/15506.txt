Once there was a little girl called Lucy. She was three years old and loved to explore the world around her. One day, she went outside with her family and saw a new watch lying on the grass. Lucy paused for a moment to take a look at the watch. She thought it was so beautiful!
The watch had a bright blue face and golden hands. Lucy wanted to take it home with her. So she asked her dad if she could keep it. Daddy thought it was a great idea and said yes.
Lucy was so excited to have a new watch! She put it on her wrist and went to play in the garden. She would pause often to look at her watch and admire it. She felt so grown-up wearing it!
Finally, it was time to go home. Lucy was so happy she had found a beautiful new watch. She was very lucky. From that day onwards, her watch was always with her.
