Once upon a time, there was an enormous engine. It seemed to go on forever, with lots of sparkly bits and bright lights. 
One day, a brave little girl went up to the engine and she gave it a big kiss. Suddenly, something amazing happened - the engine started to move and it took off! It went so high that the little girl could barely keep track. 
The engine flew over the moon and around the stars. Everyone cheered for the little girl and the enormous engine.
Eventually the engine and the little girl returned back to the same place where they had started. And that's how the small kiss made an enormous difference.
