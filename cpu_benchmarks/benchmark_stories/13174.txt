Once upon a time there was a healthy bee. She flew over to a park to explore. When she arrived, she was so excited! She saw people running and playing and having fun. She flew across the park to see what she could find. She flew past the swings and the slides, the trees and the flowers. Eventually, she found a big pond filled with ducks and fish. She loved it! She decided to stay and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of the park for the rest of the day. When it was time to go home, she happily flew away.
