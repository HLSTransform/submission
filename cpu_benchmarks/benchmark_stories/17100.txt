Once upon a time, there was a little car named Red. Red loved to zoom around the house and play with his toy friends. One day, it was very hot outside and Red could feel the heat on his shiny red paint. He decided to stay inside and play with his friends instead.
But when Red went to play with his friend Blue, Blue was being rude and wouldn't share his toys. Red felt sad and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, Red had an idea. He zoomed over to his toy box and grabbed his favorite toy. He went back to Blue and offered to share his toy. Blue was surprised and felt bad for being rude. They both played together and had a great time. From that day on, they were the best of friends and always shared their toys.
