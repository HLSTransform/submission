Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sing and dance all day. One day, she went to the park to play.
At the park, Lily saw a microphone. She was so happy! She picked it up and started to sing. Then, she met a new friend, a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to sing too. They sang and danced together.
But then, a big mean dog came. The dog wanted the microphone. It took the microphone from Lily and Tim. The dog ran away with it. Lily and Tim were sad. They did not get the microphone back.
