Once there was a little girl who loved to play in the rain. Every time it rained, she would put on her coat and boots and head outside.
One day, it started to rain. She got dressed and headed outside. Before she could take two steps, her mom called her back inside. The little girl was very worried. She thought that she would never get to play in the rain again. 
But then, her mom told her that she could go outside for a few minutes. She was so excited, she started to run. Her mom laughed and watched her go.
The rain felt so good and she splashed around in the wet grass. She was so happy that she even threw her arms up in the air and spun around. She had so much fun that before she knew it, her mom was calling her back in. 
Although she was disappointed, the little girl knew that her mom was just looking out for her. Plus, she still had the most wonderful wet and wild time.
