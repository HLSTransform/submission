Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to observe the bugs and the flowers. They saw a big mushroom under a tree. It was brown and round and had spots on it.
"Look, a mushroom!" Lily said. "Can we touch it?"
"I don't know," Ben said. "Maybe it is not good to touch. Mom said some mushrooms are bad."
Lily wanted to touch it anyway. She reached out her hand and poked the mushroom. It felt soft and wet. But then the mushroom broke and fell apart. Lily gasped.
"Oh no!" Ben said. "You broke the mushroom! What if it was someone's home? What if a bug lived there?"
Lily felt sorry. She did not mean to break the mushroom. She did not know it was so fragile. She looked at the pieces of the mushroom on the ground. She saw a small worm crawling out of one of them. She felt even more sorry.
"I'm sorry, worm," she said. "I'm sorry, mushroom. I did not want to hurt you. I was just curious."
Ben saw that Lily was sorry. He hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. You did not know. Maybe we can find another mushroom for the worm. Maybe we can help it find a new home."
Lily nodded. She wiped her tears and smiled. She and Ben looked around the garden for another mushroom. They found one that was smaller and white and had no spots. They carefully picked it up and brought it to the worm. They placed it near the broken mushroom and hoped the worm would like it.
"Here you go, worm," Lily said. "This is a new mushroom for you. We hope you are happy. We are sorry for breaking your old mushroom."
The worm wiggled and seemed to say thank you. Lily and Ben felt happy. They learned to be more careful with the things they observe. They also learned to say sorry when they make a mistake. They went back to playing in the garden, but they did not touch any more mushrooms. They just looked at them and admired their colors and shapes.
