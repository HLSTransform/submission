Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She went to the airport with her mommy and daddy. They were going on a trip to see her grandparents.
At the airport, Lily saw a funny clown. He had a big red nose and a colorful hat. Lily wanted to play with him, but her mommy said they had to go catch their plane.
On the plane, Lily got to use her new coloring book. She colored pictures of animals and flowers. It was so much fun!
When they landed at the airport, Lily's grandparents were waiting for them. They hugged and kissed and had a big family hug. Lily was happy to see them and couldn't wait to have more fun with them.
