Anna and Ben are playing with their toys in the living room. They have a lot of fun making noises and pretending to be animals. Anna is a lion and Ben is a monkey. They roar and screech and jump around.
But then, Anna sees that Ben has her favorite doll. She wants it back. She says to Ben, "Give me my doll. It is mine." Ben says, "No, it is mine. I like it." They start to pull the doll from each other. They get angry and sad.
They shout at each other, "Mine! Mine! Mine!" They shout so loud that their parent hears them from the kitchen. Their parent comes to the living room and sees them fighting. Their parent is not happy. Their parent says, "Stop shouting. Why are you fighting? You have to share your toys. Sharing is kind."
Anna and Ben stop shouting. They look at their parent and at the doll. They feel sorry. They say, "Sorry, parent. Sorry, Anna. Sorry, Ben." They hug their parent and each other. They decide to share the doll and play together. They are happy again. Their parent is proud of them. Their parent says, "Good job, Anna and Ben. You are kind and smart. I love you." They say, "We love you too, parent." They smile and laugh and play.
