Jane opened the fridge door and saw a lovely bright red strawberry. She smiled and grabbed it. She looked around the kitchen and thought of something fun. She went over to her toy box and paused to think what she could do with a strawberry.
Suddenly she had an idea. She grabbed the toy hammer and a little plate. On the plate she placed the strawberry. Jane lifted the hammer in the air and took a deep breath. Then she brought the hammer down onto the strawberry. It was very difficult but after a few tries, she managed to smash it into pieces.
She paused and smiled. She took one of the pieces of strawberry and ate it. It was delicious and sweet. With the other pieces of strawberry, she made a nice strawberry smoothie. She drank it slowly, savouring the wonderful taste of the strawberry. It was the best day ever!
