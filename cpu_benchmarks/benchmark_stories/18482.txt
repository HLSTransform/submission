Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. He had a big box full of cars, trucks and dolls. Timmy's favorite toy was a chubby teddy bear. He would hug it tight and play with it in his room.
One day, Timmy's mommy told him to put on his coat because it was cold outside. Timmy didn't want to go outside because he wanted to keep playing with his toys. But his mommy said it was important to get some fresh air. So, Timmy put on his coat and went outside to play.
Even though it was cold, Timmy had fun playing with his friends at the park. They ran around, played on the swings and went down the slide. When Timmy got home, he was tired but happy. He hugged his chubby teddy bear and went to bed, dreaming about all the fun he had.
