Once upon a time, there was a stubborn seed. Every day, the seed wanted to bloom like all the other flowers and plants, but it just couldn't. The seed worked hard trying to bloom, breaking out of its tiny covering and pushing its way through the soil. 
One sunny morning, the seed's work paid off! With a loud "pop", the stubborn seed finally bloomed! Its beauty was magnificent! Its petals were a deep purple and its aroma was like a summer afternoon.
All the other plants and animals came to admire the blooming seed. They praised its beauty and struggled with the stubborness that kept it from blooming for so long. 
For the rest of the summer, the stubborn seed bloomed and shined, reminding everyone how amazing and special it was. The seed taught everyone that with hard work and patience, amazing things can happen.
