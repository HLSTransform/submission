Once upon a time there was a boy called Tom. Tom was three years old and very curious. Every day he would explore outside, looking for something new to learn.
One day, Tom was walking through the grass when he spotted an original goose. He'd never seen a goose before and was excited to get closer. He requested to the goose if he could approach, but the goose didn't answer. Tom walked up to the goose and asked again. This time, the goose finally responded.
"I'm looking for food," said the goose. "If you help me find food, I can show you something special."
Tom was intrigued. He agreed to help and the pair set off to search for food. Eventually, they found some tasty insects and the goose was very grateful.
It was then that the goose revealed its secret. It told Tom that it could fly! Tom was so excited that he couldn't believe it. The goose asked him if he wanted to ride and Tom could only nod in agreement. 
The original goose took flight, with Tom on its back. Tom couldn't believe his luck as he had asked for adventure, and the goose had granted his request!
