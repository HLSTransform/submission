Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play in the garden. One day, they found a big hole in the fence. They wanted to see what was on the other side, so they crawled through the hole.
They saw a lot of flowers and trees and a pond with fish. They also saw a big red car parked near a house. Tom wanted to touch the car, but Sam said no.
"That is not our car. It belongs to someone else. We should not touch it," Sam said.
But Tom did not listen. He ran to the car and opened the door. He saw a shiny key in the ignition. He turned the key and the car started. It made a loud noise and smoke came out of the exhaust.
Tom was scared and jumped out of the car. He ran back to the hole in the fence. Sam followed him. They heard someone shouting from the house.
"Hey, who started my car? What are you doing in my garden?" It was the owner of the car. He was angry and came out of the house.
Tom and Sam crawled through the hole and ran to their own garden. They hoped the man did not see them.
They felt bad for what they did. They knew they should not have gone through the hole and touched the car. They decided to tell their mom and dad what happened.
They also decided to replace the hole in the fence with some wood and nails. They wanted to fix their mistake and respect their neighbor's property.
They learned that it is wrong to go where they are not invited and to take what is not theirs. They also learned that some things are hot and dangerous and should not be played with. They said sorry to their mom and dad and to their neighbor. They promised to be more careful and respectful in the future.
