Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweet. Tweet lived in a nest high up in a tree. One day, Tweet wanted to make his nest look pretty. He thought of a creative idea to decorate it with colorful flowers.
Tweet flew down to the ground to find some flowers. As he was flying, he stumbled on a rock and fell down. "Ouch!" he said. A little girl named Lily saw Tweet and asked, "Are you okay?"
Tweet replied, "I stumbled, but I'm okay. I'm looking for flowers to decorate my nest."
Lily smiled and said, "I can help you find some pretty flowers." Together, they found lots of colorful flowers and Tweet decorated his nest. It looked beautiful! From that day on, Lily and Tweet became good friends and they often played together in the garden.
