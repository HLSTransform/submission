Once upon a time there was a young girl named Abigail. She loved wearing colorful things. She wanted a special bracelet, so she planned to make it. 
Abigail went to the store to buy the supplies. She got some orange yarn, some colorful beads, and a special charm.
When Abigail got home, she got to work. She carefully started to wrap the orange yarn around her wrist. She added the colorful beads around it, and then the special charm in the center. 
After she worked hard, Abigail finished making her bracelet. It was so pretty! She put it on her wrist and felt so happy. 
Abigail wore her orange bracelet all the time. She felt so cool, and she was proud of the bracelet she made.
