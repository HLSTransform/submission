Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Pip. Pip had a beautiful feather that he loved very much. One day, a fierce wind blew and took Pip's feather away. Pip was very sad and didn't know what to do.
Pip went to his friend, a wise old owl, and asked for help. The owl said, "Don't worry, Pip. We can replace your feather." Pip was happy to hear that and asked how they could do it.
The owl said, "We need to find another feather just like yours." So they went on a search for a feather that looked the same. After a while, they found one and replaced Pip's lost feather. Pip was very happy and said, "Thank you, wise old owl. You are my best friend." And they lived happily ever after.
