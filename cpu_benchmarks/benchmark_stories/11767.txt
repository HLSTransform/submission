Once there was an elderly lady who was walking down the street. She was holding a big rubber ball. She suddenly heard a voice from behind her.
"Hi! Can I hold the ball too?" The voice belonged to a small three-year-old.
The elderly lady smiled and said, "Of course you can! Take the ball and make sure you don't drop it."
The little boy held the ball with both hands and excitedly said, "Wow! This rubber is so bouncy!" He began bouncing it up and down the street. 
When he stopped, the elderly lady said, "Make sure you give the rubber ball back when you're done." 
The little boy smiled, thanked the elderly lady and ran off with the rubber ball.
