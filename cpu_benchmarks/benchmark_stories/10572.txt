Once upon a time there were two young boys who lived together in a small room. They were best friends, always doing fun things together. 
One morning, the boys decided to go for a walk. As they were walking, they saw a big, heavy box that was not tied down. Being curious, they decided to see what was inside. As soon as they opened the box, they saw lots of flowers and other pretty things. 
The boys were excited and started to take the things out. Suddenly, a man appeared behind them. He was very angry and yelled at the boys. He told them that the box belonged to his shop and that they had to put everything back. 
The boys tried to explain that they were only curious and wanted to support the shop but the man did not listen. He simply took the box away and told them to stay away from the shop.
The boys felt sad and scared and quickly ran back to their room. From that day, they realised the importance of asking for help and support before doing anything.
