Once, there was a little girl named Molly. She lived in a small house near a garden. One day, Molly was exploring the garden and came across a strange statue. She thought it looked really funny and crazy, so she decided to turn it. When Molly touched it, she heard a magical sound.
The statue said, "If you want a magical surprise, turn me three more times!" Molly was so excited she quickly did as the statue said. When she finished, a big chime sounded out!
Molly stepped back and suddenly the craziest thing happened: the statue came alive! Suddenly, Molly was looking at a real live lion!
The lion said, "Thank you for setting me free! As your reward, come to the edge of the garden tomorrow and I will surprise you with something special!"
Molly was so excited, she ran home and couldn't wait for the next morning! When the sun rose, Molly ran back to the garden and waited with anticipation. Just then, the lion appeared with a bag of candy!
Molly was delighted and thanked the magical creature for her surprise. From then on, Molly and the lion stayed friends forever!
