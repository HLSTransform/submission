Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her toys. One day, she was playing with her dollhouse when her friend Timmy came over.
"Wow, Lily! Your dollhouse is so cool! Do you own it?" Timmy asked.
"Yes, I do!" Lily replied proudly.
As they played, time flew by quickly. Suddenly, Timmy looked at his watch and exclaimed, "Oh no! I have to go home in a minute!"
Lily was sad to see her friend go, but she knew they would play again soon. As Timmy left, Lily looked out the window and wondered about all the unknown adventures they would have together in the future.
