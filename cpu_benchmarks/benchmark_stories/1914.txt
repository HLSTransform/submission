Once upon a time there was a girl called Daisy. Daisy loved playing in the park and playing with her friends. One day, Daisy was playing in the park and her friends had a kite, which looked so fun!
Daisy's friends asked her: "Do you want to fly the kite with us?"
Daisy was so excited and said, "Yes, of course!"
Together they flew the kite and it was so much fun. Daisy felt so happy, but at the same time she was a bit scared, because the wind made the kite go so high!
Suddenly, the wind stopped and the kite fell down. Everyone was scared and Daisy felt her heart beating so fast.
But luckily, the kite was alright and Daisy and her friends were so relieved.
The next morning, Daisy went back to the park and flew her own kite. She felt so brave and happy and the wind was so gentle. Daisy flew her kite until the sun went down and she was so proud of herself.
