Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Laure who had a very big brain. Laure was very selfish because she didn't want to share her things with her best friend, Chloe. She kept all of her toys for herself, even when Chloe asked her nicely.
One day, Laure and Chloe were playing a game, but Laure wouldn't let Chloe win. Chloe felt so sad that she started to cry. Laure felt bad for being so selfish, so she hugged Chloe and promised to share her things with her.
Chloe stopped crying, but Laure started to weep because she was so sorry for hurting her friend. Chloe gave Laure a big hug and said it was okay, and they hugged until they both felt much better. 
From then on, Laure promised that she would never be selfish again, and both girls could play together forever.
