Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He was gentle and kind and he loved to learn. He enjoyed going to school every day and never hesitated to do his best.
One day, his teacher told him that he would have to take an exam soon. The little boy wasn't sure what to do. He was nervous and scared but his gentle nature kept him from turning away.
So, he worked hard for days. He practiced his lessons over and over, trying to make sure he would pass the exam. Then, the big day came. He took a deep breath and walked into the exam room.
But, his teacher told him he didn't need to do the exam after all - He had already done it without even knowing it! All the hard work and preparation had paid off. He had passed the exam.
The gentle little boy was filled with happiness and pride. He had learned something very important that day: preparation and determination can turn tough tasks into wonderful successes.
