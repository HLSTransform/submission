Anna and Ben liked to play in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. But their favorite thing was to make mud pies. They used a bucket, a spoon and some water. They mixed the dirt and the water until it was sticky and brown. Then they shaped it into pies and put them on a big rock.
One day, they saw a big dog in the park. It was black and hairy and had sharp teeth. It barked loudly and ran towards them. Anna and Ben were scared. They dropped their bucket and spoon and ran away. They did not want the dog to bite them.
"Help! Help!" they shouted. "A scary dog is chasing us!"
Mom and Dad heard them and came quickly. They saw the dog and picked up Anna and Ben. They hugged them and said, "Don't worry, we are here. The dog won't hurt you."
They looked at the dog and saw that it had a collar and a leash. It was not a wild dog. It was someone's pet. A man came running after the dog and said, "I'm sorry, he got away from me. He is not mean, he just likes to play. He saw your mud pies and wanted to eat them."
Anna and Ben looked at the rock and saw that the dog had eaten their mud pies. They were gone. The dog had a dirty mouth and a happy tail. He licked the man's face and wagged his tail.
Anna and Ben felt sorry for the dog. They did not want him to be hungry. They said, "It's okay, mister. We can make more mud pies. Do you want to play with us?"
The man smiled and said, "Sure, that would be nice. What is your name?"
"I'm Anna and this is Ben. What is your dog's name?"
"His name is Rex. He is a good boy, but sometimes he is too curious. He likes to explore and try new things."
Anna and Ben nodded. They understood. They liked to explore and try new things too. They said, "We like Rex. He is not scary. He is funny."
They gave Rex a pat and a hug. Then they went back to their bucket and spoon and made more mud pies. They shared them with Rex and the man. They had fun in the park. They made new friends. They did not leave until it was time to go home.
