Nina was a regular girl who loved to have fun. She loved playing in the park and swinging on the swings.
One day, a magical fairy appeared in the park. She said to Nina, "I am giving you a magical power. When you kneel down, you can make one wish." 
Nina was excited and kneeled on the ground. She wished for the most fun day ever!
Suddenly, the fairy clapped her hands and the whole park turned into one big playground! There were rides and games everywhere. 
Nina kneeled again and thanked the fairy for making her wish come true. The fairy replied, "You're welcome! Now go have some fun!"
