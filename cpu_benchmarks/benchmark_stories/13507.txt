Once upon a time, there was a big, big hole in the ground. It was so huge that it could fit a house inside. One day, a little boy named Timmy was walking near the hole with his mom. 
"Mommy, can we go down the hole?" asked Timmy.
"No, Timmy. It's too dangerous. We need to remain safe," said his mom.
Timmy was sad that he couldn't explore the hole. But then, he saw a group of workers nearby. They were setting up a ladder and ropes.
"What are you doing?" asked Timmy.
"We're going down the hole to see what's inside," said one of the workers.
Timmy was excited. He wanted to go down too. But his mom reminded him to remain safe and not go near the hole. 
Later that day, the workers came back up from the hole. They had found something amazing - a huge treasure chest! Timmy was happy for them, but he knew that he had to remain patient and wait until he was older to explore the hole himself.
