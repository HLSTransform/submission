One day, a little boy named Tim saw a shiny thing on the wall. It was very pretty. He wanted to touch it. But the wall was too high. Tim felt sad.
Tim asked his friend, Sam, to help him. Sam said, "Let's use a chair to reach the wall." They put the chair near the wall. Tim stood on the chair and touched the shiny thing. It was a tasty candy!
But then, Tim and Sam started to fight. "I want the candy!" said Tim. "No, I want it!" said Sam. They both wanted the tasty candy. They were not happy.
Tim thought for a moment. He said, "Let's share the candy!" Sam agreed. They broke the candy in half and each had a piece. The candy was very tasty. Tim and Sam were happy again. They learned that sharing is good.
