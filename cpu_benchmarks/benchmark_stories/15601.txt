Sara and Ben are playing in the garden. They have a big sack and a mop. They want to make a fort with the sack and the mop.
They put the sack over the mop and stick it in the ground. They crawl under the sack and pretend it is their castle. They have fun making noises and telling stories.
"Look at our fort!" Sara says. "It is the best fort ever!"
"Yes, it is!" Ben says. "We are very proud of it!"
But then, a big wind comes and blows the sack away. The mop falls down and breaks. Sara and Ben are sad. They cry and hug each other.
"Where is our fort?" Sara says. "It is gone!"
"It is okay," Ben says. "We can make another fort. We still have each other."
They wipe their tears and smile. They look for another sack and another mop. They are not afraid of the wind. They are brave and creative. They are happy.
