Robby was a small boy. He saw many wonderful things around in the world, but he never tried doing them. One day his teacher suggested he try jumping like the other kids. Robby felt scared and anxious, but he decided to try. He felt a motion in his body and slowly started bouncing up and down. He realized for the first time that he could jump! He was so excited and jumped around the room like the other kids. He was so happy and proud of himself. Robby couldn't believe he could do something that he thought he couldn't. From then on, he always jumped like the other kids. That day he realized he could do anything if he tried!
