Once upon a time, there was a rich little girl. She loved to play and laugh, but her favourite thing was to push. Everywhere she went, she pushed: she pushed chairs, carriages and even people! One day, the little girl was in her room and she decided to push. She pushed and pushed, until she saw something strange. It was a wall and it felt different from all the others she had pushed. 
"What is this?" She said, pushing again. Then the wall moved and she jumped back in surprise. A big door had opened and she could hear a huge silence coming from inside. The little girl stepped inside and saw a beautiful place full of toys and games. She was so surprised, she couldn't believe it.
"What is this place?" She asked.
"It is where your dreams come true," a voice answered.
The little girl was so happy, she couldn't believe how rich her imagination was! She spent many days and nights in her special place, filled with the silent joys that only she could find.
