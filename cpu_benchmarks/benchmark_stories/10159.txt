Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a big dog named Max. One day, Lily went to school and had a quiz. She was very happy because she got all the answers right! When she returned home, Max was waiting for her. He was wagging his tail because he missed her so much. 
Lily's mom was very proud of her for doing well on the quiz. She said, "You are so smart! You will be rich one day." Lily didn't understand what "rich" meant, but she knew it was a good thing. She hugged her mom and Max and felt very happy. 
Later that day, Lily and Max went for a walk. They saw a bird in a tree and Lily asked Max to bark at it. Max barked and the bird flew away. Lily laughed and said, "Max, you are my best friend. I'm so happy we returned home together."
