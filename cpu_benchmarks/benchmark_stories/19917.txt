Once upon a time, there was a girl named Little Red Riding Hood. She lived in a house with her mom and grandma. One day, her mom asked her to bring some cookies to her grandma who lived in the forest. Little Red Riding Hood was happy to do it.
As she walked through the forest, she saw a wolf. The wolf asked her where she was going and she told him she was going to her grandma's house. The wolf said he knew a shortcut and offered to lead her there. Little Red Riding Hood followed the wolf.
But the wolf was not a good wolf. He wanted to eat Little Red Riding Hood and her grandma. When Little Red Riding Hood arrived at her grandma's house, she saw that the wolf had already eaten her grandma. The wolf tried to eat Little Red Riding Hood too, but luckily a woodsman came and killed the wolf. Little Red Riding Hood was safe, but her grandma was dead.
