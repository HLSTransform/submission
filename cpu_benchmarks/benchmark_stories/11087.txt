Sam and Ben were playing cowboys and robbers in the park. Sam had a hat and a pistol, and Ben had a scarf and a bag. They ran around the trees and the swings, pretending to shoot and chase each other.
"Bang, bang, you're dead, robber!" Sam shouted, pointing his pistol at Ben.
"No, I'm not, cowboy! You missed me!" Ben said, running away with his bag.
Sam followed him, but he saw a big dog on the grass. The dog was black and brown, and had wide ears and a long tail. Sam liked dogs, and he wanted to pet it. He forgot about Ben and the game, and ran towards the dog.
"Hey, Sam, where are you going?" Ben called, looking back. "The game is not over!"
But Sam ignored him. He reached the dog and knelt down to stroke its fur. The dog wagged its tail and licked Sam's face. Sam laughed and hugged the dog.
"Hello, doggy, you're so nice and soft!" Sam said.
The dog's owner, a lady with a red coat and a hat, came over and smiled.
"Hello, little boy, what's your name?" she asked.
"I'm Sam, and this is my pistol," Sam said, showing her his toy gun.
The lady looked surprised and a bit scared.
"Oh, I see. Well, that's a very...interesting pistol. But you know, you shouldn't point it at people or animals, right? It's not polite, and it could be dangerous," she said.
Sam nodded. He didn't want to hurt anyone, he just wanted to play.
"OK, I'm sorry. I won't point it anymore," he said.
"That's good. And what about your friend over there? He looks lonely. Don't you want to play with him?" the lady asked, pointing at Ben, who was still waiting by the swings.
Sam looked at Ben and felt bad. He had ignored him, and that was not nice. He wanted to be a good friend.
"Yes, I do. Come on, doggy, let's go play with Ben!" he said, getting up and running back to Ben.
The dog followed him, barking happily. Ben smiled and waved at Sam.
"Hi, Sam, I'm glad you're back. Do you want to play some more?" he asked.
"Yes, I do. And look, I have a new friend. This is doggy, and he's very friendly. Can he play with us?" Sam asked.
Ben looked at the dog and nodded.
"Sure, he can. He's a cute dog. Maybe he can be the sheriff, and we can be his deputies," he suggested.
Sam liked the idea. He gave his pistol to the dog, who held it in his mouth.
"OK, doggy, you're the sheriff. And we're your deputies. Let's go catch some robbers!" he said.
The three of them ran around the park, having fun and making noise. The lady watched them and smiled. She was glad they were happy and safe. She hoped they would always be friends.
