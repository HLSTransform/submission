Max had a regular vacation. He wanted to make it special so he came up with a plan. He wanted to complete a big puzzle. Max's mom and dad thought it was a great idea and bought him the puzzle.
Max got to work. He was so excited because he had never completed a big puzzle before. He worked hard and with lots of patience. Max's mom and dad helped him too.
At the end of the vacation, Max had completed the big puzzle. He was so proud of himself! His mom and dad were so proud of him too. It was a great way to end the regular vacation.
