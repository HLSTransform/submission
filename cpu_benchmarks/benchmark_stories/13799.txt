Sam and Mia were playing with their modern toys in the living room. They had cars, dolls, robots, and puzzles. They liked to make noises and stories with their toys.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise outside. It was the wind. It was very strong and scary. They looked out the window and saw trees and trash flying in the air. They saw dark clouds and rain. They saw a big, spinning thing. It was a hurricane.
"Mommy, Daddy, what is that?" Sam asked, holding his robot.
"It's a hurricane, Sam. It's a big storm that can be dangerous. We have to stay inside and be safe," Mommy said, coming to the living room. She hugged Sam and Mia and took them to the basement.
"Why do we have to go to the basement, Mommy?" Mia asked, holding her doll.
"Because the basement is strong and can protect us from the hurricane, Mia. We have to wait until the hurricane is gone. Then we can go back to the living room and play with our toys," Mommy said, smiling.
"OK, Mommy. Can we take our toys with us?" Sam asked.
"Of course, Sam. You can take your toys with us. But we have to be quiet and not shout. The hurricane is very loud and we don't want to make it louder," Mommy said.
"OK, Mommy. We will be quiet and not shout. We will play with our toys and be good," Mia said.
They went to the basement with their toys and Mommy and Daddy. They played with their toys and told stories. They were quiet and not shout. They waited until the hurricane was gone. They were safe and happy.
