Molly opened the small gate and looked at the restless sheep. She chuckled as she watched them go here and there, not particularly sure where to go. 
Molly decided it was time to close the gate and take the sheep back to their home. She slowly walked towards the gate and said, "C'mon sheep, it's time to go home." 
But the sheep didn't move. They seemed too restless and confused to understand. Noticing this, Molly clapped her hands and shouted, "Yoo-hoo, sheep! This is your home! C'mon in, hurry!"
To her surprise, the sheep quickly perked up and walked towards her, one by one, until they were all inside. She then closed the gate shut, feeling relieved that they were safe, and inside their home. 
Molly smiled, happy knowing that she had done the right thing.
