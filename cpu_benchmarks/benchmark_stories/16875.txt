Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play pretend with her toys. One day, she pretended to be a train driver and her toys were the passengers.
"Lily, do you want to go on a real train ride?" her mom asked.
"Yes, please!" Lily replied.
They went to the subway station and boarded the train. Lily was so excited to see all the different stops and people getting on and off.
She saw an old woman struggling with her bags and offered to help. Her mom was proud of her for being so compassionate.
After the train ride, Lily told her mom all about her adventure and how she pretended to be a train driver. Her mom smiled and said, "You can be anything you want to be, as long as you are kind and compassionate like you were today."
