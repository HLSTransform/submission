Once upon a time there was a farmer called Jack. He was wide and strong, but he felt all alone. One day, he decided to marry a woman called Maria. 
Jack and Maria were very happy, but one day Jack had an idea. He wanted to have a special steak for dinner. So he went to the market to buy it. But it was very expensive, and he didn’t have enough money.
He thought for a while and then had a conversation with Maria. Jack said to her: “We need to save money. Should we buy a steak or something cheaper?” 
Maria smiled and replied: “We don’t need a steak. We can eat something else and save the money. That way, we will still be happy.”
Jack agreed and they ate something else that night.
The moral of this story is that it’s important to work together and save money. Sometimes it’s better to do without something special and just be happy together.
