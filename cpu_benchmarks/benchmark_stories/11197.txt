Once there was a little girl who wanted to fly like a bird. She was so eager to do this and she wanted to learn right away.
So, the little girl asked her papa to teach her how to fly. Her papa found a pilot who could help her. The pilot told her to come to his airplane.
The little girl followed the pilot and she was very excited. When she got to the plane, the pilot showed her how to make a sign. She was supposed to sign up to fly. But the little girl was too young and the pilot said no.
The girl was very upset. She didn't understand the pilot so she just started to cry. But her papa hugged her and told her that she could come back when she was old enough. The little girl was still eager to learn how to fly and she promised that she would be back soon.
