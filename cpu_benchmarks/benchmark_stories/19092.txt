Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, while they were making cookies, Lily accidentally knocked over a pot on the stove. Her mommy said, "Oh no, Lily! You are so clumsy!"
Lily felt sad and started to cry. But then her mommy gave her a big hug and said, "Don't worry, sweetie. It's okay. Let's clean it up together." Lily felt better and smiled at her mommy.
After they finished making the cookies, Lily's daddy came home from work. He said, "Mmm, it smells delicious in here!" Lily proudly showed him the cookies she helped make. Her daddy took a bite and said, "These are the best cookies ever! You are such a good helper, Lily." Lily smiled again and felt very happy.
