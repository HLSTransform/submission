Ben and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a hole in the ground. They want to know what is inside.
"Maybe it is a treasure!" Ben says.
"Or a monster!" Sam says.
They go closer to the hole. They hear a noise. It is a mole. The mole comes out of the hole. It has a long nose and black fur. It looks at Ben and Sam.
"Hello, I am Mimi the mole. Who are you?" the mole says.
Ben and Sam are surprised. They have never seen a mole before. They have never heard a mole talk before.
"We are Ben and Sam. We are kids. We play in the park. What are you doing here?" Ben says.
"I live here. This is my home. I dig tunnels and eat worms. That is normal for moles. What do you do?" Mimi says.
"We run and jump and swing and slide. We eat sandwiches and cookies. That is normal for kids. Do you want to play with us?" Sam says.
Mimi thinks for a moment. She likes Ben and Sam. They are nice and curious. But she also likes her home and her worms. She does not want to leave them.
"Thank you, but no. I have to stay here. This is where I belong. But you can come and visit me anytime. I like to make new friends." Mimi says.
Ben and Sam understand. They say goodbye to Mimi. They promise to come back soon. They go back to their games. They are happy. They have met a mole. A mole that can talk. That is not normal. But that is okay. They like Mimi. She is their friend.
