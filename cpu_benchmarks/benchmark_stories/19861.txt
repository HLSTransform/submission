Once upon a time, there was a man who was very famous. He was always on TV and in the newspaper. One day, he went to the store to buy some candy. When he got to the store, he realized that he forgot his wallet. He was sad because he really wanted some candy.
Luckily, a kind lady saw him and reminded him that he forgot his wallet. He was very happy and said thank you to the lady. He went back to his car to get his wallet and then he went back to the store to buy some candy. He was so happy that he could buy his candy and he didn't have to go home without it. 
From that day on, the man always remembered to check if he had his wallet with him before he left the house. The end.
