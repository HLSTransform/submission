Mimi was a playful three year old who loved to explore the world around her. One day, she went out to the back garden and to her surprise, she realized there was a cage. She ran towards it, eager to find out what was inside. 
"Mommy, mommy, look I found a cage!" Mimi yelled from outside the gate. 
"Be careful, sweetie," her mom warned, "make sure not to get too close until we know what's inside." 
But Mimi was too curious and peeked through the window of the cage, and was pleasantly surprised to see a hufflepuff rabbit inside. She laughed in joy and pushed the door open.
"Hey little one! C'mon out here, I'll be your friend," she said excitedly. 
The rabbit hopped out, realizing he was now free. Mimi and the rabbit quickly became the best of friends, playing tag, hide and seek, and many other games in the garden. Mimi was overjoyed and felt like a completely new creature had just become part of her life. She realized that the world was a much bigger, much better place than she had ever known.
