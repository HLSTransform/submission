Once upon a time, there was a large prince. He had a faithful servant who was always ready to help him.
One day, the prince wanted to get to a special place. He told his servant, "I need to get there quickly. Please cut through the forest and find a shortcut!".
But the faithful servant said, "No, sir! It's too dangerous. I cannot let you do that. Let's take the long way instead".
The prince was angry and said, "You must listen to me! I'm the prince and you must obey me. If you don't, I will have to find someone else to be my servant."
The faithful servant saw that the prince was really upset and he agreed to cut through the forest. After many hours, the prince and the servant finally arrived. The prince was relieved and thanked his servant. From then on, they always stuck to the safe road.
