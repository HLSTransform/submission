Once upon a time there was a hairy monkey. The monkey was especially fond of jazz music. He liked to listen to it every day. Everyone in the neighbourhood would gather around to hear the music and the monkey would dance along.
One day the monkey wanted to see how much he weighed. He asked all his friends to help him. They took some pieces of fruit and placed them on either side of a weighing scale.
The monkey hopped onto the scale and the others watched the fruits on either side. At first the monkey's side was lower than the fruit's side, but then it became even!
The monkey was so excited, he started to dance a jazzy dance. Everyone clapped and laughed and they all agreed that the monkey weighed the same as the pieces of fruit.
The monkey was so proud of himself. From then on, he practiced his jazzy dance every day and was always sure to weigh himself.
