Once upon a time, in a big park, there was a pretty fountain. The water in the fountain went up and down, and many kids loved to play near it. One sunny day, a little boy named Tim and a little girl named Sue were playing by the fountain.
Tim saw a small bird near the fountain that looked sad and helpless. He told Sue, "Look, the bird can't fly. Let's help it!" Sue nodded, and they both went near the bird. They were very gentle and kind to the bird.
Tim and Sue talked to their mom and dad about the bird. They said, "Can we help the bird get better?" Their mom and dad agreed to help. They all took care of the bird together. Soon, the bird was strong and happy again.
One day, the bird flew away, and Tim and Sue were sad. But their mom and dad told them, "You did a good thing. You helped the bird when it needed you." Tim and Sue felt proud and happy.
The moral of the story is to be kind and help others when they need it.
