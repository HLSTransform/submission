Once upon a time, there was a dependable dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with his friends in the park. They would run, jump, and have lots of fun.
One day, Spot found a big bag of rice. He thought it would be fun to bury the rice and play a game with his friends. So, he dug a big hole and put the rice in it. Then, he covered it with dirt.
Spot called his friends to play a game of finding the rice. They all looked and looked, but they could not find it. Finally, Spot showed them where the rice was. They all laughed and had a great time. Spot was a very dependable friend.
