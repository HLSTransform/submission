Lily and Max were playing with their blocks. They liked to build towers and houses and cars. Lily had a lot of purple blocks. She liked purple. It was her favorite color. Max had some purple blocks too, but not as many as Lily.
Max wanted to make a big purple car. He saw that Lily had a purple block that he needed. He asked her, "Can I have that purple block, please?"
Lily said, "No, this is my purple block. You have your own blocks. Go away."
Max was angry. He wanted that purple block. He tried to grab it from Lily. Lily did not let go. They pulled and pulled. The block broke in half. Lily and Max both screamed.
Mom heard the scream. She came to see what was wrong. She saw the broken block and the angry children. She said, "What happened here? Why are you screaming?"
Lily and Max both said, "He/she broke my purple block!"
Mom said, "I'm sorry your block is broken. But you should not scream or fight over toys. That is not nice. Sharing is nice. Can you say sorry to each other and share your blocks?"
Lily and Max looked at each other. They felt bad. They said, "Sorry." They hugged. They decided to share their blocks. They made a big purple car together. It was difficult, but it was fun. Mom smiled. She was proud of them. She said, "Good job, Lily and Max. You are good friends."
