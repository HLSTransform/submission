Once upon a time there were two best friends, Tommy and Sam. They were playing at the park and having lots of fun.
"Let's play a game," said Tommy.
"Yes," said Sam excitedly. "What should we do?"
"Let's repeat our names. I'll start," said Tommy.
So they both took turns saying their names over and over again until they got tired. After they both finished they heard a loud noise coming from the sky.
When they looked up they saw a dead bird.
The boys got scared and started to cry. 
Suddenly there was a second loud noise and the ground started to shake. When the shaking stopped the boys looked around, but everything was destroyed.
They were so sad and the game of repeating their names was forgotten forever.
