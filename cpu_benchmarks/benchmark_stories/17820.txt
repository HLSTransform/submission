Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Lucy. She wanted to do something fun, so she went outside to play. 
She saw a tall stand in the park and thought it looked like fun. She wanted to climb it, so she grabbed the side and began to pull herself up. 
Once she was standing on top, she felt so proud! She looked around at the light sky and smiled. Then she heard a loud voice coming from the ground. 
It was her mom, who had been watching from below. She was demanding that Lucy come down, so Lucy quickly scrambled to the ground. 
When her feet touched the ground, she turned to look at her mom with a big smile. Her mom smiled back and praised her for being brave. 
And that's how Lucy's stand on the big stand made her day light up!
