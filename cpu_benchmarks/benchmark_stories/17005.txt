Ben saw a beetle on the grass. It was black and shiny, with six legs and two wings. Ben liked beetles. He wanted to play with it.
He bent down and reached out his hand. But the beetle was scared. It opened its wings and flew away. Ben was sad. He wanted to be friends with the beetle.
He ran after the beetle, but it was too fast. It landed on a flower, then on a leaf, then on a rock. Ben could not catch it. He huffed and puffed.
"Please, beetle, don't go!" he said. "I just want to say hello. I won't hurt you. I like you."
The beetle heard Ben's voice. It looked at him with its tiny eyes. It saw that Ben was not mean. He was just curious. The beetle felt sorry for Ben.
It flew back to the grass and landed near Ben's feet. It waited for Ben to come closer. Ben smiled. He walked slowly and gently. He did not want to scare the beetle again.
He sat down on the grass and said, "Hello, beetle. I'm Ben. What's your name?"
The beetle did not have a name. It did not know how to talk. But it made a soft buzzing sound. It was its way of saying hello.
Ben listened to the sound. He liked it. He said, "You sound nice, beetle. Can I call you Buzz?"
The beetle nodded. It liked the name. It was its way of saying yes.
Ben and Buzz became friends. They played on the grass. Ben showed Buzz his toys. Buzz showed Ben how to hop and fly. They had fun.
The sun was mild and warm. It was a good day. Ben and Buzz were happy.
