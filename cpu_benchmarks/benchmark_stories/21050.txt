Sara and Tom like to play outside. They like to run, jump, and kick a ball. They also like to look at the sky. The sky is big and blue and has white clouds. Sometimes the sky has other colors, like pink and orange and purple.
One day, Sara and Tom see something in the sky that is not a cloud. It is gray and black and smelly. It comes from a big car that makes a lot of noise. The car is dirty and old and has a pipe. The pipe blows out the gray and black thing into the sky.
Sara and Tom do not like the gray and black thing. It makes the sky look bad and makes them cough. They want the sky to be clean and blue again. They need to do something. They run to the big car and shout at the driver.
"Stop! Stop! You are making the sky dirty! You need to fix your car or get a new one! The sky is not a trash can! The sky is for clouds and birds and stars!"
The driver hears Sara and Tom and looks at the sky. He sees the gray and black thing and feels sorry. He did not know he was making the sky dirty. He says he is sorry and turns off his car. He says he will fix his car or get a new one. He says he likes the sky too and does not want to hurt it.
Sara and Tom are happy. They thank the driver and hug each other. They look at the sky and see it is getting clean and blue again. They smile and go back to play. They hope the sky will stay clean and beautiful forever.
