Once upon a time there was a polite little girl. She enjoyed playing by the sea and watching the waves. One day, when she was by the sea she heard a voice. It said, “Stop!”
The little girl looked around, but she couldn’t see anyone. Then she saw a fish out in the sea.
The girl asked, “Who said stop?”
The fish replied, “Don’t go in the water. It’s too deep and you might get hurt.”
The little girl was so polite that she said, “Thank you for warning me. I’ll be careful.”
The fish smiled and said, “You’re welcome. Have fun playing by the sea. Just remember to stay on dry land!”
The little girl nodded and waved goodbye to the fish. She enjoyed playing by the sea, but she was very careful not to go too close to the water.
