Once there was an ugly yard. It had tall weeds and a rusty swing. No one liked to go there.
One day, a boy named Adam came to the yard. He looked at all the weeds and the broken swing and he started to feel sad. He said to himself, "This yard is ugly."
He started to cry, which made him feel even worse. He was so mad that he shouted, "I hate this yard!"
Adam made a huge mess. He yanked out the weeds and he threw the rusty swing away.
When he was done, the yard was much better. Everyone began to like it again. But Adam still remembered how he felt before, and he said to himself, "I still hate this yard."
