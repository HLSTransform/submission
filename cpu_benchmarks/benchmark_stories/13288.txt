One day, it began to rain. The sky was grey and the clouds were big and fluffy. A bear was standing outside in the rain. Even though the rain was cold, the bear was not scared, but he wanted to stay dry.
He looked around and spotted a big tree nearby. The bear ran under the tree and stopped. The tree's leaves were providing cover from the rain. The bear shook his fur and some of the water went flying! He leaned against the trunk of the tree and the rain kept falling.
The bear curled up in a tight ball and fell asleep. As he slept, the rain kept coming down. Eventually, the rain stopped and the sun came out. The bear awoke and stretched out his big arms and legs. He was happy that the rain had stopped and he could go out and explore.
