Sam liked to play with his toy cars. He had many cars of different colors and sizes. He liked to make them race and crash on the floor. He also liked to hide them in his room, so his sister Lily could not find them.
One day, he found a new place to hide his cars. It was a big box with a lock on it. He did not know what was inside the box, but he thought it was a good place to keep his cars safe. He put some of his cars in the box and closed it. He turned the lock and heard a click. He smiled and ran away.
Later, he wanted to play with his cars again. He went back to the box and tried to open it. But he could not. The lock was too hard to turn. He pulled and pushed, but nothing happened. He felt his muscle hurt. He started to cry. He was helpless.
He called for his mom and dad, but they did not hear him. They were busy in the kitchen. He called for Lily, but she did not come. She was angry with him for hiding her doll. He was alone and scared.
Then, he heard a noise. It was coming from the box. He stopped crying and listened. He heard a growl and a scratch. He felt something move inside the box. He realized he had made a big mistake. He had locked something else in the box with his cars. Something that was not happy. Something that was hungry. He wished he had never found the box. He wished he had shared his cars with Lily. He wished he could get out of there. But it was too late. The box was about to open.
