Once upon a time, there was an old man who loved to write in his journal. He wrote about his adventures and the things he saw. One day, he met a little girl who asked him what he was doing. "I'm writing in my journal," he said. "It's where I keep all my memories."
The little girl was curious and asked if she could read it. The old man hesitated but eventually said yes. He showed her his journal, and the little girl started to read. She read about all the fun things the old man had done, but then she saw something that made her sad. The old man had written that he had lied to his best friend.
The little girl asked him why he had lied, but the old man didn't have a good answer. He just said he was sorry. The little girl told him that lying was bad and that he should always tell the truth. The old man agreed and promised to never lie again.
But the next day, the little girl found out that the old man had lied to her too. He had said he would take her to the park, but he never showed up. The little girl was sad and disappointed. She realized that sometimes people don't keep their promises and that it's important to be honest. And so, the little girl went home, feeling sad, but also wiser.
