Tom is a dog. He likes to run and play with his owner, Ben. Ben is a boy. He likes to throw a ball and Tom likes to catch it. They are good friends.
One day, they go to the park. There are many other dogs and people there. Tom sees a big dog with a bone. He wants the bone. He runs to the big dog and barks.
"Give me your bone!" Tom says.
The big dog growls. He does not want to yield his bone. He is bigger and stronger than Tom. He shows his teeth.
"Go away! This is my bone!" the big dog says.
Ben sees Tom and the big dog. He is worried. He knows Tom is not reliable. He sometimes does not listen to him. He runs to Tom and calls his name.
"Tom, come here! Leave the big dog alone!" Ben says.
Tom hears Ben. He loves Ben. He does not want to make him sad. He stops barking and runs to Ben. He licks his face.
"I'm sorry, Ben. I just wanted the bone." Tom says.
Ben hugs Tom. He is glad he is safe. He knows the big dog could hurt him.
"It's okay, Tom. I understand. But you have to be careful. The big dog is the owner of the bone. You have to respect him. You have to yield to him. Do you understand?" Ben says.
Tom nods. He understands. He does not want to fight with the big dog. He wants to play with Ben. He wags his tail.
"Yes, Ben. I understand. Can we play with the ball now?" Tom says.
Ben smiles. He throws the ball. Tom catches it. They are happy. They are good friends.
