Tom and Lily liked to play with their toy boat. They made it sail in the bathtub, in the sink, and sometimes in the puddle outside. They pretended they were pirates or explorers, and had many adventures.
One day, they wanted to try something new. They decided to sail their boat in the toilet. They thought it would be fun to see how fast it could go in the swirling water. They lifted the lid and put their boat inside.
"Ready, Lily?" Tom asked.
"Ready, Tom!" Lily answered.
They pushed the button and watched their boat sail away. But then, something went wrong. The boat got stuck in the hole and the water kept rising. It spilled over the edge and made a big mess on the floor.
"Oh no!" Tom and Lily cried. "Our boat! Our boat!"
They ran to get their mom, who was not happy to see the flooded bathroom. She turned off the water and took out the boat. She scolded Tom and Lily for being careless and naughty. She made them clean up the water and dry the boat.
Tom and Lily felt sorry for what they did. They hugged their mom and said they were sorry. They promised to never sail their boat in the toilet again.
Mom forgave them and gave them a kiss. She told them to play with their boat somewhere safe and comfortable. She suggested the bathtub or the sink.
Tom and Lily agreed. They took their boat to the bathtub and filled it with warm water and bubbles. They made it sail again, but this time, they were careful and happy. They learned their lesson and had fun.
