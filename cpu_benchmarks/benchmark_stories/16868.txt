Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a pet dog named Max. Max was her best friend. They liked to play together every day.
One day, Lily had to go to school and she couldn't bring Max with her. Max was sad because he didn't want to be alone. Lily hugged Max and said goodbye. Max watched Lily go and felt even sadder.
But then, Lily's mom came home and saw Max was sad. She played with Max and gave him lots of love. Max felt happy again. From that day on, Max knew that even when Lily had to go, he had someone to keep him company.
