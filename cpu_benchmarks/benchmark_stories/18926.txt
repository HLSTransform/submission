Tim and Jen are twins. They like to play with their toy cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They drive them on the floor, on the sofa, and on the table.
One day, they find a big ball of wool in their mom's basket. It is soft and fluffy. They think it is brilliant. They want to use it for their cars.
"Look, Jen, we can make a road with the wool!" Tim says. He takes the wool and makes a long line on the floor.
"Yes, Tim, that is a good idea!" Jen says. She takes her red car and drives it on the wool. It goes fast and smooth.
They have fun driving their cars on the wool road. They make turns and bridges and tunnels. They laugh and cheer.
But then, their mom comes in. She sees the wool on the floor and the cars on the wool. She is not happy.
"Tim and Jen, what are you doing?" she asks. "That is my wool for knitting. You can't play with it. It will get dirty and tangled."
Tim and Jen feel sorry. They did not know it was mom's wool. They did not want to make her angry.
"Sorry, mom," they say. "We just wanted to make a road for our cars. We thought the wool was brilliant."
Mom sighs. She loves her twins, but they are very messy. She picks up the wool and the cars. She puts them away.
"Next time, ask me before you use my things," she says. "And if you want to make a road, you can use paper or cardboard. They are easier to clean up."
Tim and Jen nod. They hug their mom and say they love her. They promise to be more careful. They still think the wool is brilliant, but they will not play with it again.
