Once there was a boy named Owen. He was three years old and very hungry. He went to the kitchen and saw lots of yummy things to pick! He thought, "Which one should I pick?"
He decided to pick an apple. He liked apples because they made good memories. He had fun picking apples with his family in the past. So he picked the apple and took it outside.
Owen bit the apple and smiled. It was delicious! He ate his apple on the porch and enjoyed the feeling of being full.
He took out his notebook and drew a picture of the apple. He wanted to remember the apple forever. He also wanted to remember how it felt to be hungry, but now full. So, he picked one more apple and put it in his notebook as a reminder.
