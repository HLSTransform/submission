Once upon a time, there was a box. It was very big and open. Inside the box was a knife. It was shiny and sharp. One day, a man saw the box. He was excited and thought it would be fun to play with the knife.
So he loaded the box onto his truck. He drove far away until he got to his house. When he arrived, he unloaded the box and took out the knife. He was so happy and smiled. He began to play with the knife, making it spin and twirl.
The man had so much fun with the knife. He decided to keep it and make it his own. He put it in a special place and kept the box open, so he could look at it whenever he wanted.
From that day forward, the man always played with his special knife. He was so proud of his open box and his shiny knife.
