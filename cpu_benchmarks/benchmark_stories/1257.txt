In the morning, Sam woke up and the light shone in his eyes. He was happy to be up and ready to start the day. Sam got up, but he forgot to brush his teeth. His mom was not happy when she saw this. She told him to brush his teeth right away. Sam felt ashamed. He quickly ran to the sink and brushed his teeth.
After that, his mom gave him breakfast. Sam felt better now that he had brushed his teeth. He said thank you to his mom, who was happy to see him smiling. They went to the park to play together. Sam had a lot of fun running around in the sun all day.
When it was time to go home, Sam was sad to leave the park. He said goodbye to his mom and thanked her for taking him. They went home to get ready for bed. Sam put on his warm pajamas and brushed his teeth again. His mom smiled at him and said goodnight. 
The next morning, Sam woke up and the light was shining in his eyes. He was ready to start a new day!
