Once upon a time, there was a big and fat fish named Fin. Fin lived in a big and beautiful reef with his friends. One day, Fin saw a delicious cake being baked by a kind lady. Fin wanted to eat the cake, but he knew he shouldn't leave the reef. 
But Fin couldn't resist the temptation, so he left the reef and swam to the lady's house. As he was eating the cake, he got caught in a net. The lady took him to the market and sold him to a restaurant. 
Fin realized his mistake and wished he had never left the reef. The moral of the story is that we should always listen to our parents and not give in to temptation.
