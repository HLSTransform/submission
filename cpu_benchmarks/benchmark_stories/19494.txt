Once there was a bald man who lived on a porch. Every day he would sit there, but he would never smile. One day a little girl came to visit him. She was only three years old. She saw the man and asked why he was so sad. The man said he was sad because he had no one. 
The little girl smiled and sat beside him. She asked him if he wanted to come and play with her. He looked at her and began to cry. He said he would love to play with her. 
The man and the little girl played together all day. They never stopped laughing and having fun. When it was time to go home, they hugged each other goodbye. The man said he was so happy now and thanked the girl. 
The little girl waved goodbye and skipped home. She still remembers the bald man and always stops to say hello when she passes by. The man is never alone or sad anymore.
