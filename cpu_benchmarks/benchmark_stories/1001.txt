It was a warm summer day, and the sun was shining bright. Then all of a sudden, clouds filled the sky and the wind started to blow. Then it started to rain!
The rain was so heavy that it was like a wall of water pouring down from the sky. The horse in the field felt the rain on its hairy back and it liked it. It shook its head, enjoying the feel of the rain.
The rain kept falling and the horse continued to walk around in the field, feeling the rain all over its furry body. Soon, it was drenched with rainwater.
The horse happily trotted around and around in the field. After the rain stopped, the horse shook its body off, sending the remaining bits of rain flying away.
The sun came out once again and the horse continued feeling the warmth of the sunshine on its back. Soon, the horse's fur was completely dry.
