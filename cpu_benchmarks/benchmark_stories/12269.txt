Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tony. One day, Tony was playing ball near a mill. he was so excited to play ball, but he was a bit scared. Tony could hear the mill shaking and trembling. He held his toy ball tight and talked to himself.
"I can't do this," he said in a small voice. 
Just then a friendly farmer appeared. Tony looked up at him with his big eyes. Tony asked him why the mill was trembling.
The farmer kindly replied, "Earthquakes are a natural force. They make the ground shake and tremor, makes us all feel a bit scared. But don't worry Tony, everything will be alright."
Tony was very glad to hear the comforting words of the honest farmer. He learned to be brave and not be too scared of the tremors. The farmer had taught him a valuable lesson that day. 
At the end of the story, Tony was no longer afraid of the mill trembling. He knew that he could face his fears with courage and honesty.
