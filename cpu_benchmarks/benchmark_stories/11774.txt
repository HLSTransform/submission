Julie was a 3 year old who loved to make things. She had a special pattern which she wanted to make into a dress. So she asked her mom if she could mail the pattern to a special tailor. Her mom said she could. So Julie was happy and sent the pattern off.
The tailor sent Julie a beautiful dress back. Unfortunately, when Julie tried it on, it didn't fit. She was so sad. She wanted to wear it so badly.
Her mom saw how upset she was and said they would try to fix the problem. They called the tailor and asked if they could exchange the dress for one that fit better. The tailor said yes.
Julie was so excited when the new dress came in the mail. When she tried it on, it fit perfectly. She couldn't have been happier. Julie loved wearing the dress and it became her new favorite.
