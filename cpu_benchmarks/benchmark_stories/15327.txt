Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was John. He was three years old. One day, John's mom was making dinner and decided to ask him to go and get something from the fridge. John was so excited to help his mom and quickly ran to the fridge. When he opened the door, the light came on and suddenly he felt very embarrassed. He had taken out something that was not needed and he was not sure what to do. He stayed quiet and just looked up at his mom with a scared face. His mom smiled and said that it was okay. She quickly grabbed the item and closed the refrigerator door. John felt much better and was glad that his mom had not made him feel embarrassed. The next time he went to the fridge, he was careful to grab what his mom wanted him to.
