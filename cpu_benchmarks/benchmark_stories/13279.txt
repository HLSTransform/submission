Once upon a time, there were two friends who were very different. One of them was big and brave while the other was small and timid. The big one wanted to play a game and asked the small one if they wanted to join. The small one was scared but they agreed.
The game was called "Bow and Win". The big one showed the little one how to do it. First, they both had to bow. Then, they had to try and win. 
The little one tried their best but they were just too scared. They trembled and their legs shook. The bigger one was worried and asked the small one if they were okay. The small one said that they were just so fearful. 
The big one was very kind and gave the little one a hug. They both kept playing the game until the little one got the hang of it. By the end, they both won! 
The little one was very happy and she learned that even when you are fearful, you can still do great things.
