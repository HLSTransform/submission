Timmy was walking in the garden when he found a ball of yarn. He was excited and tried to take it away with him. His mom saw him and said, “No, Timmy, that’s not yours. Give it back.” Timmy was naughty and didn’t want to do it, so he started to run away with the yarn in his hand.
His mom called to him, “Timmy, remember your manners. Give that yarn back.” But Timmy wanted to keep it. So, he started to run even faster.
Suddenly, a bird flew by and grabbed the yarn from Timmy’s hand. Timmy was surprised and did not know what to do. His mom came to him and hugged him. She said, “Timmy, remember why it’s important to share.”
Timmy felt bad and hugged his mom. He said he was sorry and promised to remember to share next time. His mom smiled and said, “Good job remembering, Timmy!”
