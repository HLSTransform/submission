Once upon a time there was a person named Joe. Joe liked to bow down to the ground and stretch. He did it every morning and it made him feel happy.
One day Joe wanted to go on an adventure. So he grabbed a big bag and put all of his stuff in it. He looked inside and saw a dull gas can. "I wonder what I can do with this?" he thought.
Joe looked all around but he couldn't think of anything fun to do. He decided to take the gas and his bag and go outside.
When he got out, Joe saw lots of things to explore. He started to run around and have lots of fun. Then he remembered the gas can and he had an idea.
Joe grabbed the gas can and starting running faster. He laughed and shouted as he ran. When he got to the top of the hill, he bowed down and sprayed the gas all over. A rainbow of color filled the sky! Joe had invented a fun new game and he smiled.
