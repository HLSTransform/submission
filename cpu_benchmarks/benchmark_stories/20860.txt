Once upon a time, there was a nice little girl called Claire. Claire liked to march around the garden in a special way. She held her notebook high up in the air, so that she could read it easily.
One day, Claire decided to march all the way to the park. She was very happy and excited, but not for long. There was a big, dirty puddle blocking her way! Claire was disappointed, but then she had an idea.
Using her notebook, Claire made a bridge to cross over the dirty puddle. She held it out in front of her, and carefully stepped across it. Once she was safely on the other side of the puddle, she cheered with joy and started marching again.
Claire reached the park and had a fantastic time. She and her friends played for hours in the sunshine, until it was time to go home. Claire was sad to leave, but she knew she had made a special journey and was very proud of herself.
