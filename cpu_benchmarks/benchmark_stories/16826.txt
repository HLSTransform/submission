Once upon a time, a little crab named Sammy lived by the sea. Sammy loved to play in the sand and collect shells. One day, Sammy found a thin shell that was perfect for his collection. He was so happy that he settled down on the sand to admire it.
As Sammy sat there, he noticed that the sun was starting to set. The sky turned orange and pink, and the waves became calm. Sammy felt peaceful as he watched the sun go down. He knew it was time to go back to his home in the rocks.
Sammy scurried back to his home and settled into his cozy little shell. He felt safe and warm inside his shell, and he knew he would have sweet dreams that night. The end.
