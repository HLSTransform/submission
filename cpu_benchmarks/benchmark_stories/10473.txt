Once upon a time there was a fat fairy. She lived in a big forest and was very happy. But one day, something bad happened. Suddenly she heard a loud noise and started to panic. She looked around, but she couldn't see what was causing the noise. All she could see were big trees and bushes.
The noise got louder and she started to run. She ran and ran until she came to a big river. But when she looked down, she saw a big, fat monster in the water. She panicked and tried to run away. But the monster was too powerful. He grabbed her and swallowed her whole.
The poor fat fairy was never seen again. The monster burped and waddled off into the sunset. And that was the end of the poor fat fairy.
