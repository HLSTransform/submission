Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and move her body in motion. One day, she went to a party with her mommy and daddy. They had lots of yummy food, but Lily didn't like the spicy chips.
Lily saw a clown at the party and she wanted to clap for him. She ran over to the clown and clapped her hands. The clown showed her a magic trick and Lily was so happy. She said, "Thank you, Mr. Clown!"
Suddenly, the lights went out and everyone started to scream. Lily was scared and she held onto her mommy's hand. They tried to leave the party, but there was a big fire. Lily's family didn't make it out of the building. Lily was very sad and missed her mommy and daddy. She wished she could clap for them one more time.
