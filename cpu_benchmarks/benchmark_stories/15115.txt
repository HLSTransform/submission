Once upon a time there was a small house on the edge of a beautiful forest. In the house lived a 3 year old girl named Lucy. One night, Lucy woke up feeling nervous. She looked around her bedroom and noticed a bright figure standing in the corner. Lucy was scared, but the figure spoke to her.
"Why hello there little one, I am an angel sent here to give you a cuddle so you feel safe," said the angel.
Lucy was still a bit nervous. "Will you keep me safe all through the night?" she asked.
"Of course! I will watch over you and make sure you are always safe," the angel said softly.
Lucy smiled. She felt much better. Then the angel gave her a hug and said goodnight. Lucy went back to bed and woke up feeling happy and safe.
