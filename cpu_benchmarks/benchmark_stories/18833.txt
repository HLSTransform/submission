Jazz is a big dog who likes to play. He lives with Sam and his mom and dad. Sam is three years old and loves Jazz very much. They have a lot of fun together.
One day, Sam and Jazz go to the park with mom. There are many other kids and dogs there. Sam sees a swing and wants to try it. He asks mom to help him get on the swing. Mom lifts him up and puts him on the seat. She holds the swing and says, "Are you ready, Sam?"
Sam nods and says, "Yes, mom. Push me, please!"
Mom pushes the swing gently and Sam starts to swing back and forth. He feels the wind on his face and laughs. He likes the swing a lot. He says, "This is fun, mom!"
Jazz watches Sam and mom from the ground. He thinks the swing looks fun too. He wants to join them. He runs to the swing and jumps up. He tries to grab the seat with his mouth. He misses and hits the swing with his nose. The swing moves faster and Sam feels a bump. He says, "Ow, Jazz! What are you doing?"
Jazz barks and tries again. He grabs the seat and pulls it down. Sam slides off the seat and falls on the grass. He is not hurt, but he is surprised. He says, "Jazz, no! Bad dog!"
Mom runs to Sam and hugs him. She says, "Are you okay, Sam? I'm sorry, Jazz was just playing. He didn't mean to push you off the swing."
Sam looks at Jazz and sees his tail wagging. He knows Jazz is sorry too. He says, "It's okay, mom. I'm okay. Jazz is a good dog. He just wanted to swing with me."
Mom smiles and says, "I know, Sam. Jazz loves you very much. But he is too big for the swing. Maybe we can find another game for him to play."
Sam nods and says, "Okay, mom. Let's go find a ball. Jazz likes balls. He can fetch them and bring them back."
Mom says, "That's a good idea, Sam. Let's go find a ball. And maybe we can get some water too. We are all very dry after playing so much."
Sam and Jazz follow mom to the water fountain. They drink some water and feel better. Then they find a ball and play fetch. They have a lot of fun together. They are happy.
