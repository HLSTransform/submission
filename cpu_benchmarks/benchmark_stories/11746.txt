John was walking to the beach. He saw a tall man wearing a hat.
John: "Hi, do you know where I can find some oysters?"
Tall man: "Yes, I do. You'll find them by the pier."
John nodded and continued down the beach until he finally spotted the oysters by the pier. He bent down to pick one up, but the tall man quickly grabbed his shoulder. 
Tall man: "You should be careful. Oysters have sharp shells!"
John thanked the tall man and lifted an oyster with his hands. But he didn't notice that he had been surrounded by three large boys. 
One of the boys: "Hey, give us the oyster!"
John stepped back but the boys moved closer until he finally had to hand over the oyster. The boys smiled at John and walked away, soon disappearing into the sun. 
John was left without the oyster, feeling sad and very scared.
