Once there was a girl named Lucy. She was 3 years old and loved going to the movies.
One day her mommy told her she could have an extra special treat at the movies. She was so excited.
Lucyâ€™s mommy brought her to the ticket booth to buy a ticket. She asked for two tickets and got a nosy look from the worker behind the ticket booth.
The worker handed Lucy a ticket and told her to act grown up for the movie. Lucy took the ticket and smiled.
She and mommy went inside the theater and found two great seats. Lucy sat down and act grown up. She was very proud and excited to get to go to the movies. 
Lucy sat through the entire movie without saying a word. She acted like she was a grown up. She was so proud of herself.
At the end of the movie, Lucy and her mommy held hands and walked out of the theater. Lucy was so happy she got to act grown up for her special treat.
