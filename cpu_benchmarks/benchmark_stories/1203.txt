Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park every day. One day, while she was playing with her toys, she saw a white rabbit appear out of nowhere.
"Hello, little rabbit. You're so white and fluffy!" said Lily.
"Thank you," replied the rabbit. "I'm just an ordinary rabbit, but I can do some magical tricks."
"Wow, that's amazing!" exclaimed Lily. "Can you show me some tricks?"
The rabbit hopped around and did some small tricks that made Lily giggle with joy. After a while, the rabbit disappeared again, leaving Lily feeling happy and amazed. From that day on, Lily always looked out for the white rabbit, hoping to see more of its magical tricks.
