Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the big house. The big house has many stairs. Lily and Tom like to jump on the stairs.
One day, they find a new stair. It is very high and very long. Lily and Tom want to jump on it.
"Look, Tom, a new stair!" Lily says. "Let's jump on it!"
"OK, Lily, let's jump!" Tom says. "But be careful, it is very high!"
Lily and Tom run to the new stair. They jump on it. It is fun. They jump and jump and jump.
But then, Lily jumps too high. She falls off the stair. She hurts her knee. She cries.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lily says. "My knee hurts!"
Tom hears Lily cry. He runs to her. He helps her get up.
"I'm sorry, Lily, are you OK?" Tom says. "Do you want a hug?"
"Yes, Tom, I want a hug," Lily says. "Thank you for helping me."
Tom hugs Lily. He gives her a band-aid for her knee. He says sorry again.
"It's OK, Tom, it was an accident," Lily says. "But maybe we should not jump on the new stair. It is not easy. It is hard."
"Yes, Lily, you are right," Tom says. "Let's jump on the old stairs. They are easy. They are fun."
Lily and Tom go back to the old stairs. They jump on them. They are happy. They are friends.
