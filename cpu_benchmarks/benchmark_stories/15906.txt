Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Violet. She loved to go to the beach and play in the sand. 
One day when Violet was at the beach, she saw a big, orange jellyfish in the water. Violet wanted the jellyfish very much so she decided to steal it. 
Violet quietly snuck into the water and grabbed the jellyfish. But when she looked up she saw a big, mean lobster. The lobster shouted at her, "Hey! That's my jellyfish! Give it back!" 
Violet was so scared that she quickly ran back to the shore. She was so sad and tried to hide the jellyfish behind her back. 
Suddenly, a friendly dolphin swam up to her and said, "It's ok Violet, don't be scared. That lobster is only trying to protect his friends. Why don't you give him the jellyfish as a kind gift? 
Violet smiled and nodded her head. She carefully returned the jellyfish to the lobster, who was very happy and thanked her for being so kind.
From that day onwards, Violet was able to spend time with the jellyfish and the lobster in the ocean and make new friends.
The end.
