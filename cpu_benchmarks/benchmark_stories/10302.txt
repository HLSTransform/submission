Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play in the woods behind their house. They liked to climb trees, make forts and look for animals. One day, they found a big pile of lumber near a path. It was wood that someone had cut from the trees.
"Wow, look at all this lumber!" Tim said. "We can use it to make a bigger fort!"
"Or a boat!" Sam said. "Or a bridge!"
They ran to the pile and started to pick up some pieces. But then they heard a loud voice.
"Hey, you kids! Get away from my lumber!" It was a man who came out of a small hut. He looked angry and had a big saw in his hand.
"Who are you?" Tim asked. "Why do you have so much lumber?"
"None of your business!" the man said. "This is my lumber and you can't touch it! Go away or I'll call the police!"
Tim and Sam were scared. They dropped the lumber and ran back to the path. They wondered who the man was and why he was so mean. He was a mysterious man who did not like to share.
They decided to go home and tell their mom what they saw. Maybe she would know more about the man and his lumber. They hoped he would not come after them. They also hoped he would yield some of his lumber to other people who needed it.
