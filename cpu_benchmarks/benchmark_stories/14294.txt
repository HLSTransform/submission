Once upon a time there was a little girl called Jane. Jane was very adventurous. She loved to explore and discover new things.
One day, Jane found a note on the floor. She picked it up, and on it was written the word "spin". Jane was so excited by this word, she didn't know what it meant. She decided to find out.
For the next few days, Jane explored and looked for the answer. She asked everyone she knew, but nobody knew what it meant. Then one day, Jane found a spinning toy. She realised that the note was telling her to spin the toy.
"Ah ha!" shouted Jane. She quickly picked up the toy and began to spin it around. It was so much fun! She spun and spun until she was too tired to go on.
Jane was so pleased with herself - she had been very adventurous and discovered the secret of the note. She smiled, content that she had solved the mystery.
