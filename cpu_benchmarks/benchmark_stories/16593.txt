Lily and Max are playing soccer in the park. They like to kick the ball and run after it. Lily is good at scoring goals. Max is good at stopping goals.
"Max, can you be my goalie?" Lily asks. "I want to practice scoring."
"OK, Lily, I can be your goalie. You are a reliable friend," Max says. He goes to the net and waits for Lily.
Lily kicks the ball hard. It flies in the air. Max jumps and tries to catch it. But the ball is too fast. It goes over his head and into the net.
"Yay, I scored!" Lily shouts. She runs to the net and hugs the ball.
"Good job, Lily. You are a good scorer," Max says. He claps for Lily.
They play some more. Lily scores two more goals. Max stops one goal. They are having fun.
But then, they hear a loud noise. It is a dog. It is big and brown. It sees the ball and runs to it. It grabs the ball with its mouth and runs away.
"Hey, that's our ball!" Lily and Max yell. They chase the dog. They want their ball back.
The dog is fast. It runs across the park. It goes behind a tree. Lily and Max lose sight of it.
"Where did it go?" Lily asks. She is sad. She likes the ball.
"Let's search for it," Max says. He is brave. He wants to help Lily.
They look around. They see a bush. They see a bench. They see a pond. But they don't see the ball or the dog.
"Where is it?" Max asks. He is confused. He doesn't like the dog.
"Maybe it's over there," Lily says. She points to a hill. She sees something round and colorful.
They run to the hill. They climb up. They see the ball. It is on the ground. The dog is gone.
"Look, there it is!" Lily says. She is happy. She runs to the ball and picks it up.
"Yay, we found it!" Max says. He is relieved. He runs to Lily and hugs her.
They hug the ball. They are happy. They have their ball back.
They go back to the net. They play some more. They score and stop goals. They are good friends. They are good players. They are happy.
