Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Mandy. Mandy loved popcorn. One day, she went to the movies with her mom and dad. When they got to the movie theater, Mandy saw all the popcorn and she shouted with joy. She looked at her mom and dad and demanded popcorn! Her mom smiled and gave Mandy a little bag of popcorn. Mandy happily munched on the popcorn as she watched the movie. She was so happy and kept asking for more popcorn. In the end, Mandy enjoyed her little box of popcorn the whole movie long.
