Once upon a time, there was a little lamb named Daisy. She liked to play in the meadow and feel the soft, green grass beneath her feet. One day, she was playing in the meadow when she came across some wool. Daisy was frightened and started to pray.
"Oh please, help me! I'm so scared!" Daisy prayed.
Then, out of nowhere, a friendly voice spoke up. "Don't be frightened, Daisy," it said. "The wool belongs to me and I'm going to use it to make a nice warm scarf for everyone in the meadow."
Daisy was relieved. She thanked the kind voice and was no longer frightened. Everywhere she looked in the meadow, she saw happy animals wearing their warm woolly scarves. 
Daisy never forgot what happened that day, and she always took comfort in the fact that when she was frightened, someone was always there to help her.
