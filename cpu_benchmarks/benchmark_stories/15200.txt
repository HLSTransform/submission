Once upon a time, there was a messy volcano. It was very big and lived on a far away island. The volcano had lots of rocks and dirt all over it. The animals who lived near the volcano did not mind the mess. They liked to play and have fun around it.
One day, the volcano started to shake and rumble. It got very loud and all the animals got scared. They ran away to hide and watch what would happen next. The volcano was getting ready to pour something out.
The volcano poured out hot, red stuff called lava. The lava flowed down the side of the volcano and made a big, messy puddle. The animals stayed far away and watched it cool down. When it was safe, they came back to play near the messy volcano again. They were happy that the volcano was still their friend, even if it was a little messy sometimes.
