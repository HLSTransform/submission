Once upon a time, there was a little boy who really wanted a bicycle. He asked his mom and dad to get him one but they said 'no'.
He was really sad but then he remembered that he could make a bicycle himself. He found some old pieces of wood and he worked very hard to make a colorful bicycle. He was so excited and he showed it to his parents.
They were surprised that he had made it himself, but then they got angry. They said that he had used their tools and he was not allowed to do that. They said he had to get rid of the bicycle.
The little boy was so sad, but he did what his parents said and threw the colorful bicycle away. He never got the bicycle he wanted.
