There was once a little girl who loved to sing a beautiful song. Whenever she felt happy, she would sit in the sun and sing it out loud.
One day, the little girl asked her mom if she could go to the park. Her mom said yes and the little girl was so excited; she couldn't wait to get to the park and sing her song. When she arrived, she sat on the swing and started to sing.
Suddenly, the sky began to darken and the little girl noticed something frightening. It was a big, dark cloud that seemed to be getting closer and darker. She stopped singing and started to feel scared.
The little girl's mom called out to her, "We must run, it is about to rain!" The little girl got up from her seat and ran with her mom. The storm was getting stronger as they ran away from the park. Unfortunately, they didn't make it in time and they both got caught in the rain.
The little girl had a bad ending, but it was foreshadowed when the sky began to darken.
