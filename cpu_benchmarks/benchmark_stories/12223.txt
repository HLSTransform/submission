Once upon a time there was a little girl named Maisie. She had a big, fluffy pillow that she loved to sleep on. One night, Maisie heard a loud noise coming from outside her window. She got up to see what it was, and noticed that someone was trying to break into her house with a key! Maisie was scared, so she ran to get her pillow and locked the door.
Maisie then decided to call the police to help her. When the police arrived, they asked Maisie if she had seen the person who was trying to break in. Maisie told the police that the person had been very rude. 
The police took Maisie's description of the person and started looking for the suspect. After searching for a while, the police finally caught the suspect. Maisie was so happy that the police had found out who the rude person was. She hugged her pillow and thanked the police for their help.
