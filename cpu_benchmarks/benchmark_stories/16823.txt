Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice cream and always asked her mom to take her to the ice cream truck. One day, Lily's mom took her to get a cone, but it was very icy outside. 
Lily was so excited to eat her cone, but she accidentally dropped it on the ground. She was very sad and didn't know what to do. 
Suddenly, Lily's mom had an idea. She told Lily to use her hands to make a snowball and put the icy snow on top of the dropped cone. Lily was hesitant at first, but she tried it and it worked! The icy snow made the cone even better than before. 
From that day on, Lily always remembered to use the icy snow to make her cone even more delicious. She was happy that her mom taught her a new trick.
