Once upon a time, there was a little spider named Itsy. Itsy lived in a big tree with her family. One day, Itsy wanted to make a new cobweb to catch some flies for dinner. So, she climbed up to the highest branch and spun a new web. 
But, a big gust of wind came and blew Itsy's cobweb away. Itsy was sad because she worked hard on her new cobweb. Her mom told her not to worry and that they could send a message to their spider friends to help rebuild the cobweb.
So, Itsy and her family sent a message to their spider friends and soon enough, they all came together to help Itsy build a new cobweb. It was even better than the first one! Itsy was so happy and grateful for her friends' help. From that day on, Itsy knew that she could always count on her spider friends to lend a helping hand.
