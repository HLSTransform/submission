Once upon a time, there was a kind little boy named Timmy. He loved playing with his toys, but one day he accidentally broke the leg of his favorite teddy bear. Timmy was sad and didn't know what to do. 
His mom saw him crying and asked him what happened. Timmy explained that he broke his teddy bear's leg. His mom said, "Don't worry, Timmy. We can remove the broken leg and fix it." 
Timmy was happy to hear that and watched as his mom carefully removed the broken leg. She then fixed it and put it back on the teddy bear. Timmy was so happy that his favorite toy was fixed and could play with him again. 
He hugged his mom and said, "Thank you for being so kind and fixing my teddy bear's leg." His mom smiled and said, "I will always help you when you need it." And from that day on, Timmy knew that his mom was always there to help him.
