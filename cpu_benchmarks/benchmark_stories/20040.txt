Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to eat avocados. One day, Lily's mom took her to the grocery store to buy some avocados. While they were there, Lily saw a big orange balloon and she wanted it so badly.
"Lily, you can't have the balloon now. We need to buy the avocados first," said her mom.
Lily started to get upset and misbehave. "I want the balloon! I want the balloon!" she cried.
"Lily, you need to behave. We can get the balloon after we buy the avocados," said her mom calmly.
Lily took a deep breath and tried to behave. After they bought the avocados, her mom surprised her with the orange balloon. Lily was so happy and felt proud that she behaved. From that day on, Lily learned that good behavior can lead to good things.
