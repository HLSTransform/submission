Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and go on adventures. He had a special jacket that he wore on all his adventures. It was green and had lots of pockets.
One day, while Timmy was playing, he fell down and ripped his jacket. He was sad because he thought his jacket was ruined forever. But then, his dad came to him and said, "Don't worry, Timmy. We can repair your jacket!"
Timmy was happy to hear that his jacket could be fixed. His dad took the jacket and sewed it back together. Timmy was so grateful that he hugged his dad. From that day on, Timmy continued to have many adventurous days with his trusty jacket by his side.
