Lila was a polite girl who liked to help her mom in the kitchen. She loved to smell the herbs that her mom used to make yummy food. One day, her mom asked her to pick some mint from the garden.
Lila put on her hat and ran outside. She saw many green plants in the garden, but she knew which one was mint. It had small leaves and a fresh smell. She bent down and picked some leaves with her fingers. She put them in a basket and smiled.
As she was walking back to the kitchen, she saw a small bird on the fence. It was brown and white, and it had a long tail. It looked at Lila with its bright eyes and blinked. Lila blinked back and said hello.
"Hello, little girl," the bird said. "What do you have in your basket?"
Lila was surprised that the bird could talk, but she was not afraid. She was polite and answered, "I have mint. It is an herb. My mom uses it to make food."
"Can I have some?" the bird asked. "I like mint. It is good for my throat."
Lila thought for a moment. She wanted to share, but she also wanted to help her mom. She decided to give the bird one leaf. She took it out of the basket and held it out to the bird.
"Here you go," she said. "But only one, okay? I need the rest for my mom."
The bird nodded and took the leaf with its beak. It thanked Lila and flew away. Lila waved goodbye and continued to the kitchen. She was happy that she had made a new friend and that she had been polite. She hoped that the bird would come back another day.
