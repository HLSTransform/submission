Once upon a time, there was a cute baby who loved to play. One day, the baby saw a toy on a high shelf and wanted it. The baby tried to reach it, but it was too high. The baby started to struggle and cry.
The baby's mom was not home, so no one could help. The baby kept struggling until finally, the toy fell down. But when the toy hit the ground, it broke into many pieces. The baby was sad and cried even more.
The baby's mom came home and saw the broken toy. She was angry and scolded the baby. The baby felt very sad and cried all night. The end.
