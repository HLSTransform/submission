Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the sandbox and feel the thin sand between her toes. One day, her friend Timmy came to play with her.
"Can I hold your shovel, Lily?" Timmy asked.
"Sure," Lily said, handing him the shovel.
They played for a while, building castles and digging holes. But then, Timmy accidentally dropped the shovel and it hit Lily's foot.
"Ouch!" Lily cried.
"I'm sorry," Timmy said, feeling bad.
Lily's foot hurt more and more, and she had to go to the hospital. The doctors said she had a broken bone and had to wear a cast for many weeks. Lily was sad that she couldn't play in the sand anymore, and she missed her friend Timmy.
