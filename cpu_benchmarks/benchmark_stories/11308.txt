Once upon a time there was a very cheerful bunny. Every day he went to school to learn new things and play.
One day, the teacher said "class, today we are going to make a test". The bunny felt a little scared, he had never made a test before.
But the teacher was very nice and said "do not worry, I am here to help. We will practice first and see how it goes."
So the bunny tried his best, and soon he was ready to perform the test. All his classmates were cheering him on, and he felt a lot better.
At the end of the test, the bunny was very proud. He had done it! Everyone cheered and hugged him, and the bunny was very happy.
