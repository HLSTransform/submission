Once upon a time, there was a little car named Red. Red loved to travel and see new places. One day, Red's battery ran out of power, and he couldn't move anymore. Red was sad because he wanted to keep traveling. 
But then, a kind person came and gave Red a new battery. Red was so happy and grateful! He could travel again! 
However, Red became impatient because he wanted to travel to new places quickly. He tried to go faster and faster, but he realized that it was important to be patient and enjoy the journey. So, Red slowed down and enjoyed the beautiful scenery around him.
