Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore and go on adventures. One day, she came to a fork in the road. She had to choose which way to go. 
Lily asked a friendly bird, "Which way should I go?" The bird replied, "The left road is long and windy, but it leads to a rare flower field. The right road is short and straight, but it leads to a yummy berry bush."
Lily thought about it for a moment and decided to choose the left road. She wanted to see the rare flowers. She walked and walked until she finally found the field. It was filled with beautiful flowers she had never seen before! She picked some and brought them home to show her family. They were amazed and proud of her for choosing the road less traveled.
