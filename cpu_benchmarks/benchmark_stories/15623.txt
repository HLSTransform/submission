Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They like to slide on the big slide. It is fun and fast. They take turns to go down the slide.
One day, they see some tape on the slide. It is yellow and black. It says "Do not slide". Anna and Ben are curious. They want to know why the tape is there.
"Maybe the slide is broken," Anna says.
"Maybe the slide is dangerous," Ben says.
They look at the slide. It looks the same as always. They do not see anything wrong with it.
"Let's slide anyway," Anna says. "The tape is silly."
"No, Anna, we should not slide," Ben says. "The tape is there for a reason. Maybe there is something sharp or slippery on the slide. It could hurt us."
Anna does not listen to Ben. She is brave and naughty. She pulls off the tape and throws it away. She runs to the top of the slide. She sits down and slides.
"Anna, stop!" Ben shouts. But it is too late.
Anna slides down the slide. She feels something scratch her leg. She screams. She sees blood on her leg. She cries.
Ben runs to Anna. He sees a nail sticking out of the slide. The nail cut Anna's leg. He is scared and sorry.
"Anna, are you okay?" Ben asks.
"No, Ben, I am not okay," Anna says. "My leg hurts. The slide is dangerous. The tape was right. We should have listened to the tape."
Ben hugs Anna. He says he is sorry. He says he will get help. He says he loves her.
Anna and Ben learn a lesson. They learn to obey the tape. They learn to be careful and safe. They learn to slide on the other slide. It is smaller and slower. But it is also fun and safe. They are happy and smart.
