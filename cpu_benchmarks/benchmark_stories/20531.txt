Once upon a time there was a brown comet. Every night it would dance in the sky. It would twirl and leap in the night sky. It made a beautiful sight. Every night the comet would invite a friend. They would join the comet and dance in the night sky. They smiled and laughed and made a wonderful show. Animals below watched and smiled along too. After the comet's friends would leave for their homes, the comet kept dancing in the sky until the sun came up. Then the comet would go to sleep until the night time came again, when it would start dancing again.
