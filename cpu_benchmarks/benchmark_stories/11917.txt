Once upon a time, there was a cop named Bob. Bob was a very stubborn cop who never took a rest. He would work all day and all night, catching bad guys and keeping the town safe.
One day, Bob got a call about a big robbery happening at the bank. He jumped into his car and raced to the scene. When he got there, he saw the robbers running away with bags of money.
Bob chased after them, but they were too fast. He ran and ran, but he couldn't catch them. Finally, he stopped and took a rest. As he sat there catching his breath, he had an idea. He would set a trap for the robbers.
Bob went back to the bank and waited. Soon enough, the robbers came back to get more money. But this time, Bob was ready for them. He caught them and put them in jail. From that day on, Bob learned that sometimes it's important to take a rest and think things through.
