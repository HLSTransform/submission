Sara liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls with pretty dresses and long hair. She liked to comb their hair and make them talk. One day, she found a new doll in her room. It was a big doll with a red dress and black hair. Sara was happy. She wanted to play with the new doll.
She picked up the new doll and looked at her face. The doll had big eyes and a small nose. But she also had a big mouth with sharp teeth. Sara did not like the teeth. They looked scary. She tried to close the doll's mouth, but it was hard. The doll's mouth was stiff and strong.
Sara pushed harder on the doll's mouth. She wanted to make it shut. But the doll did not like that. The doll was angry. The doll bit Sara's finger. Sara felt a lot of pain. She screamed and dropped the doll. She looked at her finger. There was blood. The doll had snapped her nail. Sara cried and ran to her mom.
Mom saw Sara's finger and was worried. She took Sara to the bathroom and washed her finger. She put a bandage on it and gave Sara a hug. She asked Sara what happened. Sara told her about the new doll and how it bit her. Mom was shocked. She went to Sara's room and saw the new doll on the floor. The doll had a fierce smile on its face. Mom did not like the doll. She threw it in the trash.
Sara never played with the new doll again. She was afraid of it. She only played with her old dolls. They were nice and gentle. They did not bite her. Sara learned to be careful with new things. She did not want to get hurt again.
