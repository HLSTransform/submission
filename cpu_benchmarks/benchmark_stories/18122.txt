Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a bright yellow dress and loved to play outside. One day, she went to the park and saw two boys fighting over a toy truck.
Lily went up to them and asked, "Why are you fighting? Can't you share the truck?"
The boys stopped and looked at each other. "I want to play with it first," said one boy.
The other boy crossed his arms and said, "But I had it first!"
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I have an idea. Let's take turns playing with the truck. That way, everyone can have a turn."
The boys smiled and agreed. They played together for the rest of the day and had lots of fun. From that day on, Lily became friends with the two boys and they never fought again.
