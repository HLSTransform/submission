Once upon a time there was a girl named Amy. She was three years old and she really loved her shirt. Every morning she put it on and was ready to start the day. 
One day, her mom was getting ready to do some chores when she found Amy's shirt. It was all crumpled up and dirty. Her mom knew that Amy cared about it so much and decided to wash it for her. 
Amy wanted to wear it right away, but her mom said it would take time to get it clean and ready. But Amy wasn't ready to wait. She got angry and tried to take it back.
Her mom explained that she was just trying to take care of the shirt and that Amy needed to be patient. Finally, Amy understood and waited for her shirt to be ready. When it was, she was so happy that she couldn't wait to put it on. 
The shirt was now fresh and clean and Amy was smiling from ear to ear!
