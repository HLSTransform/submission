Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play outside on the swings. She would swing back and forth, feeling the wind in her hair. One day, she went to the grocery store with her mom. They needed some food for dinner. Lily saw lots of yummy fruits and vegetables. She helped her mom pick out the dependable ones. When they got home, Lily went back to swinging on her swing. She felt happy and full of energy from the healthy food they bought at the grocery store.
