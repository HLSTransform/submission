Mom and Dad were playing a game of football with their little girl. She was very excited, jumping up and down. She shouted, "I want to play too!"
Mom smiled, "Of course you can join us! We'll save a spot for you!"
The little girl ran over to the football and grabbed it with her tiny hands. She pumped her legs and ran long and fast. She laughed joyfully as she kicked the ball far away. 
Suddenly, the ball rolled into a deep hole. The little girl gasped "Oh no! How can we save the football?" 
Mom and Dad put their heads together and came up with a plan. Mom reached into the hole and grabbed the ball. Then, Dad and the little girl pulled Mom out of the hole. The little girl cheered, happy to have saved the football!
