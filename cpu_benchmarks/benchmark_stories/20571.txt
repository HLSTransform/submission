Once there was a bear. He was black and very furry. He was walking through a forest and found a rock on the ground. It was hard and grey. The bear touched the rock with his paw. The bear wanted to kiss it. So he gave it a big kiss! Then the rock changed. It turned black and shiny in the sunlight. The bear was very happy. He kissed the black rock again. Then he hugged it and went on his way.
