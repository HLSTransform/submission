Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. One day, she saw a shiny rock on the ground. It made her smile because it was so pretty and it shone in the sun.
When Lily went back inside her house, she went to the refrigerator to get a cold drink of water. She opened the door and felt the cold air. It made her shiver, but she was happy to have a nice, cold drink.
Later that day, Lily went back outside and found that the shiny rock was still there. She picked it up and put it in her pocket. She knew that it would make her smile every time she saw it shine.
