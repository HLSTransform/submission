Once upon a time there was a little girl called Betty. She loved to sail on her paper boat.
One day, she found a long rag in the back garden. She decided to use it to sail her paper boat.
Betty put the long rag in the water and asked her paper boat to sail away.
The paper boat said, "I can't sail away without any wind!"
Betty smiled and said, "I know just what to do!" She put the long rag up in the air and it caught the wind.
The paper boat sailed away with Betty holding on, the long rag streaming in the wind behind her.
The paper boat sailed on and on, until they reached a secret island where they found a treasure chest. Inside the chest was the most beautiful pink pearl.
Betty smiled and said, "This is the best sailing adventure ever!"
