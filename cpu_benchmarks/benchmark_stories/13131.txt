One day it was raining outside. The rain was coming down hard. Everyone got ready to stay inside.
But there was one little boy who wanted to go outside and explore. So he put on his raincoat and went out into the forest. He saw all the green trees and the clean leaves.
The rain was coming down even harder, but he kept walking. He found a big mud puddle and splashed in it. He laughed and laughed.
He kept walking and found a treehouse. It was dry inside, so he climbed up and went inside for a rest. It was cozy and comfy.
He stayed there for a while, until the rain stopped. He looked out of the window and saw a rainbow. He smiled as he watched it.
Finally, when the sun appeared, the little boy went back home. He had had such a wonderful day in the clean forest.
