Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the beautiful sunshine. One day, her friends invited her to a party at the park. Lily was so excited to go! She put on her favorite dress and waited for her mom to arrive. 
When her mom arrived, they drove to the park. Lily saw a lot of balloons and decorations. There were a number of kids playing games and eating cake. Lily's friends were so happy to see her. They played together and had so much fun. 
As the sun began to set, it was time to go home. Lily was sad to leave, but she knew she would see her friends again soon. She hugged them goodbye and her mom took her home. Lily fell asleep in the car, dreaming of the beautiful party she had just been to.
