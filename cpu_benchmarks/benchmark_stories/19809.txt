Once there was a beautiful goose. She was white with a yellow beak. She loved to go around and do lots of things. One day, she went walking in the park. She saw a big pond, and decided to go swimming. She spread her wings and glided across the water. She had so much fun! When she was done, she flew off again. This time she went to the farm. She saw some other geese and asked them to come join her. They all had a great time playing together in the grass. Suddenly, a farmer came by and saw them all. The goose quickly flew away and the other geese ran off into the woods. The beautiful goose had a wonderful day and she never forgot it.
