Timmy was very troubled. He was trying to score the most points in a game, but he wasn't doing very well. He was getting more and more sad. Suddenly, he heard a voice.
"Don't worry, Timmy. I can help you," it said.
Timmy looked around and saw a big bear. He was smiling at him.
The bear said, "Let me lead you. I'll help you get more points!"
Timmy followed the bear and soon he was getting lots of points. He was so happy!
At the end of the game, Timmy was smiling. He had scored the most points in the game! He thanked the bear for leading him and the bear said, "You're very welcome!"
