Once upon a time, there was a big, fluffy cow named Moppy. Moppy was very happy and enjoyed eating her favorite snack--hay.
One day Moppy heard a sad mooing coming from outside. She wanted to help, so she wobbled over to see what was going on. 
On the edge of the farm, she saw a sad little calf named Archie. He was all alone and suffering. Moppy noticed that Archie was very hungry and she wanted to help.
Moppy said, “Would you like some hay? I know it's not as tasty as your mama's milk, but it'll fill you up.”
Archie looked at Moppy, thankful for her offer and said, “Yes, please, I am very hungry.”
Moppy smiled, happy that she could help. She gave Archie the big pile of hay and he ate until he was full. Moppy was glad that she could help him and Archie was happy that he no longer had to suffer. 
The end.
