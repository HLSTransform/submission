Timmy was outside playing in the garden yesterday. He liked to jump high and feel the wind rush past him as he flew up in the air. His mom was watching him from the garden bench, feeling uncomfortable as she saw him jump above the flowers.
"Timmy be careful! You're going to tire yourself out.", his mom shouted.
But Timmy didn't listen. He just kept jumping higher and higher.
"I can jump higher than the clouds, mom!", he shouted back. 
His mom smiled, shaking her head with a laugh.
"No, you can't! You should come down now.", she said.
But Timmy didn't want to. He wanted to keep jumping until the sun set. In the end, his mom had to come and pick him up, telling him it was time to go inside. Reluctantly, Timmy stopped jumping and the two of them went inside together.
