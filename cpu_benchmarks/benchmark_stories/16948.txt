Lily and Sam were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide on the grass. It was a hot day, so they were very thirsty. They saw a water fountain near the swings. "Let's go drink some water!" Lily said. Sam nodded and followed her.
They ran to the fountain and took turns to drink. The water was cold and fresh. They felt better. But when they turned around, they saw a big dog. The dog was barking and running towards them. It looked angry. Lily and Sam were scared. They tried to run away, but the dog was faster.
The dog jumped on Lily and knocked her down. She fell on the ground and hurt her knee. It was bleeding. She cried out loud. Sam ran to help her. He grabbed a stick and waved it at the dog. "Go away, bad dog!" he shouted. The dog was afraid of the stick. It ran away.
Sam helped Lily get up. He saw her knee. It was red and sore. He felt sorry for her. He took her to the fountain and washed her knee with water. It stung a little, but it also felt good. He found a tissue in his pocket and wrapped it around her knee. "There, that will help it dry," he said. Lily smiled and hugged him. "Thank you, Sam. You are a good friend," she said. Sam smiled back. "You're welcome, Lily. Come on, let's go find our moms. They will make it better," he said. They held hands and walked to the bench where their moms were sitting. They were happy to see them. They told them what happened. Their moms hugged them and praised them for being brave and kind. They gave them some juice and cookies. They felt better. They forgot about the dog and the hot day. They only remembered their friendship.
