Once upon a time there lived a boy named Tony. He was just three years old and very happy to get invites.
One day Tony received an invitation. He was so excited, he grabbed it and ran to show it to his mom. It was an invitation to a party!
Tony's mom was very flexible. She said he could go to the party, but he had to repeat the rules she gave him. He listened very, very carefully and said them back just like she said.
So Tony went to the party. He had a wonderful time! He shared the news with his mom when he got home. She smiled and said how proud she was of him for repeating the rules.
The End.
