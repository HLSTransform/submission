Once there was a bear who was very healthy. He was walking through the forest one day, looking for something to eat. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise behind him. The bear turned around to see a lion on his tail. The lion had a big, scary face and roared like a thunder. The bear was scared, so he started to run. 
The lion followed the bear through the trees and across the fields. The bear was so scared, he didn't know what to do. He knew the lion wasn't being friendly and was a threat to him.
The bear ran as fast as his legs could carry him and kept on running for a long time. Suddenly, he came upon a cave. Without thinking twice, the bear ran inside. The cave was dark and damp, but it was perfect for the bear to hide from the lion. 
The bear stayed in the cave for sometime until he was sure the lion had gone away. After an hour or so he came out. It was then that the bear realised how lucky he had been. He was safe and he had been kept away from the threat of the lion. 
The bear continued his journey through the forest, but this time he was more careful. He was determined to stay healthy and safe.
