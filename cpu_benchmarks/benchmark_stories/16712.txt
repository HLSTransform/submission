Mia and Leo like to play in the garden. They see many flowers that bloom. They are colorful and pretty. Mia and Leo want to pick some flowers for their mom.
But Mia and Leo are competitive. They want to have more flowers than the other. They run and pull and grab the flowers. They do not share or say sorry.
A fly sees them and buzzes around. The fly likes the flowers too. But the fly does not like Mia and Leo. They are loud and mean. The fly wants to teach them a lesson.
The fly lands on Mia's nose and tickles her. Mia sneezes and drops her flowers. The fly lands on Leo's ear and whispers. Leo gets scared and drops his flowers. The fly laughs and flies away.
Mia and Leo look at their flowers on the ground. They feel sad and silly. They wasted the flowers and hurt the plants. They look at each other and say sorry. They hug and smile. They decide to pick some flowers together and share them with their mom. They are not competitive anymore. They are happy and kind.
