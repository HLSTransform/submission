Once upon a time there were two best friends. One was called Meg and the other was called Ray.
Ray had a special jacket which he loved. It was made from a super soft material that kept him really warm.
One day, it was icy cold outside and Ray felt like going for a walk. But when Meg saw Ray's jacket, she asked if she could borrow it. Ray said yes and the two set off.
But when the two got to the park, Ray realized that his jacket was not on him anymore. Someone had taken it! Meg and Ray tried to search for his jacket but it was impossible to find it in the snow.
Suddenly, the two heard some voices and saw two kids running away with Ray's jacket. Ray knew his jacket was being stolen! The two ran as fast as they could and when they caught up, Ray grabbed hold of his jacket and they both ran away.
Meg and Ray were so relieved they had escaped with Ray's jacket. Ray was glad his very special jacket was safe. The two friends were very happy and decided to never let go of the jacket ever again!
