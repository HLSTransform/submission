Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play in the snow, but her hands always got cold. So, her mom decided to make her some mittens. They were pink and fluffy, and Lily loved them very much.
One day, Lily went outside to play in the snow with her new mittens. She built a snowman and had a snowball fight with her friends. Then, her mom called her inside for a snack. She made Lily a tasty sandwich with peanut butter and jelly.
Lily was happy and warm with her mittens and her tasty sandwich. She smiled and hugged her mom, saying "Thank you for my mittens, Mommy. They make me so happy!"
