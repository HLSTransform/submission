Tom and Lily are playing in the park with their ball. They like to kick the ball to each other and catch it. Sometimes the ball goes too far and they have to run after it.
One time, the ball goes over the fence and onto the road. The road is noisy and busy with cars and trucks. Tom wants to get the ball back, so he runs towards the fence.
Lily sees Tom and gets scared. She shouts to him, "Tom, stop! The road is dangerous! You have to warn me before you go!"
Tom hears Lily and stops at the fence. He looks at the road and sees the cars and trucks zooming by. He feels scared too. He says to Lily, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't think. The ball is too far. We can't get it."
Lily runs to Tom and hugs him. She says, "It's okay, Tom. I'm glad you're safe. The ball is not important. We can play with something else."
They go back to the park and find a swing. They take turns pushing each other and laughing. They forget about the ball and the road. They are happy.
