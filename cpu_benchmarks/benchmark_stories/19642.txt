Once upon a time, there was a silly little girl named Sarah. She went on a camping trip to a cabin in the woods. Sarah was very excited to explore the woods, but it was very dark and spooky. 
When Sarah entered the cabin, she started to shiver. She had never been so scared! She thought she heard something moving around. Then suddenly, a giant owl flew in the window and scared her even more! 
Sarah ran outside, screaming. She ran around the cabin and tried to find safety. Finally, she found a tall tree and hid in it. From way up high, she could see everything. She felt safe. 
Sarah stayed in the tree until the morning. When the sun rose, the little girl felt brave again. She climbed down the tree and returned to the cabin. She was no longer scared, and she remembered how silly she had been the night before.
