Once upon a time there lived a little boy named Sam. He had a puppy named Larry and a kitten named Henry.
Sam wanted to go out to the park and play, but he was a bit nervous. He had never gone out alone before.
So, he asked his mom, “Can I please go to the park?” His mom said yes and gave him some rules to follow.
Sam said goodbye to his mom, then took Larry and Henry with him. As he opened the door, he felt excited and nervous at the same time.
At the park, he had so much fun! He played with Larry and Henry, running around, laughing and chasing each other. But after a while, Sam started to feel tired.
He said to Larry and Henry, “Let’s please go home now.”
On the way home, Sam wasn’t nervous anymore. He couldn’t wait to tell his mom about his first time at the park. He knew she would be so proud of him!
