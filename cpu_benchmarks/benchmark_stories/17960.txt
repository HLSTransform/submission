Once upon a time, there was an interesting little dog named Max. Max liked to play outside in the sun. One day, Max found a pipe in the yard.
Max thought the pipe was fun to play with. He tried to get the pipe with his mouth. Max ran around with the pipe, wagging his tail.
Max's friend, a little girl named Lily, saw Max with the pipe. Lily and Max played with the pipe together. They had a great day and lots of fun.
