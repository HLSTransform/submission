Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a bicycle that he loved to ride every day. One day, Tim saw a wise old man sitting on a bench. The old man had a long white beard and a kind smile.
Tim rode his bicycle over to the old man and said hello. The old man looked at Tim and said, "You are a smart young boy." Tim felt proud when he heard this.
Suddenly, a big fly landed on Tim's nose. Tim tried to swat the fly away, but it wouldn't go. The old man saw Tim struggling and said, "Sometimes, when a fly won't go, you have to give it a little slap." Tim followed the old man's advice and the fly flew away.
Tim thanked the old man and rode his bicycle home, feeling happy and wise.
