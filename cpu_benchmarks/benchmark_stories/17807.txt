John wanted to ride his kite. Every day he went to the park and he would fly it in the sky. His kite was yellow and very big. One day when he was flying it, he got so tired that he had to sit down and rest. He stayed in the park for a long time and enjoyed the fresh air. When he was done, he took his kite and went home. He was so happy that he had the chance to ride his kite that day.
