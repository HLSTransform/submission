Once upon a time, there was a frog. He was very sleepy, so he hopped around looking for a place to rest. He hopped and hopped until he saw a big pond. He hopped into the pond and soon fell asleep.
The frog was so sleepy that he changed. His skin started to change color, and he noticed he was getting bigger too. He started to look like a different frog! But he was still sleepy.
He decided to go find something yummy to eat. He hopped around the pond, looking for bugs and beetles. He found lots of yummy food, but he was still very sleepy.
He decided he must find a cozy place to sleep. He hopped around until he found the perfect place. It was a big, leafy tree. He curled up in the leaves and quickly fell asleep. 
The frog changed from being sleepy to being wide awake. He enjoyed his new home in the big, leafy tree.
