Once upon a time, there was a furry puppy named Max. Max loved to run and play in the park. One day, Max saw a big plane flying in the sky.
Max barked excitedly, "Look, look! Plane up high!"
His owner, Lily, smiled and said, "Yes, Max. That's a plane. It's flying very far away."
Max wagged his tail and ran around in circles. He was so happy to see the big, shiny plane up in the sky. From that day on, Max would always look up at the sky, hoping to see another plane fly by.
