Sandra and her parents were walking through the forest one day. It was a warm, sunny day and Sandra was excited to explore. Suddenly she noticed an insect and became very curious. She wanted to take a closer look, so she took a few steps towards it. She was amazed by its tiny wings and its colorful body, but then she became frightened when it started to fly away.
"Sandra, be careful," warned her mother. 
Sandra heeded her mother's advice and stepped back. But then her foot landed on something soft and slimy. It was a strange feeling and Sandra felt a bit scared. Then she looked down and saw that it was a huge snake. She screamed and backed away in fear.
Her father put his arm around her and tried to comfort her. "It's okay, sweetheart," he said. "That's why I told you to be careful out here. It's the home of many insects and wild animals, so you must be careful when exploring." He smiled and held her close.
After that, Sandra became more aware of her surroundings. She knew to be careful and she felt safer when she was with her parents. Sandra felt much better now that she had learned her lesson. She never wanted to be frightened by an insect ever again.
