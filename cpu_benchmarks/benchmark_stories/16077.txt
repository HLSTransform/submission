Timmy was three and running down the hallway. He was playing a game where he pretended to be a race car. He was going so fast that his parents couldn't keep up with him.
Suddenly, Timmy heard a loud sound. He froze and looked around. He saw a strange contraption with a red laser. He was scared.
Timmy started to cry and ran back to his parents. His mom put her arm around him and said, "It's ok, honey. It's just a laser pointer. It's used to play games with the cats!"
Timmy nodded his head and wiped his tears away. His mom said, "Come on, let's go back to the bedroom. You look so tired." 
Timmy was relieved to hear that and followed his mom down the hallway. He knew that nothing would scare him anymore.
