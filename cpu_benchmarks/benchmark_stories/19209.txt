Once upon a time, there was a big fat cat named Whiskers. Whiskers liked to eat a lot of food every day. One day, Whiskers' owner gave him some vegetables to eat, but Whiskers refused to eat them. 
Whiskers wanted to eat only his favorite food, which was fish. He would eat fish every day if he could. But his owner said that he needed to eat vegetables too, so he could be healthy and strong. 
Whiskers didn't like the idea of eating vegetables, but he knew his owner was right. So, he decided to try the vegetables and see if he liked them. To his surprise, he found that he actually enjoyed them! From that day on, Whiskers ate both fish and vegetables every day, and he felt much healthier and happier.
