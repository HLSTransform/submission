Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a red wagon that he loved to play with. One day, he decided to take his wagon for a walk in the park. 
As he was walking, he saw a man sitting on a bench looking sad. Timmy wanted to make the man happy, so he went up to him and said, "Hi! Do you want to play with my wagon?" 
The man smiled and said, "Yes, I would love to." They played together for a while and the man felt much better. He thanked Timmy and said, "You are very kind. You answered my prayers for a peaceful moment." 
Timmy didn't understand what the man meant, but he was happy that he could make someone smile. From that day on, Timmy always brought his wagon to the park, hoping to make more people happy.
