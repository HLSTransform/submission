Once upon a time there was a tube in the garden. It belonged to a boy called Sam. He liked to play with it but one day it didn't seem to work anymore.
Sam wasn't sure what to do and he was feeling very sad. Then his best friend Annie came over and she had an idea. "Let's joke with the tube", she said.
So they put their hands on the tube and made it spin around. And soon the tube was spinning around the garden, making them laugh and have lots of fun.
But then something terrible happened. The tube flew off and broke into pieces. Sam and Annie were so sad but they soon laughed when Annie said, "Well, that was a terrible joke!"
