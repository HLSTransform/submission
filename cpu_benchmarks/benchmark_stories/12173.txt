Once upon a time, there was little boy called John. He liked to find treasures and hide them in the garden. One day he found a smooth page and he couldn't wait to hide it.
John went outside and he started to bury the page in the ground. It was not easy. He used his tiny hands to dig the hole and he worked very hard.
John's father saw him and said, "What are you doing, John?"
John looked up and he said, "I am burying a smooth page for safe-keeping".
John's father smiled and he helped John to bury the page in the ground.
They said goodbye to the page and went inside.
John was so happy that he had found something special and buried it in the garden.
