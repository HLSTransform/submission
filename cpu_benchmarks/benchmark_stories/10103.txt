Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and balls. One day, they see a big map on the wall. The map has many colors and shapes.
"What is that?" Tom asks.
"That is a map. It shows many countries. Countries are big places where people live," Sam says.
"Wow, how do you know that?" Tom says.
"My dad told me. He knows a lot. He says some countries are strong and some are weak. Strong countries have many things and can do many things. Weak countries have few things and can do few things," Sam says.
"Which country are we in?" Tom asks.
"We are in this one," Sam points to a shape on the map. "It is a strong country. We have many things and can do many things."
"I want to be in a strong country too," Tom says.
"You are. We are in the same country," Sam says.
"No, I want to be in a different strong country. That one," Tom points to another shape on the map. "It has a nice color and a cool name."
"That is a weak country. You don't want to be there. They have few things and can do few things. They are not happy," Sam says.
"Yes, I do. I like that country. It is better than ours," Tom says.
"No, it is not. Our country is better than theirs. You are silly," Sam says.
They start to argue. They push and pull the map. They tear the map. They make a big mess.
"Stop! Stop!" a voice says.
It is their teacher. She sees the map and the mess. She is angry.
"What did you do? Why did you do that?" she asks.
Tom and Sam are quiet. They are scared. They are sorry. They did a bad thing.
