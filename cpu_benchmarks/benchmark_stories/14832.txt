Anna likes to play hide and seek with her big brother Tom. Tom is very good at finding Anna, but Anna is also good at hiding. One day, they play hide and seek in the kitchen. Anna sees a big green avocado on the table. She has an idea.
She picks up the avocado and runs to the cupboard. She opens the door and goes inside. She puts the avocado on her head and closes the door. She thinks Tom will not find her there.
Tom counts to ten and then looks for Anna. He looks under the table, behind the sofa, in the closet, but he cannot find her. He wonders where she is. He goes to the kitchen and sees the avocado is gone. He thinks that is strange.
He hears a giggle from the cupboard. He opens the door and sees Anna with the avocado on her head. He laughs and says, "I found you, Anna! You are very funny. But why did you take the avocado?"
Anna takes the avocado off her head and says, "I wanted to hide with it. It is green like me. And it is helpful. It makes me healthy and strong."
Tom smiles and says, "You are right, Anna. Avocado is very helpful. And you are very smart. But now it is my turn to hide. Can you find me?"
Anna nods and says, "Yes, I can. You better hide well, Tom. I will count to ten. One, two, three..."
