Once upon a time there was a girl who wanted to be successful. She thought and thought about what to do, but nothing seemed to work. One night, when she was feeling very sad, she saw something sparkly in the sky and decided to make a wish.
"I wish to be successful," she said.
Suddenly a magical button appeared in the sky and floated down towards her. She grabbed it and saw that it had "success" written on it. She decided to press the button and a cloud of sparkles surrounded her!
The next day, the girl felt so happy. Everything was perfect and she was more successful than ever before. She was so happy with her success, she decided to sleep in a little longer.
After a good night's sleep, the girl was feeling even more successful and smiled. She looked up at the sky and thanked the magical button for giving her the chance at success. The girl was so happy with her success, she decided to keep the button forever!
