Once upon a time there was a mighty sea. It was very big and blue. All the animals loved playing in the sea. 
The sea was home to lots of fish. Some fish were small and some were big.
Every day the fish would mind the sea. They would swim around and explore.
At night the stars would shine on the mighty sea. They looked like giggly candles that shimmered in the sky.
The fish would travel all around the sea, looking for new things each day. They had so much fun and didn't ever want to leave.
The sea was a special place and the fish were so happy to be living in the mighty sea.
