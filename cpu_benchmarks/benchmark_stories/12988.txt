Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Daisy. She loved to skip along the sidewalk, her pigtails bouncing as she went. One day, Daisy came across a small pond.
She stopped to look around and noticed a little fish swimming near the surface of the water. "What are you doing, fishy?" Daisy asked.
The fish said, “I’m waiting for some tasty fuel to help me swim.” Daisy thought for a moment and then smiled. She took a handful of breadcrumbs from her pocket and skipped over to the pond.
“Here!” she said, scattering the breadcrumbs over the water. The fish gobbled up the delicious little pieces. 
Daisy smiled. “Remember,” she said, “sharing is caring. If something is yours to share, help other people too!” 
The fish swam around happily and thanked Daisy for her kind act. 
The moral of the story is that is important to share what you have with others.
