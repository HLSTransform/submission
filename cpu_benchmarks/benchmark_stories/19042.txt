Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the mall with his mom. They would buy toys and eat yummy treats together. One day, Timmy saw a big, high slide in the mall's play area. He wanted to go down it so badly, but his mom said he was too small.
Timmy felt sad and angry. He wanted to solve the problem of being too small. He saw a big, heavy box nearby and got an idea. He climbed on top of the box and felt taller. He thought he could reach the slide now. But as he climbed up the slide, he lost his balance and fell down, hurting himself badly.
Timmy's mom rushed him to the hospital, where the doctors tried to help him. But it was too late. Timmy had hurt himself too badly and couldn't be saved. His mom was heartbroken and wished she had never taken him to the mall that day. From then on, she always made sure to keep a closer eye on Timmy and never let him out of her sight.
