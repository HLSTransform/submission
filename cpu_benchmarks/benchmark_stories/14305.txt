Jimmy was a happy little boy. He loved to go outside and play in the sunshine. He loved to skip and run around the park - it was so much fun!
Today, Jimmy was looking for his favorite spot in the park. He wanted to find the shade - it was usually so nice and cool there. As he skipped around the park, he spotted the shade. It was a big and clear tree with a lot of branches.
Jimmy was so excited to find his favorite spot. He ran to it and stood in the shade, feeling so happy and content. He jumped and skipped around the tree, singing and laughing in the sunshine.
Before he left, he stopped to take one last look at his favorite spot in the park. He smiled, thanked the tree and said goodbye, before skipping home.
