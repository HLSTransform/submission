Anna likes to play with her doll. She has a pink comb for her doll's hair. She combs her doll's hair every day. She makes her doll look pretty.
One day, Anna's brother Tom comes into her room. He is naughty. He sees the comb on the floor. He picks it up and runs away. He laughs and says, "This is my comb now!"
Anna is angry. She runs after Tom. She says, "Give me back my comb! It is not yours! It is for my doll!" Tom does not listen. He shakes the comb in the air. He says, "No, it is mine! I like to shake it! It makes a funny noise!"
Anna tries to catch Tom. She jumps and reaches for the comb. But Tom is too fast. He runs around the room. He shakes the comb harder and harder. He says, "Ha ha ha! You can't get it!"
Anna is sad. She cries. She says, "Please, Tom, give me back my comb! You are hurting it! It is not a toy! It is for my doll's hair!"
Tom stops. He sees Anna's tears. He feels sorry. He says, "I'm sorry, Anna. I was just playing. Here is your comb. I won't shake it anymore."
He gives the comb back to Anna. Anna smiles. She says, "Thank you, Tom. You are a good brother. I love you." She hugs Tom. She takes the comb and goes back to her doll. She combs her doll's hair gently. She says, "Don't worry, doll. Your hair is still pretty. I will take care of you."
