Once upon a time there was a little girl who liked to dream. She dreamed of all sorts of different things, like trees and flowers, animals and toys. 
One chilly winter day, the little girl put on her warmest, most fit clothes and headed outside into the winter air. As she looked around, she saw snowflakes gently falling all around her. The little girl started spinning round and round, spreading her arms out wide. 
In the middle of all these snowflakes, the little girl found herself dreaming that she was a snow fairy. She spun faster and faster, and it made her so happy that she smiled the biggest smile she had ever smiled. 
As she spun, the snowflakes got caught up in her spun and she could feel the cold snow on her skin. Before long the little girl was laughing and feeling so carefree. 
When the little girl’s dream was over, she opened her eyes and looked around. But the snow was still all around her and the winter air was still chilly. She smiled to herself and said “Well, that was a fun dream!” And with that, she went off on her way.
