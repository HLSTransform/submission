Tom and Lily are twins. They like to play outside. One day, they go to the lake with Mom and Dad. The lake is big and blue. There are ducks and fish in the lake.
Tom and Lily see a boat. The boat is orange. It has a sail and a flag. Tom and Lily want to go on the boat. They ask Mom and Dad.
"Can we go on the boat, please?" they say.
Mom and Dad say, "No, you can't. The boat is not ours. It belongs to someone else. You have to ask before you touch things that are not yours. That is polite and kind."
Tom and Lily are sad. They want to have fun on the boat. They think Mom and Dad are not fair. They wait until Mom and Dad are not looking. Then they run to the boat. They climb on the boat. They pretend to be pirates.
"Arrr, we are the captains of the boat!" they say. "We can go wherever we want!"
They pull the sail and the flag. They make loud noises. They do not see the man who owns the boat. The man is angry. He comes to the boat. He shouts at Tom and Lily.
"Hey, what are you doing on my boat?" he says. "You have no right to be here. You are breaking my sail and my flag. You are making a mess. Get off my boat right now!"
Tom and Lily are scared. They jump off the boat. They run to Mom and Dad. They are sorry for what they did. They say sorry to the man. They say sorry to Mom and Dad.
Mom and Dad are not happy. They hug Tom and Lily. They say, "We love you, but you did a bad thing. You have to respect other people's things. You have to listen to us. We are here to keep you safe and teach you good manners. Next time, do not go on the boat without asking. Do you understand?"
Tom and Lily nod. They understand. They learn their lesson. They say, "We understand. We will not do it again. We are sorry. We love you."
The end.
