Once upon a time, there was a furry little bear. His name was Timmy. Every night, Timmy would dream of wonderful, magical things. He would dream of flying in the sky and hopping on the clouds.
One night, the most amazing thing happened to Timmy. He had a special dream. His dream told Timmy that he could perform like a real circus bear! He was so excited.
The next day, Timmy couldn't wait. He practiced a few of his tricks over and over again. He practiced walking on a ball and balancing on a stick. He was so determined that he even practiced when it was raining!
Finally, after lots and lots of practice, Timmy was ready. He took a big deep breath and stepped out onto the circus stage. Timmy smiled and waved to the audience before performing all of his awesome tricks!
The crowd cheered and clapped. Timmy felt so proud of himself! He had taken his dream and made it real. Even his furry little self could perform like a real circus bear!
