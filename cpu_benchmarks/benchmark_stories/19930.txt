Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a sister named Rose who was very fragile. One day, Lily asked her mommy if they could visit Rose. Mommy said yes and they got in the car. 
When they arrived, Rose was happy to see them. She showed Lily her dolls and they played together. But Lily had to be careful not to play too rough with Rose's fragile toys. 
After they played, they all had a snack together. Lily and Rose had cookies and milk. Then it was time to go home. Lily hugged her sister goodbye and promised to visit again soon.
