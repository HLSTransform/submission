Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she found a shiny object on the ground. It was a microscope! Lily had never seen one before, but she knew it was special. 
She brought the microscope home and showed it to her mom. Her mom was very proud of her for finding such a cool thing. But Lily's little brother, Timmy, wanted to play with it too. He grabbed the microscope from Lily's hands and accidentally dropped it. It made a loud noise and broke into pieces. 
Lily was very sad and regretted showing the microscope to Timmy. She wished she had kept it to herself. But her mom hugged her and told her it was okay. She said they would find a way to fix the microscope, or maybe even get a new one. Lily felt a little better knowing that her mom understood how she felt.
