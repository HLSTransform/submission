Lila was a dancer. She liked to dance with music and wear pretty dresses. She had many friends who were dancers too. They learned new moves from their teacher.
One day, Lila saw a shiny trophy in the teacher's office. She asked, "What is that?"
The teacher said, "That is a prize for the best dancer. There is a big show next week. The dancers who do well will get a trophy."
Lila wanted a trophy. She thought she was the best dancer. She practiced hard every day. She wanted to fit in the best dress and do the best moves.
But some of her friends were competitive too. They also wanted a trophy. They practiced hard too. They wanted to fit in the best dress and do the best moves.
On the day of the show, Lila and her friends wore their best dresses. They danced with music and smiled. The teacher and the judges watched them.
Lila did very well. She fit in her dress and did her moves. But so did her friends. They fit in their dresses and did their moves. Lila did not know who would get the trophy.
When the show was over, the teacher and the judges announced the winners. They gave trophies to Lila and her friends. They said, "You are all the best dancers. You worked hard and had fun. You are all winners."
Lila and her friends were happy. They hugged each other and thanked the teacher and the judges. They did not care who fit in the best dress or did the best moves. They cared about being dancers and friends.
