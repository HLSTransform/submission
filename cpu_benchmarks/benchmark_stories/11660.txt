Once there was a boy called Tom. He wanted to decorate his house. So he got some stamps and chose the best one. But then he slipped and the stamp got stuck in his arm. It really hurt.
Tom started crying as the pain was too much for him. His mum came and saw what had happened. She knew that the stamp was too deep and it was very dangerous. 
Tom's mum took him to the hospital. They could not remove the stamp out of his arm. Tom felt really sad and he did not know what to do. 
The doctor said that Tom would need to live with the stamp in his arm. And the stamp would never come out. Tom was very unhappy. He never wanted to decorate his house again.
