Once upon a time, there was a van. It was filled with things that belonged to the family that lived there. One day, the van had to go away. It was very sad when it had to leave.
The van was gone for a long time. When it returned, it was filled with items that made the family feel terrible. the family was very unhappy.
But the family didn't give up. They worked together to fix up the van and make it look better. Soon enough, the van was beautiful like it used to be. 
Everyone was so happy to have the van back and the terrible items were gone. The family enjoyed riding in it and spending time together. 
The end.
