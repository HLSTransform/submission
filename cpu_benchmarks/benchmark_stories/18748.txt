Sara and Ben are friends who like to travel. They have a big map with many places to see. One day, they decide to go to the jungle. They pack some food, water and a camera. They are very excited.
They take a bus to the jungle. They see many trees, flowers and animals. They hear birds and monkeys. They walk on a path and look for new things. They find a big vine that hangs from a tree. Ben says, "Look, Sara, a vine! We can swing on it like Tarzan!"
Sara says, "That sounds fun, Ben. But be careful. The vine may be weak or have thorns." Ben says, "Don't worry, Sara. I am strong and brave. Watch me!" He grabs the vine and swings in the air. He laughs and shouts, "Whee!"
But then, something bad happens. The vine breaks and Ben falls to the ground. He lands on a pile of leaves. He is not hurt, but he is scared and dirty. He says, "Help, Sara, help! I am stuck and helpless!"
Sara runs to Ben and helps him up. She says, "Oh, Ben, are you okay? You were very silly to swing on the vine. You could have been hurt or lost." Ben says, "I'm sorry, Sara. I was too curious and reckless. I won't do that again. Thank you for helping me."
Sara and Ben hug and say sorry. They decide to go back to the bus and leave the jungle. They have learned a lesson. They still like to travel, but they will be more careful and smart. They are happy to be friends.
