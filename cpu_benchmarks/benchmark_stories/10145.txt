Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dress up in costumes and pretend to be different characters. One day, she saw a thin princess costume in a store and wanted it very much.
Lily asked her mommy, "Can we send a message to Santa to ask for the princess costume?"
Mommy replied, "Yes, we can send a letter to Santa and ask him to bring you the costume for Christmas."
Lily was very happy and wrote a letter to Santa, asking for the thin princess costume. She sent the letter in the mail and waited patiently for Christmas to arrive. On Christmas morning, Lily woke up to find a big present under the tree. She opened it and inside was the beautiful thin princess costume she had wished for. She put on the costume and twirled around, feeling like a real princess.
