Once upon a time, there were two friends, Tom and Tia. They were playing in the park one day and came across an old shed. Tom said to Tia, "Let's play in there! It looks like fun!"
They ran inside, and Tom saw an old wooden box. He opened it and found some modern toys inside. He said, "Tia, these toys look really cool! Let's play with them!"
Tia said, "What kinds of toys?" Tom opened the box and showed her the modern toys. They started playing with them, and had so much fun that they forgot the time. 
When they eventually remembered the time, they ran outside and realized it was getting dark. Tom said, "Let's come here tomorrow and play with the toys again!"
And they did! Tom and Tia kept coming back to the shed every day to play with their modern wooden toys. They played and laughed and had a wonderful time until they grew up.
