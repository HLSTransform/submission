Once upon a time, there was a reindeer named Rudolph. Rudolph had a red nose that made him special. One day, Rudolph went to play with his friends. They played hide and seek, but Rudolph was not good at hiding. He found it easy to be found.
After playing, Rudolph went to rest under a tree. His friend asked him if he was okay. Rudolph said he was fine, but he lied. He was feeling sad because he was not good at hiding. His friend noticed and told him that it was okay to not be good at everything. Rudolph felt better and thanked his friend for making him feel better.
From that day on, Rudolph learned that it was okay to not be good at everything. He felt happy and continued to play with his friends.
