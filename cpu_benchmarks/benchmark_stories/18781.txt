Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in their room. But sometimes their room is very messy. Mommy says they have to organize their toys or they will lose them.
One day, Anna and Ben decide to organize their toys by color. They make piles of red, blue, green, yellow and pink toys. They are very careful with their fragile toys, like the glass doll and the wooden train. They do not want to break them.
When they finish, they are very proud of their work. They show Mommy their organized room. Mommy is very happy. She says they did a good job. She gives them a hug and a cookie.
Anna and Ben have an idea. They want to sing a song for Mommy to thank her. They think of a song they know. It is about a rainbow. They sing the song together. They use their fingers to show the colors of the rainbow.
Mommy listens to their song. She smiles and claps. She says they have beautiful voices. She says she loves them very much. She says they are her rainbow. Anna and Ben hug Mommy. They are very happy. They love Mommy too.
