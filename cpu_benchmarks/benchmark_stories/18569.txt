Once upon a time, there was a nation of ants. They lived in a big tree and worked all day to find food. One day, an impatient ant wanted to go out and look for food alone. But the other ants said no because it was dangerous. The impatient ant didn't listen and went out alone anyway.
The impatient ant found some delicious crumbs, but then got lost on the way back to the tree. The other ants searched for the impatient ant but couldn't find him. They were sad and worried. Eventually, they had to let go and accept that the impatient ant was gone forever.
From that day on, the ants always stayed together and never let impatience lead them to danger again.
