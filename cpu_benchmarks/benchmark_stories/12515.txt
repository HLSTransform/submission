Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the park with his friends. One day, the sky turned dark and the clouds started to move fast. Timmy's mommy told him that a tornado was coming. 
Timmy and his mommy went inside their house and waited for the tornado to pass. It rained really hard and the wind blew really strong. After the storm passed, Timmy went outside to see what happened. He saw that some houses were broken and some trees were knocked down. 
Timmy's mommy told him that it's important to stay safe during a storm. She said that it's better to be inside where it's safe than to be outside where it's dangerous. Timmy learned that it's important to listen to his mommy and stay safe. He also learned that sometimes things can be empty and broken after a storm, but with time, they can be fixed and made whole again.
