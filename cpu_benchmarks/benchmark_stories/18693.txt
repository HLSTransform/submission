Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, while she was playing, she found a shiny gem. It was so pretty and sparkly that she wanted to keep it forever.
Lily put the gem in her pocket and ran back to her house. She showed it to her mom and dad, but they told her that she needed to be careful with it so that it wouldn't spoil. Lily promised to take good care of her precious gem.
Later that day, Lily's little brother started to cry very loud. He wanted to play with the gem too, but Lily didn't want to share it. She realized that it was better to share and have fun together than to keep the gem all to herself. So, she gave the gem to her brother and they played together happily ever after.
