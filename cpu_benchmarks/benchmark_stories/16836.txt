Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mommy and daddy. She saw a man with a big snake and it scared her. But then, the man spoke to her and told her that the snake was nice. Lily felt better and even petted the snake.
Later, Lily and her family went to a restaurant for dinner. The restaurant was very boring because there was no music or fun things to do. But then, Lily's daddy gave her a strip of paper and some crayons. Lily drew a picture and felt happy.
After dinner, Lily went to bed. She dreamed about the nice man with the snake and the fun strip of paper. She felt so lucky to have such a great day.
