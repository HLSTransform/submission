Heather was a humble girl. Every morning, she headed to the park for some fresh air. Today she was looking for a surprise. As she arrived to the park, her heart skipped a beat; she noticed a shiny fork on the ground. She quickly picked it up and felt its smooth surface. 
Heather was so excited she ran back home to show her mom. On the way, different ideas crossed her mind. She thought of using the fork to eat some ice cream. To her surprise, her mom had a bigger plan. Heather's mom took her to the park's lake. She showed Heather a fishing rod and the fork.
Heather watched in awe as her mom used the fork to open a can of worms, which she used as bait. Unaware of the surprise, Heather grabbed her fishing rod and cast it in the lake, with the help of her mom. Suddenly, Heather felt a tug in the fishing rod; she had caught a fish.
Heather was surprised and proud of her catch. She grabbed the fork to take the fish off the line. What started as a usual morning, ended in a magical surprise. After a long hour, Heather went home with a smile on her face.
