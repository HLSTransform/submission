Once upon a time there was a little kid who had a wagon. The wagon was her favorite and everyday she would take rides in it. 
One day her mommy came to her and demanded that she give the wagon to her little sister. The little kid was very upset. She didn't want to give up her wagon! She clung onto the wagon tightly and refused to let go. 
Luckily, her mommy had a great idea. She took the wagon and split it in two so that each of the little kids could have a half of the wagon. They were very happy and neither of them was upset anymore. They both loved their half wagons and went for rides in them all the time. 
The end.
