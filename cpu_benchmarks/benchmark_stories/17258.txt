Once upon a time, there was a purple bird who loved to fly. One day, the bird went on a tour around the world. The bird saw many things like big mountains, blue oceans, and green forests. But the bird was getting tired and hungry. 
So, the bird asked a kind person for help. The person provided the bird with some food and a cozy nest to rest in. The bird was happy and grateful. The bird continued on its tour, feeling refreshed and energized. 
At the end of the tour, the bird returned home with many stories to tell. The bird was proud to have seen so many amazing things and grateful to the person who provided help along the way.
