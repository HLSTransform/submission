Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play together. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big pool in their backyard. They liked to splash and swim and pretend they were fish or pirates or mermaids.
One night, Ben had a dream about the pool. He dreamed that the pool was orange, like a big carrot. He wondered why the pool was orange and how it tasted. He wanted to try it, but he was afraid it might be hot or sour. He looked for Lily, but he could not see her. He felt lonely and scared.
He called out, "Lily, where are you? The pool is orange!"
Lily heard Ben's voice in her dream. She was dreaming that she was a princess in a castle. She had a beautiful dress and a crown and many friends. She was happy and proud.
She heard Ben say, "Lily, where are you? The pool is orange!"
She thought he was playing a joke on her. She said, "Ben, stop it! That's silly! The pool is blue, not orange!"
Ben heard Lily's voice in his dream. He was glad to hear her, but he was confused. He said, "No, Lily, look! The pool is orange! Come and see!"
Lily said, "No, Ben, you are wrong! The pool is blue! Come and see!"
They argued and argued, but they could not agree. They both wanted the other to come and see their dream.
Suddenly, they woke up. They saw each other in their beds. They rubbed their eyes and smiled.
They said, "Good morning, twin!"
They hugged and laughed. They realized they had the same dream, but different. They wondered how that could be.
They decided to go and see the pool. They ran to the backyard and looked at the pool. It was blue, like the sky.
They said, "Wow, the pool is blue!"
They jumped in and played. They forgot about their orange and blue dreams. They were happy and had fun.
