Anna and Ben are playing in the garden. They see a big red flower. They want to examine it.
"Look, Ben, the flower is so pretty!" Anna says.
"Yes, and it smells sweet!" Ben says.
They go closer to the flower. They touch the petals. They are soft and smooth. They see a bee on the flower. The bee is yellow and black. It makes a buzzing sound.
"Hello, bee!" Anna says. "What are you doing?"
The bee does not answer. It is busy. It is collecting nectar from the flower. Nectar is a sweet liquid that bees like. They use it to make honey.
The bee flies away. It goes to another flower. Anna and Ben follow it. They want to see more bees and flowers.
They have fun examining the garden. They learn many things. They feel the heat of the sun. They hear the birds singing. They smell the sweet flowers. They are happy.
