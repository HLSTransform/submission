Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Betsy. Betsy loved to play in the fields and eat carrots. One day, while Betsy was nibbling on a carrot, she saw a big, scary wolf. The wolf wanted to eat Betsy for dinner!
Betsy knew she had to protect herself. She ran as fast as she could and hid in a bush. The wolf couldn't find her there. Betsy was safe.
After the wolf left, Betsy went back to her burrow. She realized that she needed to always be careful and protect herself from danger. She also learned that a mild-mannered bunny like herself can still be brave and strong.
From then on, Betsy made sure to brush up on her safety skills and never let her guard down. She knew that being cautious was the best way to stay safe and happy.
