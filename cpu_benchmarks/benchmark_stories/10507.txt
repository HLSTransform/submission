Once upon a time, there was an attractive fairy. Everyday she would fly around her magical kingdom and dance under the stars.
One day, she was flying around and she saw a big tree. She was so excited that she danced all around it! But suddenly, she stubbed her toe on a rock and a bandage was needed.
So she flew up to a big castle and knocked on the door. The prince answered and she explained the situation – she couldn’t keep dancing without her bandage! Luckily, the prince had some bandages. He said he would give her one if she danced for him.
The fairy accepted, and she flew and danced around the prince's castle. It was so beautiful, and the prince was very impressed with the pretty fairy's moves. He gave her the bandage she needed and sent her on her way.
And ever since then, the fairy has been happily dancing around her magical kingdom with her attractive bandage!
