Once upon a time, there was a big garden. The garden had huge flowers and plants. The flowers were colorful and smelled good. The plants grew in soil that was brown and dirty. 
One day, a little girl came to the garden. She liked the flowers and plants. She asked her mom, "Can we have a garden like this at home?" Her mom said, "Yes, I recommend it! We can get some soil and plant some flowers and plants too." 
The little girl was happy. She went home and told her dad. Her dad got some soil and they planted some flowers and plants. They watered them every day. Soon, their garden was big and beautiful too!
