Sara and Ben were playing in their room. They had many toys and books and they liked to make noise and mess. Their mom told them to be quiet and tidy, but they did not listen. They threw their toys on the floor and on the bed. They shouted and laughed and jumped.
Their dad came home from work. He was tired and wanted to rest. He opened the door of their room and saw the chaos. He was angry and said, "What is this? Why are you making so much noise and mess? Don't you care about your family and your home?"
Sara and Ben stopped playing and looked at their dad. They felt scared and sorry. They said, "We are sorry, dad. We were having fun and we forgot to be tidy. We love our family and our home. We will clean up now."
Their dad said, "I am glad you are sorry, but sorry is not enough. You have to show respect and responsibility. You have to cover your toys and books and put them away. You have to make your bed and sweep the floor. You have to be quiet and polite. Then you can have fun with your family and enjoy your home."
Sara and Ben nodded and said, "Yes, dad. We will do that. We will be tidy and good." They started to cover their toys and books and put them away. They made their bed and swept the floor. They were quiet and polite. They felt proud and happy.
Their dad smiled and said, "Well done, Sara and Ben. You have learned a valuable lesson. Being tidy and good is not only good for you, but also for your family and your home. It shows that you care and appreciate what you have. It makes everyone happy and peaceful. Now you can have fun with your family and enjoy your home."
Sara and Ben hugged their dad and said, "Thank you, dad. We love you. We love our family and our home. We will be tidy and good from now on." They went to the living room and joined their mom. They played a game and read a story. They had fun with their family and enjoyed their home. They were tidy and good.
