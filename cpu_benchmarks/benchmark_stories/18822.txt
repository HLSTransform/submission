Lily and her mom went to the shop. Lily saw a toy bear that she liked. It was brown and soft and had a red bow. She wanted to take it home.
"Mom, can I have the bear?" Lily asked.
Mom looked at the bear and smiled. "It is a nice bear, but we don't have enough money for it today. Maybe another time."
Lily felt sad. She hugged the bear and put it back on the shelf. She saw a boy who was crying. He had a bandage on his arm and a big bruise on his face.
"What's wrong?" Lily asked him.
"I fell off my bike and hurt myself. And I lost my teddy. He was my best friend." The boy said.
Lily felt sorry for the boy. She had an idea. She took the bear from the shelf and gave it to the boy.
"Here, you can have this bear. He can be your new friend. He will make you feel better." Lily said.
The boy stopped crying and smiled. He hugged the bear and thanked Lily.
"Thank you, you are very kind. What is your name?" The boy asked.
"I'm Lily. What is yours?" Lily asked.
"I'm Max. Do you want to play with me?" Max asked.
Lily nodded. She and Max played with the bear and had fun. Mom watched them and felt proud of Lily. She was a compassionate girl who liked to help others. She decided to buy Lily a treat for being so generous. She called Lily and Max and gave them each a cookie.
"Thank you, mom. And thank you, Max. You are my new friend." Lily said.
"You're welcome, Lily. And thank you, too. You are my new friend, too." Max said.
Lily and Max ate their cookies and shared the bear. They were happy. They had learned that giving is better than taking.
