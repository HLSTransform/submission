Once upon a time, there was a bridge that was very special. It was light and strong and able to measure far and wide.
A little bird wanted to find out how long the bridge was, so he measured it with his wings. He measured with one wing, then back again with the other. When he was done, he was very surprised!
The bridge was so light and strong it could stretch all the way to the end of the sky! The little bird was so happy he sang a song and flew back over the bridge, happy to know its size.
The little bird continued to fly over the bridge every day, proud to know the special bridge was so light and strong and able to measure so far and wide.
