John was so excited. It was a great day outside and Mom had said he could help in the garden. He grabbed the rake and started to work. It was so much fun. He could feel the sun shining on his face and smell the dirt as he raked away.
John finished raking the leaves and then he ran to get the hose. He had to wash the leaves away so that the garden would be nice and clean. He lifted up the hose and the water came pouring out. He sprayed it all around the garden, making sure to get every single leaf.
When he was done, John looked around and smiled. He had done a great job. The garden was beautiful and clean. Mom said she was proud of him and gave him a hug. John felt so happy. He couldnâ€™t wait to finish the garden tomorrow.
