Once upon a time there was a beautiful queen. Every day she went for a walk in her kingdom and watched the people. One day, the queen saw a persistent 3 year old boy who wasn't behaving very nicely.
The queen called out to him: "Young man, why don't you behave?".
The boy turned around and said: "But I want to play with my friends".
The queen smiled and said: "That's very nice, but you have to be respectful and polite". She took the child's hand and led him to his friends, talking to him kindly.
From then on the boy was very persistent in behaving nicely. He always listened to what the queen said and the people in the kingdom were so proud of him. The end.
