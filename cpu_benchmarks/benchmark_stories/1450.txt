Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Sally and she was three years old. One day, Sally was sitting in the kitchen. She saw something that made her very excited. It was a big pot of yellow spaghetti! 
Sally smiled and asked if she could have some. Her mom said yes and put some spaghetti on a plate. Sally sat down at the table and started to eat the spaghetti. It was very good. 
After she ate the spaghetti, Sally was very full. She sat down on the couch and closed her eyes. She was so happy and content. 
The End.
