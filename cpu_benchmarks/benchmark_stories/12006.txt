Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play games with his friends. One day, they played a game where they had to run and catch a ball. Timmy was very fast and he caught the ball! Everyone clapped for him.
After the game, they all sat down to have a snack. Timmy's friend, Sally, said that she found a mysterious box in her backyard. Timmy was curious and wanted to see what was inside. They went to Sally's house and opened the box. Inside, they found a toy car and a note that said, "You win!" They were so happy and clapped their hands.
