Anna and Ben love to go to the park with their grandma. Grandma is elderly, but she likes to play with them and push them on the swings. Sometimes she tells them stories about when she was a little girl.
One day, they went to the park and saw a big boot on the grass. It was brown and dirty and had holes in it. Anna and Ben wondered who left it there and why. They decided to make up a story about the boot.
Anna said, "Maybe it belongs to a giant who lives in the woods. He was walking to the park to have a picnic, but he stepped on a thorn and it hurt his foot. He took off his boot and threw it away, but he forgot to take his sandwich with him."
Ben said, "Or maybe it belongs to a pirate who sailed to the park on his ship. He was looking for treasure, but he found a snake instead. He kicked the snake with his boot, but the snake bit his leg. He ran away and left his boot and his map behind."
Grandma listened to their stories and smiled. She said, "You have very good imaginations, my dears. But I think I know the real story of the boot. It belongs to Mr. Jones, the gardener. He works very hard to keep the park clean and beautiful. He has a pair of old boots that he wears when he mows the grass and digs the soil. He must have taken them off to rest his feet and forgot to put them back on. He will be looking for them soon."
Anna and Ben looked at the boot and nodded. They thought that was a nice story too. They decided to leave the boot where it was, so Mr. Jones could find it. They thanked grandma for taking them to the park and gave her a hug. They had a lot of fun and learned a lot of new words.
