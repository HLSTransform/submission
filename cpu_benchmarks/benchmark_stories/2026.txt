Binny wanted to stay warm, so she put on her coat and hat. She went outside and felt the cold air on her cheeks. She was excited to slide on the snow. 
She stepped into the snow and the texture was rough and squishy. Grinning, she started walking. She was peaceful and happy. 
Suddenly, she slipped and nearly fell, but then she remembered her mom’s words. She could be safe if she “yielded” -she should just move slowly and carefully, like a snail. So Binny took a deep breath, bent her knees and closed her eyes. 
After a few seconds, she opened her eyes and realized that she was still standing. She had yielded to the cold ground and stayed safe. With a satisfied nod, she continued her adventure.
