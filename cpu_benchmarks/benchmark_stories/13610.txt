Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park with their mom and dad. One day, they see a big pond with ducks and fish. Lily and Ben want to feed the ducks and fish. They ask their mom and dad for some bread.
"Okay, but you have to be careful," mom says. "Don't go too close to the water. It is deep and you can fall in."
"Yes, mom," Lily and Ben say. They take some bread and break it into small pieces. They throw the pieces to the ducks and fish. The ducks and fish come to eat the bread. Lily and Ben are happy.
But then, Ben sees a big fish with a shiny tail. He wants to touch it. He leans over the edge of the pond. He reaches out his hand. He does not listen to mom.
"Ben, stop!" Lily shouts. "You will fall in!"
But Ben does not hear her. He tries to grab the fish. He slips and falls into the water. Splash!
Lily screams. Mom and dad run to the pond. They are very worried. They see Ben in the water. He is scared and wet. He cries for help.
Mom orders dad to get Ben out. Dad jumps into the water. He swims to Ben. He holds him and brings him back to the shore. Mom hugs Ben and wraps him in a towel. She is angry and relieved.
"Ben, you are very naughty!" mom says. "You did not listen to me. You could have drowned. You made us all worry."
"I'm sorry, mom," Ben says. "I just wanted to touch the fish. It was so pretty."
"Well, you can't touch the fish. They are wild animals. They don't like to be touched. And you can't go near the water. It is deep and dangerous. You have to be careful and obey me. Do you understand?"
"Yes, mom," Ben says. He looks down. He feels sorry and ashamed.
Lily comes to Ben. She gives him a hug. She is glad he is safe.
"I'm sorry, too, mom," Lily says. "I should have stopped him. I was his twin. I should have helped him."
"You did help him, Lily," mom says. "You shouted and warned him. You did the right thing. But next time, don't let him go near the water. Stay with him and hold his hand. Okay?"
"Okay, mom," Lily says. She holds Ben's hand. They both say sorry again.
Mom and dad forgive them. They love them very much. They take them home and give them a warm bath and a hot chocolate. They tell them to be more careful and listen to them. They also tell them to enjoy the park and the ducks and the fish. But from a safe distance.
