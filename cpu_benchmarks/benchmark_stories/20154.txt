Lily and Tom were playing hide and seek in the park. Lily was the seeker and Tom was the hider. Lily counted to ten and then looked for Tom. She saw his red hat behind a big tree. She ran to the tree and shouted, "I found you!"
But Tom was not there. He had moved to another hiding spot. Lily was confused. She looked around and saw a slide. Maybe Tom was hiding under the slide. She ran to the slide and bent down to look. But Tom was not there either. He had moved again.
Lily was getting tired. She wanted to find Tom and have a snack. She heard a noise behind her. She turned around and saw a big dog. The dog was black and had yellow eyes. It looked angry and hungry. Lily was scared. She wanted to run away, but her legs were frozen. She paused and hoped the dog would not see her.
But the dog saw her and barked loudly. It ran towards her and showed its teeth. Lily screamed and closed her eyes. She waited for the dog to bite her. But nothing happened. She opened her eyes and saw Tom. Tom had heard her scream and came to help her. He had a stick in his hand and he waved it at the dog. He shouted, "Go away, bad dog! Leave Lily alone!"
The dog was afraid of Tom and his stick. It stopped and ran away. Lily was happy and relieved. She hugged Tom and thanked him. Tom hugged her back and said, "You're welcome, Lily. You're my friend and I'm your friend. Friends help each other." Lily smiled and said, "You're a mighty friend, Tom. You saved me from the dark dog. You're the best hider and the best seeker." Tom smiled and said, "You're a mighty friend too, Lily. You're brave and smart. You're the best player and the best snacker." They laughed and walked to the bench. They shared their snack and their story. They were happy and proud. They were mighty friends.
