Lila loved stars. She liked to look at them in the sky at night. She liked to draw them on paper. She liked to make them with clay. She had many stars in her room.
One day, a man came to her house. He said he wanted to buy her stars. He said he would give her a lot of money. Lila was happy. She thought she could buy more clay and paper. She said yes.
The man took all her stars. He put them in a big bag. He gave her some money. He said thank you and left.
Lila counted the money. It was not a lot. It was not enough to buy more clay and paper. She felt sad. She wanted her stars back.
She ran outside. She saw the man get in a car. She saw him drive away. She yelled, "Stop! Give me back my stars!" But he did not hear her. He did not care.
Lila cried. She looked at the sky. It was dark. There were no stars. The man had taken them all. He had sold them to someone else. He had been harsh. He had tricked her.
Lila learned a lesson. She learned that stars are not for sale. She learned that some people are not nice. She learned that she should not trust strangers. She learned that she should love what she has.
