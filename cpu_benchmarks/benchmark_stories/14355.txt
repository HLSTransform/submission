Once upon a time, there was a happy bunny. He loved to hop and play in the sunshine. He had many friends and they always had fun together. One day, the bunny decided to enter a race. He was very enthusiastic and practiced every day.
On the day of the race, the bunny was very nervous but he tried his best. Unfortunately, he didn't win and felt very sad. He missed his friends and wished they were there to cheer him up. 
As a result of losing the race, the bunny felt like he wasn't good enough. He stopped practicing and stopped playing with his friends. He became very lonely and unhappy. 
In the end, the bunny learned that winning isn't everything and that he should always try his best. But it was too late, he had lost his friends and his happiness. The bunny realized that he missed his old life and wished he could go back to being happy again.
