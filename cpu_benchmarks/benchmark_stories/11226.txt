Tilley saw something in the sky. She pointed and said, "What is that?"
Mama said, "That is zero. Zero is a special number."
Tilley looked closer and saw an orange number in the sky. Mama said, "That is zero. Zero is orange."
Then Tilley noticed more orange zeros in the sky. She said, "More zeros!"
Mama smiled and said, "Yes, a lot of zeros!"
Tilley was excited. She said, "Let's go and be zeros!"
Mama laughed and said, "No, we cannot be zeros. We can only look at them."
Tilley thought for a moment. Then she said, "But we can wear orange like the zeros."
Mama said, "Yes, that's right. We can be orange like the zeros."
Tilley was happy. She said, "Let's go be orange!"
