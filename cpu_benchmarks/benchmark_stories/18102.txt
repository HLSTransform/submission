Once upon a time, there was a shy little crab. He lived on the shore with his family. The crab was afraid to talk to the other animals because he was so shy. But one day, he saw a fish stuck on the shore.
The crab knew he had to help the fish, but he didn't know how. He tried to push the fish back into the water, but he wasn't strong enough. Then he had an idea! He managed to find a stick and used it to push the fish back into the water.
The fish was so happy and grateful to the crab. From that day on, the crab wasn't so shy anymore. He felt proud that he could manage to help someone in need.
