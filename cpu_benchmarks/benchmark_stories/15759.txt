Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jane. Jane had a closet in her room filled with special things. She loved to open the closet door and look in.
One day, Jane decided to open the closet. She saw something smooth and shiny inside! Jane couldn't remember what it was.
She ran to get her mommy. "Mommy, look!" Jane said, pointing to the closet. "What's in there?"
Mommy looked in the closet and smiled. "Oh! That's your old teddy bear, sweetheart. Do you remember him?" she said.
Jane smiled. "Yes, now I remember. I used to play with him all the time!"
Mommy gave Jane the teddy bear. Jane hugged it tight and felt happy and warm. She remembered all the fun times she had with her old friend.
