Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Emily who was really sick. The doctors told Emily's parents that she had to have a special operation to make her better.
Emily was scared. She didn't want the doctors to touch her. But the doctors promised that it would make her well if she had the operation. 
So, Emily let the doctors do it. The doctors used some very useful tools and machines during the operation, but it was very quick. 
After the operation, Emily felt much better. The doctors had kept their promise and now Emily was healthy again. Everyone was happy!
