One day, Will and his mom were playing. Will looked around and noticed his mom had something special. It was a clear puzzle. She said she was going to create something fun with it. Will got excited and wanted to help! 
Will and his mom started putting the pieces together. They were going to make a picture of a plane and a rainbow. Will put the pieces together carefully, but it was hard work. He looked at his mom, and she pointed out the pieces he was missing. Will and his mom finished the puzzle and it looked beautiful.
Will was so proud of what they had created together. He hugged his mom and said, "I made a puzzle! It looks so clear!" His mom was so proud and gave him a big hug.
Will and his mom stayed up late that night looking at their creation. They had lots of fun, working together on the clear puzzle.
