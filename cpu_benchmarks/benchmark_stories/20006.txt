Anna and Ben wanted to make a sandwich for lunch. They had bread, butter and jelly in the kitchen. Anna took two slices of bread and put them on a plate. Ben opened the jar of jelly and got a knife.
"Can I spread the jelly?" Ben asked.
"OK, but be careful. It is difficult to spread jelly. It is sticky and runny," Anna said.
Ben tried to spread the jelly on one slice of bread. He used too much jelly and it dripped from the knife. Some jelly fell on the floor and some jelly got on his fingers.
"Oops! I made a mess!" Ben said.
Anna looked at the plate and saw a lot of jelly on the bread. She also saw the jelly on the floor and on Ben's fingers.
"That is too much jelly, Ben. You need to use less jelly. And you need to clean the floor and your fingers," Anna said.
Ben felt sorry for making a mess. He got a paper towel and wiped the floor and his fingers. He also scraped some jelly off the bread and put it back in the jar.
"Is this better?" Ben asked.
Anna nodded and smiled. She spread some butter on the other slice of bread. She put the two slices together and cut the sandwich in half.
"Here, you can have this half. It has more jelly," Anna said.
"Thank you, Anna. You are a good sister," Ben said.
They ate their sandwich and enjoyed it. They agreed that jelly was yummy, but difficult to spread.
