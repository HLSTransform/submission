Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys. But sometimes they fight over them. One day, they both want the same truck. They pull and pull, but the truck does not move. It has a knot in the string.
"Let go, it is mine!" Anna says.
"No, it is mine!" Ben says.
They pull harder and harder. The knot gets tighter and tighter. Then, snap! The string breaks and the truck splits in two. Anna and Ben fall back and cry.
Mom hears the noise and comes to see. She sees the broken truck and the sad twins. She hugs them and says, "I'm sorry, my loves. The truck is not available anymore. But I have an idea. Why don't you share these blocks? You can build anything you want with them. And you can help each other and have fun."
Anna and Ben wipe their tears and nod. They say, "Okay, Mom. We will share the blocks. And we will not fight anymore." They hug Mom and say, "Thank you, Mom. We love you."
Mom smiles and says, "I love you too, my loves. Now, let's go and build something amazing." She helps them pick up the blocks and they go to the living room. They start to build a castle, a bridge, and a car. They use their imagination and their teamwork. They are happy and proud of their creations. They forget about the truck and the knot. They only remember their love and their fun.
