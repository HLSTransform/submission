Lisa loved getting presents. One day, her Aunt Clara gave her a new bottle of perfume. She was so excited that she couldn't wait to try it on!
Lisa hung the bottle of perfume around her neck and sprayed it all over her. It smelt terrible but Lisa loved it.
But when Lisa went outside to show off her new perfume, she noticed something strange. All of the birds had stopped singing and were flying away in a big hurry!
It turned out that the perfume was too strong and the birds were scared of it.
Lisa was very sad. She thought she was never going to get to show off her new perfume. But then she had an idea. She hung the perfume in her room so it couldn't make the birds scared anymore.
Now Lisa can show off her beautiful new perfume without making the birds go away.
