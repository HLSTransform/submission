Teddy was a very obedient three year old. He did what his mommy and daddy asked him to do. One day, a robot came to Teddy's house. It had big shiny eyes and a funny voice. Teddy was so excited he ran to the robot and said hello.
But the robot didn't want to stay. It told Teddy it had to leave. Teddy was very sad, but he was very obedient. He said goodbye to the robot and watched it go. 
Teddy's mommy put her arm around him and said, "Don't worry, I'm sure the robot will come back one day." Teddy smiled and said he hoped so. He waved as the robot left and went back inside.
And ever since then, Teddy has been waiting for the robot to come back. He's sure one day it will and he can't wait to say hello again!
