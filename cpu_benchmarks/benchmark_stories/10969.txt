One day, a blue bird flew high in the sky. The bird was happy and sang a sweet song. The sun was warm, and the bird felt good.
The blue bird saw a big tree. In the tree, there was a hole. The bird went into the hole and found a root. The root was strong and made the tree stand tall.
The bird told his friends about the root. He mentioned how good the tree was. All the birds came to see the tree. They were happy and sang together.
