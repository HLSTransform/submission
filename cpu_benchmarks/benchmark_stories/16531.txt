Once upon a time, there was a little duck named Ducky. Ducky loved to swim in the lake. One day, Ducky saw a big, mean cat by the lake. Ducky was alert and knew to stay away from the cat.
But then, Ducky saw something shiny in the water. It was a paint can! Ducky was curious and wanted to see what was inside. Ducky swam closer and closer to the paint can until suddenly, the cat jumped out and tried to catch Ducky. Ducky tried to fly away, but it was too late. The cat had caught Ducky and took him away.
Poor Ducky never got to paint or swim in the lake again. The end.
