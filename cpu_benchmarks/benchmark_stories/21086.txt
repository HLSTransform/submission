Lily liked to play in the garden with her plant. Her plant was green and tall and had red flowers. She gave her plant water and sun and talked to it every day. She named her plant Rose.
One day, Lily saw a big dog in the garden. The dog was black and furry and had sharp teeth. The dog barked and ran towards Lily and her plant. Lily was scared and ran away. She forgot to take her plant with her.
The dog was angry and hungry. He saw the plant and thought it was food. He bit the plant and tore it apart. He ate the flowers and the leaves and the stem. He left nothing but dirt and roots.
Lily came back to the garden and saw what the dog had done. She cried and cried. She remembered her plant and how much she loved it. She wished she had taken it with her. She was sad and lonely. She had no plant to play with anymore. The garden was cold and empty. The end.
