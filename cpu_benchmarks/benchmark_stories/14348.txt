Once upon a time, there was a poor little mouse. He lived in a small hole in the ground. One day, it started to rain very hard and the river began to flood. The mouse was scared and didn't know what to do. 
He saw a big piece of cheese on the ground and decided to climb on it to stay safe. But as he climbed, the cheese began to melt because it was so hot outside. The mouse was sad because he lost his safe spot. 
Suddenly, he saw a friendly bird flying above him. The bird saw the mouse and knew he needed help. The bird swooped down and picked up the mouse in its beak. Together, they flew to a new home where the mouse was safe and happy.
