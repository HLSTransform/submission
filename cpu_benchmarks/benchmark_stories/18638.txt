Once upon a time, a little boy named Timmy wanted to climb a big tree. He tried and tried, but he couldn't do it. His mommy said, "Don't worry, Timmy. Keep trying and you will succeed."
One day, Timmy climbed the tree all the way to the top! He was so happy and proud of himself. Suddenly, he heard a loud sound. It was thunder! Timmy was scared, but his mommy said, "Don't worry, Timmy. Thunder is just a loud noise in the sky."
Timmy climbed back down the tree and ran inside with a smooth feeling of success. He knew he could do anything if he kept trying.
