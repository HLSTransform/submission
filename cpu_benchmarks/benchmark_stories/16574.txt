Lily was a cat who loved tuna. She always asked her mom for tuna when she was hungry. But mom said tuna was a special treat, not for every day. Lily had to eat other food, like chicken or cheese or kibble.
One day, Lily saw a big can of tuna on the kitchen counter. She jumped up and tried to open it with her paws. But the can was too hard and slippery. She could not open it. She meowed loudly, hoping mom would hear her and help her.
Mom came into the kitchen and saw Lily on the counter. She was not happy. She said, "Lily, what are you doing? You know you are not allowed on the counter. And you know you cannot have tuna today. It is for tomorrow, when we have guests. You have to wait, Lily. Be a good cat."
Lily felt sad and sorry. She did not mean to make mom angry. She just wanted some tuna. She jumped down from the counter and rubbed her head against mom's leg. She said, "Meow, meow, meow." She hoped mom would understand that she was sorry and that she loved her.
Mom smiled and picked up Lily. She hugged her and said, "I know, Lily. I love you too. And I have a surprise for you. Since you are such a mighty cat, and you tried so hard to open the can, I will give you a little bit of tuna now. But only a little bit, okay? And you have to promise to behave and share with the guests tomorrow."
Lily was very happy. She licked mom's face and said, "Meow, meow, meow." She meant, "Thank you, mom. You are the best. I promise to be good and share." Mom opened the can and gave Lily a small spoonful of tuna. Lily ate it quickly and licked her lips. It was delicious. She felt lucky to have such a nice mom and such a yummy treat. She purred and snuggled with mom. She was a happy cat.
