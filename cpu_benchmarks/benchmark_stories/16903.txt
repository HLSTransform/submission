Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her toys. She had a doll, a bear, a ball and a car. She liked to make them talk and move. She was very happy.
One day, she saw a new toy in the shop. It was a cat. A cat that could blink and meow. Lily wanted the cat very much. She asked her mom if she could have it. Her mom said yes, but only if she was good.
Lily was very good. She helped her mom with the dishes, the laundry and the dusting. She did not cry or fuss. She was very patient.
When they went back to the shop, Lily ran to the cat. She picked it up and hugged it. She felt its soft fur and its wet nose. She saw its green eyes blink at her. She heard it meow softly. She was very happy.
She thanked her mom and took the cat home. She gave it a name: Fluffy. She played with Fluffy all day. She fed it, brushed it and cuddled it. She kissed its lip and whispered in its ear. She was very happy.
Fluffy was happy too. It liked Lily very much. It followed her everywhere. It was very alert. It watched her toys, her books and her bed. It was very curious.
They became best friends. Lily and Fluffy. They blinked, meowed and smiled at each other. They were very happy.
