One day, a little girl named Sue was in the kitchen with her mom. Her mom was making a cake. Sue saw the cream and it reminded her of ice cream. She asked her mom, "Can I have some ice cream, please?"
Her mom said, "Not now, Sue. We need to eat dinner first. We will have a healthy meal with veggies and then we can have ice cream."
Sue was sad, but she knew her mom was right. They needed to eat healthy food before having treats. She helped her mom cook dinner and set the table. They had a yummy meal with lots of veggies.
After dinner, Sue and her mom cleaned up the kitchen. Sue was excited, because she knew it was almost time for ice cream. She could see the cream on the counter, waiting to be used.
Finally, her mom said, "Okay, Sue. It's time for ice cream!" They made big bowls of ice cream with the cream and enjoyed their treat together. Sue was happy that she had listened to her mom and eaten her healthy dinner first.
