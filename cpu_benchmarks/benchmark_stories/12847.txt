Once upon a time there was a little girl called Bella. She was playing in her garden when she saw two animals, a rabbit and a squirrel, walking by. She wanted to join them but wasn't sure how. 
So she asked them, "Would you like me to join you?" The rabbit hopped over and said, "Yes, we'd love to have you join us!"
So the three of them travelled around the garden. They talked and laughed, looked at the flowers and skipped in the grass. Then they came across a nut. The squirrel said, "Look, I know this is a very important nut and I'm sure it will give us great benefits if we all join together and share it!"
So they all joined together, holding the nut between them. But then, before they could start eating it, the squirrel said, "This won't work unless we work together. If we don't help each other, the nut won't give us anything at all."
The little girl smiled and said, "That's a great lesson. We should all help one another out, then we will be able to achieve a lot more together than if we did it alone!"
Moral: In life, it's important to work together, because together we can do bigger and better things!
