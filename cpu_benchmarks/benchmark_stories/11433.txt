Frankie and his mommy were sitting in front of a big trunk full of toys.
"What do we need to do, Mommy?" asked Frankie, looking up at her with his big, blue eyes.
"We need to pick out the toys we don't want to keep anymore so we can give them to other children," his mommy said.
Frankie grabbed the toys one by one, proudly showing them to his mommy. But no matter how much he tried, he couldn't decide which ones to give away. He was feeling sad.
Suddenly, his mommy came to his rescue. She gave him a big sack and said,"Let's just pick out the ones that fit into the sack. Are you ready?"
Frankie smiled and started to fill the sack. After a while, the sack was full and the trunk was empty.
"Thank you, Mommy" said Frankie, and hugged her.
"You did a great job, and now these toys can go to other children who need them," said his mommy, giving him a big, loving hug.
