Once there was a girl named Sam. One day Sam went to the playground with her mom. While she was there she saw something strange. It was smoke, but it was bright blue! Sam asked her mom what it was but she didn't know. 
Suddenly, Sam heard something coming from the smoke. It was a voice. It said, "I am broken. My name is BRO. Can you help me?" 
Sam was surprised. She told her mom that BRO was asking for help. Her mom said they should try and help BRO. 
So they stepped into the smoke. Sam was scared but she kept going until they got to BRO. He was a robot, and he was in bad shape. He needed a lot of help to be fixed. 
Sam and her mom worked together to get BRO fixed. They used tools and put new parts on him. After a few hours, BRO was fixed and he thanked them.
From then on, Sam and BRO were friends. They went to the playground all the time and even took visits to the museum. Sam was very happy that she was able to help BRO when he was broken. 
The end.
