Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Rose. She was so adventurous!
Today, Rose was going on a special adventure. She was unpacking everything she would need, to build a bridge.
At first, she didn't know where to start, but Rose was so brave and determined. She got out all the pieces she had, and started to fit them together. Before long, she had made a bridge!
Then, Rose's mum came to see what was happening.
Mum: "What have you made, Rose?"
Rose: "Look, I made a bridge!"
Mum: "Wow, what an adventurous bridge! I'm so proud of you Rose."
Rose beamed with pride, and then she went to show all her friends her new bridge. She just knew they would love it.
