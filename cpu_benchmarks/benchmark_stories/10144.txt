Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play hide and seek with her friends. One day, Lily's mom gave her some medicine to make her feel better. Lily didn't like the taste of the medicine, so she hid it under her bed.
Later that day, Lily's friend came over to play. They decided to play hide and seek. Lily's friend looked for her everywhere, but she couldn't find her. Finally, Lily's friend heard a giggle coming from under the bed. She looked under the bed and found Lily hiding with the medicine bottle.
"Wow, that's a fancy hiding spot!" said Lily's friend.
"I'm hiding my medicine," said Lily.
"Why are you hiding your medicine?" asked her friend.
"Because it tastes yucky," said Lily.
Her friend giggled and said, "Well, I think it's time for you to take your medicine. It will make you feel better."
Lily took her medicine and soon she was feeling much better. She thanked her friend for finding her and for reminding her to take her medicine. From that day on, Lily never hid her medicine again.
