Once upon a time in a beautiful garden, there was a little worm named Wiggly. Wiggly was a happy worm who loved to play in the dirt all day long. He had many friends, like the pretty butterflies and the singing birds.
One sunny day, Wiggly met a new friend, a tiny bug named Buzz. Buzz was sad because he was cold. Wiggly wanted to help his new friend, so he said, "I will cover you with a soft leaf to make you warm."
Wiggly found a big leaf and used it to cover Buzz. Buzz smiled and said, "Thank you, Wiggly. You are a good friend." They played together in the beautiful garden, and Wiggly and Buzz were very happy.
