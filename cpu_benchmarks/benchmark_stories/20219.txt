Tom and Lily wanted to build a castle with their blocks. They had many blocks of different colors and shapes. They put some blocks on the floor and stacked them up. They made walls and towers and a gate.
"Look at our castle!" Tom said. "It is big and strong and pretty!"
"Yes, it is!" Lily said. "But it needs something more. It needs magic!"
"Magic?" Tom asked. "What is magic?"
"Magic is something that makes things special and fun. Like a fairy or a dragon or a rainbow." Lily said. "We can make magic with our imagination!"
"How do we do that?" Tom asked.
Lily picked up a small red block and held it in her hand. She closed her eyes and made a wish. She wished that the block would turn into a magic ruby that could make their castle fly.
She opened her eyes and showed the block to Tom. "Look! It is a magic ruby!" she said. "If we put it on top of the highest tower, our castle will fly!"
Tom looked at the block. It was still a small red block. But he wanted to believe Lily. He wanted to see their castle fly. He smiled and took the block from Lily. He climbed on a chair and reached for the highest tower. He placed the block on top of it.
"Ready?" Lily asked.
"Ready!" Tom said.
They both clapped their hands and shouted: "Fly, castle, fly!"
They looked at their castle. It did not move. It was still on the floor. But in their eyes, it was flying. It was flying high in the sky, over the clouds and the stars. It was a magic castle. And they were happy.
