Once there was a patient squirrel. He liked to grab things and explore his world. One day, he grabbed a nut from a tree and went on his way. Suddenly, a big, red bird swooped down from the sky and grabbed the nut from the squirrel! The squirrel was very scared. He watched as the bird flew away with his nut.
The squirrel was determined to get his nut back. He was patient and waited for the bird to come back. Finally, the bird returned and he dived at the squirrel with his powerful wings. This time, the squirrel was ready. He jumped high and grabbed the nut from the bird's beak!
The squirrel held the nut tightly and ran away. The bird was too big and slow to catch him! The squirrel was excited to have his nut back and thanked his patience for helping him succeed. From then on, he always was patient when he wanted to grab something new.
