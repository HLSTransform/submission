Once upon a time, there was a boy named Bob. He was a very honest boy who was always kind. One day, he wanted to go for a jog in the park. He left his laundry on the front porch.
On the way back, he was startled when he saw someone running away from his house, holding a bundle of his laundry! Bob chased after the man, but he wasn't fast enough. The man was able to run away with Bob's clothes!
Bob was very sad and he didn't understand why the man would take his laundry. He wished he had been faster so he could catch the man and get his clothes back.
Luckily, a kind policeman saw what happened. The policeman promised to help Bob find the man who had taken his laundry. With the policeman's help, Bob was able to get his clothes back. They found the man, who confessed that he wanted to take Bob's laundry because he was poor and didn't have any.
Bob was so happy he was able to get his clothes back, and he thanked the policeman for his help. Now Bob knew to be more careful with his laundry, and he went for his jog again, feeling more honest than ever.
