Lila and Sam were two camels who lived in the desert. They liked to walk and find green plants and water to eat and drink. Sometimes they saw other animals, like rabbits and lizards, but they did not talk to them much.
One day, they found a big oasis with many trees and a lake. They were very happy and ran to the water. But when they got there, they saw that there was only one spot where the water was clear and cool. The rest of the water was muddy and warm.
"I want to drink from the clear water!" Lila said.
"No, I want to drink from the clear water!" Sam said.
They started to quarrel and push each other with their noses. They made loud noises and splashed water everywhere. They did not notice that the other animals were watching them and shaking their heads.
"Stop it, you two!" a voice said. It was Zara, a zebra who lived in the oasis. She came out of the trees and walked to the lake. "You are making a mess and scaring everyone. There is enough water for everyone, if you share and take turns."
Lila and Sam looked at Zara and felt ashamed. They realized that they were being selfish and rude. They said sorry to each other and to Zara. They agreed to drink from the clear water one at a time, and then move to the muddy water. They also said hello to the other animals and asked if they wanted to join them.
Soon, the oasis was quiet and peaceful again. Lila and Sam learned to be more friendly and generous. They also learned that the oasis was more beautiful when they shared it with others.
