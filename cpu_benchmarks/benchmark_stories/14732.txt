John had a big, dependable engine. He wanted to attach it to his car so he could go on adventures. So, every morning John would attach it to the car, and go for long drives.
But one morning, the engine wouldn't attach. John tried to attach it, but it just wouldn't stay. He got really upset, and started to cry.
John's dad came out and saw what was wrong. He suggested that John get a wrench, and try to fix the engine. John got the wrench, and started to tighten the engine. And it worked! The engine started to attach to the car.
John was so happy that he jumped up and hugged his dad. He thanked him for helping, and from then on the engine was always dependable. John and his dad went on many more adventures, and John's car was always ready for adventure.
