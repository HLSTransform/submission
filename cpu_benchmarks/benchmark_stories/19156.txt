Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a loyal dog. The dog was very smart and had a big brain. He loved to play with his friends, the rabbit and the bird.
One day, while they were playing, the rabbit's toy ball vanished. The rabbit was very sad. The loyal dog wanted to help find the ball. He used his big brain to think of where it could be.
The dog, the rabbit, and the bird looked everywhere. They looked under the trees, in the bushes, and near the river. At last, they found the ball behind a big rock. The rabbit was so happy to have his ball back.
The friends learned that if they work together, they can solve any problem. The loyal dog, the rabbit, and the bird were always there for each other. And they lived happily ever after.
