On a cold evening, Alexis and her mom were walking on the beach. Alexis felt the sand between her toes and the cold breeze. She loved the evening and feeling happy, she skipped along the beach. 
Mom said, "Let's look for shells." 
Suddenly, Alexis lost her grip on the shells that she was holding. Some of them got swept up in the waves and disappeared. 
Alexis cried as mom said, "I'm sorry, things sometimes get lost at the beach."
However, Alexis quickly cheered up because she knew something great was waiting for her. When they arrived at the end of the beach, her mom showed her a beautiful surprise: a sand castle that she had made just for her. 
Alexis couldn't believe it, she shouted with joy and ran to where the sand castle had been made. She couldn't believe such a wonderful surprise after she had lost some of her shells. 
Alexis has learned that even though you can lose things, there are still surprises in life that make us very happy.
