Once upon a time there was a frog named Stan who liked to take baths. One day he decided to take a much needed bath and filled up his tub with water from the faucet. As the tub filled up he hopped in and began to relax.
But suddenly he noticed some droplets of water coming from the faucet still. Stan was frustrated and yelled, "Hey faucet, why don't you settle down?"
The faucet replied, "Sorry Stan, but it's not my job to settle. My job is to make sure the water flows."
The faucet then said, "But if I can give you some advice, try to settle your frustration. That way you can enjoy the peaceful bath you wanted."
Stan thought about it and finally settled his frustration. As he did, the water in the bath tub began to relax.
Stan learned a valuable lesson that day. He discovered that in order to truly enjoy something, you have to settle all your frustrations and anxieties first.
