Once upon a time, there were two friends named Sam and Joe. Sam and Joe were always together and were the best of friends. One day, they were playing in the their garden and they saw a branch. Sam said, "I will steal the branch." Joe was jealous and said, "I want to steal the branch too!" So they both ran over to the branch, but Sam was bigger and faster and reached the branch first. Joe became so jealous that he pushed Sam down and took the branch all for himself. Sam was very sad, but Joe just ran away with the branch.
