Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the park. One sunny day, Timmy saw a cop walking around the park. The cop had a big hat and a shiny badge. Timmy gazed at the cop and smiled.
Suddenly, Timmy noticed that his hands were dirty from playing in the dirt. He ran to his mom and asked for a tissue to clean his hands. His mom gave him a tissue and Timmy wiped his hands clean.
After that, Timmy went back to playing in the park. He ran around and played with his friends. Timmy was happy and he knew that he had to always keep his hands clean so he wouldn't get sick.
