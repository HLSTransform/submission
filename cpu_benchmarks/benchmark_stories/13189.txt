Once upon a time there was a fierce dragon. He lived in the mountains and liked to sleep all day. He had no food to eat and was very hungry.
One day a food supply was left near the dragon's cave. The dragon was very pleased to see the food! He gobbled it up quickly.
The food was so tasty that the dragon wanted more. He looked around and found another food supply in a nearby village. That night he flew to the village.
The people in the village were afraid of the fierce dragon. He swooped down and grabbed the food supply, then flew back to his cave. The dragon was now full and happy.
He kept eating the food supplies until they were all gone. He was never hungry again. The people in the village were happy too, as they were no longer scared of the fierce dragon.
