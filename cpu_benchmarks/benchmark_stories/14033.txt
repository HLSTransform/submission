One day, a big dog named Max was very eager to play. He wanted to play ball at the big park. The big park was called the stadium. Max liked the stadium because it was big and fun.
Max went to the stadium with his friend, a little cat named Luna. They played ball together. Max threw the ball very far. Luna ran and ran to catch the ball. They were having a lot of fun.
Then, Max did something silly. He tried to catch the ball in his mouth, but he missed. The ball hit Max on his nose. Max felt embarrassed. Luna laughed and said, "It's okay, Max. We all make mistakes. Let's keep playing!" Max smiled and they played until the sun went down.
