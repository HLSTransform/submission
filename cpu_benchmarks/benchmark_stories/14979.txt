Andy was walking in the park with his mother. He saw an orange bird sitting on a tall tree. "Mommy, what's that?" he asked, pointing at the bird.
"That's a parrot," his mother replied.
Andy wanted to get closer to the bird, so his mother picked him up and showed him the parrot. The parrot looked down at Andy and smiled. 
Then the parrot flew down and sat on Andy's palm. It started to make some funny noises and show Andy some tricks. It waved its wings and jumped from one finger to another. 
Andy was so excited, he laughed and clapped his hands. His mother was glad Andy was so happy and watched proudly as the parrot showed him more tricks.
