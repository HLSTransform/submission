Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to help with the gardening. Lily was happy to help and ran outside to the garden.
While she was working, she saw a ladder leaning against the fence. Lily knew she wasn't supposed to climb it, but she felt curious. She climbed up the ladder and felt very tall. Suddenly, her mommy called out, "Lily, be alert! You could fall!"
Lily quickly climbed down the ladder and said, "I won't climb it again, mommy. I promise." From that day on, Lily remembered to be careful and not to climb the ladder without her mommy's help.
