Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl who had a special wish. She wanted a new bike, so she went to the police station to make a request. The police replied that they couldn’t give her a bike, but they could help her look for one. 
So off she went with the police in search of her bike. They searched high and low in the city, but sadly the girl couldn’t find what she was looking for. After a long day of searching, the girl went home empty handed. 
But the next morning, something amazing happened! A friendly delivery man appeared at her door with the most beautiful bike she had ever seen! She was so excited that she ran to the police station to show them her new bike. 
The officers were so pleased to hear that the girl had found her bike. They gave her a card, which said ‘Well done, you found your bike!’. The girl was so happy that she thanked the officers and went home riding on her beautiful bike.
