Once there was a girl named Ellie who loved kicking. Whenever she went outside, she would kick everything in sight, from balls to trees. One day though, she saw something orange on the ground that she hadn't noticed before. She bent down to look closer and saw it was a little package of chocolate!
She became excited, so she decided to kick the package. As she did, the wrapper split open and out came the chocolate bar! She couldn't believe it. She was so happy and began eating it right away.
Ellie enjoyed the chocolate so much that she kept kicking the ground around her. When she was done, she had even more orange packages of chocolate surrounding her. As she kicked some of them open, she began to share the chocolate with her friends. They all had a great time.
