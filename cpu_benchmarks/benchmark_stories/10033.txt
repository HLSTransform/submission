Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She woke up one morning and felt the sun on her face. It was warm outside, so she put on her favorite dress and ran outside to start her day. 
As she was walking, she saw a butterfly flying around. She tried to catch it, but it flew away. Then, she saw a bird in a tree. She said hello to the bird and it chirped back at her. 
Later that day, Lily went to a party where they played music. She loved the music so much that she started to bow and dance. Everyone clapped and cheered for her. Lily felt happy and loved. The end.
