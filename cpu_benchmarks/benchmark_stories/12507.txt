Once upon a time, there was a brave knight named Jack. Jack had a sword that he loved to play with. One day, Jack was walking in the forest when he saw a dragon. Jack was enthusiastic to fight the dragon. 
"Hello, dragon! I am Jack, the knight. I want to fight you," said Jack.
The dragon replied, "Why do you want to fight me?"
"I want to fight you because you are big and scary. It will be fun," said Jack.
The dragon laughed and said, "Okay, let's fight!" 
Jack and the dragon fought for a long time. Finally, Jack won the fight and the dragon ran away. Jack was happy that he won the fight. He went home and told his friends what happened. They were all enthusiastic to hear his story.
