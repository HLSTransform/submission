One day, a little girl named Anna wanted to mail a letter to her grandma. She was grateful for the nice gift grandma sent her. Anna put the letter in a box and went to the mail place.
On her way, she saw a big tree. Anna knew this tree, but today there was something new. She saw a little bird in a nest. She thought, "I will come back to see the bird after I mail my letter."
Anna went to the mail place and gave the letter to the mailman. She was happy. Anna went back to the big tree to see the bird. The bird was still there. The bird saw Anna and flew to her. The bird had a letter, too! It was a letter from grandma. Anna was so grateful for the sight of the bird and the letter. The bird helped Anna feel close to her grandma.
