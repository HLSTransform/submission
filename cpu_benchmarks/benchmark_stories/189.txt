Tom was a troubled boy. He did not like to eat his food. He only liked to eat candy and cake. His mom and dad were sad. They wanted Tom to be healthy and strong.
One day, mom made a soup for dinner. She put celery in the soup. She said, "Tom, this soup is good for you. It has celery. Celery is green and crunchy. It makes you grow and learn. Please try some."
Tom looked at the soup. He saw the celery. He did not want to eat it. He said, "No, mom. I do not like celery. It is yucky and bitter. I want candy and cake."
Mom sighed. She said, "Tom, you cannot have candy and cake every day. They are bad for you. They make you sick and tired. You need to eat your soup. It is warm and tasty. It has carrots and potatoes and chicken too. They are all good for you."
Tom shook his head. He said, "No, mom. I do not like soup. I do not like carrots and potatoes and chicken. I only like candy and cake."
Mom was sad. She said, "Tom, you are being stubborn and rude. You are hurting my feelings. You are not listening to me. You are not thanking God for your food. You need to pray and ask God to help you eat your soup."
Tom did not know what to do. He did not want to hurt mom's feelings. He did not want to be stubborn and rude. He did not want to make God angry. He wanted to be a good boy. He looked at the soup. He looked at mom. He looked at dad. He closed his eyes. He said, "God, please help me. I do not like soup. I do not like celery. But I love mom and dad. And I love you. Please make me eat my soup. Please make me like celery. Please make me healthy and strong. Amen."
Tom opened his eyes. He saw mom smiling. He saw dad nodding. He saw the soup steaming. He picked up his spoon. He took a sip. He was surprised. The soup was not yucky and bitter. It was warm and tasty. He took another sip. He liked it. He saw the celery. He bit it. It was green and crunchy. He liked it too. He ate his soup. He ate his celery. He was happy. He said, "Mom, dad, thank you for the soup. Thank you for the celery. They are good for me. I like them. And thank you, God, for helping me. I love you. Amen."
