One day, little Lisa was walking in the forest when she discovered a lion. She was so excited and couldn't believe her eyes.
The lion was mighty and powerful looking. Lisa was a bit scared but she was also curious. She tiptoed slowly up to the lion, but the mighty beast quickly spotted Lisa and shifted his gaze directly towards her.
Lisa froze in place while the lion roared at her. Then, he asked her in a deep, gruff voice “What are you doing here, little one?” 
Lisa took a deep breath and replied bravely “I was just exploring and I discovered you!”
The lion seemed impressed with Lisa’s courage and softened his expression. He said “Well, you better get back home now. Don’t come out here in the forests alone anymore.”
Lisa thanked the lion and quickly ran back home. She never forgot the mighty lion that she had discovered in the forest.
