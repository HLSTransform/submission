Once upon a time, there was a dog named Mr.Bark. Mr.Bark wanted to go on an adventure. He said, "Let's go explore the city!" He started walking and saw a lot of traffic. He asked his friend, "What is this?" His friend said, "This is traffic. It is what people sort with cars".
Mr. Bark felt excited. He thought, "Maybe I can sort with cars too!". He forgot that he had four paws, not four tires. He didn't understand why he couldn't join the other cars.
He started running across the street, dodging the cars. Suddenly, he felt something big and heavy hit him and he flew in the air. When he landed back on the ground, he knew something was wrong.
He tried to move but he was hurt and couldn't get up. His friend was scared and said, "Mr.Bark! What happened?" Mr.Bark said sadly, "I got hit by a car. It was my fault. I should have stayed away from the traffic."
The original adventure that Mr.Bark wanted to go on had ended, but not in a good way. He had to stay in bed for a few days and was never able to explore the city again.
