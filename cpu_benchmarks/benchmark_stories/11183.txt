Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pet goat named Billy. One day, Lily saw that Billy's leg was broken. She felt sad and wanted to help her goat.
Lily went to her mom and said, "Mommy, can you help Billy? His leg is broken." Her mom said, "Of course, Lily. I will call the vet to come and check on Billy."
After the vet came, he said that Billy needed to rest his leg for a few weeks. Lily was happy that her goat would be okay soon. She went to Billy and said, "Don't worry, Billy. You will be better soon. I request that you rest your leg and not move around too much."
Billy looked at Lily and said, "Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend." From that day on, Lily took care of Billy and made sure he rested his leg. They became even closer friends.
