once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sophie. She was 3 years old and loved fruit. One day when Sophie was walking in the park she spotted a pear in a nearby tree. She excitedly ran over to get her treat but when she tried to pick it, the pear was too high for her to reach.
Just then a friendly neighbour saw Sophie's plight and smiled. "Would you like me to help you reach the pear?" he asked.
Sophie quickly nodded yes, but then stopped and looked embarrassed. "I'm sorry, I don't have any money."
The neighbour laughed and told her not to worry. He climbed up the tree and handed Sophie the pear. "This one is for you," he said.
Sophie smiled and thanked her neighbour before skipping off, happily cradling the pear in her little hands.
