One day, a boy named Tim found a toy pistol. He thought it was fun to play with. He showed it to his friend, Sue. Sue said, "Wow, I think that's a cool toy!"
Tim and Sue played with the toy pistol all day. They pretended to be heroes saving the day. They were compassionate and always helped others in their game.
Later, they met a sad girl named Lily. She was crying because she lost her toy. Tim and Sue decided to help her. They said, "Don't worry, Lily. We'll find your toy!" They looked everywhere and finally found her toy under a tree. Lily was so happy and thanked them. They all played together and became best friends.
