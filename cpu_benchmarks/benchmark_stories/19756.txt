There was a worrisome gloom in the air. Two brothers, Mark and Pete, were putting the last touches on their secret squash garden. It was so special they had to hide it from everyone else. But suddenly, they heard a noise from outside. A big, angry bull was coming down the path. She was squashing everything in her way.
The boys rushed back to their garden. They knew the bull had to be stopped or their secret garden would be destroyed. Pete grabbed a big stick and rushed straight towards the bull with all his might. With a loud roar, he started hitting the bull with the stick, distracting it from the garden.
Meanwhile, Mark was running for his life. He rushed to find a way to stop the bull and save the garden. Suddenly, he saw some big branches on the ground. He quickly grabbed them and built a barrier around the garden to protect it.
The bull was still raging but with some help, the barrier held firm and Mark and Pete were able to keep their garden safe. They breathed a sigh of relief as the gloomy clouds finally cleared away.
