Once upon a time, there was a mom and her daughter. The daughter was very sweet and pretty. She loved jam. Every morning, she would help mommy spread jam on her toast.
One day, the girl wanted to make her own jam. She asked mommy to help. Together, they cut up some apples and cooked them on the stove. After awhile, the apples smelled yummy and the jam looked nice.
The girl was so excited, she wanted to give the jam to all of her friends. She put the jam in some jars, but mommy told her that she had better stay home. The girl felt a bit sad, but she knew her mom was right.
When her friends came over, the girl gave each of them a jar of her very own jam. They all said it tasted so yummy and that the girl was very clever. The girl was so proud, she danced around the room.
The jam was always a reminder of the special time that the girl and her mom shared. From then on, the girl always remained happy.
