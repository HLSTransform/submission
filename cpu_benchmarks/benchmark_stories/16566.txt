One day, Lily sees a new toy in the shop. It is a pink bike. Lily wants the bike very much. She asks her mom to buy it for her. Her mom says no. She says the bike is too expensive. Lily is sad.
Ben sees Lily is sad. He wants to help her. He has an idea. He goes to his home and gets his piggy bank. He has saved some money. He asks his dad to lend him some more money. His dad says yes. He says Ben is kind and generous.
Ben takes the money and goes to the shop. He buys the pink bike for Lily. He puts a bow on it. He hides it behind a tree. He calls Lily and tells her to come. He has a surprise for her.
Lily comes and sees the bike. She is very happy. She hugs Ben and thanks him. She says he is the best friend ever. She asks him how he got the bike. He tells her he used his money and his dad lent him some more. He says he wanted to make her smile.
Lily and Ben ride the bike together. They take turns. The bike is hard to pedal, but they do not mind. They have fun. They are happy. They are friends.
