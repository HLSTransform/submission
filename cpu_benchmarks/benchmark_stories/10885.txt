Once upon a time, there was a man named John. John had a wife named Mary. Mary was a very clean woman, but John was messy. His house was filthy and dirty.
One day, Mary said to John, "John, please clean the house. It's very dirty." John replied, "I will clean it later. I need to go outside and play." Mary was upset and said, "You never clean the house. I am tired of it."
John felt bad and decided to clean the house. He started to pick up his toys and put them away. He even used a bow to tie up the garbage bags. When Mary came back, she was surprised to see the house clean. She hugged John and said, "Thank you for cleaning the house. You are a good husband." From that day on, John made sure to clean the house every day.
