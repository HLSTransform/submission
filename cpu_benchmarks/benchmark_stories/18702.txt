Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but her favorite one was a shiny crystal. The crystal was very pretty and sparkly. One day, Lily decided to spin the crystal around in her hand. It spun and spun, making her very happy. 
Suddenly, a gentle breeze came through the window and blew the crystal out of her hand. It flew across the room and landed on the floor. Lily was sad, but then she remembered that she could pick it up and spin it again. She ran over to the crystal, picked it up, and started to spin it once more. 
From that day on, Lily would spin the crystal every day. She loved how it sparkled and how it made her feel. She knew that even if the crystal ever fell again, she could always pick it up and spin it once more. And that made her very happy. The end.
