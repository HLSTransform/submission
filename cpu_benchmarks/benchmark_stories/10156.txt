Once upon a time, there was a curious little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the big, green park near her house. One day, while she was walking, she found a patch of colorful flowers. She picked some of them and took them home.
Lily's mommy saw the flowers and asked her where she got them. Lily told her about the patch she found in the park. Her mommy was curious too, so they went back to the park together.
While they were there, they saw a happy couple getting married under a big tree. Lily thought it was so beautiful and she wished to get married one day too. Her mommy smiled and said, "Maybe one day you will, Lily."
