Once upon a time, there was a big boat on the sea. It was big and strong, and had lots of people on board. But one day, a big storm hit. The waves got very tall and the wind got strong. The boat was not strong enough and it started to rock and roll. Suddenly it shook so hard that it broke into lots of pieces. All the people on board felt sad and helpless.
But then, the sun came out. A rescue team came to help the people. They all climbed into the big boats and went away. The people held hands and hoped for a safe journey.
When they reached shore, they saw a sight of destruction. The broken pieces of the boat were lying everywhere. People felt sad and helpless, but they also held onto hope.
The rescue team used tools to clean up the wreck. They worked hard and long, and they fixed the pieces of the boat back together. One by one, they put the pieces back into place.
Finally, the boat was all ready to go back to sea. The people on board were smiling and they were happy that they were safe. They all had hope that this boat would be strong enough to make the journey. And sure enough, the boat sailed away into the sunset, off for new adventures.
