Lily liked to dance. She danced in her room, in the garden, and in the park. She moved her arms and legs in different ways. She made shapes and patterns with her body. She felt happy and free when she danced.
One day, she saw a poster on a wall. It said: "Dance Show. Come and watch. Or come and join." There was a picture of a big stage with lights and curtains. Lily wanted to go. She asked her mom if they could go. Her mom said yes.
They went to the show. There were many people there. Some were watching, some were dancing. Lily saw some dancers who were very good. They moved in sync. They wore shiny costumes. They smiled and bowed. Lily clapped and cheered. She wanted to be like them.
She saw a sign that said: "Do you want to dance? Come and try. We will teach you." Lily pulled her mom's hand. She said: "Mom, can I try? Please, please, please." Her mom said: "Okay, but be careful. And have fun."
Lily went to the sign. There was a lady there. She was wearing a hat and a whistle. She said: "Hello, little dancer. What is your name?" Lily said: "Lily." The lady said: "Nice to meet you, Lily. I am Miss Rose. I am the dance teacher. Do you want to learn some moves?" Lily said: "Yes, please."
Miss Rose took Lily to a group of other kids. They were all wearing numbers. Lily got a number too. It was seven. Miss Rose said: "Listen to me, kids. I will call out a motion. You have to do it. The best dancer will get a prize. Are you ready?" The kids said: "Yes."
Miss Rose blew her whistle. She said: "Jump." The kids jumped. Lily jumped too. She jumped high and low. She jumped with one leg and two legs. She jumped with joy. Miss Rose said: "Good. Now, spin." The kids spun. Lily spun too. She spun fast and slow. She spun with her arms out and in. She spun with grace. Miss Rose said: "Very good. Now, slide." The kids slid. Lily slid too. She slid left and right. She slid with her feet and hands. She slid with style. Miss Rose said: "Excellent. Now, the last motion. Freeze." The kids froze. Lily froze too. She froze in a perfect pose. She froze with a smile. She froze with confidence.
Miss Rose looked at the kids. She said: "Wow. You are all amazing. But there is one dancer who is the best. And that is... number seven. Lily, you are the winner. You are the perfect dancer. Come and get your prize." Lily was surprised and happy. She ran to Miss Rose. Miss Rose gave her a medal and a hug. She said: "You are a star, Lily. You have a gift. You should keep dancing. You make me proud." Lily said: "Thank you, Miss Rose. You are a great teacher. You make me happy." They both smiled. The other kids clapped and cheered. Lily's mom took a picture. Lily felt proud and happy. She loved dancing. She loved Miss Rose. She loved her prize. She loved her mom. She loved her life. She danced some more. The end.
