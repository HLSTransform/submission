Lila and Tom wanted to go to the beach. They liked to play in the sand and water. But their mom said no. She said it was too hot and the sun was harsh. She said they could get burned and sick.
Lila and Tom were sad and angry. They did not want to stay at home. They wanted to have fun. They begged their mom to let them go. But their mom did not change her mind.
Lila and Tom had an idea. They decided to sneak out when their mom was busy. They took their hats and sunscreen and ran to the beach. They thought they were smart and brave.
But they were not. The beach was far and they got tired. The sun was harsh and they got hot. The water was cold and they got wet. They did not have any toys or snacks. They did not have any fun.
They wished they had listened to their mom. They wanted to go back home. But they did not know how. They were lost and scared. They started to cry.
A nice lady saw them and asked them what was wrong. They told her their story. She felt sorry for them and helped them. She called their mom and told her where they were. She waited with them until their mom came.
Their mom was worried and angry. She hugged them and scolded them. She said they were naughty and foolish. She said they could have been hurt or worse. She said they had to learn to obey and be safe.
Lila and Tom felt sorry and ashamed. They said they were sorry and they loved her. They said they would never do it again. They said they learned their lesson.
Their mom forgave them and took them home. She said she loved them too. She said they could go to the beach another day, but only with her. She said they had to manage their feelings and choices.
Lila and Tom agreed and nodded. They were happy and relieved. They hugged their mom and thanked her. They said they would manage better next time.
