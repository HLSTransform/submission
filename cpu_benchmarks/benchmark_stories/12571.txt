Tommy was a very intelligent boy. He liked to learn new things and solve problems. He had a big book of puzzles that he read every day. He wanted to succeed in everything he did.
One day, he saw a red cap on a high shelf in his room. He wanted to wear the cap, but he could not reach it. He tried to jump, but he was too short. He tried to climb, but he was too small. He tried to use a chair, but he was too weak. He felt sad and angry.
He asked his mom for help. "Mom, can you get me the cap, please?" he said. His mom smiled and said, "Why do you want the cap, Tommy?" Tommy said, "Because it is red and I like red. And because it is on the high shelf and I want to get it." His mom said, "I see. But you know, Tommy, sometimes you have to work hard and be creative to get what you want. You are a very intelligent boy, and I'm sure you can find a way to get the cap by yourself. Why don't you try again and use your brain?"
Tommy thought for a while. He looked around his room and saw his toys. He had an idea. He took his toy truck and his toy crane. He put the truck under the shelf and the crane on the truck. He used the crane to lift the cap from the shelf and bring it down to the truck. He was very happy. He put the cap on his head and said, "I did it! I got the cap!"
His mom came back and saw him. She was very proud. She hugged him and said, "Well done, Tommy! You are a very intelligent boy, and you succeeded in getting the cap by yourself. You used your brain and your toys to solve the problem. That's very clever. I love you, Tommy, and I love your red cap." Tommy smiled and said, "I love you too, mom, and I love my puzzles. Can we do some together?" His mom said, "Of course, Tommy. Let's go and have some fun." They went to the living room and did some puzzles together. They had a great time.
