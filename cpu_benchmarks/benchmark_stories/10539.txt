Once upon a time, there was a graceful bird named Flapper. She loved to fly high up in the sky, singing as she soared. One day, as she spread her wings, something strange caught her eye. She flew closer and saw a shiny, silver battery resting on the ground.
Flapper landed softly and curiously peered at the battery. Suddenly, she heard a loud scream! Startled, she flew away quickly. She looked back once more and saw that a little girl was screaming and pointing at the battery.
The little girl said excitedly, "Mommy, look! A battery!" Her mother smiled down at her and explained, "That's right, sweetheart! That's a battery."
Flapper watched the little girl reach down and pick up the battery. The little girl then thanked her mother with a hug and ran off happily, cradling the battery in her arms.
Flapper spread her wings once again and flew away gracefully. She was filled with joy to see the little girl so happy.
