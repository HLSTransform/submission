Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, but he was always very clumsy. One day, he accidentally knocked over his mommy's mirror and it broke into tiny pieces. 
Timmy was very sad because he knew his mommy loved that mirror. He tried to put it back together, but it was too broken. 
Later that day, Timmy's grandpa came over to visit. He had a shiny bald head and Timmy loved to rub it for good luck. Grandpa saw the broken mirror and said, "Don't worry Timmy, accidents happen. We can buy mommy a new mirror." 
Timmy was so happy that his grandpa was there to help him. They went to the store and bought a new mirror for mommy. Timmy learned that it's okay to make mistakes, as long as you try to fix them.
