One day, there were two brothers who were both very eager to explore. The younger brother was very excited to go but the older brother was a bit jealous. He asked their mum, "Can I go too?"
Mum said,"No, you can't come with us. You have to stay and look after the house, but I will pass you something special." 
The older brother was very suspicious but also a bit jealous. He asked his mum what was going to happen and she said, "I'm going to pass you a key. It will help you explore the town while we are away." 
The younger brother was very excited. He ran around the house and said, "I'm ready to explore the town!". 
The older brother was a bit jealous, but he took the key from his mum and said, "I'm going to explore too!"
And so both brothers headed off to explore their town, having a great time and discovering all sorts of fun things!
