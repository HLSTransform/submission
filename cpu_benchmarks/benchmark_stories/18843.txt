Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play together. They have many toys, but their favorite is a big box. They can make the box into anything they want.
One day, they decide to make the box into a spaceship. They use crayons to draw windows and buttons on the box. They find some old clothes and hats to wear as space suits. They pretend to fly to the moon and the stars.
"Wow, this is so fun!" Anna says. "I like our spaceship. It is very useful. We can go anywhere we want."
"I like it too," Ben says. "You are very good at drawing. I admire your pictures. They look real."
"Thank you," Anna says. "You are very good at flying. I admire your skills. You are very brave."
They smile at each other. They are happy. They play with their spaceship for a long time. They have a lot of adventures. They are the best space friends.
