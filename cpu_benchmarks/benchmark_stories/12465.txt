Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play with trains. They had a big train set with many tracks and cars and a toy engine that made noise. They pretended to be drivers and passengers and had fun.
One day, their dad brought home a surprise. He had a big bag of coal for their train. He said coal was what old trains used to make fire and steam. He showed them how to put some coal in the engine and light it with a match. Then the engine started to puff and chug and move on the tracks.
Tim and Sam were very excited. They wanted to try the coal train. They took turns to fill the engine with more coal and watch the smoke come out. They made the train go faster and slower and stop at different stations. They had a lot of fun.
But after a while, they noticed something. The engine was getting very hot and dry. It needed water to make steam. They looked for a water bottle or a cup, but they could not find any. They started to worry. What if the engine stopped working or broke down?
Then Sam had an idea. He ran to the kitchen and got a glass of milk. He came back and said to Tim, "Let's give the engine some milk. Maybe it will like it and keep going."
Tim was not sure. He said, "But milk is not water. Milk is for drinking, not for trains. What if the engine does not like it and gets sick?"
Sam said, "It's worth a try. We have nothing else. Come on, let's do it."
They poured some milk into the engine and waited. The engine made a funny noise and spat out some milk. Then it stopped puffing and chug
