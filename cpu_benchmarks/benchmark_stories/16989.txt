Tom and Anna are brother and sister. They share a room and a bed. Tom likes to tease Anna when it is time to sleep. He makes scary noises and tells her stories about monsters and ghosts. Anna gets scared and cries. She asks Tom to stop, but he laughs and says he is just having fun.
One night, Anna has a nightmare. She dreams that a big, hairy monster is chasing her in the dark. She runs and runs, but the monster is faster. She screams and tries to wake up, but she can't. She feels the monster's breath on her neck and its claws on her back.
Tom hears Anna scream and wakes up. He sees her face twisted in fear and her eyes closed. He feels sorry for her and hugs her. He whispers in her ear, "It's okay, Anna. It's just a dream. I'm here with you. You are safe." Anna opens her eyes and sees Tom. She feels his arms around her and his voice in her ear. She calms down and snuggles with him. She says, "Thank you, Tom. You are a good brother. I love you." Tom says, "I love you too, Anna. I'm sorry for teasing you. You are a tough sister. You can face any monster." They smile and fall asleep together.
