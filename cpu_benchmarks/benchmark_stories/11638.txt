Once upon a time, there was a chubby girl named Sarah. Sarah loved to hear news. Whenever she heard exciting news, Sarah loved to share her news with her family. 
Once day, Sarah was very happy because she heard some exciting news. She quickly ran to her mom and said, "Mom, I heard news! I heard the ice cream store gave away free scoops today!" 
"That's so wonderful, honey! I love that you are always so excited to share your news with us," her mom said, as she hugged her chubby daughter. 
Sarah smiled and said, "I love when we all share news together".
Her mom replied, "Yes, and I love you too!"
