Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to look out of the window and see the light shining in the sky. One day, Lily saw a bird flying outside and she felt happy. But then, she saw dark clouds in the sky and started to worry. She thought the bird might get wet and cold. Suddenly, it started to rain and Lily felt sad. She wanted to help the bird, so she opened the window and let it come inside. The bird was happy and Lily felt happy too.
