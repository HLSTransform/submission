Once upon a time, there lived a brave knight who was always ready to do daring deeds. One day, he was given an important request. He had to take a fierce candle to the King.
"Where can I find the fierce candle?", asked the knight. His servant replied, "You can find it at the candle market."
The brave knight set off right away and soon he arrived at the candle market. After looking around, the knight discovered a beautiful, fierce candle and he carefully bought it.
The knight then set off on his journey to the King. After two hours, he finally arrived at the castle gates.
The guard asked, "What is your request?". The knight replied, "I have been sent here to give the King a fierce candle."
The guard smiled and said, "That's wonderful! Please enter."
The knight was relieved and handed the candle to the King. The delighted King thanked the knight for his request and rewarded him generously. 
The brave knight returned home, feeling proud of himself. From then on, he was known as the Knight of the Fierce Candle!
