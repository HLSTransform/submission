Karen was a 3 year old girl who was always full of energy. She loved to explore the world and she especially loved colorful things.
Today she was going on an adventure to the park. She ran around exploring and found some colorful flowers. She touched them gently as she looked at the pretty petals. 
Then she saw a pond nearby. She kept exploring and found a bridge going across it. In the middle of the bridge, she noticed an empty pail. She picked it up and ran to the pond to fill it with water. 
Karen smiled as she completed her task and went back to the bridge. She wanted to take the pail home, but it was too heavy. She asked her mom to help. Together they carried it home and put it away.
Karen was happy that she was able to complete her mission. She gave her mom a big hug and went back out to explore the colorful world she loves.
