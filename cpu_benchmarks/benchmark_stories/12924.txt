Once upon a time there was a boy called Bob. Bob wanted to explore the world, but his parents said it was too dangerous. So, Bob decided to pack his bags to go on his very own adventure!
The first stop was the big city. Everything was so busy and exciting! Bob kept walking and walking until he found a huge park. There, he saw a magnificent tiger chasing birds! It was so beautiful and Bob was in awe.
Bob decided to pack up his things and go back home. The next night, Bob's parents had surprise for him. They revealed a big cage in the living room. They had adopted the tiger all the way from the park! Bob was so excited, the tiger was not boring at all!
From then on, the tiger became Bob's best friend. Together they explored the world, went on more adventures, and wondered what exciting things the future held.
