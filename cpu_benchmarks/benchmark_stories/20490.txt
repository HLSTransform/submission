Once there was a small boy who was very wealthy. He lived in a big house and had lots of toys. One day, he started to sneeze. It was not a normal sneeze like most people have. The sneezing was so bad that he couldn't stop! 
He went to the doctor and the doctor did a special test to find out what was wrong. The doctor told the boy and his family that he had allergies and he need to take special medicine. 
The wealthy boy was happy. He did not have to sneeze any more! He was so glad that he had a doctor who was able to help him. The wealthy boy was able to play with all of his toys without having to worry about sneezing.
