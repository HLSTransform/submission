Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books. But today it is raining. They cannot go outside. They are bored.
"Let's look out the window," Ben says. "Maybe we can see something fun."
They go to the window and look. They see cars and people and dogs. They see a big truck and a red bus. They see a bird and a cat. They see a flower and a tree.
But then they see something scary. They see a big, black cloud. It is very dark and loud. It makes a boom sound. It has flashes of light. It is a storm.
"Mommy, mommy!" Anna and Ben cry. "There is a scary storm outside!"
Mommy comes to their room. She hugs them and smiles. "Don't be afraid, my loves," she says. "The storm will go away soon. It is just water and wind and noise. It cannot hurt you. You are safe with me."
She gives them a kiss and a cookie. She reads them a story. They cuddle with her and their teddy bears. They feel better. They are not scared anymore. They like to look out the window again. They see a rainbow. It is very pretty. They are happy.
