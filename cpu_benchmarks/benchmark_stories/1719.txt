Once upon a time, there was a deer. The deer was very lonely because it had no friends to play with. One day, the deer closed its eyes and started to imagine having lots of friends to play with. It imagined running and jumping with its new friends in the forest. Suddenly, the deer heard a rustling sound in the bushes. It opened its eyes and saw a group of friendly rabbits hopping towards it. The deer was overjoyed and it played with the rabbits all day long. From that day on, the deer was never lonely again because it had lots of new friends to play with.
