Sara liked to imagine things. She imagined she was a princess, a pirate, a fairy. She imagined she had a big castle, a fast ship, a magic wand. She liked to play with her toys and make up stories.
One day, Sara went to the park with her mom. She saw a pond with ducks and fish. She imagined she was a mermaid, swimming with the fish. She wanted to touch them and talk to them. She saw a big stick near the pond. She imagined it was a flexible tail, like a mermaid's.
She picked up the stick and tied it to her legs with her scarf. She felt like a real mermaid. She smiled and waved to her mom. Her mom was busy talking on the phone. She did not see Sara.
Sara walked to the edge of the pond. She wanted to jump in and swim with the fish. She did not know the pond was deep and cold. She did not know how to swim. She did not know the stick would make her sink.
She jumped in and felt the water cover her head. She tried to breathe, but she could not. She tried to kick, but she could not. She tried to scream, but she could not. She felt scared and sad. She wished she was not a mermaid. She wished she was with her mom. She wished she did not imagine things.
