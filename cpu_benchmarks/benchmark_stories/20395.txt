Once upon a time, there was a big zoo. It had lots of animals like lions, monkeys, and elephants. One day, a little girl named Lily went to the zoo with her mom and dad. They saw all the animals and had lots of fun. 
As they were leaving, Lily saw a toy elephant in the gift shop. She really wanted it, but her parents said they couldn't buy it right then. Lily was sad, but her parents promised they would come back to the zoo another day. 
A few weeks later, Lily's parents surprised her with a trip back to the zoo. They went to the gift shop and bought the toy elephant Lily had wanted. She was so happy and excited to play with it. From then on, Lily always remembered the fun day she had at the big zoo and the special toy elephant she got to play with.
