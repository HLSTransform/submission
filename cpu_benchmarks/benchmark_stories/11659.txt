Once there was a little girl. Her name was Mia. One day she put on her loud vest. She skipped happily down the street. She saw a beautiful butterfly in the garden. She chased it. She jumped and skipped over the rocks. The butterfly flew to a tree, and Mia followed it. She skipped around the tree, but the butterfly had already flown away. Mia was sad, but happy because she had had so much fun skipping. She went back home and put away her loud vest. She had had a great day skipping and chasing the butterfly.
