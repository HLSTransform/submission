Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat grapes, especially the purple ones. One day, she saw a grape on the ground and picked it up. She wondered if it was still good to eat.
Lily tried the grape and it was delicious! She was so happy that she found a yummy grape. But then, she dropped the grape and it rolled away. Lily searched and searched for the grape, but it was persistent in hiding from her.
Finally, Lily found the grape under a chair. She was so happy to find it again and ate it right away. From then on, Lily always made sure to hold onto her grapes tightly so they wouldn't roll away again.
