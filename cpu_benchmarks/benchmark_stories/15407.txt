Once upon a time, there was a modest house. It was small, but very cozy and happy. But one day, a strange wind started to blow. It was so strong that it began to scatter things all around the house. All the toys, furniture and even clothes were blowing around.
The wind blew and blew, until it was so strong that it blew the walls down! The house was destroyed and everything inside was now scattered everywhere. 
The people living in the house were very sad. They had a hard time finding all the things scattered around. But eventually, they collected everything they could and they built a new, bigger and much happier house.
The end.
