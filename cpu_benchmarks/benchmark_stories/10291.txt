Tom is sick. He has a bad cough and a hot head. Mom says he needs to lie down and rest. She gives him a pill and some water. She says the pill will make him feel better.
But Tom does not like the pill. It is big and bitter. He spits it out when Mom is not looking. He hides it under his pillow. He thinks Mom will not know.
Mom comes back to check on Tom. She sees his pillow is wet. She lifts it up and finds the pill. She is angry and sad. She says to Tom, "Why did you spit out the pill? It is good for you. Do you want to be sick forever?"
Tom is scared. He says, "I'm sorry, Mom. I don't like the pill. It is yucky. Can I have something else?"
Mom sighs. She says, "No, Tom. You have to take the pill. It is the only thing that can help you. If you don't take it, you might get worse. You might lose your voice or your hearing. Do you want to be deaf?"
Tom shakes his head. He does not want to be deaf. He likes to hear Mom's voice and the birds and the music. He says, "OK, Mom. I will take the pill. But can you stay with me and read me a story?"
Mom smiles. She says, "Of course, Tom. I love you. I want you to be well. Come on, let's try again. Swallow the pill and I will read you your favorite story."
Tom nods. He takes the pill and drinks some water. He makes a face, but he does not spit it out. He lies down and cuddles with Mom. Mom reads him a story about a brave knight and a friendly dragon. Tom feels a little better. He closes his eyes and listens to Mom's voice. He falls asleep.
