One day, a furry neighborhood cat was walking by the house of a neighbor when it saw a bow on the front door. The cat was very curious and decided to get closer. It bowed its head to get a better look at the bow and saw it was made of a pretty ribbon. 
The cat reached out its paw and tried to touch the bow. Suddenly, the door opened and the cat jumped back. It was the neighbor! 
The neighbor smiled and said it was for the cat - it was a present! The cat was so happy that it bowed its head again as a thank you. 
From then on, the cat and the neighbor were good friends. The cat would often make sure to bow its head in greeting when it passed by their house.
