One day, a little boy named Tim found a big plastic toy in his room. It was very pretty. He wanted to show it to his friend, Sue.
Tim went to Sue's house and said, "Look at my toy! It is big and pretty!" Sue looked at the toy and said, "Oh, it is so pretty! I like it!" They played with the toy all day long.
Later, Tim's mom called him home. When he got home, his mom asked, "Where did you get that toy?" Tim felt funny and said, "I found it in my room." His mom said, "That toy is not yours. It belongs to your sister. You should not take things that are not yours." Tim felt bad and was embarrass. He said sorry to his mom and sister. He went back to Sue's house and told her the truth. They promised to always share and play with their own toys.
