Once upon a time, there was a little bunny. The bunny loved to run and play in the green grass. One day, the bunny saw a prune on the ground. It was a dark prune, almost black. The bunny picked it up and sniffed it. It smelled sweet! 
The bunny decided to run with the prune in its mouth. It ran very fast, like a race car. It loved the feeling of speed. Suddenly, the bunny tripped on a rock and the prune flew out of its mouth. It was sad, but it learned to be more careful next time. 
From that day on, the bunny always looked for dark prunes to play with. It loved the taste and the feeling of speed when it ran with them. The end.
