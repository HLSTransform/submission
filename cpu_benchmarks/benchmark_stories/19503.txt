Once upon a time there was a boy. He was so excited to go outside and play. He put on his shoes and ran out the door. He ran and ran until he saw a cop. He was in a big hurry so he ran past the cop. The cop jumped in his car and started to follow the boy. As the cop was following the boy, the boy saw a big hill. He was so excited to try and run up the hill! He started running up the hill as fast as he could. The cop followed close behind. But the boy was so fast that he reached the top of the hill before the cop. The boy was so happy! He waved goodbye to the cop and ran to play with his friends. The end!
