Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Lily. She loved to serve her family and friends by making them yummy food. One day, she was making cookies for her rude neighbor, who always yelled at her. 
As she was taking a step towards her neighbor's house, she accidentally dropped the cookies on the ground. Her neighbor saw this and started yelling at her, calling her names. Lily felt sad and scared. 
Later that day, Lily's family found out what had happened and they all went to talk to the neighbor. But the neighbor was still rude and didn't want to listen. The conflict between Lily and her neighbor continued and they never became friends. 
In the end, Lily learned that sometimes, no matter how kind you are, some people will still be rude. She decided to focus on serving those who appreciated her kindness and love.
