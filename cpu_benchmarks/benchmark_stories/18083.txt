Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved cookies, especially the chocolate chip ones his mom made. One day, Timmy saw a jar full of cookies on the kitchen counter. He knew he shouldn't take one without asking, but he couldn't resist the temptation. He took a cookie and ate it quickly.
The next day, Timmy's mom noticed that some cookies were missing from the jar. She asked Timmy if he knew anything about it. Timmy felt guilty and knew he had done something wrong. He told his mom the truth and apologized. His mom forgave him and told him that it's always better to tell the truth than to lie.
From that day on, Timmy made sure to always ask before taking a cookie. He didn't want to repeat his mistake and feel guilty again. Timmy learned that it's important to be honest and take responsibility for our actions.
