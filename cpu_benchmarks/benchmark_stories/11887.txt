Once upon a time there was a puppy who was very miserable. He lived with an owner who was not nice. Every morning the puppy would rise and do what his owner said in the hopes of being happy.
But this never worked. The owner never gave the puppy any love. This made the puppy feel very miserable.
Then one day, something magical happened. A new person came to the house and the puppy felt very happy to see them. This person was very kind and the puppy knew they were here to help him.
The new person said she was the puppy's new owner and she took him far away. The puppy was so excited and could feel himself rising from his former misery.
With his new owner, the puppy was very happy. She showed him lots of love and was always gentle and kind to him. From that day forward, the puppy was never miserable again. He rose to a life of love, joy and happiness.
