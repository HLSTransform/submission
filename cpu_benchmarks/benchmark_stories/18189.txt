Once upon a time, a little dog named Max was very anxious. He was always hungry and wanted to eat more food. One day, Max saw a big dish full of yummy treats. He wanted to eat them all, but he knew he had to share with his friend, Sam the cat.
Max said to Sam, "Sam, let's weigh our treats so we can share them." Sam nodded and they took turns putting treats on the little scale. Max put some treats on one side and Sam put some treats on the other side. They both watched the scale go up and down until the treats were the same on both sides.
With a big smile, Max said, "Now we can eat our treats!" Max and Sam sat down and ate their treats together. They were so happy to share and enjoy their yummy treats. From that day on, Max was not anxious anymore because he knew that sharing with his friend Sam was the best way to be happy.
