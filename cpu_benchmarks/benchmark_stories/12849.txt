Once there was a little girl named Lily. She was three years old and loved to explore. 
One day, Lily decided to go for a walk in the garden. She was wearing her favorite purple dress with a buckle around her waist. As she was walking, she saw a rabbit.
"Hi, rabbit," said Lily.
The rabbit just stared at her.
Lily was very curious, so she decided to jump closer and get a better look. The rabbit jumped away.
Lily became very sad. Then, a wise old owl flew down and said, "Never be afraid to be curious, little one. You can always be brave and jump until you find the answer you are looking for."
Lily smiled, thanked the owl, and bravely jumped again in search of the rabbit. Eventually, she found the bunny and they became friends.
From that moment on, Lily was never scared to be curious. She knew that if she was brave and jumped, she could find the answers she was looking for.
