Once upon a time in a small town, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia liked to watch her mom work in the garden. The garden was very pretty with many colorful flowers. Mia loved to play near the flowers and watch the bees and butterflies.
One day, Mia saw a big pile of junk near the garden. She wanted to play with the junk, but her mom told her not to. Mia didn't listen and went to the junk pile anyway. She found a pretty, shiny thing in the junk and picked it up.
Mia played with the pretty, shiny thing, but it broke. She got very sad and started to cry. Her mom came over and saw the broken shiny thing. She was not happy with Mia. Mia learned that she should listen to her mom and not play with junk. The pretty garden was not as fun anymore because Mia felt sad and bad.
