One day, Mommy and Johnny went for a walk. Johnny looked for puddles along the way. Every puddle he saw, he wanted to jump in it. But Mommy said no, so Johnny had to resist.
On the way, they saw a nice puddle. It shimmered in the sun! With all his heart, Johnny wanted to jump in that puddle. He asked Mommy, but Mommy still said no. Johnny had to resist.
Johnny pouted. He wanted to jump in that nice puddle so badly! But Mommy told him that if he jumped into the puddle, his shoes would get wet and his feet would get cold. Johnny had to resist.
So he didn't jump. He resisted his urge. Thinking of how cold his feet would be made it easier to resist. In the end, Johnny was proud of himself, and Mommy was proud of him too!
