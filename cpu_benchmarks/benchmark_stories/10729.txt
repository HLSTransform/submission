Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, her mommy asked her to help make dinner. Lily was so excited!
Her mommy gave her a big bowl and told her to soak some rice in water. Lily loved playing with the water, so she happily obeyed. While the rice was soaking, her mommy asked her to cut up some vegetables. Lily saw a pepper and thought it looked funny. She asked her mommy if she could taste it. Her mommy warned her that it was very spicy, but Lily didn't listen.
Later, when they sat down to eat, Lily took a bite of her food. She quickly realized that the pepper was not ordinary. It was so spicy that her mouth felt like it was on fire! From that day on, Lily learned to listen to her mommy's warnings and not to play with her food.
