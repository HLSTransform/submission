Once upon a time, there was an ancient cable. It ran through the whole valley and connected all the houses together. Every day, the people living in the valley would use the cable to communicate with each other and share their stories.
One day, a young girl saw the cable and asked her Mom, "What is this thing Mommy?". Her Mom said, "That is an ancient cable. It helps us to have a connection with other people."
The young girl was very excited and said, "I want to have this cable too!". Her Mom said, "Sure, but you will have to wait until you get a bit older." 
The young girl was very eager and asked, "How much older?". Her Mom replied, "When you are three years old, you will be able to use the cable too."
The young girl was very happy and said, "Yay! I cannot wait until I am three!" She kept counting the days until the day she could have her very own ancient cable.
