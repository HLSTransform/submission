Once upon a time, there was a playful kitten named Mittens. Mittens loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, Mittens saw a little birdie flying outside. She wanted to play with the birdie, but the birdie flew away.
Mittens asked her mom, "Mommy, why did the birdie part from me?"
Her mom replied, "Well, Mittens, the birdie has a goal to fly and explore the world. Just like you have a goal to play and have fun."
Mittens thought about what her mom said and realized that everyone has their own goals. She decided to play with her toys and let the birdie fly away to reach its goal. And that's how Mittens learned that it's important to respect other's goals and enjoy your own playful time.
