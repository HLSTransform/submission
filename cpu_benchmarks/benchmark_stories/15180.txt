Once upon a time, there was a cute little boy named Tom. Tom and his family drove to the park. He was so excited, Tom ran ahead of his family. As Tom ran, he saw a big and beautiful hotel in front of him. He was so happy and immediately ran inside.
The hotel looked incredible! All around the place were adorable decorations and furniture. He wanted to explore the entire hotel so desperately.
He started walking around, looking into different rooms and playing with the furniture. Suddenly, a voice shouted out.
"Hey! What are you doing here? Get out!" 
Tom was so scared. He quickly ran out of the hotel and he didn't look back. He ran back to the park and found his family, explaining what he had witnessed. 
Tom had a bad ending to his adventure, but he would always remember the incredible hotel he had stumbled upon.
