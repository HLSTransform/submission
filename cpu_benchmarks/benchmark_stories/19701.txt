Once upon a time, there was a small girl who loved to explore. She loved to explore the landscape around her. Everywhere she looked, she saw new and different things. One day, she was feeling brave enough to explore an uncomfortable landscape. She cautiously made her way through the meadow, avoiding the prickly patches of grass and the sharp rocks beneath her feet. As she reached the edge of the meadow, she felt tired and wanted to complete her journey. She sat down on a nearby log and looked out on the horizon. All around her, the landscape changed and she felt proud of herself for completing such an uncomfortable exploration. She smiled with joy, happy to have conquered the uncharted land.
