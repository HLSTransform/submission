Once upon a time, there was a rich bird. He had the most beautiful feathers and the happiest song. He sang from the highest tree in the land.
One day, he spotted a cauliflower in the farmer's field. He swooped down and picked it up in his beak. He was so excited, he started to sing louder and louder.
The farmer heard the bird's happy tune. He came out of his house and said, "Thank you for the song, little bird! As a reward, here is a cabbage for you".
The bird was happy and so he started to sing again. The farmer was delighted by the bird's voice. He said, "You have the most beautiful song. Please, come back here and sing any time. I'll give you some cauliflower even if you're not wealthy".
The bird was pleased to hear this. From then on, he visited the farm every day to sing for the farmer and enjoy the yummy cauliflower.
