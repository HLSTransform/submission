Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a lot of fog. The fog was so thick, that the people could not see far. They had to be very careful when they walked or played outside. The sun was weak and could not shine through the fog.
In this town, there was a little girl named Lily. She wanted to reach the top of the big hill, where she heard there was a beautiful garden. But the fog made it hard for her to find her way. She asked her friends to help her reach the top.
Together, they walked slowly and held hands. They took turns being the leader, so no one would get lost. After a long time, they reached the top of the hill. The fog was still there, but they could see the beautiful garden. They played and laughed, and had a great day. And when it was time to go home, they walked down the hill together, happy that they had reached the top.
