Once upon a time there was an adorable little bear named Tommy. Tommy loved to play and explore, but he didn't know very much. He wanted to learn more, so he asked his Mama Bear for help.
Mama Bear was so happy to provide for Tommy. She smiled and told him that she would teach him all sorts of things. She taught him how to count, name colors, and even the alphabet.
Tommy was so excited to learn. He shouted and clapped his hands as he learned. His Mama Bear was so proud of him.
After some time, Tommy learned so much from his Mama Bear. She provided him with all of the love and knowledge that he needed. With her help, Tommy became a very smart and wise little bear.
