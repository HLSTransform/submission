Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Luna. Luna was a fit cat who loved to play and run. She lived in a big house with her best friend, a little girl named Mia.
One day, Mia and Luna found a can of tuna. They both loved tuna very much. Mia said, "Let's pray that we can open this can and share the tuna together!" So, they both closed their eyes and prayed very hard.
When they opened their eyes, they saw that the can was open! Mia and Luna were so happy. They sat down and shared the tasty tuna. From that day on, they always remembered to pray and be thankful for the good things in their lives.
