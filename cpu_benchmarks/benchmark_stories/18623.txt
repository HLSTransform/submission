Once upon a time, there was a little baby named Timmy. Timmy was very naughty and he loved to jump on his crib. His mommy always told him to stop, but he never listened. One day, Timmy's mommy went to the store and left him with his big sister, Lily.
Lily told Timmy to stop jumping on his crib, but he didn't listen. Suddenly, Timmy fell off his crib and started crying. Lily helped him up and asked him if he learned his lesson. Timmy nodded his head.
When their mommy came back from the store, Lily told her what happened. Their mommy was happy that Timmy learned his lesson. She hugged him and they all laughed together.
The moral of the story is to always listen to your family when they tell you to stop doing something naughty.
