Lila and Sam were playing on the porch. They had a big box of cheap toys that their mom gave them. They liked to make up stories with the toys and pretend they were in different places.
"Let's go to the ocean!" Lila said. She picked up a blue toy fish and made it swim in the air. "Look, Sam, this is a dolphin. It can dive very fast and jump out of the water."
Sam nodded. He grabbed a yellow toy boat and put it on the floor. "And this is our boat. We can sail on the ocean and see the dolphins. Maybe they will come and say hello to us."
Lila and Sam moved their toys around and made noises like the ocean and the dolphins. They had a lot of fun. But then they heard their mom calling them from inside the house.
"Kids, it's time for lunch. Come inside and wash your hands."
Lila and Sam looked at each other. They didn't want to stop playing. They wanted to stay on the porch and go to the ocean.
"Can we play a little more, mom?" Lila asked.
"No, you can't. You need to eat and take a nap. You can play later, after you wake up." Mom said.
Lila and Sam sighed. They put their toys back in the box and got up from the porch. They followed their mom inside the house. They hoped they could dream about the ocean and the dolphins while they slept.
