Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and draw pictures. One day, she found a purple crayon and started making a picture of the universe. 
As she drew, she thought about how big and amazing the universe was. She wondered if she could ever see it all. Then, she remembered something her mommy had told her. "Lily," she had said, "you can gain anything you want if you work hard and never give up." 
So Lily decided to keep drawing and learning about the universe. She read books and asked questions. She even went to the planetarium to see the stars. And little by little, she gained knowledge about the universe. 
In the end, Lily realized that the universe was too big to see all at once. But she was happy because she had gained so much knowledge about it. And she knew that if she kept working hard and never gave up, she could gain anything she wanted in life.
