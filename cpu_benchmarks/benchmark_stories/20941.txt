Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She loved to play in the kitchen with her toys. One day, when she was playing there, one of her toys had broken. Amy started to cry.
Then, her mom came in the kitchen and saw the broken toy. She said to Amy, “Don't worry, sweetie. Everything can be fixed. Let's see if we can find a way to fix your toy.” She looked for glue and some tape, and Amy helped too. They worked together until the toy was fixed.
After it was done, Amy was very happy. She was so proud that she even gave her mom a big hug! Her mom smiled at her and said, “See? With a little effort and some hard work, anything can be fixed.”
From then on, Amy would always remember the lesson her mom taught her: no matter how broken something is, if you try hard enough, you can make it shine again.
