Jamie was a three year old who loved going on adventures. He had been playing in the garden when he heard something unusual. It was soft and growling. It was coming from the forest at the end of the garden. 
Jamie was scared, but he found the courage to go look. In the middle of the forest he saw a large, fluffy cat. It was meowing and swishing its long tail. Jamie wanted to find out what the cat was doing, so he followed it.
 
The cat led him to a small house at the edge of the forest. The cat hopped on the porch and meowed again. Suddenly, an old lady appeared at the door. She said "Welcome, cat!" and the cat hopped right inside. 
Curious, Jamie followed the cat in. The inside of the house was full of knick-knacks and furry rugs. In the corner was an ashtray with something strange in it. The old lady told Jamie it was a special treat for the cat because he was such a good friend. She said it was a spoiled fish!
Jamie went home filled with curiosity and excitement. He could hardly wait to go back to the mysterious house in the forest!
