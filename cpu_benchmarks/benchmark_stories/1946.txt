Once upon a time, there was a tall duck. He wanted to swim, but there was a wall in his way. He tried and tried to find a way to get over the wall.
Finally, he spotted a tall tree. He waddled over and climbed to the top. From there, he could see over the wall. He jumped down and landed on the other side.
Then, the tall duck spread his wings and started to swim. He swam and swam until he got tired. Then he hopped onto a big rock to take a rest.
He watched the sun setting in the sky and then flew back home. From then on, he went swimming every day.
