One day, a girl named Ann went to her mom's kitchen. She saw her mom making thick soup for lunch. Ann wanted to help her mom. She asked, "Can I help you, Mom?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Of course! You can help me fix the soup. We need to add more carrots." Ann was happy to help. She found the carrots and put them in the soup. The soup started to smell very good.
Later, Ann and her mom sat down to eat the soup. Ann took a big spoonful and tasted it. She was so proud of the soup she helped fix. "This is the best soup ever, Mom!" Ann said. Her mom agreed and they both enjoyed the thick soup they made together.
