Tom and Jen are twins. They like to play on the farm with their dad. One day, dad says he has a surprise for them. He takes them to the barn and shows them two baby cows. One is brown and one is black.
"Which one do you want to keep?" dad asks. "You can choose one each."
Tom likes the brown cow. He thinks it is cute and soft. He gives it a hug and says, "I choose this one. I will name it Brownie."
Jen likes the black cow. She thinks it is strong and brave. She gives it a pat and says, "I choose this one. I will name it Jet."
Dad smiles and says, "Good choices. You can feed them and play with them every day. But remember, they will grow up to be large cows. You have to take good care of them."
Tom and Jen are happy. They thank dad and run to get some hay for their cows. They do not know that Brownie and Jet have a secret. They are not ordinary cows. They are magic cows.
One night, when Tom and Jen are asleep, Brownie and Jet sneak out of the barn. They use their magic to fly over the fields and the woods. They have fun and see many things. They come back before dawn and pretend to be normal cows.
Tom and Jen do not notice anything. They love their cows and their cows love them. But sometimes, they wonder why their cows have sparkles in their eyes and feathers in their fur.
