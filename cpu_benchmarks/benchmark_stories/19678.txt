Once upon a time there was a port. Every day, many boats filled the port sending delicate goods around the world. 
One day, a big storm came and the boats all had to move away to stay safe. The waves got bigger and bigger until they became huge mountains that crashed down on the port. 
Some of the ships were silly and stayed in the port instead of going away. The storm got bigger and bigger, and soon it was too big and the boats were smashed. 
The delicate goods flew out of the port and into the sea. Things were in pieces and some of the boats sank. 
The next day, the storm was gone and the port was a mess. But with a bit of help and a bit of luck, the port slowly became neat again and the boats returned.
