Mommy made coffee. She wasn't very good at it though, she was a bit clumsy. She spilled some of the hot liquid on her arm and yelped.
"Mommy, what's wrong?!" asked the little three year old boy.
"I'm okay, baby," she said, rubbing the red mark on her arm. "That's why I need to be more careful with hot coffee. Would you like one?"
The little boy smiled and nodded.
Mommy filled a small cup with coffee and gave it to the boy. He looked down at the cup curiously, never having seen coffee before. He took a sip and made a terrible face.
"It's too bitter," he said.
Mommy chuckled.
"I know, baby," she said, giving the boy a hug. "That's why it's better to add a bit of sugar. Would you like that?"
The little boy nodded eagerly and soon enough, he was happily drinking a sweet cup of coffee.
