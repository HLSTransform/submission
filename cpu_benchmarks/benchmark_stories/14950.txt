Billy was on an exciting march. He saw lots of pretty flowers and he waved at the birds as he passed by. He started to get tired, so he decided to take a break. He sat down beside a tree and looked up.
Billy saw two cute squirrels jumping around and asked them, "What are you two doing?"
The squirrels answered, "We are borrowing some pretty flowers from the forest. We like to march around with them and make lots of noise."
Billy smiled. He wanted to join them, so he borrowed some flowers too. Then everyone waved the flowers around as they marched up and down the path. It was a lot of fun!
