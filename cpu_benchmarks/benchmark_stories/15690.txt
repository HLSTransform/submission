Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lisa. She was three years old and she had long, red curls.
One day, Lisa went outside to play in the garden. Suddenly, she heard a strange sound. It was coming from the sky! Lisa looked up and saw a beautiful colourful rainbow. She hopped up and down with joy!
Then, Lisa heard another sound. It was an angry bee! Lisa ran away as fast as she could. She was scared of the bee.
But Lisa was brave. She decided to stop and hope. She closed her eyes and wished that the bee would go away. Suddenly, she heard a different sound. It was a soft buzz. The bee had flown away! Lisa had been brave, but she was also lucky.
Lisa opened her eyes and smiled. She said to herself, "I'm so glad that stupid bee had gone away. I knew I could hope and it would be OK."
