Once upon a time there was a big truck. The truck was so big it could carry a lot of things. One day it was time to load the truck. The truck driver was moving very fast. He was so busy, he didn't notice the big shock at the bottom of the truck.
The big shock made a loud noise. Everyone in the street stopped to look. The truck driver was very surprised. He looked around, but could not see what it was.
At last he saw the shock. He stopped and got out of the truck. He had to be very careful so he didn't get a shock himself! He removed the shock and then he was able to load the truck again.
The truck driver was glad that he was being careful. He drove the truck away and everyone in the street cheered. They were so happy that the truck had been loaded safely, thanks to the driver's carefulness.
