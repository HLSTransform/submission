Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He liked to go to the restaurant with his family. They went there every week because it was their regular place to eat. 
One day, Timmy saw a big jar of candy at the restaurant. He wanted to eat some, but his mom said he had to count his money first. Timmy had three shiny coins in his pocket, so he counted them carefully. 
He realized he had enough money to buy some candy. Timmy was so happy that he counted his coins again and ran to the jar of candy. He picked out his favorite flavor and ate it with a big smile on his face. From that day on, Timmy always counted his money before going to the restaurant, hoping to get some more candy.
