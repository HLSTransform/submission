Sammy was an eager three-year-old. He loved to explore and see new things. At the park one sunny day, he noticed something sparkling in the grass. He bent down and grabbed the object - it was a velvet bag! Inside the bag were a few shiny coins. 
Sammy ran to his mom and asked her what the shiny coins were. She told him that it was a special surprise and he should yield them for now. Sammy was so excited that he decided to keep it in his pocket for safekeeping.
Later, Sammy decided to take the coins back to the park. He was eager to return them to the place he found them and see if someone else had put them there. As he walked back, he suddenly heard a voice call out.
“There you are!” said an old man happily. “I was looking for my coins all over the place!”
Sammy eagerly handed the coins back to the man and felt very proud. The man thanked Sammy and gave him a hug. From that day, Sammy knew how nice it was to yield things back to their rightful owner.
