Once upon a time, there was a tall dark valley. It was full of mystery and surprise.
One day, a little girl decided to explore the valley. She walked around and read all the signs. She discovered that the valley was full of colourful flowers and birds. 
The little girl was so excited to explore the valley that she decided to spend the whole day there. As the sun went down, the valley became dark. But the little girl was not scared. 
She looked up at the stars and kept reading the signs. She read about the different plants and animals that lived in the valley. Then, she started to feel sleepy.
She curled up and fell asleep in the dark valley. In the morning, when the sun came up, she was ready to learn more and explore the valley once more.
