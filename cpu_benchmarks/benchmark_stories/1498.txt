Sally saw a perfect tree in her backyard. She was excited and wanted to climb it. She grabbed a hold of the trunk and started to climb.
Halfway up the tree, she saw a worm. It was round and wiggling. She wanted to touch it, so she reached out and touched it gently. The worm wriggled around and then crawled away.
She kept on climbing, until she reached the top. From up there, she could see everything. The view was perfect!
She smiled and hugged the tree. Then, she carefully climbed down. Before she went inside, Sally looked up at the tree and thanked it.
