Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his favorite truck. One day, he went to the park to play with his truck. He drove it all around and had so much fun.
Suddenly, a big dog came running towards Timmy. Timmy got scared because he thought the dog was dangerous. The dog barked and Timmy started to cry.
A lady came over and asked Timmy what was wrong. Timmy told her about the dog and how he was scared. The lady told Timmy not to worry and that the dog belonged to her. She put the dog on a leash and walked away. Timmy felt much better and went back to playing with his truck. He even shared some of his salted pretzels with the lady and the dog.
