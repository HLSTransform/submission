Once there was a mommy and a baby. The baby was so adorable. Mommy took her on a safari. They wanted to find lots of animals! They only had to look around to find them.
They saw elephants, giraffes and monkeys. Mommy was so amazed by all the animals she saw. The baby was too!
The mommy and baby kept exploring in the safari. Then they saw something very special. It was a little cub who was looking for a home. He wanted to fit in with the other animals. 
The mommy and baby were so excited to find this cub. They put him with the other animals, and soon he fit right in! He was so happy and made some new friends. 
The mommy and baby looked on happily. They were glad that the cub could fit in with his new animal friends. 
The end!
