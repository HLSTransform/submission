Once upon a time, there was a kind boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a sheet to use for a picnic. Timmy and his friends played on the sheet and had a lot of fun.
Suddenly, dark clouds appeared in the sky. Timmy's mom saw the clouds and came outside. "We have to go inside now," she said. "I don't want you to get wet."
Timmy said, "But we're having so much fun! Can't we stay outside?"
His mom replied, "I'm sorry, Timmy. We have to prevent getting sick. Let's go inside and have some hot chocolate."
Timmy and his friends picked up the sheet and went inside with Timmy's mom. They drank hot chocolate and told stories until the rain stopped. Even though they couldn't play outside anymore, they still had a lot of fun together.
