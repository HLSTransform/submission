Once upon a time there was a navy. It was so beautiful! All of the people knew it was special.
The navy would sail around the world. They saw all kinds of amazing things. Every day on the boat was an adventure.
One day, they discovered a beautiful island. Everyone was surprised and excited. They knew the island was amazing.
The navy stayed on the island for a few days. Everyone had so much fun exploring and playing. They made lots of new friends, too! 
When it was time to leave, the navy waved goodbye to their new friends and sailed away. They knew they would never forget their beautiful island.
