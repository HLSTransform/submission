Once there was an ugly barn. One day, a kangaroo arrived at the barn. He wanted to jump inside, but the door was closed. Luckily, the kangaroo had a clever idea. He jumped up, and put his paws on the door. With a big push, he managed to open it! Soon the kangaroo was jumping up and down, exploring the barn. He discovered lots of things, and had lots of fun. 
The kangaroo was so busy jumping around that he didn't notice the farmer coming. When he saw the kangaroo, the farmer was astonished! He chased the kangaroo out of the barn. The kangaroo was scared, so he jumped, and jumped, and jumped until he was far away from the ugly barn.
