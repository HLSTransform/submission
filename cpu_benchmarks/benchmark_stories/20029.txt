Sara got a balloon for her birthday. It was red and shiny and had a string. She liked her balloon very much. It was her original balloon, not like the others.
She took her balloon outside to play. She ran and jumped and laughed with her balloon. The wind was blowing and the sun was bright. Sara was happy.
But then, something bad happened. The string slipped from her hand and the balloon flew away. Sara tried to catch it, but it was too fast. She watched it go higher and higher in the sky. She felt sad and cried. She lost her original balloon.
Her mom saw her and hugged her. She said, "I'm sorry, Sara. I know you loved your balloon. But don't worry, we can get you another one. Maybe a blue one, or a yellow one, or a pink one. Which one do you want?"
Sara wiped her tears and thought. She said, "I want a red one. Like my original balloon. But can you tie it to my wrist, mom? So I don't lose it again."
Her mom smiled and said, "Of course, Sara. Let's go to the store and find you a new red balloon. And maybe a cookie, too. How does that sound?"
Sara nodded and smiled. She still missed her original balloon, but she was happy to get a new one. And a cookie. She held her mom's hand and they walked to the store. Sara hoped her new balloon would be as shiny as her original one.
