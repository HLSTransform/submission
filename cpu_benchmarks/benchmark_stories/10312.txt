Lily liked to design boats. She used paper, glue, and crayons to make them. She wanted to sail them on the pond. But she had a problem. Her brother Ben was very nosy. He always wanted to see what she was doing. He would take her boats and play with them. He would break them or lose them. Lily was sad and angry.
One day, Lily had an idea. She decided to make a special boat for Ben. She used paper, glue, and crayons to make it. But she also added something else. She put some pepper inside the boat. She hoped that Ben would sneeze when he opened it. She thought that would teach him a lesson.
She left the boat on the table and went to the pond. She sailed her other boats and had fun. She waited for Ben to come and find the boat. She wanted to see his face when he sneezed.
But Ben did not come. He was busy with something else. He did not see the boat on the table. He did not touch it or open it. He did not sneeze.
Lily came back from the pond. She saw the boat on the table. She was curious. She wondered if Ben had seen it. She picked it up and opened it. She saw the pepper. She sneezed. She sneezed again and again. She felt silly and sorry. She realized that her idea was not very nice. She wished she had not done it.
She learned a lesson. She learned that being nosy is not good. But she also learned that being mean is not good either. She decided to be more kind and respectful to her brother. She hoped that he would do the same to her. She thought that maybe they could design boats together and have more fun.
