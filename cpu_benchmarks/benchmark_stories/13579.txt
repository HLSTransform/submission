Once upon a time, there was a silly cow named Betsy. Betsy loved to dance and sing all day long. One day, Betsy met a friendly mailman named Tim. 
"Hello, Betsy! What are you up to today?" Tim asked with a smile. 
"I am going to dance and sing in the field," Betsy replied happily. 
"That sounds like fun! Do you want me to mail a letter to your friends to join you?" Tim asked kindly. 
"Yes, please! That would be great!" Betsy exclaimed with excitement. 
Tim mailed the letter and soon, Betsy's friends arrived. They danced and sang together in the field all day long. Betsy was so happy and grateful for her silly friends and the kind mailman who helped her bring them together.
