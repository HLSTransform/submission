Once upon a time, there was a crane who lived in a big, tall tree. One day, the tree started to tremble and shake. The crane got scared and flew away to find a safer place to live. 
As the crane was flying, he smelled something very smelly. It was a skunk! The skunk was walking around, looking for food. The crane didn't want to get too close to the smelly skunk, so he flew higher into the sky. 
Finally, the crane found a new home near a peaceful river. He built a cozy nest and felt safe and happy. The end.
