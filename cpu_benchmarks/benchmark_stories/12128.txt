Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her toys and eat candy. One day, Lily's mom told her to clean her room. Lily didn't want to clean her room, so she started to play with her toys instead. 
After a while, Lily's mom came back and saw that Lily hadn't cleaned her room. She got grumpy and told Lily that she had to clean her room or else she couldn't have any candy. Lily didn't want to clean her room, but she really wanted candy, so she started to pick up all the junk on the floor. 
As she was cleaning, Lily started to think about how much nicer her room looked when it was clean. She realized that it wasn't so bad to clean her room after all. When she was done, Lily's mom came back and saw that Lily had done a great job. She was very happy and gave Lily some candy as a reward. From then on, Lily always made sure to clean her room so that she could have candy and make her mom happy.
