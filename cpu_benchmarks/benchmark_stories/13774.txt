Tim and Jen are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big ladder by a tree. Tim wants to climb the ladder. He says to Jen, "Look, a ladder! Let's go up and see what is up there!"
Jen is scared. She says to Tim, "No, Tim, it is too high. We might fall and hurt ourselves. Let's play something else."
But Tim does not listen. He runs to the ladder and starts to climb. He says to Jen, "Come on, Jen, don't be a baby. It is fun up here. You are just jealous because you are too scared to climb."
Jen is sad and angry. She does not like how Tim talks to her. She says to Tim, "Fine, Tim, you can stay up there. I don't want to play with you anymore. You are mean and rude."
She turns around and walks away. Tim does not care. He thinks he is brave and cool. He climbs higher and higher. He looks down and sees Jen leaving. He says to himself, "Ha, Jen is a silly girl. She does not know what she is missing. I am the best climber in the park."
But then, something bad happens. The ladder is old and weak. It breaks under Tim's weight. Tim falls down and hits the ground hard. He cries out in pain. He is hurt and alone. He wishes Jen was there to help him. He says to himself, "Oh no, what have I done? I was wrong and stupid. Jen was right and smart. I miss Jen. I want Jen."
