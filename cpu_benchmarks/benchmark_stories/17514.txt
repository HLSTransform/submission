Lily and Tom were best friends. They liked to play in the park and share their toys. One day, they saw a big truck with a picture of ice-cream on it. They ran to the truck and asked for ice-cream.
"Can we have ice-cream, please?" they said to the man in the truck.
"Sure, what flavor do you want?" the man said.
"I want chocolate," Lily said.
"I want strawberry," Tom said.
The man gave them two cones with ice-cream. They were very happy and licked their ice-cream.
But then, a big dog came and barked at them. Lily and Tom were scared and dropped their ice-cream on the ground. The dog ate their ice-cream and ran away.
Lily and Tom were very sad. They cried and hugged each other.
"I'm sorry, Lily. I wanted to share my ice-cream with you," Tom said.
"I'm sorry, Tom. I wanted to share my ice-cream with you, too," Lily said.
The man in the truck saw them and felt sorry for them. He came to them and said, "Don't cry, kids. I have more ice-cream for you. Do you want to try a different flavor?"
Lily and Tom nodded and wiped their tears. The man gave them two new cones with ice-cream. This time, Lily had vanilla and Tom had banana.
They smiled and thanked the man. They ate their ice-cream and enjoyed it. They were happy again and filled with joy. They decided to share their ice-cream with each other and with the birds in the park. They learned that ice-cream is better when you share it with someone you love.
