Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Annie. She was only 3 years old, but very brave. 
Annie was walking in the park when she saw a man who was walking a big dog. The dog was wearing a big belt. Annie wanted to have a closer look and so she moved closer.
The man saw this and yelled "No! Go away!". Annie was a bit scared and so she took a few steps back.
Annie began to feel a bit sad but then the man said "Do you want to see the dog's belt?". Annie was very excited and nodded her head. 
The man let Annie look at the belt and she was very grateful. She thanked the man and they both went on their separate ways, feeling very happy.
