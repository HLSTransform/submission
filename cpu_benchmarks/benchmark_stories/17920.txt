Once upon a time there was an elderly man. He had a pit in his garden. He wanted to make it smaller so he decided to shrink it. He put his hand in his pocket and out came a magic shrinking potion.
He sprinkled the potion over the pit. He watched as it began to shrink and shrink until it was tiny. 
The man was delighted with his shrinking pit. He planted a tree in the middle and he had a beautiful garden with a tiny, shrunken pit in the middle. 
The man was so proud of his work. He showed all his family and friends his little shrinking pit and they were very impressed.
The man and his tiny shrinking pit stayed together for the rest of his life. Everyone who saw it remembered his incredible shrinking pit.
