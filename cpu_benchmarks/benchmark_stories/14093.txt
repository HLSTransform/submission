Charlie was hungry, so he went to the kitchen. He knew there was cereal in the cupboard. He went to get it, but it was too high up! He was sad, but then he heard something.
It was a harsh voice. It came from behind him. He turned around and saw an old man. The man said that he would help Charlie get his cereal, but he wanted something in exchange. Charlie didn't know what to do.
The old man asked Charlie to give him a hug. It was a scary request, but Charlie was so desperate for cereal that he hugged the strange old man. It was very strange and felt uncomfortable, but Charlie was relieved when the old man gave him the cereal.
But then something bad happened. The old man said he now owned Charlie and could do whatever he wanted with him. Charlie was so scared! He didn't know what to do. He had been tricked and now he was stuck!
