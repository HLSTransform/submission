Once upon a time there was a big tree. Every day, the boy climbed the tree and touched the leaves. He felt so happy when he was up in the tree.
One time, the boy's mom saw him climbing the tree. She was very happy to see him being so obedient. She said, "Thank you for being obedient. I'm glad you are safe."
The boy loved playing in the tree. He would climb it every day, and touch the leaves. He always wanted to be obedient and do what his mom said.
One day, the boy got to the top of the tree. He thought he could touch the sky with his hand. He reached out and felt the sky with one giant touch. It was so high and so big.
The boy smiled and said, "Mom, I touched the sky. I'm sure you're proud of me now!"
