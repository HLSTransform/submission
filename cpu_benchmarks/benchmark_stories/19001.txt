Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play with her toys and go on adventures with her teddy bear, Brownie. One day, Lily's mommy said, "Lily, it's time for Brownie to take a nap. You can play quietly while he sleeps."
Lily looked at Brownie and said, "Okay mommy, I'll be quiet so Brownie can nap." She then went to her room to play with her dolls. After a while, Lily's daddy came home from work. He was very tired and wanted to take a nap too.
Lily went to her daddy and said, "Daddy, you can nap in my room. It's quiet in there." Her daddy smiled and said, "Thank you, Lily. You're such a good helper." And with that, her daddy took a nap in Lily's room while she played quietly with her toys.
