Once there was a beautiful little girl. She was only three years old and was very sad. She had never had a doll before and so she was very lonely.
One day the little girl's mother saw how sad she was and gave her a handmade doll. The doll was so special because it had been stitched with lots of love and care. 
The little girl was very happy when she saw the doll. She hugged it close and it made her feel comforted. She promised that it would be her best friend forever. 
They did lots of fun things together and the little girl was never lonely again. She loved her beautiful doll and cherished it forever more.
