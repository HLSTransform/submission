Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big sister named Sarah who loved to play with her.
One day, they went to the park and Sarah pushed Lily on the swing. Lily laughed and said, "Higher, higher!" Sarah pushed her higher and higher until Lily felt like she was flying.
Suddenly, Sarah said, "Pause, let's take a break." Lily stopped swinging and looked at her sister. Sarah smiled and said, "Look at the wide sky, it's so beautiful." Lily looked up and saw the blue sky with fluffy white clouds. She smiled and said, "I love you, sister." Sarah hugged her and said, "I love you too, Lily."
