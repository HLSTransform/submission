Anna and Ben are playing with their toys in the living room. Anna likes to be organized. She puts all her dolls in a row, and all her blocks in a pile. Ben likes to be messy. He throws his cars and trains all over the floor, and makes loud noises.
"Ben, stop it!" Anna says. "You are making a big mess. I don't like it."
"I don't care," Ben says. "I like to have fun. You are boring."
Anna feels sad and angry. She wants to play with Ben, but he does not listen to her. She looks around and sees a big stuffed lion on the couch. She has an idea.
"Ben, do you want to play with the lion?" Anna asks.
Ben looks at the lion and smiles. He likes lions. They are big and strong and scary.
"OK, let's play with the lion," Ben says.
Anna and Ben take the lion and pretend it is a real lion. They make it roar and run and jump. They have fun together. Anna feels happy and Ben feels sorry.
"Anna, I'm sorry I was mean to you," Ben says. "You are not boring. You are my sister and I love you."
"I love you too, Ben," Anna says. "And I'm sorry I was bossy. You are not messy. You are creative."
They hug each other and the lion. They decide to share their toys and play nicely. They are organized and messy, and they are happy.
