Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the village. One day, they see a big sign. The sign says: "Do not go in the forest. It is dangerous."
Tom says: "I want to go in the forest. It looks fun. Maybe we can find animals or flowers."
Sue says: "No, Tom. We have to listen to the sign. The sign is there to keep us safe. The forest can have bad things, like snakes or thorns or traps."
Tom says: "You are scared, Sue. I am not scared. I am brave. I will go in the forest and show you."
Sue says: "Please, Tom. Do not go. Stay with me. We can play something else."
But Tom does not listen. He runs to the forest. He leaves Sue behind. Sue is sad and worried.
Tom goes in the forest. He sees many trees and plants. He thinks it is beautiful. He does not see any animals or flowers. He goes deeper and deeper. He does not know where he is.
Soon, he hears a loud roar. He sees a big bear. The bear is angry. The bear wants to eat Tom. Tom is scared. He screams. He runs. He tries to find the way out.
Sue hears Tom scream. She runs to the forest. She sees the sign. She is afraid. But she loves Tom. She wants to help him. She goes in the forest. She calls Tom's name.
Tom hears Sue call. He is happy. He follows her voice. He sees her. She sees him. They hug. They are glad.
But the bear is still there. The bear is fast. The bear is close. Tom and Sue have to run. They run and run. They see the sign. They see the village. They are almost there.
But the bear is faster. The bear catches Tom. The bear bites Tom's leg. Tom cries. Sue cries. They are in pain.
The people in the village hear the cries. They see the bear. They grab sticks and stones. They throw them at the bear. The bear is hurt. The bear is scared. The bear runs away.
The people help Tom and Sue. They take them to the doctor. The doctor fixes Tom's leg. The doctor gives them hugs. The doctor says: "You are lucky. You are brave. But you are also silly. You should not go in the forest. You should listen to the sign. The sign is there to keep you safe."
Tom and Sue say: "We are sorry. We are sorry. We will listen to the sign. We will not go in the forest. We will stay in the village. We will play something else."
The people say: "That is good. That is good. We are happy. We are happy. You are our friends. You are our friends. We love you. We love you."
