Once upon a time there was a girl named Bella. Bella was 3 years old, and loved to explore new things. One day, Bella was in her house when her mom asked her a question.
"Bella, sweetheart, do you know where the bathroom is?"
Bella smiled and answered, "Yes! I know!" Then she ran off to find the bathroom. 
Bella opened the door to the bathroom and inside she saw a tub full of water. She thought it looked fun and wanted to get in. So she stepped in, but it was too slippery and she fell.
Bella was hurt and started to cry. Her mom heard her crying and quickly came to comfort her. 
Bella's mom hugged her and wiped away her tears. She said, "It's ok, sweetheart. You're not hurt anymore. Everything's ok." 
Bella was happy again and smiled. She climbed out of the tub and her mom helped her get dressed. Then they did something fun together. 
The End.
