Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she saw a bee buzzing around the flowers. The bee was furry and yellow. 
Lily wanted to say hello to the bee, but she didn't want to get pinched by its stinger. So she watched from a safe distance. The bee flew from flower to flower, collecting nectar. 
Suddenly, a gust of wind blew and the bee got stuck in Lily's hair. She was scared, but she knew not to pinch the bee. So she carefully untangled the bee from her hair and set it free. The bee flew away, and Lily felt happy that she helped a furry little friend.
