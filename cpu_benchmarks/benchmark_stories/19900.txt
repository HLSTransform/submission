Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to peek around the house to see what her mommy and daddy were doing. One day, she peeked into the refrigerator and saw lots of yummy food inside. 
Lily's mommy came into the kitchen and saw her peeking. "What are you doing, Lily?" she asked. 
"I'm looking in the refrigerator," Lily said. "It's so useful for keeping our food cold." 
"Yes, it is," her mommy said with a smile. "Now, let's make a sandwich with some of the food we have in there." 
Lily helped her mommy make the sandwich and they sat down to eat it together. It was the best sandwich Lily had ever tasted, and she was happy she peeked inside the refrigerator to find the ingredients. From that day on, Lily loved to help her mommy in the kitchen and use the useful refrigerator to make delicious meals.
