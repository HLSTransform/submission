Little Joe had a large look and a big dream. He wanted to supply all the children in his town with toys. He was determined to make it happen.
He first went to the toy store and picked out a large box of toys. He carried the box home and got to work. Little Joe made sure each toy was in perfect condition. He loved seeing the smiles on the childrenâ€™s faces.
Little Joe then got some friends to help him. They collected big bags of toys and walked around the town. Every child that they met was given a toy. The kids were so happy and Little Joe was overjoyed.
The adults in the town saw what Little Joe was doing and joined in the fun. They all combined their resources and supplied the entire town with toys. Little Joe's dream had come true! Everyone laughed and celebrated. Little Joe had really made a difference!
