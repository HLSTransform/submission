Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy who had a parrot named Polly. Timmy loved Polly very much and would play with her every day. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over and asked to borrow Polly. Timmy was happy to lend Polly to his friend.
But Billy was ignorant about how to take care of a parrot. He didn't know that parrots need lots of food and water. He also didn't know that parrots need to be kept in a cage to stay safe. Billy let Polly fly around his house and didn't give her enough to eat or drink.
When Timmy came to get Polly back, he found her very sick. Polly was so sick that she died soon after. Timmy was very sad and angry at Billy for not taking good care of Polly. From that day on, Timmy never lent his beloved pets to anyone again.
