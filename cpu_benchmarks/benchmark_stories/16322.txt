Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his toy cars. One day, Timmy's mom gave him some peanut butter to spread on his bread. Timmy loved peanut butter, so he spread it all over his bread with a stick.
After Timmy finished his snack, he went to play with his toy cars. But he accidentally dropped his bread on the floor. The peanut butter stuck to the floor and made it very dull. Timmy's mom was very upset because she had just cleaned the floor.
Timmy realized he should have been more careful and not played with his toys near his snack. He learned the moral value of being responsible and not making a mess. From that day on, Timmy made sure to eat his snacks at the table and play with his toys in his play area.
