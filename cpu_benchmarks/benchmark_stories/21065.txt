Lily and Tom were going on a big trip with Mom and Dad. They were very excited to see new things and have fun. Mom and Dad told them to pack their bags and get ready to go to the airport.
"Did you pack your passport, Lily?" Mom asked.
"Yes, Mom, I did. It is in my pink bag. See?" Lily showed Mom her passport. It had her name and picture on it.
"Good girl. And you, Tom?" Mom asked.
Tom looked at his blue bag and frowned. He did not pack his passport. He forgot. He felt a big urge to cry.
"Tom, where is your passport?" Dad asked.
"I...I don't know, Dad. I can't find it," Tom said in a small voice.
Mom and Dad looked at each other and then at the clock. They had to leave soon or they would miss their plane. They felt a big urge to panic.
"Tom, think hard. Where did you last see your passport?" Dad asked.
Tom tried to think. He remembered that he played with his passport yesterday. He pretended it was a magic card that could take him anywhere. He had fun with it. But where did he put it?
He looked around his room. He saw his toys, his books, his clothes, but no passport. He felt a big urge to give up.
"Tom, please, we don't have much time. Do you remember anything else?" Mom asked.
Tom looked at Mom. She looked pale and worried. He did not want to make her sad. He felt a big urge to help.
He thought harder. He remembered that he took his passport to the backyard. He wanted to show it to his friend Max, who lived next door. He and Max played with it. They pretended it was a ticket to a spaceship. They had fun with it. But where did they leave it?
He ran to the backyard. He saw his bike, his ball, his swing, but no passport. He felt a big urge to scream.
"Tom, did you find it?" Dad shouted from the door.
Tom shook his head. He did not find it. He felt a big urge to hide.
But then he saw something. He saw a flash of blue in the grass. He ran to it. He picked it up. It was his passport. It was dirty and wet, but it was his passport.
He felt a big urge to smile.
He ran to the door. He showed his passport to Mom and Dad.
"I found it! I found it!" he shouted.
Mom and Dad hugged him. They felt a big urge to cry, too. But they were happy tears.
They grabbed their bags and went to the car. They drove to the airport. They made it to their plane. They went on their big trip. They saw new things and had fun.
And Tom never forgot his passport again.
