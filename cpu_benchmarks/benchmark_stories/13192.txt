Once upon a time, there was a rich millionaire. He had a big, reliable yacht and he liked to take it out on the sea. One day he took some of his friends out for a ride on the yacht. The millionaire liked to show off his reliable yacht, but his friends just complained about the noise.
The millionaire didn't like the complaining so he asked them to leave the yacht. He wanted to have a lovely trip by himself. The millionaire sailed away with the reliable yacht and only listened to the sound of the waves.
He sailed until he reached a small island in the middle of the sea. As the sun set, he watched the stars come out. The millionaire felt the joy of being in such a beautiful and peaceful place. He couldn't hear anyone complaining on the reliable yacht. 
The millionaire was so happy that he even sang a little song about joy and peace. Then he sailed away, happy to have a beautiful and reliable yacht.
