Tom and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to make houses and cars and animals with their blocks and dolls and cars. But they only had one roll of tape to stick things together. Tom wanted to use the tape to make a big tower with his blocks. Lily wanted to use the tape to make a dress for her doll.
"Give me the tape, Tom!" Lily said. "I need it for my doll!"
"No, I need it for my tower!" Tom said. "You can use something else!"
They both pulled on the tape, trying to take it from each other. The tape stretched and snapped, and the pieces fell on the floor. Tom and Lily looked at the broken tape and started to cry.
Mom heard their cries and came to the living room. She saw the mess and the tears and asked them what happened.
"We broke the tape, Mom!" Tom and Lily said. "We both wanted it and we pulled too hard!"
Mom hugged them and said, "I'm sorry, my loves. Tape is not for fighting. Tape is for sharing and making things together. Do you want to try again?"
Tom and Lily nodded and wiped their eyes. Mom gave them a new roll of tape and helped them to make a tower and a dress. They said sorry to each other and played nicely. They were happy again.
The end.
