Once upon a time, there was a festival. Everyone was excited and speeded about, having lots of fun. 
Annabelle was at the festival with her mom and dad. She wanted to try something new and delicious, so she went to the food stall. She saw lots of interesting food, but the one that caught her eye was a sour treat. She excitedly asked her mom if she could try it. 
Her mom said yes, and Annabelle eagerly took a bite. The sour treat was so tangy and delicious! She couldn't help but speed away and eat some more. 
Annabelle had a great time at the festival, and she couldn't wait to go back next year. She was so happy that she got to try something new and tasty.
