Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went for a walk with her mommy. They saw lots of birds and flowers on their walk. 
Suddenly, Lily fell down and got embarrassed. Her mommy helped her up and said, "It's okay, Lily. Everyone falls sometimes." Lily felt better and they continued their walk.
Later, they saw a man with a big camera. He asked if he could record them walking. Lily's mommy said yes, and they smiled for the camera. Lily was happy to be on the video and couldn't wait to show her friends. 
After their walk, they went home and watched the video. Lily was so excited to see herself on the screen. She said to her mommy, "I love our walks. Let's do it again tomorrow!"
