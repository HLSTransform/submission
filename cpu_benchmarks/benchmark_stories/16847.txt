Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw pictures with her crayons. One day, she drew a square on a piece of paper. It was her favorite shape!
But then, her little brother came and stole her paper. He wanted to draw on it too. Lily was very upset. She told her brother that he shouldn't take things that don't belong to him. Her brother felt sorry and gave the paper back to Lily.
Lily forgave her brother and they both drew pictures on the paper together. Lily drew a big square and her brother drew a little circle. They were both happy and played together for the rest of the day. The end.
