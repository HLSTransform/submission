Once upon a time there was a creative clown. He liked to have fun and make people laugh. One day he decided he wanted to take a bath. He filled the tub with warm water and bubbles and hopped right in. He laughed and splashed around, so happy to be enjoying a fun bath. After a while, he hopped out and put on his colorful clown costume. He went out to the park to entertain the kids with all his clowning around. They loved to watch him be creative and excitedly laughed and cheered. The creative clown was so happy and ready to have fun!
