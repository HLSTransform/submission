Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play with a ball in the park. They kick the ball to each other and have fun. One day, they see a big white cake on a table. The cake looks yummy. It has pink frosting and sprinkles.
Tim and Sam want to eat the cake. They run to the table and grab a slice each. They do not see the sign that says "Happy Birthday Lily". They do not see Lily and her mom coming to the park. They do not hear Lily's mom say "Stop! That is our cake!"
Tim and Sam bite the cake. It is not yummy. It is yucky. It is salty and sour and spicy. They spit out the cake and make a face. They feel sick. They look at the sign and see Lily and her mom. They are angry. They yell at Tim and Sam.
"Bad boys! You stole our cake! That is not a real cake. It is a prank cake. We made it for Lily's mean cousin who always bullies her. You ruined our surprise. Go away!"
Tim and Sam are sorry. They say sorry to Lily and her mom. They drop the cake and run away. They are sad and ashamed. They do not want to play with the ball anymore. They do not want to see the cake anymore. They do not want to be friends anymore. They learned a lesson. They will never steal cake again.
