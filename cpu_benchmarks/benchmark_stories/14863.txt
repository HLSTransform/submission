Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her toys. One day, she found a big box in her room. She opened it and saw lots of shapes inside. There were circles, squares, and triangles.
Lily started to play with the shapes, but then her little brother came in and wanted to play too. Lily said, "No, these are mine!" Her brother got sad and went away.
Later, Lily felt bad for being impolite to her brother. She decided to surprise him by making a shape for him. She made a heart shape and gave it to him. Her brother was happy and they played together nicely. From that day on, Lily learned to share her toys and be a polite sister.
