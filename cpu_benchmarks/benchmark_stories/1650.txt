Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go to the park to play with his friends. One day, while he was playing, he saw a vendor selling balloons. Timmy really wanted a balloon, but he didn't have any money.
Timmy felt sad and started to cry. Suddenly, a kind lady saw him crying and came to hug him. She asked Timmy why he was crying and he told her about the balloon. The lady gave Timmy a big hug and bought him a balloon.
Timmy was so happy that he ran back to his friends to show them his new balloon. But when he got there, he saw that one of his friends had popped his balloon. Timmy felt angry and sad again. But then, his friend came to him and gave him a big hug, saying sorry for popping his balloon.
Timmy felt better and hugged his friend back. He learned that even though bad things can happen, hugs can make everything feel light and better again.
