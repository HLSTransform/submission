Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a little rabbit named Tim. Tim was an adventurous rabbit who loved to run and play all day. One day, Tim found a shiny watch in the grass. He picked it up and put it on his paw.
Tim showed the watch to his friends, but they did not know what it was. They decided to go on an adventure to find out. They ran through the forest, climbed trees, and jumped over rocks. After a long day, they were very tired and needed to rest.
As they rested under a big tree, a mean fox saw the shiny watch. He wanted it for himself. While Tim and his friends were resting, the fox took the watch and ran away. Tim was very sad and learned that not all adventures have good endings.
