One day, there were two little kids that wanted to go on an adventure. So, they slowly pulled their big red luggage and started walking down the road. Suddenly, they noticed a funny number written on a wall. It said '3'.
The kids thought that was funny and decided to find out what was so special about the number. So, they kept counting and counting, until they reached the number 3 again. When they did, a big surprise came out of the luggage! It was a giant clown with balloons!
The kids were so excited. The clown even picked up the big red luggage! He slowly carried it away, laughing the whole time. With the clown gone, all that was left was the special number 3. That will always remind the kids of their wonderful adventure!
