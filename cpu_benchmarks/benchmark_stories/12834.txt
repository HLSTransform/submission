Once upon a time there was a family who lived in a small house. Every morning, the family would all gather around the kitchen table to have breakfast. On this day, the family dad entered with a big plate of toast in his hand. Everyone smiled and cheered when they saw it.
They all sat down at the table and started to eat the warm toast. The youngest family member, a cheerful three year old, smiled because the toast was so delicious. She happily asked for more toast, and her dad happily obliged.
After eating, the family all washed their hands and left the kitchen. While leaving, the three year old turned to dad one last time and said "Thank you for the tasty toast!" Dad smiled and said "You're welcome my little one."
