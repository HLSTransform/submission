Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a rose garden in her backyard. Every day, she would water her roses and watch them grow. One day, a storm came and the wind blew very hard. Lily's roses were in danger of getting blown away.
Her mother warned her that the storm was dangerous and that she should go inside. But Lily didn't want to leave her roses. She remembered that her dad had given her a dependable fence to protect her roses. She quickly put up the fence around her garden to keep her roses safe.
After the storm passed, Lily was happy to see that her roses were still there, safe and sound. Her mother was proud of her for being responsible and taking care of her garden. The moral of the story is that it's important to listen to warnings and be dependable in taking care of the things we love.
