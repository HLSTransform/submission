Once upon a time there was a girl. She was three years old and wanted to do something. Her goal was to perform. She thought it would be tough.
One day she decided it was time to practice. She looked around for something special to do. She found a big box of blocks. She took out some blocks and began to stack them up. She worked very hard and was so proud of herself.
But then the big tower of blocks toppled over! She let out a big sigh and wanted to give up. But she was tough and tried again. She kept trying one more time and finally the tower stayed up!
She had accomplished her goal. She had performed and she was so proud!
