One day at school, the children were in their classroom and the teacher was teaching them something new. She told them that they were going to learn a rare word called yield. All the children looked at each other and were confused.
The teacher tried to explain the meaning of the word yield, but the children just couldn't understand it. One of them finally asked: "What does that mean?"
The teacher smiled and said "Yield means to give up something. You have to make an effort and then you might get something new out of it. It's rare, but it's important to know".
The children still looked confused and one of them said "But why should we do it?".
The teacher replied "So that you can learn something new, and to help others. Yielding is not something that we do everyday, but it's important to know when and how to do it".
The children thought about it and eventually understood what the teacher meant. Now they know how to yield to help others and learn something new.
