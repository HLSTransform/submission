Sally set out a special box on the table. Inside was a razor. Sally was very patient. She moved the razor very slowly and carefully. She drew a line down the middle of her face. Sally was making a funny face and it made her giggle. She put the razor aside, careful not to cut herself. She then wiped off the white foam from her face and looked in the mirror. She had a silly grin and she laughed even more. After a few more tries, Sally was done. She was happy with her new face and twirled around to show everyone. Her mommy and daddy smiled and hugged her. Sally was so proud of her patient work.
