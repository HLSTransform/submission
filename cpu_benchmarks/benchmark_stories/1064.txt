Once upon a time there lived a girl who was very independent. Her name was Mary. Mary liked to explore the world and take risks. One day, Mary decided to take a step into the open.
Mary stepped softly with her little feet and looked around. Everything was so exciting to her! She could feel the freedom of the open and it made her heart race with joy.
Mary took many steps forward, discovering new places and things. She explored the world with her own two feet. When she was tired, she would take a break and rest.
Mary kept stepping and eventually, she experienced a moment of independence. She felt proud and content with all of her accomplishments. From then on, Mary continued to step into the open, learning and growing along the way.
