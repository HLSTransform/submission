One day, a boy named Tim got a new bathrobe. It was soft and blue. He liked it very much. He wore it all the time, even when he read books. 
One day, Tim read a book about a dizzy cat. The cat would spin and spin until it got very dizzy. Tim thought it was funny. He wanted to be like the dizzy cat.
So, Tim put on his blue bathrobe and started to spin. He spun and spun until he got dizzy too. He laughed and fell on his bed. Tim liked being a dizzy cat. He read more books in his blue bathrobe and sometimes pretended to be the dizzy cat.
