Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to water the flowers with the hose. Tom was holding the hose and Lily was telling him where to spray. "Supply water to the red ones, Tom. They are thirsty," Lily said.
Tom nodded and sprayed the red flowers. Then he saw a butterfly on a yellow flower. He wanted to see it closer. He moved the hose to the yellow flower. But he sprayed too hard and the butterfly flew away. The water also hit Lily in the face. She was wet and angry.
"Tom, why did you do that?" Lily shouted. "You scared the butterfly and you made me wet. That was not nice."
Tom felt ashamed. He did not mean to hurt Lily or the butterfly. He dropped the hose and ran to Lily. He hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was curious about the butterfly. I did not want to make you wet or angry. Please forgive me."
Lily looked at Tom. She saw that he was sorry. She hugged him back and said, "It's okay, Tom. I forgive you. But next time, be careful with the hose. And don't scare the butterflies. They are pretty and gentle."
Tom and Lily smiled and went back to watering the flowers. They were friends again.
