Once upon a time, there was a little bunny who loved to eat carrots. He lived in a cozy burrow made of wood. One day, the bunny found a tiny orange seed and decided to plant it in his garden. He watered it every day and watched it grow bigger and bigger.
After a few weeks, the seed turned into a big orange tree. The bunny was so happy and proud of his tree. He loved to sit under it and eat his carrots. But one day, a big storm came and destroyed the bunny's burrow and his beloved orange tree. The bunny was very sad and had to find a new home.
