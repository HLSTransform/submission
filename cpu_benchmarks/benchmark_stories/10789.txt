Once upon a time, there was a playful puppy named Max. Max loved to run and jump and play all day long. One day, Max's family decided to take him to a restaurant. Max was very excited to go to the restaurant and try some new food.
When they arrived at the restaurant, Max was so happy that he started to jump around and wag his tail. But then, Max saw a big bowl of water on the floor. He ran over to it and started to play in the water. He splashed and splashed until he was soaking wet.
Max's family was very embarrassed and they had to take him home early. Max was sad that he couldn't stay and play anymore. When they got home, Max's family gave him a bath and put him to bed. Max was very tired and sad that he couldn't go back to the restaurant.
