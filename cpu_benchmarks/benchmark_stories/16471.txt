Sara and Tom were twins who liked to play together. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big teddy bear. They named him Brownie and gave him hugs and kisses every day.
One day, Sara and Tom had a fight over Brownie. Sara wanted to dress him up in a pink dress, but Tom wanted to make him a superhero with a cape. They pulled and tugged at Brownie, and he ripped in half. Sara and Tom both cried and blamed each other.
Their mom heard the noise and came to see what was wrong. She saw Brownie on the floor and the twins with angry faces. She said, "What happened here? Why did you hurt Brownie? He was your friend."
Sara and Tom told their mom what they did and how they felt. Their mom said, "I'm sorry, but I can't fix Brownie. He is too broken. You have to learn to share and be kind to each other and your toys. They are gifts from God, and you should be thankful for them."
Sara and Tom felt sorry for what they did and for Brownie. They said, "We're sorry, mom. We're sorry, Brownie. We love you." They hugged each other and their mom. Then they said, "Can we pray for Brownie, mom? Maybe God can make him better."
Their mom smiled and said, "That's a sweet idea. God loves you and hears your prayers. He may not always do what you want, but he knows what is best for you. Let's pray together." She held their hands and they closed their eyes. They prayed for Brownie and for each other. They asked God to forgive them and to help them be good twins.
The next day, their mom surprised them with a new teddy bear. He was brown and soft and had a big smile. She said, "This is a gift from God and me. He is Brownie's brother, and his name is Honey. He wants to be your friend and play with you. But you have to promise to take good care of him and share him nicely."
Sara and Tom were very happy and thanked their mom and God. They hugged Honey and said, "Welcome to our family, Honey. We will love you and share you and be kind to you. You are our friend." They played with Honey and each other, and they never fought over him again. They learned to be thankful and gentle and loving.
