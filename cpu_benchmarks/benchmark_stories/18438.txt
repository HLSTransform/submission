Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a bad cough and needed to take medicine to feel better. His mom gave him the medicine and told him to trust that it would make him feel better. Timmy didn't like the taste of the medicine, but he knew his mom wouldn't give him something bad.
One day, Timmy and his mom went to the park. Timmy was playing on the swings when he saw a big dog. The dog looked very alert and Timmy felt a little scared. But his mom told him not to worry because the dog was friendly and wouldn't hurt him. Timmy trusted his mom and wasn't scared anymore.
After playing at the park, Timmy's cough started to get better. He knew it was because he took his medicine like his mom told him to. Timmy was happy and felt much better. He trusted his mom and knew she would always take care of him.
