Alice was walking to the library. She couldn't wait to get a new novel. As she walked, she thought of all the adventures her novel might hold. But a sudden gust of wind blew her novel right out of her hands and it quickly disappeared.
Alice sadly trudged back home, but when she got there, she noticed something on the porch. It was her novel, but it looked a bit broken. She was so relieved -- she had almost forgotten about it.
Alice carefully carried the novel inside and put it thoughtfully on the kitchen table. She talked to her mom.
"Mom, I almost forgot my novel on the way home," she said.
Her mom smiled and said, "Forget no more, my dear, or else you might forget something even more important!"
Alice wasn't sure what her mom meant, but the warning felt important. She vowed never to forget her novel again.
