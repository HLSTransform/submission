Once upon a time, there was a brilliant cook called Daisy. Daisy was a kind and generous person and she enjoyed cooking every day.
One day, Daisy wanted to make something special, so she decided to cook a dove. She collected the ingredients, including some salt and herbs, and started preparing the dish.
Meanwhile, Daisy's best friend, Tim, was outside and he saw her cooking. He came closer and asked what she was doing. Daisy replied, "I am cooking a delicious dove. Would you like to try some?" Tim was eager to taste Daisy's cooking and said, "Yes please!"
When the dove was cooked, Tim took a bite and his eyes lit up. "Wow, this is brilliant!" he exclaimed. Daisy smiled, happy to have cooked something so delicious.
From then on, Daisy cooked doves often. Her friends and family always enjoyed them and requested them whenever they visited. Daisy was very proud of her signature dish and she enjoyed sharing her cooking with everyone.
