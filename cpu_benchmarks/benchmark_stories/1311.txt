Once upon a time there was a happy little girl. Her name was Sarah and she had the biggest smile. She loved to wander in the sunshine and one day, she asked her mom if she could go alone. Her mom said yes and gave her permission.
So Sarah skipped away, singing as she went. She wandered through the sweet smelling field, watching the butterflies flutter in the air. The grass was so soft beneath her feet and the sun was so warm on her face.
Sarah stopped at the edge of the field and saw a friendly rabbit hopping around. She hopped closer, wanting to pet the rabbit, but it was too scared and hopped away. Sarah was sad and started to cry.
Suddenly, something amazing happened! Sarah heard a voice as if from far away. It said, “You can pet the rabbit if you are gentle.” Sarah smiled and quietly moved forward, and with a soft touch and kind words, the rabbit allowed her to pet it.
Sarah and the rabbit were friends after that day. They would meet at the edge of the field, greeting each other with friendly smiles. Sarah was so happy, and her mom was proud that she had listened and been so gentle.
