Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She liked to ride her bike and go outside. One day, she went to the fair. She saw colorful lights and heard happy music.
At the fair, she saw lots of candy. She went to the candy store and bought some. She was so excited to eat the candy and felt so happy.
Then, she went to the fun park at the fair. She saw rides going up and down. She wanted to ride them so much! Finally, she was tall enough to ride a ride. She had a lot of fun and laughed the whole time.
When the fair was over, the little girl went home. She was happy with the candy she had bought and the fun she had on the rides. She knew she would come back to the fair soon.
