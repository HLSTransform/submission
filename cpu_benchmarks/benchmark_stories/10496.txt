Once there was a bunny who was very fancy. He was always wearing a bowtie and introducing himself with a lot of flare. He thought he was the best because he was so fancy. 
One day, the bunny hopped over to a pond to take a drink of water. A fish was swimming in the pond, so the bunny called out, "Hey Fish! I'm fancier than you, so why don't you move and let me drink the water!" The fish said nothing and just kept swimming. 
This made the bunny angry. He hopped over to the fish and yelled again, "Move, fish!" The fish said nothing and kept swimming in circles. Seeing the fish wouldn't move, the bunny got angry and said, "If you don't move, I'll bite your tooth!"
But before the bunny had a chance to bite the tooth, an old wise turtle called out. He said, "Why don't you just be patient and share? Then, everyone will be happy." The bunny was embarrassed and realized that being nice, helpful and sharing is much better than being fancy.
So, the bunny and the fish both had a drink and the bunny moved back to his own side of the pond. From that day forward, the bunny was always kind, helpful and generous. He had learned his lessonâ€”being fancy isn't nearly as important as being kind.
