Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a big palace. Everyday the princess looked out her window and saw the trees, the sun and the birds. She was always so happy. 
One day the princess noticed something else outside her window - a crystal. It was a shiny red crystal in the shape of a heart. The princess had never seen anything like it before. She wanted it so she asked the palace guards to get it for her. 
When they brought the crystal back, the princess was so excited. She hugged it close to her chest. But the next day the crystal had disappeared. The princess searched everywhere but couldn't find it. 
The princess was very sad. She had to learn an important lesson - when something appears too good to be true it is important to think carefully before taking it. By doing so she can make sure she makes the right decisions in life.
