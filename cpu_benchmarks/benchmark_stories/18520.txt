Anna liked to learn new things. She liked to read books and watch shows about people and places from long ago. She liked history. She wanted to share her history books with her friend Ben, who came to play with her today.
She took Ben to her room and showed him her books. She picked one with pictures of kings and queens and castles. She opened it and said, "This is a history book. It tells stories about people who lived before us. They wore funny clothes and had big houses. Do you want to read it with me?"
Ben looked at the book and shook his head. He did not like history. He liked cars and trucks and planes. He liked to play with his toys and make noises. He said, "No, thank you. History is boring. Can we play with your toys instead?"
Anna felt sad. She wanted Ben to like history too. She wanted to introduce him to her favorite stories and characters. She did not understand why he did not want to learn. She said, "But history is fun. You can learn about different things and imagine how they lived. Don't you want to know more about the world?"
Ben looked at Anna and felt confused. He did not know what she meant by imagine and learn. He did not care about the world. He only cared about his toys and games. He said, "No, I don't. I just want to play. Can we please play with your toys?"
Anna sighed. She did not want to fight with Ben. He was her friend and she liked him. But she also liked history and she wanted him to like it too. She had an idea. She said, "Okay, we can play with my toys. But can we pretend that they are from history? Can we make them talk and act like the people in the book?"
Ben thought for a moment. He liked to pretend and make his toys talk and act. He said, "Okay, that sounds fun. But you have to tell me what to do. I don't know anything about history."
Anna smiled. She was happy that Ben agreed to play with her. She hoped that he would learn something from her history book and maybe like it a little bit. She said, "Okay, I will tell you what to do. Let's start with this king and this queen. They are from a place called England. They had a big problem. Do you want to know what it was?"
Ben nodded. He was curious about the problem. He said, "Yes, what was it?"
Anna opened the book and pointed to a picture. She said, "This is the problem. It is a big red dragon. It was very mean and scary. It burned the villages and ate the sheep. The people were very afraid. They needed a hero to save them. Do you want to be the hero?"
Ben's eyes widened. He liked dragons and heroes. He said, "Yes, I want to be the hero. What do I have to do?"
Anna said, "You have to use this sword and this shield. They are very special. They belong to the king. He gave them to you because you are brave and strong. You have to fight the dragon and make it go away. Can you do that?"
Ben said, "Yes, I can do that. I am brave and strong. I will fight the dragon and make it go away. Watch me!"
Anna said, "Okay, I will watch you. I will be the queen. I will cheer for you and thank you. Are you ready?"
Ben said, "Yes, I am ready. Let's go!"
They took the toys and went to the living room. They pretended that the couch was the castle and the rug was the field. They put the dragon on the rug and made it roar. They made the king and the queen watch from the couch. They made the sword and the shield shine. They had fun. They played history.
