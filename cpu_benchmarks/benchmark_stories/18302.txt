Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she woke up early and saw the beautiful sunrise. It made her feel happy and excited to start her day.
As she was playing, she saw a bug on the ground. It was big and disgusting! Lily didn't like bugs, so she moved away from it quickly. She went to play with her toys instead.
Later, Lily's friend came over to play with her. They had so much fun moving around and playing together. They even saw a rainbow in the sky! It was a wonderful day for Lily and she went to bed feeling happy and tired.
