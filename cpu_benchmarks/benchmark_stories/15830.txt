Once upon a time there lived two friends called Anna and Bob. They liked to play together all day long.
One day, Anna said to Bob "Let's play a game. Let's guess what's round and crazy".
Bob liked the game and said, "Yes, let's play!".
Anna thought for a minute and then said, "I think it's the moon!".
Bob thought and then said, "No, I think it's the sun".
Anna laughed and said, "No Bob, it's a bubble!"
Bob was happy and he said, "Oh yeah, a bubble is round and crazy!"
So they laughed and smiled and played with bubbles all day long.
