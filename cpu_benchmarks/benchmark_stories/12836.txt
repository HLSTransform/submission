Dani was so excited as she walked to the park. She was going to receive her first clay creations!
"Where's the park?" Dani asked her mom.
"There it is," said Mom, pointing to the big, green gate.
Dani ran faster until she finally arrived. She looked around and saw a long table filled with lovely clay creations. She was amazed!
"They're so pretty," said Dani.
Mom laughed and said, "Yes, Dani, why don't you pick out the one you like best?"
Dani couldn't believe her eyes. She saw a bright blue clay creation that looked like a bird. She knew it was perfect for her.
"This one!" said Dani, as she carefully took it from the table.
Mom smiled and said, "That's a great choice! Now let me teach you how to take care of it."
As Dani listened and learned, she sensed something else nearby. She peaked around the corner and saw that the park's playground had a brand new lay. It even had slide for her. Dani knew that she was going to have a wonderful time playing with her new clay creations and the playground. She couldn't wait!
