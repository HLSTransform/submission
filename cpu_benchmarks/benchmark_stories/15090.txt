Once there was a little boy named Michael. He was three years old and he lived in a big house with his family. One day, Michael went into the garden to play. He saw an olive tree with lots of olives and he wanted to pick one. But when he reached for an olive, his dad shook his head and said, "No, Michael. You can't pick that olive."
Michael felt really sad. He started to cry and he asked his dad why he couldn't pick the olive. His dad said, "Michael, that olive belongs to the neighbor. You must never take something that doesn't belong to you."
Michael felt even more sad. He thought it was not fair that he couldn't pick the olive. He walked away from the tree, away from the garden, away from his home. He wanted to find a place where he could pick olives and he walked and walked until he was very tired.
Eventually, Michael was lost and he never returned home. He never got to pick the olive and he never got to eat it. He was so sad that he could never go home again.
