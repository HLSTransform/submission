Once upon a time there was a comet flying in the sky. It flew so high, it was almost out of sight. One day it spotted a family down below. The family was not very nice, they were very spoiled and mean.
The comet didn't like what it saw, so it decided to help the family. It shone with a bright light and flew down to the family. The comet supported them by giving them love and kindness.
The family was very surprised. They had never had someone be so kind to them before. The comet was happy to help them, since it wasn't used to being so strong and kind.
The family felt much better after the comet supported them. They started to be nicer to each other and they were no longer spoiled and mean. They were so thankful to the comet and they would never forget it.
The comet was glad that it could help the family. From that day on, it would always look out for families that needed support, no matter how high it flew in the sky.
