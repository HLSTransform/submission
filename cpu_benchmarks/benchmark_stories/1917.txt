Once upon a time, there were two sisters. Their names were Jane and Marie. Jane was three years old and Marie was five years old. 
One day Marie said to Jane, "Let's play a game". Jane was excited and said, "Yes, what will we play?" Marie said, "Let's pretend that we have a pot full of healthy rice". Jane replied, "How do we do that?" Marie said,  "We just have to believe".
Jane and Marie smiled and immediately started to imagine that there was a pot full of healthy rice. They both said, "We believe there is a pot full of healthy rice". 
Suddenly, Jane heard a sound. She looked around the room and saw the pot of healthy rice she and her sister had believed in. Jane and Marie both were amazed and hugged each other, excited for their game. They laughed and enjoyed their pot of healthy rice for days and days!
