Once there was a bird who was very miserable. Every day he looked around for something to make him happy but he couldn't find anything. One day he noticed a big branch on a tree. He thought it looked so comfy and he wanted to sit on it. So the bird flew up to the branch and he had a seat.
He was so happy. He spread out his wings and looked around. The view from the branch was amazing. He could see the whole forest from up there. He even saw a pond where he could take a bath.
The bird was so happy to find the branch. It made him forget how miserable he had been. From now on, the bird decided that he would always remember to look for branches to give him a happy seat.
