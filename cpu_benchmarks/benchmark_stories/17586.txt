Tom and Lily were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to kick the ball to each other and run after it. The sky was blue and the sun was warm.
"Let's go to the slide!" Lily suggested. She liked to slide down fast and feel the wind in her hair.
"OK!" Tom agreed. He followed Lily to the slide and waited for his turn.
But then they heard a loud noise. It was thunder. They looked up and saw dark clouds. The wind started to blow hard and the leaves flew in the air.
"Oh no, a storm is coming!" Tom said. He was scared of storms. They made him feel cold and wet.
"Let's go home!" Lily said. She grabbed Tom's hand and ran to the gate. They saw their mom waiting for them in the car.
"Mom, mom, we're here!" they shouted. They got in the car and buckled their seat belts.
"Good job, kids. You came back just in time. The storm is very big and strong. We have to drive carefully." Mom said. She was busy looking at the road and the traffic.
"Can we listen to some music, mom?" Tom asked. He wanted to forget about the storm.
"Sure, honey. What do you want to hear?" Mom asked.
"Something happy and fun!" Lily said.
Mom smiled and turned on the radio. They heard a song they liked and started to sing along. They felt better and happier. The storm was still outside, but they were safe and cozy inside.
