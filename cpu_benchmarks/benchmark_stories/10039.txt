Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big slide. Sara wants to go first. She climbs up the ladder and sits on the slide. She is happy.
"Look at me, Tom!" she says. "I am going to slide down fast!"
But Sara slides too fast. She does not hold on to the slide. She falls off the slide and lands on the grass. She hurts her knee. It bleeds. She cries.
"Ow, ow, ow!" she says. "My knee hurts!"
Tom runs to Sara. He is worried. He sees her knee. He wants to help her.
"Don't cry, Sara," he says. "I have something for you."
He takes out a grape from his pocket. He gives it to Sara.
"Here, Sara," he says. "Eat this grape. It is sweet and juicy. It will make you feel better."
Sara takes the grape. She bites it. It is sweet and juicy. She likes it. She stops crying.
"Thank you, Tom," she says. "The grape is good. But my knee still hurts."
Tom thinks. He remembers what his mom told him. He has an idea.
"I know what to do, Sara," he says. "We need to heal your knee. We need to put something on it. Something flexible and soft. Something like this."
He takes out a band-aid from his pocket. He opens it. He sticks it on Sara's knee.
"There, Sara," he says. "Now your knee has a band-aid. It will protect your knee. It will help your knee heal. It is flexible and soft. You can bend your knee. See?"
Sara bends her knee. She feels the band-aid. It is flexible and soft. It does not hurt. She smiles.
"Wow, Tom," she says. "You are smart. The band-aid is good. It makes my knee feel better. Thank you, Tom. You are a good friend."
Tom smiles too. He is happy. He hugs Sara.
"You are welcome, Sara," he says. "You are a good friend too. Come on, let's play some more. But be careful on the slide, okay?"
Sara nods. She holds Tom's hand. They go to play some more. They are happy. They are friends.
