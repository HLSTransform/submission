Once upon a time, there was a cute little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to bake cakes and cookies with his mom. One day, Benny's mom asked him to whip some cream for the cake they were making. But Benny didn't know how to whip cream and felt sad.
Benny's mom saw that he was sad and decided to teach him how to whip cream. They worked together and soon the cream was whipped perfectly. But then, Benny accidentally dropped the cake on the floor and it broke into pieces. Benny started to cry because he thought he ruined everything.
But his mom hugged him and said it was okay. They decided to make cupcakes instead and they turned out even better than the cake would have. Benny learned that it's okay to make mistakes and that sometimes things turn out even better than planned. From that day on, Benny and his mom baked and whipped together every week.
