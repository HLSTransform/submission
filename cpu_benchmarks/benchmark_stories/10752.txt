One day, a little boy named Tim found a tooth on the floor. He was very excited. He called his mom to show her the tooth. "Look, Mom! I found a tooth!" Tim said. His mom smiled and said, "That's great, Tim!"
The next day, Tim was very tired. He had a long day playing with his friends. He went to bed early. While he was in bed, he remembered the tooth. He put the tooth under his pillow and closed his eyes.
In the morning, Tim woke up and looked under his pillow. The tooth was gone! Instead, there was a shiny coin. Tim called his mom and showed her the coin. "The tooth fairy came!" Tim said. His mom hugged him and said, "Yes, she did! Now you can buy a treat with your coin." Tim was very happy.
