Henry was a furry bear. He was a very happy bear and he had a plan. He was going to have a shower. He thought it would be fun. First he needed to find a big tub. He went to the forest to see what he could find. He looked around and saw a big bucket. He thought it would be perfect for the shower. Then he started to fill it with water. It took him a while, but he filled it with water from the river nearby. After he was done he hopped inside the bucket and enjoyed his shower. The cool water made him feel so nice and refreshed. Then he got out and gave himself a big hug. He was so happy that he had finished his special plan.
