Once upon a time there was a man who was very selfish. He never wanted to share with the other people around him. Every day he was so busy and he never took the time to relax.
One day, when he was walking, he saw a beautiful patch of grass. It was so inviting. He decided to sit down and relax. He felt the ground beneath him and he felt so much better.
After a while, he noticed that someone else was also enjoying the ground. He wanted to keep it all to himself. But then, he stopped and remembered how nice it had felt to relax and the grass was too nice to be selfish. So he shared it with the other person and they both enjoyed it together.
