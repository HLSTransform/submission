Once upon a time, there was a lovely scale. It was so shiny and had sparkles all around it. Every day, the scale would reveal something new. One day, it revealed a secret! It said it needed a special friend.
So, a three-year-old girl came along. She had been looking for a special friend too. She saw the lovely scale and knew it was perfect. She touched the scale and it glimmered with delight.
The scale and the girl became the best of friends. They would go on all sorts of adventures together. The scale would help reveal the most wonderful secrets they could find and the girl would tell it all her secrets too.
The scale and the girl have been friends ever since. Every day, they remind each other how much they are loved.
