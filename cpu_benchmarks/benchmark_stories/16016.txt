Once upon a time, there was a three-year-old boy named Tim. Tim was a very lucky boy, so everyone was always very kind to him.
One day, Tim saw an exam on his kitchen table. He was very curious and asked his mom, "What is this?"
Mom smiled and said, "It's an exam, Tim. It's something special that you get to do. You get to show how smart you are!"
Tim was very excited, so he quickly tried it. But it was hard. He got many wrong answers and began to feel upset.
Suddenly, a lucky rabbit appeared in the room. It said, "Don't worry, Tim. You can do it!"
Tim felt hopeful and tried again. This time, he managed to finish the exam. He was so happy and proud of himself.
The rabbit smiled and said, "See, Tim? You are very lucky!" 
And from then on, Tim always remembered to keep trying his best.
