Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside with his bubble wand. He would blow big bubbles and try to catch them. One sunny day, Tim went outside to play with his bubbles.
As Tim blew the bubbles, they floated high up in the sky. Tim tried to catch them, but they were too high. He jumped and reached, but he couldn't catch the bubbles. Tim felt a little scared because the bubbles were going so high.
Then, Tim's big sister, Sue, came outside. She saw Tim was scared and helped him catch the bubbles. She lifted Tim up high, and together they caught the bubbles. Tim was happy, and he wasn't scared anymore. They played with the bubbles all day and had lots of fun.
