Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl named Sally. She was very excited because she was going to take an adventure in space. Everyone was so happy for Sally, but also a little bit nervous.
On the day of her space adventure, Sally put on her space suit and stepped into the rocket. She was so excited and ready to get it started. "Countdown from ten!" shouted Sally. So the rocket started counting and at the same time everyone waved goodbye.
When Sally got higher and higher into space, she saw so many amazing things. She saw stars, moons, galaxies and much more! She was having so much fun that she wanted to share it with her friends.
So Sally sent a message back home. She told them all about her exciting adventure and sent lots of pictures too. Everyone back home was so happy to hear all about her trip.
At the end of the adventure, Sally zoomed back down to Earth again. Everyone was so happy to see her safe and sound. They were so proud of how brave and adventurous Sally was. It was a space trip that none of them would ever forget!
