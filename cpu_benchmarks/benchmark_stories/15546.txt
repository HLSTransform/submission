Tom and Lily like to play ball in the yard. They have a big red ball that bounces high and makes a loud sound. They take turns to pass the ball to each other and catch it.
One day, they see a new car in the garage. It is shiny and blue and has four doors. They want to look at it, but they know they are not allowed to go in the garage. The garage is for grown-ups only.
"Who's car is that?" Lily asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it's Mom's or Dad's," Tom says.
"Can we touch it?" Lily says.
"No, we can't. It might be dirty or break," Tom says.
But Lily is curious. She sneaks into the garage when Tom is not looking. She reaches out her hand to touch the car. But she is not gentle. She scratches the car with her nails. The car makes a beep beep sound. Lily is scared. She runs out of the garage.
Tom hears the beep beep sound. He sees Lily running out of the garage. He sees the scratch on the car. He is angry.
"Lily, what did you do?" he shouts.
"I'm sorry, Tom. I just wanted to see the car," Lily says.
"You are bad, Lily. You should not go in the garage. You should not scratch the car. Mom and Dad will be mad at you," Tom says.
Lily starts to cry. She feels sorry. She hugs Tom and says, "I'm sorry, Tom. I love you. Please don't be mad at me."
Tom feels sorry too. He hugs Lily and says, "I love you too, Lily. But you have to be careful. You have to be gentle. You have to listen to Mom and Dad. OK?"
"OK, Tom. I will," Lily says.
They go back to the yard. They play ball again. They pass the ball to each other and catch it. They are happy.
