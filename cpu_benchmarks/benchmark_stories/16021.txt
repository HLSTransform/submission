Once upon a time, there was a bald man named Bob who loved to sell things. He sold all sorts of toys, games, and books.
One day, Bob decided to sell some of his books at the park. He grabbed a bunch of them and headed to the park.
At the park, Bob saw a little boy playing. He didn't have any money, so Bob smiled and offered him a book for free.
The little boy was really excited and said, "Thank you! This book is so much fun!"
Bob smiled and said, "You're welcome, my friend! I just love to sell things and make people happy."
The little boy was so excited he ran off with the book and a big smile on his face. Bob was happy too. Even though he didn't get paid, he knew he made the little boy happy. That made it all worth it in the end.
