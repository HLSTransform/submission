Tom and Sam like to play football. They have a big ball and a small goal. They kick the ball to each other and try to score. They have fun and laugh.
One day, a big dog comes to the park. The dog sees the ball and runs after it. Tom and Sam are scared. They do not want the dog to take their ball. They run away from the dog and hide behind a tree.
The dog gets the ball and plays with it. He bites it and shakes it. He makes a loud noise. Tom and Sam are sad. They want their ball back.
They see a man coming. He is the dog's owner. He calls the dog and puts a leash on him. He sees Tom and Sam and says sorry. He gives them their ball back. He says the dog likes to play football too. He says the dog is friendly and does not want to hurt them.
Tom and Sam are happy. They have their ball back. They are not scared anymore. They say thank you to the man and the dog. They ask if they can play football with them. The man says yes. They all play football together. They have fun and laugh.
