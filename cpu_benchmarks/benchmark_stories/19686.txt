There was an old house with a park outside. One day, a little boy wanted to go and explore the park. He ran out of the house and walked to the park.
When he arrived, he saw lots of animals and a big swing. He played for hours, swinging and running around.
After he played a while, he felt tired and decided to rest. He lay down on the floor and felt the sun warming his body. He closed his eyes and slowly fell asleep.
He woke up a few hours later feeling refreshed. He said goodbye to the park and walked back to the old house. He felt happy and he knew he would visit the park again soon.
