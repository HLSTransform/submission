Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to watch the birds fly in the sky. One day, Lily fell down and hurt her arm. Her mommy took her to the hospital to make her arm feel better. The hospital was big and had lots of people. Lily was scared, but her mommy held her hand. 
While they waited, Lily saw a toy she really wanted. It was so pretty and shiny, but also very expensive. She asked her mommy if she could have it, but her mommy said no because it cost too much money. Lily was sad, but then she remembered the birds she loved to watch. She closed her eyes and imagined the birds flying in the sky, and soon she felt much better.
