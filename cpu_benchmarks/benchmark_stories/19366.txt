One day, Alex had some stupid luggage to wash. He took it outside and filled a tub with water. He used some soap to get it clean. Alex scrubbed and scrubbed until the luggage was nice and shiny. He was so proud of his work.
Next, he put the clean luggage in the sun to dry. He sat and watched it, but it was taking a long time. He played in the garden until it was done.
Finally, the luggage was dry. Alex put it away, feeling accomplished. He was so happy he had washed it all!
