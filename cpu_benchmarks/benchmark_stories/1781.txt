Once upon a time, there was a big dinosaur who wanted to find a friend. He looked around everywhere but couldn't find anyone. He was beginning to feel sad and embarrassed so he decided to ask a wise old tree for help.
The tree thought for a while and then said, “I recommend that you look in the jungle. You’ll find lots of other animals there and you might be able to find a new friend.” 
The dinosaur thanked the tree and went off to the jungle. Sure enough, he soon found other animals like monkeys and tigers and birds. The dinosaur began to play with them and had lots of fun. He even found a new friend who he liked to play tag with.
The dinosaur was very happy to have found a friend in the jungle. He thanked the wise old tree for recommending it and went off to have more adventures with his new friend.
