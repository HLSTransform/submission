Once upon a time, there were two friends, Tom and Bella. Tom didn't have a bathroom. Bella promised him she would find him one.
So, Tom and Bella went on a big journey. They traveled down long roads and climbed big hills. Finally, they saw it - a huge bathroom!
Tom and Bella were so excited. Tom was amazed at how big the bathroom was. He had never seen anything like it before.
Tom thanked Bella for finding him a bathroom. She promised him she would always be there for him. They hugged and sang a song of happiness.
And from that day onwards, Tom was able to use his own bathroom whenever he wanted. The end.
