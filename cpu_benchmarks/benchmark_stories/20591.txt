Once upon a time, there was a dish. It was lively and colorful, with yellow, green and red. One day, a little bug wanted to make the dish its home. Carefully, it settled onto the curved surface of the dish.
The little bug watched as the dish was lifted and placed onto the big, wooden table. As it surveyed the room, it was filled with lots of fun things to do - like a big pile of colorful blocks and a soft, furry toy.
The little bug felt content and enjoyed watching the lively family. The children ran around the room and the mom and dad laughed and talked.
The little bug was happy to have found a nice place to settle. He stayed there for a long time and would keep watch over the family every day, happily living in its dish.
