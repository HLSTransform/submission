Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to slide, swing and run. They had a lot of fun. But then they saw a big dog. The dog was barking and running towards them. Lily and Ben were scared.
"Help! Help!" they yelled. "Go away, dog!"
A man came and grabbed the dog. He said, "Sorry, kids. He is not mean. He just wants to play. His name is Spot."
Lily and Ben looked at the dog. He was wagging his tail and licking the man's face. He did not look mean. He looked friendly.
"Can we pet him?" Lily asked.
"Sure, if you want to. He likes kids. But be gentle and calm," the man said.
Lily and Ben went closer to the dog. They touched his fur and ears. He licked their hands and nuzzled their cheeks. He was soft and warm.
"Hi, Spot. You are a nice dog," Ben said.
"Thank you for letting us pet him," Lily said.
"You're welcome. You are very brave, kids. It's good to face your fears and make new friends," the man said.
Lily and Ben smiled. They learned that not everything that looks scary is bad. They made a new friend. They had more fun.
