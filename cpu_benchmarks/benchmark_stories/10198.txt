One day, a little leopard named Leo went to play outside. He saw a big rock and thought it would be perfect to polish his spots. He rubbed his spots on the rock, and they began to shine.
"Wow, your spots look perfect!" said his friend, a little bird named Bella. Bella wanted to help Leo polish his spots too. So, they took turns rubbing Leo's spots on the rock until they were all shiny.
After they finished, Leo thanked Bella for her help. "Thank you, Bella. My spots look perfect now!" Leo and Bella played together all day, happy with their shiny, perfect spots.
