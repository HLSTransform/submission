Once upon a time, there was a small boy called Will. He was just 3 years old and very curious about the world. Every day he asked lots of questions about what he saw and talked to everyone he met.
One day, Will was playing outside when he saw a lovely tree in the distance. He decided to go over and talk to it, so he carefully walked up to it. 
But when he got there, the tree didn't answer him like Will was expecting. He thought he'd been silly for thinking it could talk.
Will was very sad and disappointed, but he didn't give up. He told the tree that, if it was too shy to answer, it could always talk to the birds and the bees, instead. Then he decided to go home. 
The next day, when Will returned, he saw that the tree was fully in blossom! Will couldn't believe it! The tree had clearly taken his advice and was talking to the birds and the bees. 
Will was so happy that his idea had worked, and he realized that words can be great, if we use them with care and kindness!
