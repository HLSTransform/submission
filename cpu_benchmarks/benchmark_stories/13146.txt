Once there was a kind girl who wanted to help out. She wanted to help her Mom so she decided to do the dishes. She got a bowl and filled it with soapy water. Then, she put the dishes in the sink. 
But when she tried to clean them, she noticed something was wrong. The dishes were spoiled. She looked in the sink and saw slimy green stuff all over them! 
The girl wanted to help her Mom clean the dishes, so she decided to keep trying. She scrubbed extra hard, and eventually all the slimy green stuff was gone. The dishes were now nice and clean! 
The girl was so proud that she had helped her Mom. She had cleaned the sink and it looked sparkling. She was so happy when her Mom gave her a big hug and thanked her for her help.
