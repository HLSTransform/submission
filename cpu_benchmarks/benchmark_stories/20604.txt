Once upon a time, there was a family that lived in a tidy house. One day, the family decided to go on an adventure and invited a friend to come with them. They got on a big ship and sailed away to a faraway land. 
As the ship sailed, the family's friend looked around, exploring all the new sights and sounds. Suddenly, they saw a giant whale! It was the biggest whale they had ever seen. The friend was so excited that they invited the whale to join them on the ship. 
The family and their friend took turns feeding the whale for the rest of the voyage, until they finally reached the faraway land. The family and their friend said goodbye to the whale and thanked it for joining them. 
Since then, the family has taken many more adventures on the ship. Each time they voyage, they bring tidiness, excitement and plenty of snacks to ensure another satisfying voyage.
