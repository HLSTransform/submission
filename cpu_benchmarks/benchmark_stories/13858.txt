Once upon a time, in a big jungle, there lived a rare bird. The bird had many colors and was very pretty. One day, a little girl named Mia went into the jungle to play. She saw the rare bird and wanted to be friends.
"Hi, pretty bird! Can I taste your food?" asked Mia. The bird nodded and shared its food with her. They ate fruits and seeds together. Mia and the bird became good friends and played in the jungle all day.
But one day, a big storm came to the jungle. The wind blew hard, and the rain was heavy. Mia and the bird tried to find a safe place to hide. They looked and looked, but the storm was too strong. In the end, Mia and the bird got lost in the jungle, and they could not find their way back home.
