Once upon a time, there was a town. It was a special town, and everyone was happy.
One day, something strange happened: the sun suddenly vanished! All the people got very scared, because it got so cold outside.
Sophia, a little girl who was three years old, was very scared. She asked her mummy, "Why is it so cold outside, mummy?"
Mummy smiled and said, "I'm not quite sure, Sophia. Let's all find out together!"
So, Sophia and her mum started walking around the town, asking all the other people if they knew what had happened to the sun. No one had any answers.
Then suddenly, a wizard appeared! He told Sophia and all the other people in the town that the sun had been stolen by a dragon. Everyone gasped. The wizard said the only way to get the sun back was to go on an adventure and defeat the dragon.
Little Sophia bravely volunteered to go on the adventure. All the people in the town cheered her on, and she went off to save the sun.
In the end, Sophia managed to defeat the dragon and the sun returned to the town. Everyone celebrated, and it was warm again.
Sophia smiled and said, "No one else was brave enough to do it, so I had to!" She had saved the town, and everyone was very proud of her.
