Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Max. Max loved to run and play in his big yard. He was very graceful when he ran, and he loved to chase after his ball.
One day, Max saw a little bird in his yard. He wanted to play with the bird, but he didn't know that birds can't play with dogs. Max chased after the bird and scared it away.
Max's owner saw what happened and told Max that he had to be punished. Max didn't like being punished, but he knew he had done something wrong. From then on, Max learned to be more careful when playing in his yard and to respect the little creatures that lived there too.
