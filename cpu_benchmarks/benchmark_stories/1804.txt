Once upon a time there was a girl who loved to look at nature. She would go to the park every day and wonder at the plants. She saw so many kinds of plants in all sorts of colors. Her favorite was a pink one.
The girl wanted to have a pink plant of her own. She asked her mom to help her get one for her bedroom. Her mom was so happy that she went right away to look for one.
Soon, the girl had a pink plant in her bedroom. She watered it every day and it grew bigger and bigger. The girl was so excited to watch it grow.
She kept wondering if her pink plant would ever bloom. Soon, one day it began to produce some beautiful pink flowers. The girl was so happy!
She was so excited to show off her pink plant to all her friends. The girl was so proud of her pink plant. Every day she would take care of it and it kept blooming more and more.
