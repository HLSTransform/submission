Once upon a time, there lived an underground monster who liked to roar. Each day, he would roar as loud as he could. Everyone in the underground was scared of his loud roars. 
One day, a little rabbit who lived nearby had a good idea. She decided to visit the monster and talk to him. 
She was very brave. She jumped down into the underground and said "Hello! I hear you like to roar, but you're scaring everyone". 
The monster was surprised. He said, "I didn't know that my roars were scaring anyone. I like to roar because it makes me feel good". 
The little rabbit said, "That's ok, you don't have to stop roaring, but maybe you can roar a bit quieter so everyone is happy." 
So the monster tried it! He took a deep breath and let out a soft, gentle roar. Everyone was so pleased! 
From then on, he roars every day, but now it's not too loud and everyone is happy. 
The end!
