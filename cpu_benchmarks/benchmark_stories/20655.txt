Mummy and Daddy were very worried. No one took care of them or their baby. Money was scarce and they didn't have a job. So, Mummy and Daddy started to think of a plan to take care of their family.
Mummy and Daddy looked for clues for how to make their lives better. They had heard that a very important job was available in town. Even though they knew it might be hard, they decided to go weigh the job and see if they could do it.
Mummy and Daddy were very fearful, but they had to try. They checked the job carefully and got all the information they needed. Sure enough, Mummy and Daddy were able to do the job!
They gratefully accepted and soon enough, Mummy and Daddy had enough money to take care of their family. They hugged each other, glad and happy that their plan worked.
The family was much happier and their money troubles were all gone. They thanked their luck, and Daddy always reminds them about the importance of trying.
