Once upon a time, there was a fisherman named Jack. Jack loved to catch fish in the big blue sea. One day, Jack went out to sea and caught a big, slimy fish. The fish was disgusting to look at and smelled very bad.
Jack knew he had to be careful because the fish had sharp teeth. He put the fish in a bucket and took it home to show his family. When he got home, he put the fish in a big bowl of water.
Later that night, Jack's cat came into the room and saw the fish in the bowl. The cat tried to catch the fish, but the fish was too quick. Suddenly, the fish jumped out of the bowl and landed on the cat's tail. The cat was scared and ran away, but the fish was happy to be free. From that day on, Jack always made sure to keep his fish in a safe place.
