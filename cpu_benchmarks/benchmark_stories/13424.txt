Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play with her toy boat. She would put the boat in a big bowl of water and watch it float around. One day, Lily's friend Timmy came over to play. Timmy saw the boat and demanded that Lily give it to him. 
Lily didn't want to give her boat away because she loved it so much. She told Timmy that it was hers and that he couldn't have it. Timmy got angry and started to cry. Lily didn't know what to do, but she remembered her mom telling her to always be kind and graceful. 
So, Lily decided to share her boat with Timmy. She showed him how to play with it and they had fun together. In the end, Timmy was happy and Lily felt good for being kind. The moral of the story is that sharing is important and being graceful can solve conflicts.
