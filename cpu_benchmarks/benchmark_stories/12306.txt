Once upon a time, there was a family with a mom, a dad, and three little kids. One day, the family went out for a walk in the park. 
As they were walking, the mom saw a pretty gold necklace lying on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to the dad.
"It looks like real gold!" the dad said. "We should support this family who has lost their necklace," the mom replied. 
The dad felt silly when he realized how stupid it was to keep the gold. Instead, he suggested that they put up a sign in the park asking the necklace's owner to come get it.
The family agreed and put up the sign. They waited and crossed their fingers, hoping someone would come.
Soon enough, a little girl and her grandma showed up. They were so happy to find their necklace and thanked the family for their support. 
The family was happy that they could help the little girl, and they all went home feeling good.
