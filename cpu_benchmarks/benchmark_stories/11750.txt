Once upon a time there was a big wide river full of fishes. Everyday, a little girl went to the river with her dad. She was so anxious to go fishing, it made her dad smile. 
One day, the river started to move quickly. The girl was worried, but her dad wasn't worried. He said the river was just trying to tell them something. So, they started moving away from the river. 
The little girl was anxious. She didn't understand what was happening. But the river's fast movement meant there was an even bigger river coming and it was coming quickly. 
Suddenly, her dad saw the huge wall of water coming from far away. He quickly grabbed the girl and held onto a tree. As the wave moved closer, the girl held her dad's hand tightly. Together, they managed to stay safe. 
The wave passed and the river returned to normal. The little girl was happy and relieved, but still anxious about the river. She learned that she needed to be careful near rivers. 
The end.
