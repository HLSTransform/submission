Max and Mimi were very happy. They were going on a special part today. Max was holding a big orange balloon and Mimi was holding a basket of treats. 
Max and Mimi went to the mailbox. Max put his arm in the box and pulled out two letters. They were special letters. Mimi was so excited and smiled. 
Max and Mimi opened their letters. It was a party invitation. They had been invited to an orange party! 
Max and Mimi were so happy. They jumped up and hugged each other. They ran off to get ready for the party. 
Max and Mimi had so much fun at the orange party. They played games, ate treats and partied all day long.
