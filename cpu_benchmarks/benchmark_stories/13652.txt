Lila and Ben were friends who liked to play in the garden. They liked to dig, water, and watch the plants grow. One day, they saw a big red tomato on a vine. They both wanted to pick it and eat it.
"I saw it first!" said Lila.
"No, I did!" said Ben.
They pulled on the tomato, but it did not come off. They pulled harder and harder, but it only made the vine shake. They were confused. Why was the tomato so stuck?
Then they heard a voice from behind the fence. It was Mr. Lee, their neighbor. He was smiling and holding a pair of scissors.
"Hello, Lila and Ben," he said. "Do you like my tomato?"
They stopped pulling and looked at him. They did not know it was his tomato. They felt sorry.
"Sorry, Mr. Lee," they said. "We did not know it was yours. We thought it was ours."
Mr. Lee laughed. "It's okay, kids. I have plenty of tomatoes. You can have this one, if you want. But you have to unite and share it. Can you do that?"
Lila and Ben nodded. They did not want to fight anymore. They wanted to be friends. They thanked Mr. Lee and took the tomato. They used the scissors to cut it in half. They each took a bite and smiled. It was juicy and sweet.
They learned that it was better to unite and share than to fight and be confused. They also learned to ask before taking something that was not theirs. They hugged and went back to play in the garden. They were happy.
