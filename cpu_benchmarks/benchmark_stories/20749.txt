Once upon a time, there were two best friends. One was a cat and one was a dog. Together, they liked to play in the backyard. 
The cat's fur was soft and the dog's tail was waggy; they were both very happy. But one day, they started to discuss who had the better nose.
The cat said her nose was better because it was small and pink and could smell lots of fun things like butterflies and falling leaves. But the dog thought his nose was better because it was big, black and could smell really far away.
They both started to get fierce! They ran around and around, trying to prove to each other who was right. 
But then, they stopped to take a deep breath. They looked at each other and laughed; they were still best friends, no matter which one had the better nose!
