Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, her mommy put on an apron and said, "Let's bake some cookies!" Lily was excited because she loved cookies.
They got all the ingredients out and mixed them together. Lily helped her mommy stir the batter. Then, they put the cookies in the oven to bake.
While they waited for the cookies to bake, Lily's mommy said, "Be careful, sometimes people make fake cookies that look real but taste yucky." Lily didn't want to eat yucky cookies.
Finally, the cookies were done and they took them out of the oven. Lily's mommy gave her a cookie to try. It was delicious! Lily was happy they didn't make any fake cookies. From that day on, Lily loved baking with her mommy.
