Mummy and Johnnie were going on an adventure. They had packed their bags and were ready to go. They looked around their cabin and they saw something glowing. It was a magical cabinet!
"What is that mummy?" asked Johnnie.
Mummy bent down and told Johnnie how popular the magical cabinet was. She said the cabinet was full of games and that it would be lots of fun.
Johnnie's face lit up with excitement. The two of them raced over to the cabinet and opened it up. Inside was a glowing treasure, with lots of games.
Mummy and Johnnie spent hours playing the games. They laughed, smiled and had so much fun. When it was time to go, Johnnie couldn't believe how much time had flown by!
