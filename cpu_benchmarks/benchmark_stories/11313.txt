Max was very excited, he was finally going to get to bathe without his sister. Today was very important to him. He quickly put on his swimming clothes and went outside to play with his friends. 
They had been playing for hours when Max noticed it was getting late. He said goodbye to his friends and raced home. 
When he got home, he saw his sister was in the bathroom. She was taking her time getting ready for her special pizza party. Max was so upset! He wanted to bathe and join his sister at the party. 
Max knocked on the door and asked politely if he could get in. His sister told him that it was "her turn" to bathe and that she was very important. She said he would need to find another time to take a bath. 
Max was disappointed, but he understood that his sister was very important. He decided to wait until she was finished so he could bathe and join her at the pizza party.
