One day, a little boy named Timmy was in his backyard. He looked up and observed the sky. It was a beautiful, deep blue color. He wanted to touch it, so he jumped up and down, hoping he could reach it. Suddenly, he heard a sweet sound coming from a tree nearby. He stopped jumping and moved closer to the tree to observe. Sitting on the branch was a tiny bird! It was flapping its wings and singing a sweet little song. Timmy watched in awe and started singing along with the bird. The bird flew away and Timmy waved goodbye. It was a wonderful day, full of sweet moments and beautiful blues.
