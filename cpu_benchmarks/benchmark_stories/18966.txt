Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a bike with red pedals. He loved to ride his bike. One day, Tim saw a big hill. He wanted to ride his bike up the hill. But it was difficult. Tim tried and tried, but he could not go up the hill.
Tim's friend, Sam, saw Tim trying to go up the hill. Sam said, "Tim, why don't we shout for help?" Tim liked the idea. They both shouted, "Help! Help!" Soon, their friend Max came running.
Max said, "I can help you, Tim!" Max pushed Tim's bike up the hill. With Max's help, Tim made it to the top of the hill. Tim was so happy! He thanked Max and Sam.
The moral of the story is that friends can help when things are difficult. It is good to ask for help when you need it.
