Once upon a time there was a little Vegetable. He was very playful, always running and jumping around. One day, Vegetable saw a big pond near his house. He loved playing in the water so much that he jumped right in!
But there was a big surprise waiting for Vegetable: the pond was full of ice! He was so shocked that he could not move and he began to freeze! He was stuck in the ice, and felt very sad.
After some time, a friendly animal came to the pond and saw Vegetable. He was so kind and caring that he helped Vegetable out of the ice and kept him warm.
Vegetable learned the important lesson that day. He promised himself never to jump into frozen ponds again, so he wouldnâ€™t get stuck in the cold ever again. The moral of the story is that it is important to be careful and always listen to advice.
