Lila and Ben were playing in the sandbox. They liked to make castles and roads with the sand and their toys. But then a big dog came and jumped into the sandbox. The dog was filthy. He had mud and dirt all over his fur. He shook his body and made the sand fly everywhere.
"Hey, go away!" Lila shouted at the dog. "You are ruining our game!"
The dog did not listen. He barked and wagged his tail. He thought the sandbox was fun. He dug holes and knocked down the castles and roads. He grabbed some of the toys in his mouth and ran away.
Ben was very angry. He frowns and stomps his feet. He liked his toys. He wanted them back.
"Bad dog! Bad dog!" Ben yelled. "Give me back my toys!"
Lila and Ben chased the dog. They ran out of the sandbox and into the grass. The dog was faster than them. He ran and ran until he reached a fence. He dropped the toys and jumped over the fence.
Lila and Ben stopped. They could not go over the fence. They looked at their toys. They were filthy too. They had mud and dirt and dog spit on them.
Lila and Ben were sad. They did not want to play with their filthy toys. They did not want to play in the filthy sandbox. They wanted to go home and take a bath.
They walked back to the sandbox. They picked up their filthy toys. They carried them to their mom.
"Mom, look what the dog did!" Lila said.
"Mom, can we have a bath?" Ben asked.
Mom looked at them. She saw their filthy clothes and faces and hands. She saw their filthy toys and the filthy sandbox. She shook her head and sighed.
"Of course you can have a bath," she said. "But first, let me take a picture of you. You look like you had a very adventurous day."
