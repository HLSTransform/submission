Once upon a time, there was a large bear named Bobo. Bobo loved to wear a big red tube around his neck. He thought it made him look very cool.
One day, Bobo went for a walk in the forest. He saw a little bird who was stuck in a tree. The bird asked Bobo for help. Bobo used his large red tube to help the bird. He put the tube around the tree and pulled it down. The bird was free!
The little bird was so happy that Bobo helped. They became best friends. Bobo and the bird would play together every day. And Bobo always wore his big red tube, because it reminded him of the day he met his best friend.
