Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pet rabbit named Benny. Every day, Lily would feed carrots to Benny. Benny loved to eat carrots and he would hop around happily after he ate them.
One day, Lily wanted to take Benny outside to play. She turned the doorknob and opened the door. But when they went outside, Benny got scared. He saw a big dog and he didn't like dogs. Lily picked up Benny and brought him back inside where he felt safe.
Lily decided to play with Benny inside instead. She turned on some music and they danced together. Benny was happy and he didn't feel scared anymore. After they finished dancing, Lily fed Benny some more carrots and they cuddled together. Benny felt loved and he knew that he didn't have to be scared when he was with Lily.
