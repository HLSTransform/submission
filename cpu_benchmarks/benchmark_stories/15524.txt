Mandy was a happy three year old. She had a brother who she loved very much. They liked to play together near the pool in their garden.
Mandy couldn't swim but she watched her big brother as he dived in and swam around. He was so successful at swimming. He would make it look easy, gliding through the water like a fish.
Mandy wanted to be like her brother, so she asked him to teach her how to swim. He was very excited to help and started teaching her basic movements.
Mandy practiced and practiced, but it was tricky and she kept getting in splashes. But eventually, with brother's help, she learned how to swim properly! 
Mandy was so proud and happy that she had learned to swim just like her big brother. They both splashed around in the pool and cheered for each other. It was a successful day for Mandy and her brother!
