Once upon a time, there lived a boy called Sam. He was always very quiet and liked making gentle sounds. One day, Sam's mommy told him, "It's time to go outside and play with your friends, Sam!" Sam was tired, so he replied, "No mommy, I wanna stay home." 
Mommy was frustrated. She came over to Sam's room, knelt down beside him and said, "Go out now, Sam. It's important for you to spend time outside with your friends." Sam didn't want to listen and just stayed in bed.
But mommy kept on encouraging him. She said, "If you go outside, you'll make great sounds with your friends. Come on now, you won't regret it!" Sam thought about it and got out of bed. 
At first, Sam was tired and a bit grumpy, but after playing outside a while, he started to make all kinds of happy sounds with his friends. He could hardly believe all the fun things they did! 
At last, it was time to go inside. Sam was so joyful and thanked his mommy for encouraging him go out. This story teaches us that it's important to take the time out of our day to enjoy nature, spend time with friends and make happy sounds.
