Tom and Mia were friends who liked to play with chalk. They drew pictures on the sidewalk with different colors. Tom drew a car, Mia drew a flower, and they both drew a sun.
"Look at my car!" Tom said. "It has four wheels and a horn. Beep beep!"
"Look at my flower!" Mia said. "It has five petals and a stem. It smells nice!"
They looked at each other's pictures and smiled. They were proud of their work.
Then they looked at the sun. It was big and yellow, but it had some cracks and smudges.
"Uh oh," Tom said. "The sun does not look good. It needs to improve."
"How can we improve it?" Mia asked.
Tom thought for a moment. He had an idea.
"We can use more chalk and make it brighter and smoother," he said. "And we can add some rays and a face. Then it will look happy!"
Mia liked Tom's idea. She nodded.
"OK, let's do it!" she said.
They picked up more chalk and started to fix the sun. They worked together and shared their colors. They made the sun bigger and brighter and smoother. They added some rays and a face. They gave it a smile and two eyes.
They stepped back and looked at their new sun. It was much better than before. It looked happy and so did they.
"Wow!" Tom said. "We improved the sun a lot! It looks great!"
"Yes, we did!" Mia said. "We are good at drawing with chalk!"
They hugged each other and laughed. They were honest friends who liked to help each other. They enjoyed playing with chalk and making beautiful pictures. They were happy.
