Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Bobo. Bobo had strong muscles. He liked to run and play all day long. One day, Bobo saw a little cat stuck in a tree. The cat was scared and embarrassed.
Bobo wanted to help the cat. He tried to use his muscles to push the tree down. But the tree was too big. Bobo had an idea. He would prevent the cat from falling by catching her in his soft fur.
Bobo stood under the tree and told the cat to jump. The cat was scared, but she trusted Bobo. She jumped and landed in Bobo's soft fur. The cat was safe and happy. They became best friends and played together every day.
