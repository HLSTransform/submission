Once upon a time, there was a little hut in the woods. In the hut lived a kind bear and a smart rabbit. They were good friends. One day, a big, ignorant fox came to their hut. The fox was not nice. He wanted to take the hut for himself.
The bear and the rabbit were scared. They tried to think of a plan. The rabbit said, "I have an idea. Let's make the fox fall into a hole." The bear agreed, and they started to dig a big hole near the hut.
The next day, the ignorant fox came back to the hut. The bear and the rabbit hid behind a tree. When the fox got close to the hole, the rabbit shouted, "Hey, Mr. Fox! Look over here!" The fox turned to look, and he fell into the hole.
The bear and the rabbit were very happy. They had saved their hut from the ignorant fox. From that day on, they lived happily in their little hut, knowing they could work together to solve any problem.
