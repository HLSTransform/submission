Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play with toys in their room. Tom has a guitar. He likes to make loud noises with it. Sam does not like the guitar. He likes to read books and play with cars.
One day, Tom is playing with his guitar. He is making a lot of noise. Sam is reading a book. He cannot hear the words in the book. He is angry.
"Tom, stop playing with your guitar!" Sam yells. "You are too loud! I want to read my book!"
"No, I will not stop!" Tom yells back. "I like my guitar! It is fun! You are boring!"
They yell at each other. They do not listen. They do not share. They are not kind.
Mom hears them. She comes to their room. She is not happy.
"Boys, what is going on?" Mom asks. "Why are you yelling at each other?"
"Tom is playing with his guitar. He is too loud. I cannot read my book. He is mean!" Sam says.
"Sam is reading his book. He is too quiet. I cannot play with my guitar. He is difficult!" Tom says.
Mom shakes her head. She has an idea.
"Boys, you need to learn to respect each other. You have different interests, and that is okay. But you also need to compromise. How about this: Tom, you can play with your guitar for ten minutes, but then you have to put it away and let Sam read his book. Sam, you can read your book for ten minutes, but then you have to put it away and play with Tom. Maybe you can find a game that you both like. Do you understand?" Mom says.
Tom and Sam nod. They agree. They say sorry to each other. They hug. They try to be kind.
Mom smiles. She is proud. She hopes they will get along. She leaves them to play.
