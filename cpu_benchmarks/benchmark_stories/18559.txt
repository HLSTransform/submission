Once upon a time, there was a little gray mouse. He lived in a small house in the woods. One day, the mouse went outside to play. He saw a big nosy cat! The cat wanted to catch the mouse, but the mouse was too quick. The mouse ran back to his house and closed the door. The mouse felt happy and smiled because he was safe from the cat. From that day on, the mouse was very careful when he went outside to play.
