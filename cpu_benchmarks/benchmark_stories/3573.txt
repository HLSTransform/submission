Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sing and dance, and dreamed of performing on a big stage. One day, she met a friendly butterfly who asked her what was wrong.
"I want to be on stage, but I forget the words to my song," Lily said, feeling sad.
"Don't worry, I can help," the butterfly said with a gentle smile. "Just practice every day and you'll remember the words."
Lily practiced every day, and soon she was ready to perform on stage. She sang her heart out and danced with joy, and the audience cheered and clapped. After the show, the butterfly flew up to her and said, "You did it! You were amazing!"
"Thank you for helping me," Lily said, feeling happy. "I'll never forget this day."
