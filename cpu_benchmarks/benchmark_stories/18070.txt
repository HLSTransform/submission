Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a red dress and loved to play outside. One day, she saw a leopard in her backyard. The leopard was big and had spots all over. 
Lily said, "Hi, Mr. Leopard. Do you own this yard?"
The leopard replied, "Yes, I do. This is my home."
Lily was scared and said, "But I own this house. Can we share?"
The leopard thought about it and said, "Okay, we can share. But you cannot come into my part of the yard."
Lily agreed and they became friends. They played together every day and had lots of fun. The end.
