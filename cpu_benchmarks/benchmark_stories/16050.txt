Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Lola. She was very happy. One day, Lola wanted to help her mom in the kitchen. But it was messy. Her mom had a bunch of stamps all over the counter.
Lola wanted to help her mom clean up the stamps. But she was too little. She couldn't reach them on the counter. Then, she had an idea. She climbed onto the stool. Now, she could reach the stamps.
Lola carefully picked up the stamps and put them into a box. She put the lid on the box so that the stamps couldn't move around and make the kitchen messy again. Then, Lola gave the box to her mom. Her mom was so happy. She thanked Lola for helping her clean up.
The End.
