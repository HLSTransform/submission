Once upon a time there was a furry bear. He was feeling very alone because he had no friends. He wanted someone to come and play with him.
So he got a piece of paper and started to write a letter.
He wrote "Dear Friends, Please come and play with me. We can have lots of fun together."
He put the letter in an envelope and sent it out, hoping someone would come to his house and be his friend. 
Soon enough, he heard a knock on the door and when he opened it, he saw two of his friends had come to his house.
They were so excited to see the furry bear and they all started to play together. They laughed, ran and had a blast! 
The furry bear was so happy to have his friends come to visit him and they all lived happily ever after.
