Once upon a time, there lived a furry little rabbit. The rabbit lived in a place very far away. Every day the rabbit loved to play with his eraser. One day, the eraser started to vanish into thin air! The rabbit was so surprised.
The rabbit asked his family, "Where did my eraser go?"
His mother replied, "Oh, it seems like it must have vanished into thin air."
The rabbit got upset and started to cry. He didn't understand why his eraser had disappeared.
Suddenly, a magical fairy flew down from the sky. She said to the rabbit, "Don't worry, I can cast a spell to make your eraser come back."
She waved her wand, and the eraser reappeared! The rabbit was so happy and hugged the magical fairy. From then on, the magical fairy visited the rabbit every day and they played together with the eraser.
