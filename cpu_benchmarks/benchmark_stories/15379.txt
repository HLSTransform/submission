Bob was in the desert. He wanted to grab something so he could show his friends. He spotted a cactus. He knew it would be heavy, but he was brave and decided to try. He helped the cactus out of the ground, then he grabbed it and started walking. Bob was surprised at how heavy the cactus was. He could barely carry it all the way to his house. When Bob got home, he showed his friends the cactus and they were amazed. He had grabbed a very special cactus!
