One day, in a small town, there was a big festival. The people were happy and excited. They wanted to have fun. There was a high stage in the middle of the town. On the stage, there was a big, broken chair. The people wanted to restore the chair.
A man said, "I can fix the chair!" The people were happy to hear that. The man went on the stage and started to work on the chair. He tried very hard to make it look nice again.
While the man was fixing the chair, a little boy went up to him and asked, "Can I help you?" The man said, "Yes, you can help me. Hold this part while I fix the other part." The little boy was happy to help.
But then, something bad happened. The chair fell down from the high stage. It broke into many pieces. The people were sad. The festival was not fun anymore. The man and the little boy could not restore the chair. The festival had a bad ending.
