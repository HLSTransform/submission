Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to wear her purple dress with flowers on it. One day, Lily's mom asked her to put on her jacket because it was cold outside. Lily looked for her jacket under the bed, but she couldn't find it. 
Suddenly, Lily saw her jacket hanging on the hook. She zipped up her jacket and ran outside to play. Lily played with her friends until it was time to go back inside. She took off her jacket and put it back on the hook. 
Lily's mom asked her if she had fun playing outside. Lily smiled and said, "Yes! I found my jacket under the bed and I zipped it up all by myself!" Her mom was proud of her and gave her a big hug. From that day on, Lily always remembered to look under the bed for her jacket and zip it up before going outside.
