Once upon a time there was a jolly chicken. His name was Cluck. He liked to have fun and play with his friends. Every day he would run around in his pen and have great times.
One day, Cluck did something that was a bit too much fun. He played and played until he was exhausted. All he wanted to do was rest. So he laid down and fell asleep.
The other chickens were sad that Cluck was napping. They tried to wake him up, but it was no use. Cluck was very tired and he was resting too soundly.
The other chickens decided that they would take care of Cluck while he was sleeping. They gathered around him and made sure he was safe and warm. Even when he was sleeping, they knew that Cluck was jolly.
When Cluck finally woke up, he was happy to see all his friends taking care of him. He thanked them for looking after him and asked for a big bowl of chicken feed as his reward.
The chickens all laughed and were glad that Cluck was back to his jolly self. From then on, whenever Cluck needed to rest, his friends would take care of him.
