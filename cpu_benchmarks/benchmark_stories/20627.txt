John was in his bedroom when he noticed something interesting. There on the floor was a big board. He paused and stared at it. He had never seen a board like this before. He walked closer and noticed that it was very messy. There were lots of different papers and pencils and markers scattered all around it. John was fascinated. He couldn't wait to explore the board. He started to put the different items back on the board and he noticed something amazing! The board had lots of different pictures and colours! He smiled and knew he had found something fun to do. He spent the rest of the day happily playing with the board and experimenting with the different markers and papers.
