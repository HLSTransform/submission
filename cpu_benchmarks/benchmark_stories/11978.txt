Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her bucket and shovel at the beach. One day, she found a pretty seashell and wanted to give it to her mommy as a present. But she didn't know how to wrap it.
Lily asked her daddy for help. He showed her how to wrap the seashell in colorful paper and tie a bow on top. Lily was so happy because it looked like a special gift now.
But when they got home, they saw that their dog had knocked over the bucket and scattered all the toys. Lily's daddy got angry at the dog, but Lily just laughed and started picking up her toys. She was happy because she had a pretty seashell to give to her mommy.
