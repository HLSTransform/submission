Once upon a time, there was a charming little girl named Lily. She had a pretty skirt that she loved to wear. It was her favorite skirt. Lily wanted to show her skirt to her best friend, Tim.
One sunny day, Lily put on her pretty skirt and went to Tim's house. Tim saw Lily's skirt and said, "Wow, your skirt is so nice!" Lily felt very happy that Tim liked her skirt.
Lily and Tim played all day in the park, showing their friends the pretty skirt. Everyone thought Lily's skirt was very charming. At the end of the day, Lily and Tim went home, tired but happy. They had a great day showing off the pretty skirt.
