Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mom went to church. Lily loved going to church because she got to sing and hear stories about Jesus.
During the service, Lily saw a man sing a beautiful song. When the song was over, everyone clapped and cheered. Lily asked her mom, "Why did everyone applaud?" Her mom explained that when people like something, they clap their hands to show they are happy.
After church, Lily and her mom saw an old man walking on the street. He looked very weak and tired. Lily's mom asked him if he needed help. The old man said he needed help carrying his groceries. So, Lily and her mom helped the old man and he was very grateful. "Thank you so much," he said. "You are very kind."
Lily felt happy inside because she had done a good deed. She told her mom, "I am happy we helped the old man. I want to make people happy like the man who sang at church." Her mom smiled and said, "That's a very kind thing to say, Lily."
