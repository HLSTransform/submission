Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the snow. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Timmy, let's go to the park and play."
Timmy was so excited! He put on his coat, hat, and gloves and ran outside. When they got to the park, Timmy saw a big ice slide. He wanted to slide down it so badly! But he was scared.
His mom said, "Don't worry, Timmy. I will hold your hand tight and we will slide down together." Timmy felt better and they went up the stairs to the top of the slide. When they got to the top, Timmy's mom held his hand tight and they slid down the ice slide together. It was so much fun!
From that day on, Timmy was never scared to slide down the ice slide again. He loved going to the park with his mom and holding her hand tight.
