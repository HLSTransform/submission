Once there was a little girl named Mandy and she loved playing with her lovely video. Every day after school she would run home, grab her video and settle down for hours, watching her own movie. Her mom had a rule that Mandy had to clean up before she could play with the video. But Mandy kept forgetting and her mom was getting frustrated.
So one day, Mandy's mom decided to teach her a lesson. She said, "Mandy, why don't you play with your own video today?"
Mandy was a bit confused, but she agreed. She grabbed her lovely video and went to sit down but she couldn't turn it on! Mandy had to figure out what was wrong. After a little while, she realized that her mom had taken out the batteries as a reminder of her responsibility.
Mandy learned her lesson that day: you have to clean before you can own something. Taking care of your lovely video requires remembering to put the batteries in and clean it up. This will ensure that it will always be available for you when you need it.
