Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with her pastel colors. One day, she felt dizzy because she played too much. Her mom told her to rest and unpack her toys.
Lily started to unpack her toys and found her pastel colors. She wanted to draw a big sun and flowers. But she remembered that she was dizzy. She thought, "I should listen to mom and rest first."
After resting, Lily felt better. She was not dizzy anymore. She unpacked her pastel colors and drew a beautiful picture. She learned that it is good to listen to mom and take care of herself.
