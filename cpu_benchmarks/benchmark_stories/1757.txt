Once there was a lucky girl called Sarah. She was 3 years old and went to a special classroom. In the classroom there were lots of fun things for her to do.
One day, Sarah and her friends played games in the classroom. She was so pleased because she won every game! She was feeling very lucky.
Next, they drew pictures with crayons. Sarah was excited because she had lots of ideas. She drew beautiful flowers and sent them to her family at home.
Finally, she sang a song with her friends. Everyone was clapping and singing along with Sarah. They all said she was the best singer in the classroom!
At the end of the day, Sarah was very happy. She had had so much fun at her classroom and she was very lucky to be there.
