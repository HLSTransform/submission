Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. Tom saw a big white truck with a red cross on it. He pointed and said, "Look, Lily, an ambulance!"
Lily looked and said, "Wow, an ambulance! What does it do?"
Tom said, "It helps people who are hurt. It takes them to the hospital. The people who wear blue clothes are doctors. They make people feel better."
Lily said, "That's nice. I want to be a doctor when I grow up. I want to wear blue clothes and help people."
Tom said, "Me too. Let's pretend we are doctors. We can use our toys as tools."
They ran to their backpacks and took out some toys. They found a teddy bear, a ball, a spoon, and a hat. They put the hat on the teddy bear and said, "This is our patient. He is sick. We need to check him."
They used the ball as a stethoscope, the spoon as a thermometer, and the hat as a bandage. They pretended to listen to the teddy bear's heart, take his temperature, and wrap his wound. They said, "Don't worry, teddy. You will be fine. We are doctors. We will take you to the hospital in the ambulance."
They picked up the teddy bear and ran to the white truck. They knocked on the door and said, "Hello, we are doctors. We have a patient. Can we use your ambulance?"
The driver opened the door and smiled. He said, "Hello, little doctors. You are very brave and kind. But this is not a real ambulance. It is a toy ambulance. It belongs to the park. You can play with it, but you have to be careful and share with others."
Tom and Lily said, "Oh, we are sorry. We didn't know. Thank you for letting us play with it. We will be careful and share."
The driver said, "You're welcome. Have fun. And remember, if you ever see a real ambulance, you have to move away and let it pass. It is very important."
Tom and Lily said, "OK, we will. Thank you, bye."
They waved and went back to the toy ambulance. They put the teddy bear inside and said, "We are going to the hospital. We will make you better, teddy. We are doctors."
They drove the toy ambulance around the park, making siren noises and smiling. They had a lot of fun. They liked to pretend they were doctors. They liked to wear blue clothes and help people.
