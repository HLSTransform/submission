Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They saw a big box with a hole in it. Lily wanted to look inside, but Tom said no.
"That is a trap. Someone put food in there to catch animals. If you go in, you will be stuck and scared," Tom said.
Lily did not listen to Tom. She was curious and hungry. She ignored Tom and ran to the box. She smelled cheese and bread inside. She crawled into the hole and ate the food.
Tom heard a loud snap. He turned around and saw that the box had closed on Lily. He ran to the box and tried to open it, but it was too heavy and hard. He shouted for help, but no one heard him.
Lily was crying inside the box. She was sorry that she ignored Tom. She wished she had listened to him. She was afraid of the dark and the noise. She felt fragile and alone.
Tom and Lily hoped that someone would come and save them soon. They learned a lesson: traps are dangerous and friends are important.
