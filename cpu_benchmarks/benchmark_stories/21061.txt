Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play with their dad's tools. One day, they found a big metal thing that looked shiny and fun. They did not know it was a polish machine that made things smooth and bright. They wanted to try it on their toys and other things.
They plugged the machine into the wall and turned it on. It made a loud noise and spun very fast. They took turns to hold their toys against the machine. They saw sparks and smoke come out. They thought it was cool and funny. They did not smell the bad smell or see the fire.
Soon, the fire grew bigger and hotter. It reached the curtains and the carpet. It made more smoke and noise. Tom and Sam started to cough and cry. They were scared and wanted to run away. But the door was locked and they could not open it. They did not know where the key was. They did not know how to call for help.
Their dad came home and saw the smoke and fire. He ran to the door and tried to break it. But it was too late. The fire was too strong and dangerous. He could not save his sons. He fell to the ground and screamed. He was very sad and angry. He wished he had never left the polish machine out. He wished he had taught his sons to be careful and safe. He wished he could hug them and say sorry. But he could not. They were gone.
