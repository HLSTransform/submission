Once upon a time, two friends were out walking together. One of them, Tess, had an umbrella. 
Suddenly, the sky grew dark and rain started to fall. Tess pulled out her umbrella and opened it up. "Be careful," she said to her friend. "We need to take it slow so we don't fall."
But it was too late! Her friend started running, and she stumbled and fell. Tess stepped in and closed the umbrella. She held it over her friend's head to protect them from the pouring rain.
Her friend blinked away the rain from their eyes and looked up at Tess gratefully. "Thank you," they said. 
Tess smiled. "You're welcome!" she said. "That's what friends are for!"
