Once upon a time there was a girl called Lola. She was three years old and had a big, bright smile. One day, Lola went to the park with her mom.
At the park, Lola saw a very wet puddle. Her mom told her she couldn't splash in it. Lola was sad, because she wanted to have some fun.
Lola begged her mom to change her mind. She was sure that if she splashed in the puddle it would be fun. Finally, Lola's mom made a promise â€“ if Lola stayed away from the wet puddle, she would be able to play in the park.
Lola was so excited by the promise. She stayed away from the wet puddle and played in the park all day with her mom. She was happy that her mom had changed her mind.
