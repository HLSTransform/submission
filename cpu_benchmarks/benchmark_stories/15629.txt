Lily liked to play with her mom's comb. It was shiny and had many teeth. She used it to make her hair look pretty. Sometimes she pretended it was a magic wand or a sword.
One day, she found the comb on the table in the living room. She picked it up and ran to her room. She wanted to play with it alone. She closed the door and locked it. She did not want anyone to bother her.
She put the comb on her bed and looked for her dolls. She wanted to comb their hair too. But she could not find them. They were hidden under the blanket. She lifted the blanket and saw them. She smiled and grabbed them.
She heard a knock on the door. It was her mom. She said, "Lily, open the door, please. I need the comb. It is mine, not yours."
Lily did not want to give the comb back. She liked it too much. She said, "No, mom. It is mine. I found it. Go away."
Her mom said, "Lily, that is not nice. You have to share. The comb is not a toy. It is for brushing hair. If you do not open the door, I will be angry."
Lily felt scared. She did not want her mom to be angry. She did not want to make her sad. She thought for a moment. She decided to be good. She said, "Sorry, mom. I will open the door. Here is the comb. You can have it."
She unlocked the door and gave the comb to her mom. Her mom smiled and hugged her. She said, "Thank you, Lily. You are a good girl. I love you."
Lily felt happy. She said, "I love you too, mom. Can I play with the comb later?"
Her mom said, "Yes, you can. But only if you ask me first. And only if you are careful. OK?"
Lily said, "OK, mom. I will ask you first. And I will be careful."
They both smiled and went to the living room. They played with the comb and the dolls together. They had fun.
