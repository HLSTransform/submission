Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweety. Tweety was very lonely because he didn't have any friends to play with. One day, Tweety decided to go out and find some friends. 
As he was flying, he saw a big tree with lots of birds. He flew towards the tree and asked the birds if they wanted to be friends. But the birds just laughed and said, "You're too small and weak to be our friend." Tweety was very sad and flew away.
As he was flying, he saw a big snake. The snake said, "Hello little bird, do you want to play with me?" Tweety was scared and said, "No thank you, Mr. Snake." The snake then said, "Why not? Don't you want to have fun?" Tweety replied, "I don't want to play with someone who might twist me into a knot."
The snake then said, "I understand. But don't worry, I won't hurt you. Let's be friends." Tweety thought about it and said, "Okay, let's be friends." 
The moral of the story is that it doesn't matter what size or shape you are, everyone can be friends. And it's important to be careful who you trust, but not to be afraid to make new friends.
