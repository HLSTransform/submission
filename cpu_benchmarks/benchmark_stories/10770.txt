Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Max and a small cat named Kitty. They lived in a house with a nice family. Max and Kitty liked to play outside in the yard.
One day, Max and Kitty had a little fight. Max said, "Kitty, you are too small to move this big ball!" Kitty said, "No, Max! I am fit and strong. I can move it too!" So, they both tried to move the big ball together.
As they worked together, they found out that they could move the big ball. The fight was over, and they became good friends. Now, Max and Kitty play with the big ball every day. They learned that they can do things together, even if they are different sizes.
