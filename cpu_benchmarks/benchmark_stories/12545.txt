Lila and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big truck. The truck has ice-cream. Lila and Ben love ice-cream. They run to the truck.
The man in the truck is nice. He smiles at Lila and Ben. He says, "What do you want?" Lila and Ben look at the ice-cream. There are many kinds. Lila wants chocolate. Ben wants strawberry. They tell the man.
The man gives them ice-cream. He says, "That will be two coins." Lila and Ben look at their pockets. They have no coins. They are sad. They say, "Sorry, we have no coins."
The man sees their sad faces. He feels sorry for them. He is humble. He says, "It's okay. You can have the ice-cream for free. But you have to do something for me." Lila and Ben say, "What do we have to do?"
The man says, "You have to use your manners. You have to say thank you and please. And you have to share your ice-cream with someone who has none." Lila and Ben say, "Okay, we can do that." They say, "Thank you, sir. You are very kind." They take their ice-cream and go to the park.
They see a girl sitting on a bench. She has no ice-cream. She looks lonely. Lila and Ben go to her. They say, "Hi, we are Lila and Ben. Do you want some ice-cream?" The girl says, "Yes, please. That would be nice." Lila and Ben share their ice-cream with her. They make a new friend. They are happy. They use their manners. They use their ice-cream. They are humble.
