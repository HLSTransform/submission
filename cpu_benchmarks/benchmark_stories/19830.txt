Once upon a time, there was a big bear. He was strong and very brave. He liked to protect his friends and he never got scared.
One day, he was walking through the woods. Suddenly, he heard a noise. He stopped and listened carefully. It was a baby goat! It sounded scared.
The bear walked closer to help. He saw the baby goat standing in the middle of the field, all alone. He was scared and shaking. The bear was calm and he came closer to the goat. He was making sure it knew it was safe.
The bear stayed by the baby goat's side. He stayed until the goat felt calm! He was protecting the baby goat, so no harm would come to it.
The baby goat was very happy! It stayed near the bear until it was time to go home. The bear gave the goat a big hug and the baby goat wanted to stay longer.
But, the bear had to go. He wanted to protect other animals in the woods, so he stood tall and waved goodbye. 
The End.
