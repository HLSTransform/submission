Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the forest near his house. One day, he was walking around when he saw a big bear! 
Timmy was scared and started to tremble. The bear had a spear in his paw and looked very alert. 
Timmy said, "Mr. Bear, please don't hurt me. I'm just a little boy." 
The bear looked at Timmy and said, "I won't hurt you, little one. I'm just trying to catch some fish for my family." 
Timmy felt better and said, "Oh, okay. I hope you catch lots of fish!" 
The bear smiled and walked away with his spear. Timmy was happy that he made a new friend in the forest.
