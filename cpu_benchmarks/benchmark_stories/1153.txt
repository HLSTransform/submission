Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to play with bubbles. One sunny day, she went outside to blow some bubbles with her bubble wand.
Sue blew a big, graceful bubble. The bubble floated up into the sky. Sue wanted to see where the bubble would go, so she decided to follow it. She ran and skipped as the bubble danced in the wind.
The bubble led Sue to a beautiful park with lots of flowers. Sue felt happy and laughed as she played with the bubble. She knew that she would remember this special day forever.
