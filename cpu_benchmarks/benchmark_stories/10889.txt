Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside all day long. One day, Lily's mommy told her that she needed to rest and take a break from playing. Lily didn't want to rest, she wanted to play more. But her mommy said that resting was important to help her body feel better.
The next day, Lily's mommy hired a tutor to help her learn new things. The tutor was very nice and taught Lily many new things. But Lily thought the tutor was a little crazy because she made her do hard work.
One day, Lily got very tired from playing and learning. She remembered what her mommy said about resting and decided to take a nap. When she woke up, she felt much better and was ready to play and learn again. Lily learned that resting was important and that sometimes people who seem crazy are actually very helpful.
