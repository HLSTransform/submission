Once upon a time, there was a big peach tree. Every morning, the tree would ask its friends around the garden a question. One morning, it asked, "Who is the most brilliant one in the garden?"
The wind whispered, "It is me!" The sun said nothing but smiled. The bugs chirped, "It's us!"
The tree smiled and said, "Let's all try to be brilliant together!"
Then, an answer came from nearby. It was a little girl! She had the biggest, brightest smile on her face.
The tree asked, "What makes you so brilliant?" The little girl held up a peach she had picked, and said, "This peach makes me feel happy and brave, so I can answer questions like yours!"
The tree and all its friends smiled and agreed that the girl was very brilliant. The little girl smiled and thanked them for their kind words.
The end.
