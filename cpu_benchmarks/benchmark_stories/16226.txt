One day, Bill the rabbit was walking along the field when he saw something pink and shiny. He quickly hopped over and discovered it was a pistol. Bill was very excited, and wanted to show the pistol to all his friends. 
But then, he heard a voice. "That is my pistol," said the voice. It was Liz the fox. Bill had not seen her coming. 
Liz was very angry. "I found this pistol first," said Bill, trying to settle the situation. But Liz wasn't happy. "You must give the pistol back to me," she said. 
Bill knew this was a tricky situation. He didn't like the idea of giving the pistol back to Liz, so he came up with an idea. "I shall keep the pistol, but I'll give it back to you whenever you want to borrow it," said Bill. 
Liz thought about this for a moment and then smiled. She agreed that this was a good way to settle the dispute.
From then on, Bill could keep the pistol for himself, and Liz could borrow it whenever she wanted. They smiled at each other, happy the dispute had been so easily settled.
