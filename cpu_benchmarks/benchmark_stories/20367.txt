Tim and Sam were brothers. They liked to play with their toys. Tim had a motorcycle toy that he loved very much. Sam had a ball that he liked to bounce.
One day, Tim was very lazy. He did not want to clean his room. He left his motorcycle toy on the floor. Sam saw the motorcycle toy and wanted to play with it. He took it and ran away.
"Hey, that's mine!" Tim shouted. He ran after Sam. He was very angry.
Sam ran outside. He saw a big hill. He thought it would be fun to ride the motorcycle toy down the hill. He did not see the road at the bottom of the hill. He did not see the car that was coming fast.
"Sam, stop!" Tim yelled. He saw the danger. He tried to catch Sam. But he was too late.
The car hit Sam and the motorcycle toy. There was a loud noise. Sam and the motorcycle toy flew in the air. They landed on the ground. They did not move.
Tim ran to Sam. He cried. He hugged Sam. He was very sad. He wished he had not been lazy. He wished he had cleaned his room. He wished he had shared his motorcycle toy with Sam. He wished he could say sorry to Sam. But it was too late. Sam was gone. Tim was alone.
