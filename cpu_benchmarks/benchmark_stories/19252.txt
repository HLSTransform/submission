Once upon a time, there was a small girl called Polly. She liked to explore and have fun. Today she had a surprise. Her mummy and daddy had taken her to the park to play. When they got there, there was a long line of people. But Polly was a flexible girl and she was happy to wait in the line with her parents.
The line moved slowly until it stopped. Then Polly was surprised to see an ice-cream truck. She loved ice-cream and she was so excited. She couldn't believe it! Her mummy and daddy bought her a big vanilla cone, with sprinkles and a cherry on top. Polly smiled and enjoyed her surprise.
The ice-cream was so delicious. Polly was so happy that day. She ate her ice-cream with a smile. It was one of the best surprises she had ever had.
