Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved playing in the park with his friends. One day, Timmy saw a big tree and wanted to climb it. He tried and tried, but he couldn't reach the branches.
Suddenly, Timmy's mom came and saw him struggling. She gave him a massage on his back to help him relax. After the massage, Timmy felt better and tried again. This time, he was able to reach the branches and climb up the tree!
Timmy was so happy and proud of himself. He shouted, "I did it!" His mom smiled and said, "You did a great job, Timmy. You're not terrible at climbing, you just needed a little help." From that day on, Timmy loved climbing trees and always remembered the massage his mom gave him to help him reach the top.
