Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a compassionate bird named Bella. Bella had beautiful wings and loved to fly around the village. One day, Bella saw a hungry little boy sitting under a tree. He was sad because he had nothing to eat.
Bella wanted to help the little boy, so she flew to her nest and found some food. She cooked a tasty meal with her wings and brought it to the boy. The boy was very happy and thanked Bella for her kindness.
From that day on, Bella cooked for the little boy and other hungry children in the village every day. The children loved Bella and her compassionate heart. The moral of the story is to always be kind and help those in need.
