Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was three years old and loved to dress herself up in different clothes. One morning she was wearing her favorite pink dress when she asked her mom, "what is history?" Her mom smiled and said "History is like a story that happened a long time ago". 
Lucy thought it sounded very exciting so she put on her dress and said "I want to go and see some history now!" Her mom replied "My brave girl, of course you can go, but be careful". 
So Lucy put on her shoes and walked out the door. As she walked down the street she felt a little bit nervous, but she kept going. Finally, she arrived at the museum. She stepped inside and looked around. Everywhere she looked she saw old artifacts and beautiful artifacts. 
Lucy walked around the museum for an hour, looking at the old history. After a while, she realized it was time to go home. She felt a mixture of emotions. She was both excited and nervous because she had seen a lot of history that day. 
When Lucy arrived home, she told her mom all about her adventures and what she had seen. Her mom smiled and said "It sounds like you had a very interesting day!"
