Once upon a time, there was a child. She was very happy because today was the day she was going to learn how to swim!
The child's family brought her to the pool. The water was so shiny and there were red swimmers everywhere. The child felt so excited and couldn't wait to start.
The child's mom and dad said, "The most important rule is to always listen to your swimming teacher." The child nodded her head.
The swimming teacher said, "Let's get into the water. Come on everyone, it's time to swim!" The child jumped into the pool with the other swimmers.
Everyone was having so much fun swimming around. The child was picking up lots of skills, like kicking with her feet and moving her arms.
At the end of the day, the child said goodbye to her swimming teacher and smiled. She was so proud of herself for learning how to swim!
