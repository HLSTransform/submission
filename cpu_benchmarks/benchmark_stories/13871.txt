Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to smile and play with her friends. One day, Lily saw a pretty dress in a shop. The dress was cheap, so her mom bought it for her.
Lily was so happy with her new dress. She wore it to the park to show her friends. They all smiled when they saw her pretty dress. They played and laughed together all day.
But then, it started to rain. Lily's cheap dress got wet and the colors ran. The dress was ruined. Lily was sad and didn't smile anymore. Her friends tried to cheer her up, but the dress was gone. The day had a bad ending.
