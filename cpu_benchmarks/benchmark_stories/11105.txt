Once upon a time, there was a dog named Spot. Spot was a very stupid dog. He liked to play with his ball all day. One day, Spot saw a big bottle. The bottle had wine in it. Spot did not know what wine was.
A cat named Whiskers walked by. Whiskers was a smart cat. Whiskers said, "Spot, do not play with the wine. It is not for dogs." But Spot did not listen. He wanted to welcome the wine into his playtime.
Spot played with the wine bottle. He kicked it with his paw. The bottle broke! Wine went all over the floor. Spot was sad. He knew he should have listened to Whiskers. Now, Spot had no ball and no wine to play with.
