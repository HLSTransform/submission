Once upon a time, there was an old turtle who lived in a pond. The old turtle had seen many things in his long life, but he was always happy to meet new friends. One day, a young rabbit came to the pond to play. The old turtle was happy to have a new friend.
But the young rabbit was very curious and liked to explore. One day, she wandered too far from the pond and got lost. She tried to find her way back, but she didn't know where to go. She was scared and didn't know what to do.
That's when the old turtle came to the rescue. He had seen the young rabbit wander off and had been watching her from a distance. He followed her and when she got lost, he helped her escape from the woods. The young rabbit was grateful and promised to never wander off again. From that day on, the old turtle and the young rabbit were the best of friends.
