One day, a mysterious man appeared in the land. He had a special kind of power that no one else had. Everyone wanted to get the mysterious man's power for themselves.
The people tried to get the mysterious man's power, but it was too hard. Suddenly, the mysterious man disappeared. No one ever saw him again. The mysterious man's power was gone, too.
Everyone was very sad. They searched and searched, but they never found the mysterious man or his power. Finally, they gave up. The mysterious man and his power had disappeared forever.
