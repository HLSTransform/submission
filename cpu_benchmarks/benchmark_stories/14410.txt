Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to school. She had a smooth notebook that she loved to write in. Lily's teacher, Ms. Rose, said, "Class, today we will be drawing our favorite animals. Please include as many details as you can."
Lily was excited to draw her favorite animal, a cute little bunny. She drew the bunny's long ears and fluffy tail, and even included a carrot in the picture. When Ms. Rose saw Lily's drawing, she said, "Wow, Lily, this is amazing! You are such a talented artist."
After school, Lily was walking home when she saw a mean dog. The dog started chasing her and she dropped her notebook. When she got home and saw her notebook, she was sad because the dog had ripped it apart. She cried and cried, but her mom said, "Don't worry, we can buy you a new notebook."
From that day on, Lily learned to be careful around mean dogs and always kept her notebook safe.
