Once upon a time, there was a funny bunny named Bob. Bob lived in a small cabin in the woods. He loved to play and tease his friends.
One day, Bob's friend, a bird named Tim, came to visit. They played together in the sunny yard. Bob said, "Tim, I can tease you!" Tim laughed and said, "You are funny, Bob! Let's see if you can tease me."
Bob and Tim played a game where they tried to tease each other. Bob hopped high and fast, but Tim could fly higher and faster. They laughed and had a lot of fun. At the end of the day, they went back to Bob's cabin and had a nice nap. They were happy to be friends and play together.
