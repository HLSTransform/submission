Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play together at school. One day, they have a new game. They pretend to travel to different places. They use a big desk as their plane.
"Where do you want to go today?" Sara asks Ben.
"I want to go to the zoo. I want to see the lions and the monkeys," Ben says.
"Okay, let's go to the zoo. Fasten your seat belt. The plane is ready to take off," Sara says. She makes a loud noise with her mouth. Vroom, vroom!
They fly over the sky and imagine they see many things. They see clouds, birds, mountains, and rivers. They have fun.
After a while, they land at the zoo. They get out of the desk and walk around. They see many animals. They see lions, monkeys, elephants, giraffes, and more. They are happy.
"Look, Sara, the lion is roaring. He is so big and strong," Ben says.
"Yes, he is. But we are safe. He is behind a fence. He cannot hurt us," Sara says.
They watch the lion for a while. Then they hear a voice.
"Children, it is time to go back to the classroom. The game is over," the teacher says.
Sara and Ben are sad. They want to stay at the zoo. But they are also good and helpful. They listen to the teacher. They go back to the desk and pretend to fly again.
"Bye, bye, zoo. We had fun. Maybe we can come back another day," Sara says.
"Yes, maybe. Thank you for being my friend and traveling with me, Sara," Ben says.
They hug each other and smile. They are happy.
