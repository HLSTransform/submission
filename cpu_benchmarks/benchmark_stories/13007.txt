Once upon a time there was a young green tree. The tree was so green and it was a very special tree in the forest. Every day the animals would play and laugh around the tree. But one day, the animals were feeling very sad. Someone had come and removed the tree! But then, a very nice man came to the forest with a young green tree. He planted the tree in the same spot and soon the tree started to grow just like it was before. The animals in the forest were so happy to see the young green tree once again. They all cheered and danced around the tree. The animals now had the young green tree to play and laugh around once again and the forest felt complete again.
