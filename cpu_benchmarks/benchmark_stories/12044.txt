Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the park with his friends. One day, Timmy found a yellow ball while playing. He was so happy and played with it all day.
As Timmy was walking home with his ball, he saw a big dog. The dog was very friendly and wanted to play with Timmy. But the dog was very heavy and Timmy couldn't pick him up. Timmy thought, "I wish I could weigh as much as the dog."
Later that night, Timmy went to bed and had a dream. In his dream, he saw a skeleton who told him that if he ate all his vegetables, he would grow big and strong like the dog. Timmy woke up and remembered the dream. He ate all his vegetables and soon he grew big and strong. He could even pick up the dog! Timmy was so happy and played with the dog every day.
