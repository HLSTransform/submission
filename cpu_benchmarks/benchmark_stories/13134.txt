Once upon a time, there was a girl and a boy. The girl had a pebble. The pebble was very special to her. The boy asked the girl to lend him the pebble. She was very happy to lend it to him.
The boy was excited to have the pebble. He ran around the field, shouting loud from joy. The girl smiled as she saw the boy being so happy.
Soon, it was time to go. The boy gave back the pebble to the girl and thanked her for letting him borrow it. The girl was glad to help the boy and smiled.
The girl and the boy both said goodbye and went on their way, happy that they had shared a special moment together.
