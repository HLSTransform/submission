Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He was just three years old, and he had lots of fun playing in the backyard. One night, it got dark outside, so his mommy said he needed a flashlight. He went to choose one from the drawer, and found a red one that he liked. He was so excited, he couldn't wait to go outside. 
He went outside and shined the red flashlight around. He laughed and shouted, and had so much fun. All of a sudden, he heard his mommy calling him. She told him it was time to go inside. The little boy was very sad.
He went inside, and his mommy saw that he was upset. She asked him what was wrong, and he said he forgot to turn off the flashlight. She said it was OK and not to worry.
The little boy felt so sorry, he said he would be more careful next time. His mommy said it was OK and gave him a big hug. He smiled, and went off to bed.
