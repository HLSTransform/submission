One sunny morning, Molly was playing outside with her toy airplane. The plane was red and shiny, and she made it fly around in the sky.
Molly's mom saw her daughter playing and brought her a cup of cold juice.
Molly said: “Thanks mommy!”
Molly's mom smiled and said: “You’re welcome, honey! Would you like to play a game? Let’s see if you can fly the plane and put the cups in an organized line.
Molly nodded and began flying the plane. She flew it over the cups and put them in a neat row.
Molly was so proud of herself. She flew the plane one more time and shouted: “Look, mommy! I did it!”
Molly’s mom hugged her daughter and said: “You’re so organized! I’m so proud of you!”
