Once upon a time, there was a big dog. He loved to play outside and chase balls. One day, he saw a mailman walking by. The dog got excited and ran over to say hello. But then, he did something naughty. He bit the mailman's pants! The mailman was scared and ran away.
Later that day, the dog's owner gave him a bone. The bone was so delicious! The dog wagged his tail and chewed on the bone happily. He forgot all about the mailman and just enjoyed his treat. From then on, the dog made sure to be good when the mailman came around.
