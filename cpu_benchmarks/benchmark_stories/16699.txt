Tom and Lily liked to play in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide and swing. One day, they saw a big pond in the park. They wanted to see what was in the pond.
They walked to the pond and looked. They saw some fish and some frogs and some ducks. They also saw something big and green and scary. It was an alligator! The alligator saw them and opened its mouth. It had many sharp teeth.
Tom and Lily were scared. They ran away from the pond. They shouted for help. They saw their mom and dad. They ran to them and hugged them. They told them about the alligator.
Mom and dad were worried. They looked at the pond. They saw the alligator too. They called the park ranger. The park ranger came and caught the alligator. He said the alligator was hurt and lost. He said he would take it to a safe place.
Tom and Lily were glad. They said sorry to the alligator. They hoped it would feel better. They said thank you to the park ranger. They learned to be careful near the pond. They went back to play in the park. They had fun. They did not see the alligator again.
