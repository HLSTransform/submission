Once upon a time there were two kids, Vera and Ben. They wanted to know how an egg was made, so they asked their mom.
Mom smiled and explained that eggs were laid by hens. She showed the kids the henhouse and let them watch the hens come out to lay their eggs.
Vera was amazed. She asked her mom why the eggs were so organized, and her mom said that the hens cared for their eggs. She explained that the hens would protect and clean their eggs, so they stayed neat and tidy.
Ben and Vera laughed with delight. Ben said that he wanted to have a pet hen so they could have their very own eggs!
Their mom thought it was a great idea and they went off to find a perfect pet hen. They looked everywhere and finally found the perfect bird - a friendly and organized hen that loved to lay beautiful eggs.
Ben and Vera now had an egg-laying pet that kept their eggs neat and tidy!
