Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the park to play with his friends. One day, he saw a lonely vendor selling ice cream. The vendor looked sad because nobody was buying his ice cream.
Timmy went up to the vendor and said, "Hi! I want to buy some ice cream, please." The vendor smiled and said, "Thank you, little boy! What flavor would you like?" Timmy said, "I want chocolate, please!"
As Timmy was eating his ice cream, he saw a big bully named Billy. Billy wanted to take Timmy's ice cream. Timmy said, "No! This is mine!" Billy tried to twist Timmy's arm to take the ice cream. But Timmy said, "Stop! That hurts!" 
Suddenly, the vendor came to the rescue and said, "Leave Timmy alone! He bought that ice cream fair and square!" Billy ran away and Timmy was happy to have made a new friend in the lonely vendor. From that day on, Timmy always went to the park to visit his new friend and buy ice cream.
