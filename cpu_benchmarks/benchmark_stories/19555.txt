Once upon a time, a little girl named Jessie was walking in the woods. She stopped and saw a beehive in a tree! She wanted to try the sweet honey so she shook the tree gently. 
Bees came out and started buzzing around her. She was scared but then she had an idea. Jessie started to dance and shake in front of the bees. She was twirling and hopping around, making funny faces.
The bees watched her performance and they were so amazed. They brought out some honey and gave it to her. Jessie thanked them and smiled with delight. 
From then on, Jessie was known as a creative bee-friend! Whenever she needed honey, she would go to the beehive and shake and dance. The bees would give her honey every time.
