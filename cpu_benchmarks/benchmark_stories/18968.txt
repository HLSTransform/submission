One day, a poor dog named Ben was walking on the lawn. He was very hungry. He saw a big house with a kind lady named Ann. Ann saw Ben and felt sad for him.
Ann said, "Come here, Ben. I will serve you some food." Ben wagged his tail and went to Ann. She gave him a big bowl of yummy food. Ben ate it all and felt happy.
After eating, Ben played on the lawn with Ann. They had so much fun together. From that day on, Ben lived with Ann and they were the best of friends.
