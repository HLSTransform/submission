One day, Mina was very excited. She and her Grandma were going to cook together. Grandma pulled out all her supplies and set out a huge bowl. She began to mix together some ingredients, while Mina sat and watched. 
"I'm making loop mix," Grandma said. 
"Whatâ€™s that?" Mina asked curiously.
Grandma smiled. "You'll see," she said.
Mina watched intently as Grandma cooked. She added in some small loops and stirred it up. Then, Grandma pulled out some fake food.
Mina was surprised. "Grandma, why is your food fake?" 
Grandma chuckled. "You'll see," she said again.
Mina waited in excitement, watching Grandma finish up her cooking. Grandma finished mixing, then carefully put the fake food on top.
Finally, Grandma served it up. Mina saw the plate of colorful loops with fake food topping. She gasped and smiled.
"Grandma! You made a loop surprise!"
