Once upon a time, there was a girl who worked hard. She wanted to have a special treat, so she asked her mom for something tasty. Her mom smiled and gave her an eye-shaped cookie.
The girl was so excited and took a bite. It was so good and so tasty. She took another bite and then shared it with her dog. The dog loved it too.
The girl kept working, but she thought about that tasty eye-shaped cookie. When she was finished working, she asked her mom if she could have another one. Her mom smiled and said yes.
The girl enjoyed the second cookie as much as the first and shared it with her dog. She was so happy that she was able to have something tasty after all her hard work.
