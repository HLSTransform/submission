Once upon a time, there was a beautiful sailor. She sailed far and wide, seeing amazing things along the way. Everywhere she went, the people cheered and celebrated her.
One sunny day, the sailor stopped in a small village. Everyone gathered around and said hello. They celebrated the sailorâ€™s arrival by singing and dancing in the streets. The sailor couldn't help but smile.
The village gave the sailor a special gift. It was a beautiful sailboat that was just the right size for her. She thanked them, and promised to sail around the world in it. 
The sailor said goodbye to the village and climbed aboard her new sailboat. She waved and smiled as she sailed away. Everyone waved and cheered, celebrating her new adventure. And the beautiful sailor sailed away into the sunset.
