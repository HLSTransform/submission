Once there was a little girl. She was always very flexible and loved to lay on the ground. One day, she saw something very interesting. It was a way that was just for her. 
She decided to lay down on the way and have a rest. She was flexible enough to fit perfectly. She moved her body around to get comfy and relaxed. 
She stayed there for a while with her eyes closed, feeling at peace. When she opened them, she noticed something very special. It was a beautiful rainbow. It filled the sky above her. 
The little girl smiled and thanked the bright way for showing her such a beautiful sight. Then she lay there patiently to take in the beauty around her. When it was time, she got up and said goodbye to the way. 
The little girl was glad that she had chosen to lay down on the way and was thankful for the beautiful rainbow she had seen.
