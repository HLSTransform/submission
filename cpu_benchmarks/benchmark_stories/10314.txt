Lily and Ben were playing in the living room. They liked to pretend they were in a castle, and they used the curtain as a door. The curtain was rough and red, and it made a noise when they moved it.
"Knock, knock," Ben said. "Who is there?"
"It is me, the princess," Lily said. "Can I come in?"
"Yes, you can," Ben said. He moved the curtain and let Lily in. "Welcome to my castle. Do you want some tea?"
"Yes, please," Lily said. She sat on the couch and Ben gave her a cup. The cup was plastic and had flowers on it. They pretended to drink tea and talk.
They enjoyed playing in the castle. They laughed and told stories. They did not hear their mom calling them for lunch. She came to the living room and saw them behind the curtain.
"Hello, my little royals," she said. "Are you having fun?"
"Yes, mom," Lily and Ben said. "We are in a castle."
"That's wonderful," mom said. "But it is time to eat. Come on, let's go to the kitchen."
Lily and Ben put down their cups and followed mom. They moved the curtain and said goodbye to the castle. They were hungry and happy. They liked to play with the curtain.
