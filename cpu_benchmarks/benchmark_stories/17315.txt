Once upon a time, a boy named Timmy went to his grandpa's house. Grandpa had a big garden with lots of leaves on the ground. Grandpa asked Timmy to help him rake the leaves. Timmy found a nice rake and started to rake the leaves. He was having fun and made a big pile. 
After they finished raking, they sat down and had some cookies. Timmy mentioned that he liked the nice rake and wanted to take it home. Grandpa said it was okay and gave the nice rake to Timmy. Timmy was very happy and said thank you to his grandpa. From that day on, Timmy loved to rake leaves in his own yard with his nice rake.
