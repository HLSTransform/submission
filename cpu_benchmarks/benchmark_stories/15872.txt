Once upon a time there were two best friends, a giraffe and an elephant. They were walking along, trying to guess what they should do next.
The giraffe said, "Let's go explore a new place!"
The elephant paused. He said, "But that sounds really scary. I'm not sure I want to do that."
The giraffe thought about it for a moment. Then he smiled.
"I have an original idea," he said. "Let's pretend we are exploring a new place! We can use our imaginations to make it as exciting as we want."
The elephant smiled too. He thought it sounded like a great plan.
So the two friends imagined they were exploring a new land. They pretended they were climbing tall mountains, swimming in deep oceans, and meeting wild and wacky creatures. They had so much fun!
At the end of their pretend adventure, the two friends laughed and hugged each other. They had gone on a wonderful journey, all without leaving their spot. They had used their imaginations and had a grand time. 
The giraffe said, "Let's do this again soon!"
The elephant agreed and they headed home, looking forward to their next pretend adventure.
