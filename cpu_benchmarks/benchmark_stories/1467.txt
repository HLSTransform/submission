John had a drum. He loved playing it fast. Every day after playing John would take a nap. He would sleep so soundly and for a long time. After his nap he would wake up and play his drum again, as fast as he could. He would practice hard every day, getting better and better every time. After playing he would be so tired that he could hardly keep his eyes open. He would put his drum away and then go have a nice long nap. John enjoyed sleeping and playing the drum, they were his favorite things to do.
