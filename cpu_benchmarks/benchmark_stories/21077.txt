Lily likes to sing. She sings when she wakes up, when she plays, and when she goes to bed. She sings loud and happy. She sings about flowers, stars, and rainbows.
One day, Lily finds a bubble wand in her toy box. She runs outside and blows big bubbles. She sings to the bubbles as they float in the air. She sings, "Bubble, bubble, you are so pretty. Bubble, bubble, please stay with me."
But Tom, the boy next door, does not like Lily's singing. He thinks she is too noisy and silly. He wants to pop her bubbles. He grabs a stick and runs after Lily. He swings the stick at the bubbles and makes them burst. He laughs and says, "Bubble, bubble, you are so weak. Bubble, bubble, you are gone."
Lily is sad and scared. She drops her bubble wand and runs away. She cries and says, "Bubble, bubble, you are my friends. Bubble, bubble, why did he hurt you?"
Tom feels strong and proud. He picks up the bubble wand and blows a big bubble. He sings, "Bubble, bubble, I am the best. Bubble, bubble, you are my toy."
But then, a big wind comes and blows the bubble away. The bubble flies high and far. Tom tries to catch it, but he trips and falls. He hits his head on a rock and bleeds. He cries and says, "Bubble, bubble, come back to me. Bubble, bubble, I am sorry."
But the bubble does not hear him. The bubble flies over the trees and the houses. The bubble sees Lily hiding behind a fence. The bubble smiles and says, "Lily, Lily, you are so kind. Lily, Lily, I will always love you."
The end.
