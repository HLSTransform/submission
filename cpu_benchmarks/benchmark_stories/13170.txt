Once upon a time, there was a unique peanut. It was just like any other peanut but unique in its own way. The peanut was sitting on the ground, very still and quiet. Suddenly, something happened! Someone, who was very strong, came and lifted the peanut up into the air with their hands. The peanut was so excited and happy! It had never been lifted before! 
The peanut was then moved around quickly, up and down and side to side. It was like a ride at the carnival. Then, the peanut was softly placed back down onto the ground and looked up in awe. It had never been so high up in the air before and had never felt so free. The peanut was now more confident than before and was proud of itself for having been lifted. 
The moral of the story is to never give up! There may be someone strong enough to lift you up and take you places you have never been before.
