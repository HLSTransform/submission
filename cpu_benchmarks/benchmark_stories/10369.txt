Tim and Lily are playing in the park. They like to run and jump and slide. They hear a noise in the sky. It is a plane. The plane is loud. It makes a zoom sound.
"Look, Lily, a plane!" Tim says. He points to the sky.
"I see it, Tim. It is big and white. Where is it going?" Lily asks.
"I don't know. Maybe to another park. Maybe to see other kids. Do you want to go on a plane, Lily?" Tim says.
Lily thinks for a moment. She likes to see new things. But she does not like loud noises. She shakes her head.
"No, Tim. I don't want to go on a plane. It is too loud. It hurts my ears. I like to play here with you. This is our park. It is quiet and nice." Lily says.
Tim nods. He understands. He does not like loud noises either. He likes to play here with Lily. They are friends. They hold hands and run to the swings. They forget about the plane. They have fun.
