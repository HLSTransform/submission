Jane was a very small girl. She loved to play in her room. One day she woke up very early in the morning and saw something strange in her room. She was quite scared. 
When she looked more closely, she saw that it was her own reflection in the mirror. Jane looked very carefully at herself in the mirror. She saw that she was wearing a pink dress with flowers on it and her hair was tied up in a pretty bow. 
Jane's mother heard her talking to the mirror. She went into the room and said, "That's your reflection. The mirror shows you what you look like. It's important to take care of ourselves and keep ourselves looking neat and clean."
Jane said, "Yes, Mama." She then took a cloth and wiped the mirror so that it was clear. She looked in the mirror and smiled. 
The moral of this story is that we can learn about ourselves by looking in the mirror. We can take care of ourselves and keep ourselves looking neat and clean, which makes us happy and also makes us look more beautiful.
