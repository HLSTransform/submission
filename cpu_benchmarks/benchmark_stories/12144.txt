Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She was three years old and loved to explore the world around her. One day, Mia was in her kitchen, excitedly playing with the things in the cupboard. Suddenly, she found a shiny, silver fork. She picked it up and looked at it closely, marvelling at its shape. 
Mia ran out of the kitchen to find her mum and proudly offered the fork to her. Her mum looked very surprised and said: "Mia, where did you get this from?" 
Mia pointed back to the kitchen, grinning. Her mum smiled. Even though Mia had got into the cupboard without permission, her mum felt glad that she had found the fork. She said: "Mia, I'm sorry you weren't allowed to get into the cupboard. But thank you for finding the fork." 
Mia smiled back and held the fork up in the air, beaming with pride. She had found the shiny, silver fork and that made her happy. The end.
