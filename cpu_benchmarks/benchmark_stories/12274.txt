Once upon a time, there lived an explore. He was brave and curious. One day he decided to explore deep in the jungle. When he was walking, he suddenly saw a big crocodile. The explore asked, "Who are you?"
The crocodile said nothing. He slowly opened his big mouth and moved slowly closer to the explore. The explore was scared and started to run away. But he was too late. The crocodile had already caught up to him and ate him whole. 
The big crocodile went off and the explore was never seen again. The end.
