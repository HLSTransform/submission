Once upon a time there was a brave kid called Steve. He was very curious and loved to explore the world. He wanted to try something new every day.
One day, his mom gave him a belt. It was red and had shiny buckles. Steve thought it was brilliant! He wanted to try it on straight away. He put it around his waist like a grown-up would and he felt so strong!
He tried to fasten the belt but it was too hard for him. However, he kept trying and eventually he got it! He was really proud of himself.
From that day on, every time Steve wanted to try something, he wore his belt as a reminder to never give up, even if something seemed too hard. It made him feel brave and he could do anything!
