One day, in a very sunny place, there were two friends, Sam and Tad. Sam liked numbers and Tad liked zebras! They decided to try something new together.
First, Sam counted up to 10! Then, Tad told Sam all about his favorite zebra. It was a sweet zebra that wore a black and white striped coat. They both thought it was very funny.
Then they made a new game. Sam would count to 10 and Tad would make up a short story. He said the story of the sweet zebra who liked to eat juicy apples.
Sam and Tad had lots of fun playing their new game. All day long they counted and made up stories about the special zebra for each other.
