Once there was a little girl named Jane. She was only three years old but she was already very smart. Jane's mommy and daddy always took very special care of her.
One day, Jane found a staff in the garden. She thought it looked kind of special, so she took it inside. When Jane's mommy saw it, she said, "Jane, you should be very careful with that staff. It could be dangerous!"
Jane nodded and said, "I will be careful, Mommy."
Jane spent all afternoon playing with her staff. She twirled it around and around. She even tried to pretend like she was a princess!
But eventually, it got dark outside and Jane knew it was time to end her game. She put her staff away carefully and went to bed. The end.
