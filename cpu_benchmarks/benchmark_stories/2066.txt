Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit named Benny. Benny loved to play hide and seek with his friends. One day, he found a bulb in the ground and was very enthusiastic about it. 
Benny ran to his friend, the squirrel, and said, "Look, look! I found a bulb! It's so pretty!" 
The squirrel replied, "Wow, that's great! Let's hide it so no one else takes it." 
Benny and the squirrel dug a little hole and placed the bulb inside. They covered it up with dirt and leaves, and then Benny said, "Let's play hide and seek now!" 
They played for hours, but Benny couldn't stop thinking about the bulb. When the game was over, he ran back to the spot where they had hidden it. To his delight, he saw that it had started to grow! Benny was so enthusiastic about his new plant, and he knew he would always treasure it.
