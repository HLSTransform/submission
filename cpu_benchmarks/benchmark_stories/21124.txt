Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved cookies. One day, he saw a big cookie on the table. It was so big and yummy. Tim was very happy.
Tim's mommy said, "Tim, please bring the cookie to your sister, Amy. She is not feeling well." Tim picked up the cookie and walked to Amy's room. He was a good boy and wanted to help his sister feel better.
When Tim gave the cookie to Amy, she took a bite and made a terrible face. "Yuck! This cookie is terrible!" said Amy. Tim felt sad. But then, Tim's mommy came in with a new cookie. She said, "I'm sorry, that was the wrong cookie. Here is a yummy cookie for you both to share." Tim and Amy smiled and enjoyed the yummy cookie together.
