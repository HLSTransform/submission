Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to eat waffles for breakfast. One day, she saw a big, fierce dog outside her window. The dog barked loud and scared Mia.
Mia's mommy came to see what was wrong. She saw the fierce dog too. "Don't worry, Mia. That dog can't come inside. Let's make waffles to feel better," said her mommy. They made yummy waffles and Mia started to feel happy again.
The next day, Mia saw the fierce dog again. This time, she didn't feel scared. She said, "I don't hate you, dog. I just don't like when you bark loud." The dog wagged its tail and didn't bark anymore. Mia smiled and went inside to eat her waffles.
