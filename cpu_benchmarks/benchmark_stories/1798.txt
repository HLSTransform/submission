Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy. She was 3 years old and loved playing with her friends.
One day, Lucy and her friends wanted to have a picnic at a nearby park. Everyone gathered what they needed, including a napkin for everyone to share. 
Lucy’s friend, Claire, took the napkin first. She said, “I’ll pass the napkin to you, Lucy.”
Lucy looked at the napkin. It was clear and she could see the other side. She said, “Thank you, Claire! Now I can have a bite of my sandwich.” 
Claire smiled and said, “You’re welcome, Lucy. Why don’t we take a nap after the picnic?” 
Lucy nodded eagerly and said, “Yes, please! I’m so tired already.”
And that was the end of their picnic. They all had a nice nap in the cool park and went home happy.
