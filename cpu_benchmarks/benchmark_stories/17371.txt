Lila was a little girl who liked to play in the forest. She had a red ball that she threw and caught. She had a blue hat that she wore on sunny days. She had a yellow bag that she filled with leaves and flowers.
One day, Lila went to the forest with her ball, her hat and her bag. She saw a big tree with a hole. She threw her ball into the hole and ran to get it. But when she reached the hole, she saw a pair of green eyes staring at her. She was scared and ran away.
She ran and ran until she came to a clearing. She saw a small house with a fence. She saw a woman with a basket. She saw a dog with a bone. She ran to the woman and said, "Help me, please! There is a scary thing in the forest!"
The woman smiled and said, "Don't be afraid, little girl. That is not a scary thing. That is a cat. He lives in the tree and he likes to play. He saw your ball and he wanted to play with you. He is not mean, he is lonely. He has no friends in the forest."
Lila felt sorry for the cat. She said, "Can I go back and play with him? I have a ball and a bag. Maybe he will like them."
The woman said, "Of course you can. But be careful and don't go too far. And come back before it gets dark. I will wait for you here with the dog and the basket."
Lila nodded and ran back to the forest. She found the tree and the hole. She called, "Hello, cat! I am Lila. I am sorry I ran away. Do you want to play with me?"
The cat came out of the hole and said, "Hello, Lila. I am Tom. I am sorry I scared you. I do want to play with you. You have a nice ball and a nice bag. Can I see them?"
Lila and Tom played with the ball and the bag. They shared the leaves and the flowers. They had fun and became friends. They were not lonely anymore.
