Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play at the shore, where he would build sandcastles and collect seashells. One day, Timmy met a crab who was feeling sad. 
"Why are you sad?" asked Timmy.
"I can't count all the seashells I found," replied the crab. "I feel so humble."
"Don't worry," said Timmy. "I can count them for you!" 
So Timmy and the crab counted all the seashells together. The crab was so happy that he gave Timmy a big hug. But then, a seagull swooped down and tried to steal the seashells. 
"Oh no!" cried Timmy. "We have to protect the seashells!"
So Timmy and the crab worked together to scare away the seagull. They were successful, and the seashells were safe. Timmy and the crab felt proud of themselves for working together to solve the conflict. From that day on, they became the best of friends and counted seashells together every day.
