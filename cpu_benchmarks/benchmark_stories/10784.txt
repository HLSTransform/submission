Once upon a time, there was an intelligent dog named Max. Max was a very smart dog who could do many tricks. One day, Max went for a walk in the park with his owner, a little girl named Sue.
While they were walking, they saw a muffin on the ground. Max looked at the muffin and started to tremble. He was very hungry and wanted to eat the muffin. Sue saw Max tremble and knew he was hungry, so she picked up the muffin and gave it to Max.
Max was very happy to eat the muffin. He wagged his tail and licked Sue's hand to say thank you. Sue and Max continued their walk in the park, feeling happy and full. They played together until it was time to go home. And from that day on, Max knew that Sue would always take care of him.
