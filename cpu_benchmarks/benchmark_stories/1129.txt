Once there was a seal swimming in the sea. He was a strong seal, and he loved to swim. He swam around and looked for food in the blue water.
Suddenly, he noticed a small boat. He watched it for a minute, and then he kept swimming. He kept exploring the deep ocean.
But then, he noticed something strange in the water. It was a big yellow fish! The seal was curious, so he swam closer to check it out. He was strong, and the fish didn't scare him.
Finally, the seal noticed something even stranger. It was another seal! He was surprised, but happy to see a friend. They swam together and played in the sea. They were happy and strong, and they had a great time.
