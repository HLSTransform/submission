Penny was very anxious. She was playing in the park and had been there for hours looking for something special. She didn't want to go home yet.
Suddenly, she saw a shiny penny on the ground. She was so excited! She quickly grabbed the penny and put it in her pocket.
Just then, a voice said, "Are you looking for something, Penny?"
Penny looked around, and saw a kind old man. She smiled and said, "Yes I am."
The old man chuckled softly and said, "I think I can help you. Follow me."
Penny followed the old man and soon they came to a pond filled with fish. The old man said, "See all those fish, Penny? Pick out the one you want and make a wish."
Penny said happily, "Thank you!" She grabbed the biggest fish she could find and wished for a special toy.
The old man smiled and said, "May your wish come true."
Penny thanked the old man and went home feeling very happy. She never forgot her special penny.
