Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park with their mom and dad. One day, they see a big slide. Anna wants to go first. She runs to the slide and climbs the steps. Ben follows her.
"Wait for me, Anna!" Ben says.
"No, I go first!" Anna says. She slides down very fast. She laughs and runs back to the steps.
Ben is sad. He wants to slide too. He tries to climb the steps, but Anna pushes him. He falls down and hurts his knee. He cries.
"Anna, that's not nice!" Mom says. She runs to Ben and hugs him. She puts a band-aid on his knee. "Are you okay, Ben?"
Ben nods. He still feels sad. Mom gives him a kiss.
"Anna, you need to say sorry to Ben," Dad says. He looks at Anna. She looks down. She knows she was bad.
"I'm sorry, Ben," Anna says. She goes to Ben and hugs him. "Can we be friends again?"
Ben smiles. He hugs Anna back. "Yes, we can. But can I slide too?"
"Okay, you can slide too," Anna says. "But let's take turns."
They go to the slide and take turns. They have fun. Mom and Dad watch them and smile.
After a while, they are hungry. Mom and Dad take them to a nearby cafe. They order some sandwiches and juice. They are very tasty.
"Thank you, Mom and Dad, for the tasty food," Anna and Ben say.
"You're welcome, Anna and Ben," Mom and Dad say. "We're proud of you for sharing and saying sorry."
Anna and Ben are happy. They love their mom and dad. They love each other. They are a happy family.
