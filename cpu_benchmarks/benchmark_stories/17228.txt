Once upon a time, there was a big field with lots of goats. The goats were happy and peaceful. One day, a bad man came and wanted to steal one of the goats. He waited until all the other goats were asleep and then took one away. The other goats woke up and saw that one was missing. They were sad and scared. But the next day, a kind farmer found the goat and brought it back to the field. The goats were happy again and everything was peaceful once more.
