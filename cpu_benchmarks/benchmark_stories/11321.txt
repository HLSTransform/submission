Once upon a time, there was a clever fox. He wanted to find something special, so he decided to look on the other side of the hill. When he got to the top of the hill, he snap what he'd been hoping to find - a big pile of zero's! He quickly scooped them up and ran home. When he was back in his den, he counted all the zero's. He looked so pleased - he had snap them up so quickly! 
He decided to take his zero's and hide them in a secret spot. When he finished, he put his paw up to his mouth and said, "Clever fox." That night, he went to bed a happy fox, knowing his zero's were safe!
