Bob was a big, tall man with a big, bushy mustache. All the other kids laughed at the way he organized his things. His friends tried to help him, but Bob was so harsh.
One day, Alice, a little girl, saw Bob organizing his things and said, "Let me help you, Bob!" Bob was so surprised and didn't know what to say.
Alice smiled and said, "I like your big mustache. Can I help you organize it better?"
Bob smiled and said, "Yes, I'd love your help."
So, with Alice's help, Bob organized all his things better. As they worked, Bob's friends watched and smiled.
When they were done, Bob thanked Alice and said, "You're a great helper. My mustache looks much better now!" 
Alice giggled and said, "You're welcome, Bob. Your mustache is very cool!" 
Bob smiled and said, "Thanks! Now, let's go have some fun."
