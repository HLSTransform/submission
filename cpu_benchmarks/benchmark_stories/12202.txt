Once upon a time, there was a brave hero. He had a job that was to protect the town. One day, he saw that the river was very dirty. He knew he had to do something.
So the hero let out a loud yell and asked the town to help him clean the river. Everyone came to help. They all worked together and got the river clean.
The hero said, “Thank you everyone for helping. The river looks beautiful now.”
The town cheered for the hero. They said, “You are our hero! We are so proud of you!” 
The hero smiled and said, “That makes me very happy.” 
And everyone lived happily ever after.
