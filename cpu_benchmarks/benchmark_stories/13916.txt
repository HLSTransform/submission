Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. One day, Tim went to the park to play. He saw a big hole in the ground. Tim thought it was a trap. He wanted to help his friends stay safe.
Tim kneeled down by the hole. He put a big stick across the hole. Tim said, "Now it will be easy to see the trap. My friends will not fall in."
Tim's friend, Lily, came running to the park. She saw the stick and stopped. "What is that?" she asked. Tim said, "It is a trap. I put a stick there so we do not fall in." Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, Tim. You are a good friend." They played together all day, happy and safe.
