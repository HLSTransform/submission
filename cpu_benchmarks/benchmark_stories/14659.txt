Once there was a little girl who loved to rock. She had a special rocking chair, made of wood and covered in soft wool. Each day she would sit and rock and rock, dreaming of unknown places and adventures.
One day a funny thing happened while she was rocking. Out popped a tiny mouse! He was scared but the little girl was very nice and gave him a warm woll blanket and a little bit of cheese.
The mouse was so happy he decided to stay. And each day he would come out and take a ride with the little girl when she rocked. The little girl even named him Rocker!
Rocker and the little girl were best friends and they had lots of fun together. They would rock, they would laugh, they would dream of unknown things.
It was a happy time, and the little girl and Rocker shared a special bond. And that bond was like a rock, always there and never to be forgotten.
