Once upon a time there was a little ice cream cone. It was filled with white, creamy ice cream, and it made the cone look normal. But then something strange happened. The ice cream started to melt. It oozed and dripped down the cone, and it made a big mess. The ice cream wasn't normal anymore. All that was left in the cone was a big puddle of cream!
