Once upon a time, there was a powerful dog named Max. Max had a big body and he loved to play in the water. One sunny day, Max went to the park with his best friend, a little girl named Lily.
At the park, Max and Lily found a big puddle. Max said, "Lily, let's soak in the water!" Lily laughed and said, "Okay, Max! Let's have fun!" They both jumped into the puddle and splashed around. Max's big body got all wet, and so did Lily's clothes.
After playing in the puddle, Max and Lily went home. They were both very happy and tired. Max's powerful body was still wet, so Lily's mom gave him a towel to dry off. They both had a great day at the park, and they couldn't wait to go back and play again.
