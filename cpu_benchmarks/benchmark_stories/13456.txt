Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to eat tasty treats. One day, she went to the candy store with her mom and saw a big jar of colorful gummies. She urged her mom to buy some, but her mom said no because they had already bought too much candy.
Lily was sad, but then she saw a jar of lollipops. She asked her mom if she could have one and her mom said yes. Lily was so happy and licked her lollipop as they walked home.
But then, as they were crossing the street, Lily wasn't paying attention and got hit by a car. Her mom cried and held her hand as they waited for the ambulance to come. Lily looked at her thumb, which was bleeding, and said, "Ouch." Sadly, Lily didn't survive the accident and her mom was very sad.
