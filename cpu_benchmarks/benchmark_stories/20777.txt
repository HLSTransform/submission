One day, Sally was feeling very enthusiastic. She wanted to do something special! As she looked around, she spotted a hospital down the street. She thought it might be fun to explore it, so she went inside. 
As she wandered around, Sally noticed an indoor garden. There were lots of bright plants and flowers. But then suddenly, the temperature dropped and everything started to freeze. Even Sally felt a chill! 
The hospital staff came to the rescue with thick coats and wool hats. They were so friendly and said they were used to the cold. Then they took Sally to the basement, where they had the warmest heater. 
Sally was so grateful for their help and service. As she looked around, she noticed that the basement was full of supplies for the hospital. Sally realized that her enthusiastic exploration had paid off. It had helped a very important place to stay open!
