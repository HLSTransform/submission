Once upon a time, there was a big jungle that was full of animals. Two of the animals, a seal and a bear, started to quarrel.
The seal wanted some of the bear's food, but the bear did not want to share. They quarreled and quarreled until the bear roared really loud.
Suddenly a nosy bird flew over and saw what was happening. The bird asked what the quarrel was all about and the animals told him.
The bird said that he had a special way of solving quarrels. He said that they should both move away from the area and find their own food.
The bear and the seal agreed to do this and they found lots of food in the jungle. From then, on they both lived happily and never quarreled again!
