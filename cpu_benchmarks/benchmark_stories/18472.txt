Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around outside. One day, Lily's aunt came to visit. Her aunt was very nice and brought Lily a present. It was a toy that glowed in the dark! Lily was very excited to play with it.
After dinner, Lily and her aunt played with the toy. They turned off all the lights and watched it glow. Suddenly, Lily's aunt said, "Let's peek outside and see if we can see any stars!" Lily was so happy to go outside with her aunt. They looked up at the sky and saw lots of twinkling lights.
When it was time for Lily's aunt to go home, Lily gave her a big hug. She was sad to see her go, but was happy they got to spend time together and see the pretty lights in the sky.
