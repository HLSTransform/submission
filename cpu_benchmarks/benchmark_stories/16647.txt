Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, but he didn't like cleaning them up. His mom told him that he had to clean up his toys before he could go outside and play. Timmy didn't want to clean up, but he knew he had to.
Timmy started to clean up his toys, but it was hard to resist playing with them. He wanted to keep playing, but he knew he had to follow the law of cleaning up after himself. Timmy's mom had organized his toys into different bins, so it was easier for him to put them away.
After a few minutes, Timmy had finished cleaning up and was able to go outside and play. He felt proud of himself for following the law and being organized. From then on, Timmy made sure to clean up his toys every time he was done playing with them.
