Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved animals, especially parrots. He had a pet parrot named Polly. One day, Timmy went to the park to play with his friends. While he was playing, he saw a careless boy teasing a parrot. Timmy felt sad for the parrot and decided to join in to help it.
Timmy said to the careless boy, "Stop teasing the parrot, it's not nice." The careless boy replied, "I don't care, it's just a bird." Timmy felt angry and said, "That's not true, parrots are special and they have feelings too." The careless boy didn't listen and continued to tease the parrot.
Suddenly, the parrot flew away and Timmy felt sad. He wished he could have done more to help the parrot. Timmy learned that sometimes it's hard to make people understand how important it is to be kind to animals. He went home and hugged his pet parrot Polly, promising to always take good care of her.
