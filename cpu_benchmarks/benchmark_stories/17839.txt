One day there was a little girl named Sarah. She was very careful and she had a cactus that she loved. She took good care of the cactus, because she liked for it to be happy and healthy.
One day Sarah was playing and she forgot all about the cactus. The sun was shining outside, but the cactus felt lonely and sad.
Sarah was sad too. She remembered the cactus and went outside to find it. She saw the cactus, and it was so happy to see her. Sarah thanked it for waiting for her and gave it a big hug. She promised to be more careful and never forget it again.
