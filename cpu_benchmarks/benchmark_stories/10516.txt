Once upon a time there was a little girl called Sarah who wanted a new bicycle. She asked her mum for one but her mum said "no Sarah, bicycles are too expensive". Sarah was disappointed but decided to ask her dad for one instead.
When Sarah asked her dad he said "yes", but with a condition. He said "If you can show me how much you want it, I will buy you one".
Sarah then had an idea. She decided to go outside when it was raining and get her clothes wet. Later when her dad asked her why she was wet, Sarah said "I wanted to show you how much I want a bicycle".
Her dad was very impressed and decided to buy her a bike. 
The moral of the story is that if you really want something, you should never give up. With perseverance and dedication, you can achieve anything.
