Once upon a time there was a gray umbrella. It was very special because it never seemed to end. Every morning it was there, but then it would disappear and every night it would be back.
The umbrella seemed to have a mind of its own and love to move around. Every day it went on an adventure. One day it went to the park and sailed high in the sky. Another day it flew to the beach, where it flipped and twirled in the sand.
But the umbrella had one problem. Every time it decided to stay in one place for too long, it would start to rain. And so it moved on, never finding a place to call home, never wanting to end it's fun  adventures.
The end.
