Mummy was cooking dinner for the family. Little Johnny was always very obedient, so he knew he had to be still and wait until all the food was ready before he could have any.
When dinner was ready, mummy put on the table all the delicious food. Johnny was so excited and jumped out of his chair. Mummy scolded him and said he must wear his big boy pants and sit nice and quiet. 
Johnny smiled and sat down. He knew mummy was right, so he was very obedient. He began eating his dinner and it was so yummy!
Mummy smiled and said, “Well done Johnny, you are being so good and obedient!”
