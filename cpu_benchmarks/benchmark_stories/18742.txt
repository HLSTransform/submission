Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big building with many windows. They want to go inside and see what is there.
They hold hands and walk to the door. A nice lady opens the door and smiles at them. She says, "Hello, I am Lisa. I work here. Do you want to see the elevator?" Anna and Ben nod. They do not know what an elevator is.
Lisa takes them to a big box with a door. She pushes a button and the door opens. She says, "This is the elevator. It can go up and down. Do you want to try?" Anna and Ben nod again. They are curious.
They go inside the elevator with Lisa. She pushes another button and the door closes. Anna and Ben feel the elevator move. They hear a ding. The door opens again. They see a different floor with many people and things.
Lisa says, "This is where I work. I help people with their money. Do you want to meet some of my friends?" Anna and Ben nod once more. They like to make new friends.
Lisa takes them to a desk where a thin man is sitting. He has glasses and a tie. He looks up and smiles. Lisa says, "This is Tom. He is my friend and co-worker. Tom, these are Anna and Ben. They are visiting the building. Can you say hello to them?" Tom says, "Hello, Anna and Ben. It is nice to meet you. You are very brave to ride the elevator. Do you like it?" Anna and Ben say, "Yes, we like it. It is fun and fast. Thank you for letting us see it." Tom says, "You are welcome. Do you want to see something else?" Anna and Ben say, "Yes, please."
Tom shows them his computer, his phone, his pen and his paper. He tells them what he does with them. He also gives them some stickers and candy. Anna and Ben are happy. They thank Tom and Lisa for being so kind and friendly. They say goodbye and go back to the elevator. They ride it down to the door. They wave to Lisa and go back to the park. They have had a great adventure. They tell their parents and their other friends about it. They want to go back to the big building and the elevator someday. They also want to introduce their new friends to their old friends. They think that would be fun.
