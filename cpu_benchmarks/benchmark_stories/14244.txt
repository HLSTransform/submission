Bobby was walking in the park with his parents. He saw a bell and thought it was very shiny and pretty. At first, he only wanted to look at it but then he wanted to get closer. His parents warned him to be careful and not touch anything since it was a bit filthy. 
Mentally, he made a decision to ignore the caution and he discovered the bell. He was happy and he rung it again and again. As he was doing it, he noticed that birds were flying around distracted. 
Suddenly, a flock of birds passed by and Bobby couldn't believe it. So many happy and shiny birds were flying together. Bobby found it so exciting, he was screaming with joy. His parents were also surprised and happy for all the birds that were flying around. They had discovered that the bell had attracted many birds, which were coming from different places. 
Bobby and his parents were glad to have found out how the bell had opened a way to discover all those birds. Bobby smiled and he kept ringing the bell again and again, while everyone stared and enjoyed the magical sight.
