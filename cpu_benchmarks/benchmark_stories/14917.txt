The lazy east rocket was parked in the sky. It had been so quiet and still for so long that some of the stars could barely remember its name. One day, a small alien called Bob decided to take a look inside. He wanted to be the first to lift off in this rocket and journey to never before explored parts of the universe.
Bob approached the rocket and said excitedly, “I’m going to be the first one to lift off in this rocket!” But when he tried to open the door, he discovered it wouldn’t budge. No matter how hard he pushed, it just wouldn’t move.
Bob leaned against the rocket and groaned. “What am I going to do now?” he wondered. Then he had an idea. Maybe if he got some help from the other aliens, they could lift the door together. So Bob ran back to the alien base and asked his friends if they could help him.
The other aliens were lazy, so they told Bob they would come and help him tomorrow. But when they arrived the next morning, it was too late. The rocket had rusted and broken apart, and Bob was nowhere to be found.
A sad ending indeed. All of the aliens were devastated that they were too lazy to lift the door open the day before and help Bob with his ambitious space mission.
