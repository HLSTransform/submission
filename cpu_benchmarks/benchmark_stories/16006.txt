Once upon a time there was a little boy called Todd. One day he was in the park and he saw a spinning wheel. He ran up to it, excited, and tried to spin it. But it wouldn't move.
His parent saw him and said, "Come away from there, Todd! It looks troubled."
Todd said, "But why can't I spin it?" His parent replied, "Sometimes things stop spinning when they are broken." 
So Todd and his parent went home. Todd was disappointed. On the way home, his parent said, "Maybe we can take it to the store and have it fixed." That made Todd happy.
The next day, Todd and his parent went to the store and the man in the store fixed the spinning wheel. Then Todd had lots of fun spinning the wheel. 
The end.
