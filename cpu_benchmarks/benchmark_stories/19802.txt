Once there was a little girl named Bella who loved to clean. Every day she would grab her cloth and bucket and go around cleaning everything in sight.
One day, Bella wanted to clean her big space. It was pretty big, so she was really excited to get it cleaned up. She put her cloth and bucket away and got to work.
She scrubbed the floors, dusted the walls and was careful to get into all of the corners. Soon the space looked beautiful! It was so impressive that she couldn't help but smile.
When Bella finished, her space looked so clean and tidy. She was so proud of what she had done and couldn't wait to show her mom. 
"Mom, look how clean my space is!" she shouted. Her mom smiled and said, "That looks amazing, Bella. You did an impressive job!" 
Bella was so happy and couldn't wait to show off her cleaned space to her friends.
