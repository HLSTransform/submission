Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big seesaw and ran to it. Lily climbed on one end and Ben on the other. They tried to balance the seesaw, but it was hard. Lily was lighter than Ben, so she went up and he went down.
"Ben, you are too heavy!" Lily shouted.
"No, you are too light!" Ben shouted back.
They pushed and pulled the seesaw, but it did not move much. They got bored and decided to look for something else to play with.
They saw a lady sitting on a bench. She had a bottle in her hand. She sprayed some liquid on her neck and smiled. It smelled nice. Lily and Ben were curious. They walked to the lady and said hello.
"Hello, children. What are you doing?" the lady asked.
"We were playing with the seesaw, but it was dull. What is that in your hand?" Lily asked.
"This is perfume. It makes me smell good. Do you want to try some?" the lady offered.
"Yes, please!" Lily and Ben said.
The lady sprayed some perfume on their wrists and told them to sniff. They liked the smell. It was sweet and flowery.
"Thank you, lady. You are very kind. We like your perfume. Can we play with you?" Lily and Ben asked.
"Of course, you can. I was feeling lonely. Let's play a game. How about we pretend to be animals?" the lady suggested.
"Okay, that sounds fun. What animal do you want to be?" Lily and Ben asked.
The lady thought for a moment and said, "I want to be a bird. I can fly and sing. What about you?"
Lily and Ben thought too and said, "We want to be monkeys. We can climb and swing."
They all laughed and started to act like their chosen animals. They had a lot of fun and forgot about the seesaw. They made a new friend and learned a new word. They were happy.
