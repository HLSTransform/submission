Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived on a farm with her family and their animals. One day, Lily and her brother Jack went to the barn to play. Jack said, "Let's play hide and seek!" and Lily agreed.
While they were playing, they heard a loud noise outside. They went to the door and saw a big storm coming. Lily said, "We need to pray for the storm to go away." Jack asked, "What does 'pray' mean?" and Lily explained, "It means we talk to God and ask Him to help us."
They held hands and prayed for the storm to stop. After a few minutes, the storm went away and the sun came out. Lily said, "God heard our prayer!" and Jack said, "That's amazing!"
From that day on, Lily and Jack prayed regularly and thanked God for all the good things in their lives. They also continued to play in the barn and have fun together.
