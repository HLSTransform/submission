Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. She was three years old and she was very excited to visit the temple.
Before they went to the temple, Sarah's mom reminded her to be good and behave.
Once they arrived at the temple, Sarah started exploring. She saw the warm sun and the colorful flowers. She sat on the grass and felt the warmth of the sun.
Then Sarah saw a beautiful statue of an angel. She went to the statue and asked if it could talk.
The angel said, “Yes, but first you must behave. Can you do that?”
Sarah nodded her head and said, “Yes, I can behave.”
The angel smiled and said, “Good. Now, let’s talk.”
After that, Sarah and the angel talked for a long time about the temple and everything Sarah saw. She learned lots of interesting things and thanked the angel for the warm day.
