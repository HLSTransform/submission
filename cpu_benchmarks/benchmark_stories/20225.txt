Sara and Ben are playing in the living room. They have many toys on the floor. They like to build towers with blocks and knock them down. They laugh and have fun.
"Look, Sara, I can stretch my leg very high!" Ben says. He lifts his leg and points to his knee. "This is my knee. Can you touch your knee?"
Sara tries to stretch her leg like Ben, but she falls down. She does not hurt herself, but she feels silly. "I can't stretch my leg like you, Ben. You are very good at stretching. Can you teach me?"
Ben helps Sara get up. He smiles and says, "Sure, I can teach you. It is easy. You just have to bend your knee and then straighten it. Like this." He shows Sara how to stretch his leg again.
Sara copies Ben. She bends her knee and then straightens it. She feels proud. She can stretch her leg like Ben. "I did it, Ben! I can stretch my leg too! Thank you for teaching me!"
They hug and continue to play. They are happy.
But then they hear a voice. It is Mom. She is coming to the living room. She says, "Sara, Ben, it is time to tidy up. You have made a big mess with your toys. Please put them away in the box."
Sara and Ben look at the floor. They see many toys. They know Mom is right. They have to tidy up. They say, "OK, Mom. We will tidy up. We are sorry for the mess."
They start to pick up their toys and put them in the box. They work together. They are good children. Mom is pleased. She says, "Thank you, Sara and Ben. You are very tidy. I am proud of you."
Sara and Ben smile. They are proud too. They have learned to stretch their legs and to tidy up. They have had a good day.
