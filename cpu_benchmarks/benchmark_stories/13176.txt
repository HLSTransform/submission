Once there was a little girl named Emma. She was very brave. One day, Emma's mommy told her they were going to the big mall. Emma was excited.
They went to the mall and got to the big scary elevator. Emma was a little scared. But then, mommy showed her the button to push to make the elevator go up. Emma was so excited!
The elevator went up so high and fast that Emma started to laugh. She loved it. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. It was a gun that someone had shot.
Mommy grabbed Emma and hugged her tightly. She looked around and saw that everyone was scared and running. Mommy quickly ran out of the elevator with Emma and they ran away from the mall. Emma was safe.
