Tommy was a shy little boy. He was always too scared to speak to anyone and he didn't like getting noticed. He was happy when he wasn't called attention to. 
One day, he heard some news about an increase in his town. He heard that new families were moving in, and the town was growing bigger. It made him nervous. He was scared of all the new people and all the changes that were happening. 
Tommy went to his mom and dad to ask them about the news. They explained that the increase meant that the town was growing and they would have more people and more things to do. They reassured Tommy that he wouldn't have to be intimidated by all the change. 
Tommy felt much better knowing that his parents were there for him. He was still shy, but he was able to accept that change was happening and things would be alright.
