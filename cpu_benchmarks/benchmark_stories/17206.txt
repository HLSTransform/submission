Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, her mommy asked her to prepare some cookies for their guests.
Lily was very excited and started to mix all the ingredients together. She made a big mess but her mommy helped her clean up. After they were done, they put the cookies in the oven to bake.
While waiting for the cookies to bake, Lily and her mommy decided to go for a walk. They came across an ugly frog who was trying to cross the road. Lily's mommy picked up the frog and carried it to the other side of the road.
Lily asked her mommy, "Why did you help the ugly frog?" Her mommy replied, "We should always help others, no matter how they look." When they got back home, the cookies were ready and they all enjoyed them together with their guests.
