Once upon a time there was a little girl called Sophie. She was three years old and loved to play. Every day, Sophie would go outside and look for things to add to her collection of toys.
One day, she went outside and saw a big pile of leaves. She was so excited! She put her hands in the leaves and added some to her collection. 
When Sophie was finished adding the leaves to her collection, she went to get a closer look. She was amazed. The leaves were so colourful and felt so comfortable. She just wanted to keep looking at them. 
Then, Sophie went home with her collection of leaves. She was so happy and couldn't wait to show them to her family. 
The end.
