Once upon a time, there was a girl called Lucy. She was 3 years old and loved to explore. One day, she went for a walk and saw a big tree with a branch swinging in the wind.
She looked at the branch and smiled. Then she reached up her hand and gently touched it.
"Hello!" said a voice.
Lucy looked up and saw a bird sitting on the branch.
"Hi." said Lucy.
"What are you doing here?" asked the bird.
"Exploring," said Lucy.
The bird nodded his head, then flew away. Lucy watched him go.
She looked around and saw more things to explore. She smiled and started walking. As she walked, she heard a noise.
It was a sound like a normal bird. Lucy looked around and saw a small bird. It was hopping around on the ground.
"Hi," said Lucy.
The bird stopped hopping and looked up at her. It nodded its head before flying away.
Lucy smiled and waved goodbye. Then she went back to exploring the world.
