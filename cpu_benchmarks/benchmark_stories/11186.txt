Once upon a time, there was a jolly little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy's mommy asked him to help her iron some clothes. Timmy didn't know what "iron" meant, but his mommy showed him a flat, hot thing that made clothes smooth.
While Timmy's mommy was ironing, Timmy started to gaze out the window. He saw a big, green tree with lots of leaves. Timmy thought it was so pretty! After they finished ironing, Timmy and his mommy went outside to play. Timmy ran over to the tree and gazed at it again. He loved being outside with his mommy.
