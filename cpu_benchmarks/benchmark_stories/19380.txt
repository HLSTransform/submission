Once upon a time, there was a mama bear who lived with her two cubs in a deep, dark forest. One day, they noticed a big, old tree that was broken into two parts, and mama bear knew something had to be done. She went off to find something to help put it back together. 
They waited and soon enough mama bear returned with a shiny hammer and some wood. She got to work and soon enough the tree was restored. 
But when everyone was admiring the restored tree, one of the bear cubs started acting strange. Everywhere he looked he was getting dizzy and didn't know what was wrong. Mama bear quickly took him to the doctor, and it turns out he had earache. 
The doctor gave him some medicine and he was cured. The mama bear and her cubs were so relieved. 
They thanked the doctor and went back to the restored tree, safe and happy. The end!
