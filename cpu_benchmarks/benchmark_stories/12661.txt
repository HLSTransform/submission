Once upon a time, there was a big boat that sailed on the sea. The boat had a big, shiny anchor that helped it stay in one place. One day, the captain of the boat noticed that the anchor was looking dull and dirty. He decided to polish it so it would shine again.
As the captain was polishing the anchor, he noticed something strange. The anchor started to shake and move all by itself! The captain thought it was crazy that the anchor was moving on its own.
Suddenly, the boat hit a big rock and started to sink. But because the captain had polished the anchor, it was able to hold the boat in place and keep it from sinking all the way. The anchor saved the day!
