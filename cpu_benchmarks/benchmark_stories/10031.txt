Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved hockey and he had a lot of hockey toys. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean up his toys, but Timmy didn't want to. 
"I don't want to clean up my toys," Timmy said. 
"You need to choose to be helpful and clean up your toys," Mom said. 
Timmy thought about it and decided to be helpful. He cleaned up all of his hockey toys and put them away. But later that day, Timmy's little sister came and broke all of his hockey toys. Timmy was very sad and cried a lot. 
The end.
