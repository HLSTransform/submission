Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a strong man named Tom. Tom liked to cook yummy food for all his friends. One day, Tom saw his friend, Sam, trying to clean his yard with a rake. Sam looked very tired.
Tom walked up to Sam and said, "Hi, Sam! You look tired. Can I help you with your rake?" Sam smiled and said, "Yes, please, Tom! Thank you!" So, Tom used his strong arms to help Sam clean the yard. They finished very fast.
After they finished, Tom invited Sam to his house for a yummy meal. They both enjoyed the food that Tom cooked. They were happy to help each other. The moral of the story is: when you help your friends, everyone is happy.
