Once there was a boy named Joe who wanted to buy some gum. He went to the store with his mom. When he reached the store he was so excited, he wanted to try all kinds of flavors.
Mom said, “Joe, this is not a plan. You need to be careful and only buy one!”
Joe was fearful because he had never bought gum before. “Okay, mom”, he said nervously. He slowly looked at all the flavors and eventually chose his favorite one.
He went to the counter to pay for the gum and the cashier asked, “Is this your plan, Joe?”
Joe replied, “Yes, this is my plan.”
The moral of the story is: sometimes it's best to stick to your plan. Joe was smart to listen to his mom and it was a good plan to only buy one type of gum. This made him feel better and much less fearful.
