Once there was a duck who always wanted to find the perfect place to lay her eggs. She looked far and wide, but nothing seemed quite right. Everywhere she went there was too much noise, or the ground was too hard and uncomfortable. Until one day she came upon a field of grass. It was so quiet; all she could hear was the sound of silence. She thought it would be the perfect place for her eggs.
The grass was green and lush, so she happily lay her eggs there. For days she stayed by the side of the eggs, until one day a huge storm came. It brought with it dirty rain and filthy mud. The mud and water covered the eggs, and when the storm was over all the eggs were ruined.
The duck was heartbroken. All she wanted was for her babies to hatch safely, but the storm had taken away her dream. Now all she could do was mourn in the silence of the grass.
