Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the river to play. She saw a cute otter swimming in the water. Lily said, "Hi, little otter! Can we be friends?" The otter replied, "Yes, we can be friends! Imagine all the fun we can have together!"
Lily and the otter played together all day. They swam and splashed in the water. But then, Lily accidentally stepped on a sharp rock and it hurt her foot. She started to cry. The otter asked, "What's wrong, Lily? Are you hurt?" Lily replied, "Yes, I hurt my foot. It hurts a lot."
The otter said, "Don't worry, Lily. I will help you." The otter went to find some leaves and wrapped them around Lily's foot to make it feel better. Lily was so happy that the otter helped her. She said, "Thank you, little otter. You are my best friend." And they continued to play together happily ever after.
