Once upon a time, there was a chubby little monkey who loved to swing from tree to tree. One day, while swinging on a branch, the monkey saw a big, scary tiger. The monkey was so scared that it tried to escape by running away as fast as it could.
But the tiger was too fast and soon caught up to the monkey. The monkey thought it was the end, but then it remembered that it had a secret weapon - its swinging skills! The monkey quickly swung away from the tiger and escaped to safety.
From that day on, the monkey was very careful when swinging around the jungle. It knew that swinging could be dangerous, but it also knew that it was the best way to escape from any danger.
