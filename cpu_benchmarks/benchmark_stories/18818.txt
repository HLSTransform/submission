Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play with their toys. One day, they found a big box of blocks in the basement. They decided to build a castle with the blocks. They worked hard and made a tall and strong castle.
"Look at our castle, Lily! It is so big and nice!" Tom said.
"Yes, Tom, it is. But we have to be careful. Do not destroy it!" Lily said.
They played with their castle for a long time. They pretended to be kings and queens and knights and dragons. They had a lot of fun.
But then, their mom called them. "Tom and Lily, it is time for your shower! Come upstairs, please!"
Tom and Lily did not want to stop playing. They wanted to stay with their castle. They ignored their mom.
"Tom and Lily, I am waiting for you! Come on, get ready for your shower!" their mom said again.
Tom and Lily still did not listen. They kept playing with their castle.
But then, they heard a loud noise. They turned around and saw their dog, Rex, running towards them. Rex was big and playful. He saw the castle and thought it was a toy. He jumped on the castle and destroyed it. He knocked down all the blocks and made a big mess.
"Rex, no!" Tom and Lily shouted.
They ran to their castle and tried to save it. But it was too late. Their castle was gone. They felt sad and angry.
"Look what you did, Rex! You destroyed our castle! Bad dog!" Tom said.
Lily started to cry. "Our castle was so beautiful! Why did you do that, Rex?"
Rex did not understand. He wagged his tail and licked their faces. He thought they were playing with him.
Their mom came downstairs and saw what happened. She was not happy.
"Tom and Lily, what is this? Why did you not come for your shower? And why did you make such a mess?" she asked.
Tom and Lily looked at their mom. They felt sorry. They knew they did something wrong.
"We are sorry, mom. We did not listen to you. We wanted to play with our castle. But Rex destroyed it. He did not know it was ours." Tom said.
"We are sorry, mom. We should have come for our shower. We should have put away our blocks. But we were having fun. We did not think about Rex." Lily said.
Their mom hugged them. She was not angry anymore. She was glad they were honest.
"I understand, Tom and Lily. I know you love your castle. But you have to listen to me when I call you. And you have to be careful with your toys. You have to share them with Rex. He is part of our family. He does not mean to destroy your things. He just wants to play with you." she said.
Tom and Lily nodded. They learned their lesson. They said sorry to Rex. They gave him a hug and a treat. They helped their mom clean up the mess. Then they went upstairs for their shower. They were ready to be clean and cozy.
The end.
