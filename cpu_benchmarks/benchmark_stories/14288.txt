Once upon a time, a lawyer was very eager to make money. He decided to lead a group of people to a faraway land. After a long and dangerous journey, they finally arrived at the new place. But when they got there, they realized it was not suitable to live in. The people were very sad, so the lawyer said he would help them. But instead he lead them into a trap.
The group was stuck in a dangerous situation and things began to get worse. No one knew how to get out, so the lawyer could not help them. All the people were very scared and angry at the lawyer. The lawyer wanted to leave them and run away, but the group was determined to not let him go.
In the end, the group caught the lawyer and took him to the police. The lawyer was taken away to prison for his bad behavior. The people he had lead were very sad and distrustful of lawyers forever after.
