Once upon a time there was a rich raven. The raven was happy, but he wanted more. He wanted to remove his riches, to give them to the world. So, he set off on a journey.
He passed by a deep forest, a beautiful field and a tall mountain. He kept walking until he finally found a village. The people in the village were poor, so the raven was determined to remove his riches and give them away.
He gave the villagers bags of gold, silver coins and jewels. The villagers couldn't believe their luck. They were so pleased to receive the raven's gifts.
The raven smiled when he saw how happy the villagers were. He realized that giving away what he had was the right thing to do. He flew off, content with his decision.
