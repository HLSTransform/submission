Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat yummy food. One day, she saw a cherry tree in her yard. The tree had big, red cherries on it. Lily was very happy.
Lily picked a cherry and ate it. It was so yummy! She wanted to eat more cherries. So, she picked many cherries and put them in her basket. She ate and ate until her tummy was full.
Later, Lily's tummy started to hurt. She had eaten too many cherries. Lily felt regret for eating so many. She told her mommy and mommy gave her a hug. Lily learned not to eat too many cherries at once. From that day on, she only ate a few cherries at a time and shared the rest with her friends.
