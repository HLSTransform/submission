Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to draw and write in his notebook. His notebook was tough and could handle all the scribbles and words he put in it.
One day, Timmy sat down with his notebook and started to imagine. He imagined he was a superhero, flying high in the sky and saving people. He drew a picture of himself with a big cape and a mask.
Timmy's mom came in and saw his drawing. She said, "Wow, Timmy, that's amazing! You are so creative!" Timmy smiled and felt proud of himself. He couldn't wait to imagine more and fill up his tough notebook with more drawings and stories.
