Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw on her white board with colorful markers. One day, her mom came into her room and said, "Lily, let's test out your new board. Can you draw a picture of a flower for me?"
Lily smiled and picked up her pink marker. She drew a big, beautiful flower with green leaves. Her mom was so impressed! "Wow, Lily! You're such a great artist!" she said.
Lily beamed with pride and said, "Thank you, Mommy! I love my new board. It's so much fun to draw on!" From that day on, Lily spent hours drawing on her white board and testing out new markers. She even started teaching her little brother how to draw too. They had so much fun together!
