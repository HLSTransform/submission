Lily and Sam liked to play with bubbles. They had a big bottle of bubble soap and a wand with a hole. They would dip the wand in the soap and blow through the hole. Then many bubbles would come out and float in the air.
One day, they wanted to test how big they could make the bubbles. They found a bigger wand with a bigger hole. They dipped it in the soap and blew hard. A huge bubble came out. It was bigger than their heads. It was shiny and colorful. It was beautiful.
"Wow, look at that bubble!" Lily said. "It is the biggest bubble ever!"
"Can we touch it?" Sam asked. "Will it pop?"
"I don't know. Let's try." Lily said. She reached out her hand and gently touched the bubble. It felt soft and wet. It did not pop.
"Me too!" Sam said. He touched the bubble with his hand. It did not pop either.
They smiled and laughed. They tried to touch the bubble with their noses, their elbows, their feet. The bubble did not pop. It stayed big and beautiful.
They had fun with the bubble until it floated away. They waved goodbye to the bubble. They were happy. They decided to test more bubbles. They dipped the wand in the soap and blew again. More bubbles came out. They played with the bubbles until it was time to go home. They loved bubbles.
