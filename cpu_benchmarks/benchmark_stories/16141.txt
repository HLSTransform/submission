Once upon a time there was an enormous beach. One day, a little girl and her toys zoomed to the beach. She was so excited to play! She ran towards the huge waves rolling in and out. She built sand castles with her toys and laughed as she filled them with water.
Suddenly, a giant seagull swooped down into the sand. The little girl screamed and ran away. But the seagull just wanted to join in the fun. He started flying around and zoomed over the sand.
The little girl and her toys started to chase the seagull. They ran up and down the beach, laughing and giggling as they zoomed around. The enormous beach was filling up with fun as the little girl and her toys chased the seagull.
The little girl and her toys had the best time ever. They smiled and waved goodbye to the seagull as he flew off into the sky. Then, the toys zoomed back home with the little girl. They were so happy and excited about their fun day at the beach!
