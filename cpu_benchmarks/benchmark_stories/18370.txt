Once upon a time, there was a little red ball. The ball was very independent. It liked to roll and play all by itself. One day, the ball saw a big hill. The ball hoped it could roll all the way to the top.
The ball started to roll up the hill. It rolled slowly at first, then faster and faster. It rolled past flowers and trees. The ball was happy and excited. It was getting closer to the top of the hill.
Finally, the little red ball reached the top of the hill. It looked around and saw the whole world. The ball felt proud and strong. It knew it could do anything it hoped for. And so, the little red ball rolled down the hill, ready for its next big adventure.
