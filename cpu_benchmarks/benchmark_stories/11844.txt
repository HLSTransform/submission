One day, there was a girl named Grace. Grace wanted to wash her face. She grabbed a washcloth and orange soap. She ran to the bathroom and filled the sink with warm water. She mixed the orange soap into the water and made lots of bubbles. Grace smiled as she rubbed the washcloth against her face and felt it get cleaner. After she was done washing, she put the washcloth away and felt all clean and fresh!
