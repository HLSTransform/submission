Anna and Ben are playing with blocks. They want to make a big building. They put many blocks on top of each other. They are happy.
But then, Max comes. Max is not nice. He likes to break things. He sees Anna and Ben's building. He runs to it and twists it. The blocks fall down. Anna and Ben are sad and angry.
"Max, you are stupid!" Anna shouts. "Why did you twist our building? We worked hard!"
Max laughs. He does not care. He thinks it is fun to twist things. He looks for something else to twist.
Ben has an idea. He whispers to Anna. They make a new plan. They pretend to make another building. But this time, they use sticky tape. They tape the blocks together. They make the building look weak.
Max sees the new building. He thinks it is easy to twist. He runs to it and twists it. But nothing happens. The building does not fall. The tape holds the blocks. Max is confused. He twists harder. He hurts his hand.
Anna and Ben laugh. They tricked Max. They say, "Max, you are stupid! You cannot twist our building. It is strong!"
Max is mad. He runs away. He does not want to play with them anymore.
Anna and Ben are happy. They hug each other. They keep their building. They are proud.
