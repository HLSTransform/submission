Lisa loved to take pictures with her camera. She liked to capture the colors of the flowers, the shapes of the clouds, and the smiles of her friends. She always showed her pictures to her mom, who was very compassionate and praised her for her talent.
One day, Lisa went to the park with her mom and saw a big, fluffy dog. She wanted to take a picture of the dog, but she was afraid to get too close. She asked her mom, "Can I take a picture of the dog?"
Her mom said, "Sure, but you have to ask the owner first. And be gentle and polite. The dog might be scared of strangers."
Lisa nodded and walked slowly to the owner, who was sitting on a bench. She said, "Hello, I like your dog. Can I take a picture of him?"
The owner smiled and said, "Of course, his name is Rex. He is very friendly and loves to play. You can pet him if you want."
Lisa thanked the owner and touched Rex's fur. He wagged his tail and licked her face. Lisa giggled and took out her camera. She said, "Say cheese, Rex!"
She pressed the button and heard a click. She looked at the screen and saw a beautiful picture of Rex. She was very happy and showed it to the owner. The owner said, "Wow, that's a great picture. You are very good at taking pictures. Do you want to repeat?"
Lisa nodded and said, "Yes, please. I want to take more pictures of Rex. He is so cute and fun."
The owner agreed and let Lisa repeat. She took many pictures of Rex, from different angles and poses. She had a lot of fun and made a new friend. She also learned to be brave and respectful. She couldn't wait to show her pictures to her mom, who was waiting for her with a big hug.
