Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to bake cookies with his mom. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Timmy, we're going on a journey to visit your grandma." Timmy was excited to see his grandma, but he didn't want to leave his cookies behind.
Before they left, Timmy's mom said, "Let's bake some cookies to take with us on our journey." Timmy was happy to bake cookies, and they made a big batch. They put the cookies in a jar and packed it in their bag.
On the journey, Timmy was worried that the cookies would get squished. But when they arrived at grandma's house, the cookies were still perfect. "Wow, these cookies are delicious!" said grandma. Timmy was happy that his baking had paid off. From then on, Timmy always baked cookies for their journeys.
