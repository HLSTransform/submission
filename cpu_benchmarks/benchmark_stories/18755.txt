Lily liked to paint. She had many colors of paint and a big paper. She used a brush to make shapes and lines on the paper. She was happy when she painted.
She wanted to show her mom her paint. She picked up the paper, but it was heavy. The paint was wet and made the paper heavy. Lily tried to carry the paper, but it was too heavy. She dropped the paper and the paint spilled on the floor.
Lily was sad. She made a mess. She did not want to make her mom angry. She looked for a cloth to clean the floor. She found a cloth in the kitchen. She saw her mom in the kitchen. Her mom was making food. She was serving food on plates.
Lily said, "Mom, I'm sorry. I made a mess. I wanted to show you my paint, but it was heavy and I dropped it. Can I help you clean it?"
Her mom smiled. She said, "Lily, it's okay. I'm not angry. I'm glad you like to paint. You can help me clean it later. First, let me see your paint. I'm sure it's beautiful."
She took Lily's hand and went to the living room. She saw the paper and the paint on the floor. She saw the shapes and lines that Lily made. She said, "Wow, Lily, you are a great painter. I love your paint. You used many colors and made many shapes. You are very creative."
Lily smiled. She said, "Thank you, mom. I love you. Can I help you serve the food?"
Her mom said, "Yes, you can. You are a good helper. Come on, let's go to the kitchen and serve the food. Then we can eat and talk about your paint."
They went to the kitchen and served the food. They ate and talked. They were happy. They cleaned the floor together. They hung the paper on the wall. They hugged and kissed. They said, "We love to paint. We love to serve. We love each other."
