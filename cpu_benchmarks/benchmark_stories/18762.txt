Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys. Anna has a big doll. Ben has a small car. They want to play with each other's toys.
"Can I play with your doll?" Ben asks Anna.
"Can I play with your car?" Anna asks Ben.
They look at each other. They think. They want to be kind. They want to have fun.
"Let's share!" they say together. They smile. They give each other their toys. They play with them nicely. They are happy.
They see a star in the sky. It is bright and shiny. They remember what their mom told them.
"If you see a star, you can make a wish. But you have to be wise. You have to wish for something good."
They close their eyes. They make a wish. They open their eyes. They tell each other their wish.
"I wish for more toys to share with you," Ben says.
"I wish for more friends to play with us," Anna says.
They hug each other. They are good friends. They are wise. They hope their wish comes true.
