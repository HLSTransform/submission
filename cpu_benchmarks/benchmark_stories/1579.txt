Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play in the park. One day, she found a skull on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her friends. They were surprised and scared.
Lily's mom saw what was happening and told them to be careful with the skull. She explained that it was not a toy and that they should not touch it. She also told them that it was important to respect the things they found in nature.
Lily and her friends learned an important lesson that day. They understood that they should be careful and respectful when exploring the world around them. They also learned that sometimes things can surprise us, but it is important to stay calm and make good choices.
