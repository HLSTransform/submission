Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to ride his bike all around the park. One day, Timmy's mommy took him to the airport to see a famous plane. Timmy was so excited to see the big plane with its wings and wheels. 
Timmy and his mommy went inside the plane and they sat down on the seats. The plane started to move and Timmy felt like he was riding his bike, but up in the sky! Timmy looked out the window and saw the clouds and the sun. 
After a while, the plane landed and Timmy and his mommy got off. Timmy was so happy that he got to ride on a famous plane. He couldn't wait to tell all his friends about his adventure in the sky!
