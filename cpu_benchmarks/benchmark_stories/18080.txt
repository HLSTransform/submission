Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to play basketball. He was a good player and loved to shoot the ball into the hoop. One day, he went to the park to play with his friends. It was a hot day and the sun was shining bright.
Timmy's friend, Johnny, came up to him and asked, "Hey Timmy, can I play too?" Timmy said, "Sure, but we need to squeeze the ball to make sure it's not too flat." They squeezed the ball and started to play. Timmy was happy to have his friend playing with him.
After a while, Timmy's team was winning and Johnny was getting upset. He said, "It's not fair, you guys are too good." Timmy replied, "Don't worry, it's just a game. Let's keep playing and have fun." Johnny felt better and they continued to play until the sun went down. They were tired but happy, and Timmy felt lucky to have such a great friend to play with.
