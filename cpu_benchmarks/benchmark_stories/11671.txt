Dennis and his mom were walking down the street when they spotted a cat. It was a fast cat. Dennis was so excited. 
He asked his mom, "Can I lay with it? Please, Mama, can I lay with it?"
His mom said, "No, Dennis. We can't be too close." 
But Dennis didn't listen and he moved closer to the cat. He slowly reached out so he could lay with it. But before he could do it, the cat ran away. Dennis was so sad because he wanted to lay with it so badly. 
He started to cry, and said to his mom, "It was too fast, Mama! I wanted to lay with it." 
His mom hugged him and said, "I'm sorry, Dennis. Maybe next time." 
But there won't be a next time. The cat was gone, and Dennis will never lay with it.
