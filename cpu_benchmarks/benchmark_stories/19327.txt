Once upon a time there was a little boy named Joe. Joe loved to dig and play in his garden. He wanted to plant some flowers in the soil. So, one day he went out to the garden with his shovel to dig. He dug and dug and dug and dug until he had made a little hole in the soil. Joe started to plant the flower and he patted the soil softly until it was nice and cozy.
Joe stood up and looked at his work. He smiled proudly at his little flower. He said, "I did it! I planted the flower." He knew he would have to water it everyday so it could grow big and strong.
But then something strange began to happen, the flower started to get bigger and bigger. Every day it would get a little bigger. Joe was very excited and couldn't wait to see what flower it would be. 
One day, Joe was out in the garden and he was amazed! The little flower had turned into a big, beautiful flower! Joe smiled and said, "It's so pretty!" He was so happy that he had watched the flower grow and he even took a photo of it to remember it. From then on, Joe was always in the garden taking care of his little flower.
