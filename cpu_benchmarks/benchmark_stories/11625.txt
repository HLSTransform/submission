John was walking with his mum. They were outside and the sky was blue. John looked up and noticed an aeroplane. His mum said he could go over and look closer. He thought that sounded easy so he ran over. When he was close he saw the aeroplane flying high in the sky. He wanted to touch it! He started to jump as high as he could, but he couldn't reach it. Suddenly, he lost his balance and he fell over and hurt his arm. He had tears in his eyes and his mum hugged him tightly. They had to go to the hospital to make it better. John did not get to touch the aeroplane and it was not an easy ending.
