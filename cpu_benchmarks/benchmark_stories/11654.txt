One day, Molly and her dad joined hands and went to the park. Molly was so excited to play in the park.
When they arrived, Molly saw something that made her even more excited - a big box full of colorful chalk. She quickly joined in to draw some pictures on the sidewalk.
Molly used different colors to draw a tree and a rainbow. But the most exciting thing was the purple chalk. She drew a big purple sun in the sky.
Molly was so happy and proud of what she had created. But then the wind started blowing and started to ruin her chalk drawings. Molly tried her best to save them, but it was too late.
Molly became so sad that she started crying. Dad hugged her and said: "It's ok, Molly. We can try again." But Molly was too upset and she wished that her purple chalk drawings could stay with her forever.
