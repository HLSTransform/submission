Sam and Lily were playing in the yard. They liked to run and jump and laugh. They saw a big chicken coop near the fence. They wanted to see the chickens.
"Let's go look at the chickens!" Sam said.
"OK!" Lily said.
They ran to the coop and peeked inside. There were many chickens. Some were white, some were brown, some were black. They made loud noises. They flapped their wings. They pecked the ground.
Sam and Lily stared at the chickens. They were curious and excited. They wanted to touch them.
"Can we pet the chickens?" Lily asked.
"I don't know," Sam said. "Maybe they will bite."
He reached out his hand slowly. He touched a white chicken. It was soft and warm. He smiled.
Lily reached out her hand too. She touched a brown chicken. It was also soft and warm. She smiled.
But then, something happened. The brown chicken did not like to be touched. It squawked and snapped at Lily's hand. It scratched her with its claws.
"Ow!" Lily cried. "The chicken hurt me!"
She pulled back her hand. It was bleeding. She was scared and sad. She ran to Sam.
Sam saw Lily's hand. He was shocked and sorry. He hugged her.
"Are you OK?" he asked.
"No," Lily said. "The chicken was mean. It made me bleed."
Sam looked at the chicken. It was still squawking and flapping. It looked angry. He was angry too.
He picked up a stick. He threw it at the chicken. He wanted to make it stop.
But the stick missed the chicken. It hit the coop. It made a loud noise. It broke the latch.
The coop door swung open. The chickens saw the opening. They saw Sam and Lily. They saw a chance to escape.
They ran out of the coop. They ran towards Sam and Lily. They ran past them. They ran into the yard.
Sam and Lily watched in horror. They saw the chickens running free. They saw them going everywhere. They saw them making a mess.
They heard a voice. It was Mom. She was coming out of the house. She saw the chickens. She saw the coop. She saw Sam and Lily.
She was wide-eyed. She was shocked and angry. She shouted.
"Sam! Lily! What have you done?"
