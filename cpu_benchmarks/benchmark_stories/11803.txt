Once upon a time there was a very serious bulb. It seemed so sad all the time. All of the other bulbs in the room were laughing and having fun. They asked the serious bulb, "Why don't you come play with us?" But the serious bulb just shook his head. He said, "I can't. I'm too serious for that." 
The other bulbs didn't understand. One of them said, "You don't have to be so serious all the time. It can be fun to play!" But the serious bulb just shook his head again. He said, "It's no use. I just can't be happy." 
Then, a curious thing happened. One of the bulbs started to laugh. Soon, all of the other bulbs were laughing too. The serious bulb began to smile, and before he knew it, he was laughing too! 
From then on, the serious bulb always remembered to take breaks from his serious thoughts and laugh with his friends. It was a lot of fun!
