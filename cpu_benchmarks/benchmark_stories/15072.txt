One day, a little girl named Daisy was walking around her garden with eyes full of curiosity. She noticed something peeking from behind the curtain. She kneeled down to take a closer look and saw a beautiful butterfly. She was so fascinated by its bright colors that she started to admire it from a distance.
Suddenly, she heard a loud voice coming from the other side of the curtain. It belonged to Jack, Daisy's older brother.
"Ah, Daisy! I was looking for you. Come and see what I'm doing!" Jack said.
Daisy obeyed and walked towards Jack. As she stepped closer, she could see that he was holding and admiring a brand new toy car. Daisy's eyes widened with delight and she kneeled down to get a better look at the car.
"Oh! It looks so pretty, Jack," Daisy said admiringly.
Jack smiled and said, "You can join me if you want. I'll share it with you, Daisy."
Daisy was overjoyed. Jack had never been so generous with his toys. A feeling of jealousy started to rise within Daisy, but she decided to stay quiet and enjoy the moment. Little did Daisy know, Jack had a surprise prepared that would make her shockingly jealous.
