Once there was a bald man who liked to paint roads. Every day he would get up early and find a road to paint. He would start at one end and make sure to paint everything completely. He'd even paint the curbs and poles. 
The bald man enjoyed his work. He liked the smell of the paint and seeing the roads in bright colors. One day, he was painting a road when a little girl on her tricycle stopped to watch. She was fascinated by the bald manâ€™s hard work.
After he was done, the little girl asked if she could help paint the road. The bald man said yes and handed her a brush. She was so excited as she painted the road with him. It was a beautiful sight to see bright colors on an otherwise gray road. 
When they were done, the little girl thanked the bald man and went on her way. He was so happy that he had shared this special moment with her. Now, the bald man and the little girl will always remember the day that they painted the road together.
