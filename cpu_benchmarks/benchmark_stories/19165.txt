One day, a big dog and a small cat were walking in the park. The sky was gray and it looked like rain. The dog said, "We should find a shelter before it rains." The cat said, "I saw a fine shelter near the big tree."
They walked to the big tree and saw the fine shelter. But when they got there, a big bird was sitting in the shelter. The dog said, "We need this shelter. Can you please go?" The big bird said, "No, I was here first."
The dog and the cat were sad. They did not want to get wet. Then, the small cat had an idea. "Let's all sit in the shelter together!" The big bird agreed. So, the big dog, the small cat, and the big bird all sat in the fine shelter. They stayed dry and became good friends.
