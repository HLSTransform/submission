Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in their room. They have many toys, but their favorite is a big train. The train is modern. It can make sounds and lights. It can go fast or slow.
One day, Sara and Ben want to play with the train. But they cannot find the remote. The remote is what makes the train move. They look under the bed, in the closet, and in the drawers. They cannot find the remote anywhere.
"Where is the remote?" Sara asks Ben.
"I don't know," Ben says. "Maybe we lost it."
Sara feels sad. She loves the train. She hopes they can find the remote soon. She puts her thumb in her mouth. She does that when she is sad or scared.
Ben sees Sara's thumb. He knows she is sad. He wants to make her happy. He thinks hard. He has an idea.
"Hey, Sara," he says. "We don't need the remote. We can play with the train without it."
"How?" Sara asks. She takes her thumb out of her mouth.
"Look," Ben says. He picks up the train. He makes sounds with his mouth. He makes the train go around the room. He makes the train stop and go. He makes the train say "choo-choo".
Sara smiles. She thinks Ben is funny. She picks up another train. She makes sounds with her mouth too. She makes the train follow Ben's train. She makes the train say "hello".
Sara and Ben play with the trains for a long time. They forget about the remote. They have fun. They are happy.
