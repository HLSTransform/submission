Once upon a time there was a mighty sea. The sea was so big even grown-ups were scared of it! One day a brave little girl decided to go and explore the sea. She went with her bucket and spade in her hand.
The little girl made her way to the beach. The sea was very blue, and she could see fish swimming underneath. The little girl smiled, and started to play. She splashed in the water, and made big waves.
Then she noticed something even bigger in the sea. It was a mighty whale! The whale was huge and made big splashes when it surfaced. The little girl was amazed and started to laugh.
The whale liked the little girl and they started to play together. The whale splashed and jumped around, and the little girl laughed and cheered. They played until it was dark.
Finally, the little girl went back home. She was tired from her fun day playing with the mighty whale. She knew she'd come back one day to see her new friend!
