Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun and the grass. One day, her mommy told her they were going on a picnic. Lily was so excited!
They packed a basket with yummy sandwiches, juicy fruits, and cold drinks. They found a nice spot under a big tree and spread out a blanket. They ate their lunch and played games. But then, the clouds started to get dark and the wind started to blow.
Lily's mommy said, "We need to pack up and go home before it rains. We don't want to get wet." So, they quickly put everything away and got in the car. Just as they left, the rain started to pour down. But Lily was happy because she was dry and she knew they would stay safe and warm at home.
