Once upon a time there was a little girl called Maria. She was three years old and full of energy. Maria loved to explore new places.
One weekend, Maria was playing in the garden. Suddenly, she noticed something unknown. She saw a strange box deep in the grass. Maria was curious. She wanted to add the box to her collection of treasures. 
She opened the box and looked inside. To her surprise, there was nothing there except an old piece of paper. Maria was excited and decided to take it home.
When she showed her parents the paper, they explained it was the deed to an old house that was abandoned many years ago. They told Maria it was hers if she wanted it.
Maria was delighted, she couldn't believe that the old house was hers. She said to her parents, "Can we add it to our home?"
Her parents smiled and said, "Yes, Maria, you can add it to your home in a week."
The next week, Maria and her parents drove to the unknown house. When they arrived, the old house looked different. They had added new windows and doors and it looked like a brand new home. 
Maria and her parents were excited and happy. They added the old house to their home and began their new adventure.
