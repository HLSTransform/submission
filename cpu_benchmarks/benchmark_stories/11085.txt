Lily and Ben are in the car with Mom. They are going to the park. But there is a lot of traffic on the road. The cars are moving very slowly. Lily and Ben are bored.
"Mom, why are there so many cars?" Lily asks.
"Because it is a busy time of the day. Many people are going to work or school or other places. They have important things to do," Mom says.
"Can we play a game?" Ben says.
"Sure, what game do you want to play?" Mom says.
"Let's play count the cars. We can take turns to count how many cars we see of each color. I start with red. One, two, three, four, five red cars!" Ben says.
"Good job, Ben. Now it's my turn. I choose blue. One, two, three, four, five, six blue cars!" Lily says.
They keep playing the game until they reach the park. They see many cars of different colors. They have fun counting them. They learn some new numbers. Mom is happy that they are not bored. She says they are very smart. Lily and Ben smile. They like to count. They like to play. They like to go to the park.
