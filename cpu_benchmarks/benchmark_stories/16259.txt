Mommy and Daddy were so proud of Timmy. Every day, Timmy would get up and go to his room to study. He would take his board and sit at the table. He would look at his board and ask questions to himself.
Mommy and Daddy knew that studying was very important and they wanted Timmy to be healthy. So they encouraged Timmy to study every day.
One day, Timmy finished his work and Mommy said, "Good job, Timmy! You worked so hard! You are so smart and so healthy." 
Timmy was so proud of himself. He smiled and said, "I'm going to keep studying every day!" Mommy and Daddy were so proud of him and hugged him tightly. 
From that day onwards, Timmy kept studying every day. He was so proud of himself for being healthy and smart.
