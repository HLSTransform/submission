Once there was a brave fish who lived in a tank filled with water. Every day he would go out and explore the world around him. He was always so curious and wanted to learn more.
One day he decided to go on a very special adventure. He swam out of the tank and into the dry air. It was a very strange feeling as the water dried up from his scales. He started to worry that he would become dry too, but then he remembered he was brave.
So he kept swimming. He swam around until he found a big, beautiful lake. He saw other fishes swimming in the lake and knew he had made the right choice.
He swam until he was filled with joy. He was so glad that he was brave enough to explore the unknown. He returned to the tank, happy and still a little wet from his adventure.
