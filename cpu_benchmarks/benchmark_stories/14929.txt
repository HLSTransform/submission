Once there was a happy bee named Buzz. Buzz was a very mild bee- he liked taking his time and appreciating the simple things. Buzz was flying along one day when he saw something new. He looked closely and he recognized it was a flower. It was a bright yellow flower- Buzz was amazed! He went closer to investigate.
Suddenly, Buzz heard a voice. It said "hello there, little bee!". Buzz looked around and he saw a 3 year old child. He couldn't believe it- children could talk! He said hello back to the child and the child said "I recognize you- you're Buzz the bee! Can you show me what a bee does?".
Buzz said sure and he flew around showing off all his bee tricks. He could fly in zig zags, circles and even spirals. The child was amazed and kept saying "wow!" as he watched Buzz.
When it was time to go, the little child waved goodbye to Buzz and said "Bye Buzz! We'll always remember you". Buzz waved back with a big smile on his mild bee face.
