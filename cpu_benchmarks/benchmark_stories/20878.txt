Once there was an old house that needed to be repaired. The owners called a repairman to help them. 
When the repairman arrived, he saw that the drain needed to be fixed. He asked the owners if they had the available tools to repair it. 
The owners shook their head, "No. We don't have anything."
The repairman smiled and said, "No worries. I have the tools necessary for this job. I can definitely repair it for you."
After some hard work, the drain was repaired. The owners thanked the repairman very much. They danced around and sang, "The drain is repaired! The drain is repaired!"
From that day on, the owners were always prepared when it came to repairing things. They kept tools available, just in case!
