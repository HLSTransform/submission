Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her friends at the park. One day, they decided to have a race. Lily ran as fast as she could and she won the race! Her friends clapped and said, "Wow, Lily, you are so fast!"
After the race, Lily's mom came to the park with a soft gift for her. It was a new teddy bear. Lily hugged the bear and said, "Thank you, Mommy! It's so soft!" 
As Lily was playing with her new teddy bear, she noticed that her friend, Emily, didn't win the race. Emily was sad and Lily didn't want her friend to feel bad. So, she gave her teddy bear to Emily and said, "Here, you can have my soft teddy bear as a gift. You are still a winner in my eyes." 
The moral of the story is that it's not always about winning. Sometimes, it's about being kind and sharing with others.
