One day, a little boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, went for a walk. They came to a place where they had to choose which way to go. There were two paths. One path was dark and scary. The other path was bright and happy. Tim was scared of the dark path, but Spot wanted to go that way.
Tim said to Spot, "I am scared of the dark path. Let's take the happy path." Spot looked at Tim and then at the happy path. Spot agreed, and they took the happy path. As they walked, they saw pretty flowers and big trees. Tim and Spot were having fun.
Soon, they came to a turn in the path. Tim and Spot went around the turn and saw a big surprise. There was a fun park with slides and swings! Tim and Spot played all day. They were very happy they chose the happy path and not the scary one.
