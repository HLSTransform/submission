Once there was a patient named Pam. Pam was very crazy. She liked to ask lots and lots of questions. One day, she asked her friends, "Let's go to the park!" They all said, "Yes, let's go!" So they went to the park, and they had so much fun.
At the park, Pam asked her friends to play tag. Everyone said, "Yes, let's play!" So they played tag for a long time. Pam asked her friends if they wanted to have a snack. Everyone said, "Yes, let's have a snack!" So they ate lots of yummy snacks. 
Next, Pam asked her friends to climb the trees. Everyone said, "Yes, let's climb the trees!" They had so much fun climbing the trees and making crazy shapes with their arms and legs. 
When it was time to go home, Pam asked her friends if they had a good time. Everyone said, "Yes, we had a great time!" So they all hugged and said goodbye. Pam was so happy and thanked her friends for being so patient with her and having such a fun time.
