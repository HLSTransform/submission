Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat fruit, especially apples and bananas. One day, Timmy's mom brought home a big, gray watermelon. Timmy had never seen a gray fruit before!
"Wow, Mommy! What kind of fruit is that?" Timmy asked.
"It's a watermelon, Timmy," his mom replied.
Timmy took a bite of the watermelon and it was so juicy and delicious that he shouted with joy, "Yummy!"
His mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it, Timmy." From that day on, gray watermelon became Timmy's favorite fruit.
