Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved to whistle. She thought it was so much fun that she wanted to whistle all the time.
One day, she saw a pretty chair and she wanted to sit and whistle. She hopped up onto the chair and she started whistling. It sounded so pretty! She wanted to whistle louder and longer.
She kept on whistling and hopping around on the chair. She didn't want to leave the chair, she was having too much fun. But after a little while, her mom called her and told her it was time for dinner.
So the girl stopped whistling and hopped down from the chair. She said goodbye to the chair and skipped off to have dinner. She was still whistling as she went!
