Once upon a time, there were two friends called Andy and Brooke. Andy was taller than Brooke.
One day, they were playing outside in the sun and they got very hot. Andy said to Brooke "It's too hot out here, let's go inside". 
So they went inside and sat down at the kitchen table. Brooke said "What shall we do now?".
Andy said "Let's make some apple pies for us to eat!" 
So Brooke started cutting the apples with her knife and Andy put the apples in the bowl. 
Then Andy put some sugar, cinnamon and butter into the bowl and stirred it all together. 
After that, he rolled out the pastry and Brooke put it in the pie dish. 
Then Andy poured the apple mix into the dish and he put some pastry leaves on top. 
Finally, he put the pie dish in the oven and said "It will be done in 15 minutes."
15 minutes later Andy took the pie out of the oven and said "The apple pie is finished. Let's eat it while it's still warm!" 
So they both ate the pie and it was delicious. The end!
