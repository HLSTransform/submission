Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her favorite necklace. It had a shiny loop that sparkled in the sun. One day, Lily was playing outside when she accidentally dropped her necklace. She searched and searched, but she couldn't find it anywhere.
Lily was sad because she loved her necklace so much. She asked her friends to help her look for it, but they couldn't find it either. Lily looked and looked until the sun started to set. She was tired and her face was pale from all the searching.
Just when she was about to give up, Lily's little brother came over and said he found her necklace. He had seen it drop from her pocket earlier and picked it up. Lily was so happy and hugged her brother tightly. She learned to be more careful with her favorite necklace and never let it drop again.
