Once upon a time, there was a giant. He was so big that he filled up the entire sky. All the people who lived nearby were fascinated by the giant, and they wanted to see him up close.
One day, a brave boy named Jimmy decided to take a closer look. He put on his raincoat and boots so he wouldn't get wet, and he headed towards the giant.
When Jimmy got there, he examined the giant very carefully. He looked at the huge feet, and he touched the enormous hands. Jimmy was amazed by how big and strong the giant was!
Suddenly, it started raining. Jimmy's raincoat and boots kept him dry, but the giant wasn't so lucky. As the rain soaked him, the giant began to shrink until he was tiny enough to fit in Jimmy's pocket.
Jimmy couldn't believe it! He examined the tiny giant in his hand, then put him back in his pocket and ran home. Jimmy had seen an amazing thing that day â€“ a wet giant that could fit in his pocket.
