Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park, but one day she saw a big dog with a fearful face. It made her scared and she didn't want to play anymore.
The next day, Lily decided to go back to the park. She saw the big dog again, but this time it was on a leash with its owner. The owner saw Lily looking scared and said, "Don't worry, my dog is friendly." 
Lily was hesitant, but the owner encouraged her to come closer. As she got closer, the dog started to wag its tail and loop around Lily's legs. She felt happy and safe, and even started to clap her hands in excitement.
From that day on, Lily wasn't afraid of the big dog anymore. She would always go to the park and play with the dog, and they became the best of friends.
