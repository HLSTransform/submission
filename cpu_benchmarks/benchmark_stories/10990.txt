Lily and Tom were two playful goats who lived in a valley with their mother. They liked to jump and run on the hills and eat the green grass. One day, they saw a big tent near the river. They were curious and wanted to see what was inside.
They ran to the tent and peeked through a hole. They saw a man and a woman who were cooking something on a fire. They smelled something yummy and their mouths watered. They heard the man say, "This soup will serve us well for dinner. It has carrots and potatoes and beans."
Lily and Tom wanted to taste the soup. They thought the man and the woman would not mind if they had a little sip. They waited until the man and the woman went to fetch some water from the river. Then they sneaked into the tent and found the pot of soup. They dipped their noses into the pot and slurped the soup.
But the soup was very hot and spicy. It burned their tongues and made them cough. They ran out of the tent, bleating and crying. The man and the woman heard the noise and came back. They saw the goats and the spilled soup and were angry.
"Hey, you naughty goats! You ruined our dinner! Go away and don't come back!" the man shouted.
Lily and Tom felt sorry and ashamed. They ran back to their mother and told her what they had done. Their mother scolded them and said, "You should not take what is not yours. You should respect other people's things. You should say sorry to the man and the woman and offer to help them."
Lily and Tom nodded and agreed. They went back to the tent and apologized to the man and the woman. They offered to help them clean the mess and find some more food. The man and the woman forgave them and thanked them. They shared some bread and cheese with them and invited them to stay for the night.
Lily and Tom learned their lesson and became friends with the man and the woman. They enjoyed the warm tent and the cozy fire. They slept well and dreamed of more adventures in the valley.
