Once upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a beautiful palace. She had a pet cat named Mittens who loved to play with her. One day, the princess wanted to play hide and seek with Mittens. She told Mittens to lie down and close his eyes while she hid. 
The princess ran around the palace looking for a good hiding spot. She found a big closet and crawled inside. It was dark and quiet in there. She waited for Mittens to find her. 
After a while, the princess started to get bored. She peeked out of the closet and saw Mittens sleeping on a pillow. She giggled and thought to herself, "Mittens must be really bad at this game!" She tiptoed over to him and whispered, "Wake up, Mittens! You're supposed to find me!" 
Mittens opened his eyes and meowed. The princess picked him up and hugged him. She was happy to have such a cute and cuddly friend. They went back to playing together in the beautiful palace.
