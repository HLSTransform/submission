Mia looked out of the window and saw a big jeep park in the driveway of her house. She was so excited to see it! Mia ran outside to take a closer look. She saw a man and a woman getting out of the jeep.
Mia felt helpless when the man and the woman did not look at her or acknowledge her presence. She did not know why they were here. But then she heard the man and woman laughing, so she decided to be brave and went up to them.
She asked them why they were here and the woman said, "We've come to take you for a ride in our jeep!" Mia was so happy and excited! She quickly grabbed her bag, said goodbye to her mom and hopped into the back seat of the jeep.
The man and woman smiled at Mia as they drove off in the jeep. Mia had the best time of her life and when it was time to go home moments later she was so sad. She waved goodbye to her new friends as they drove away in the jeep, promising to meet them again soon.
