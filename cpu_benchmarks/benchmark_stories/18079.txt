Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her drum every day. One day, Lily's mom told her that she needed to take a nap because she looked very sleepy. Lily didn't want to take a nap because she wanted to play with her drum.
Lily's mom said, "If you take a nap now, you will have more energy to play with your drum later." Lily didn't want to take a nap, but she listened to her mom and went to sleep.
When she woke up, she felt much better and had more energy to play with her drum. She played and played, and finally, she succeeded in playing her favorite song. She was so happy and proud of herself!
Lily's mom heard her playing and said, "Wow, you sound great! I'm so proud of you for practicing and succeeding in playing your drum." Lily smiled and hugged her mom, feeling very happy and accomplished.
