Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy lived in a field with lots of wheat. He loved to eat the wheat because it was his favorite food. One day, Timmy noticed that the wheat was growing taller and taller. He was so happy because that meant there would be more wheat for him to eat.
As the days went by, the wheat continued to increase in size. Timmy was getting very excited because he knew there would be a lot of wheat for him to eat soon. Finally, the wheat was ready to be picked and Timmy started to collect as much as he could. He was so furry with all the wheat in his little mouse house.
Timmy was very happy that he had so much wheat to eat and he knew that he would never go hungry again. He loved living in the field and was grateful for all the delicious food that grew there.
