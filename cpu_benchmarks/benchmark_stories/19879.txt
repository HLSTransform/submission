Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweety. Tweety had a pretty feather on her head. She loved to fly high in the sky and sing songs. One day, Tweety woke up feeling dizzy. She tried to fly, but she couldn't. 
Tweety's friend, a kind squirrel named Nutty, saw her struggling. Nutty asked, "What's wrong, Tweety?" Tweety replied, "I feel dizzy and can't fly." Nutty said, "Don't worry, I'll help you." 
Nutty went to find some food for Tweety to eat. He found some nuts and gave them to her. After eating, Tweety felt better, but she was still too dizzy to fly. Nutty said, "Let's delay flying for today. We can play games and have fun together." Tweety smiled and thanked Nutty for being such a good friend.
