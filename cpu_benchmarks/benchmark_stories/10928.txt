Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to run and race in the park. One day, Max saw a big bone on the ground. He was so happy and ran to get it, but then he saw a big, scary dog. Max was fearful and didn't want to lose his bone, so he ran away as fast as he could.
Max ran and ran until he saw his friend, Lily the cat. "What's wrong, Max?" asked Lily. "I saw a big, scary dog and I was so fearful," said Max. "I didn't want to lose my bone, so I ran away."
"Don't be afraid, Max," said Lily. "I'll help you get your bone back. We can race to the bone and get it before the big dog does."
Max was so happy to have Lily's help. They raced to the bone and got it before the big dog could get there. Max was so thankful to have such a good friend like Lily.
