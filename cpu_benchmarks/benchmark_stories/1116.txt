Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lola. She had beautiful, long, light hair.
One day, Lola wanted to record a video of her special haircut. She didn't have enough light to see the video, so she asked her mum to turn on the light.
When Lola saw the light, she started to record the video. Her mum cut her hair till it was nice and short. When she was finished recording the video, she gave the camera to her mum.
Lola looked in the mirror and was so happy with her new haircut. From that day on, Lola always wanted to record videos of her new haircuts.
The End
