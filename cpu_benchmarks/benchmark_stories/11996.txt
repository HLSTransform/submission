Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had to choose what to wear for her school. She didn't know what to wear, so she asked her mom. Her mom told her to wear her favorite dress. Lily was happy and put on her dress.
At school, Lily's teacher gave a lecture about being kind to others. Lily listened carefully to the lecture and promised to be kind to everyone. But when she went outside to play, she saw a poor boy sitting alone. Lily didn't want to play with him and chose to play with her friends instead.
The poor boy felt sad and lonely. He wished someone would be kind to him. Later that day, Lily's friends left her and she felt sad too. She remembered the lecture and wished she had been kind to the poor boy. She went to find him, but he was already gone. Lily felt very bad and wished she had made a different choice.
