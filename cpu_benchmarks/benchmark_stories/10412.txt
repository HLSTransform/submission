Once there was a nosy monkey. He always wanted to know what other animals were doing. One day, he saw a bird building a nest. He watched for a while and wanted to help. He started adding twigs to the nest. The bird became angry and said, "Go away! This is my nest!" The monkey was embarrassed and felt sad.
But then he heard the bird asking for help and said, "Why don't you stay here and finish the nest? I will look after it." The monkey smiled and said, "I will stay and help you." The monkey worked hard, and soon the nest was finished. The bird thanked him and said, "You are a very helpful monkey!" The nosy monkey smiled and said, "It's my pleasure!" They both hugged and laughed.
