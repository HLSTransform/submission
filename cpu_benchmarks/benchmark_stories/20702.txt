Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to succeed. Every day she tried her best, but she just couldn't seem to get it right. She started to feel very sad.
One day, she got a special present. It was a lovely high vest. She put it on and felt so proud. The vest made her feel so brave and strong.
She decided that now was her chance and gave it her all. She put her head down and worked hard. Then, finally she did it! She had succeeded.
The little girl celebrated so much. She was so happy that she had succeeded. She wore her high vest every day for a long time afterwards, to remind her of her success.
