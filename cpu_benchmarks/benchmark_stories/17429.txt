Anna and Ben are twins. They like to learn new things. Today, they go to a place with many animals. It is a zoo.
"Look, Anna, a big cat!" Ben says. He points to a lion. The lion has a mane and a tail. He roars loud.
"I like the big cat. He is strong and brave," Anna says. She claps her hands. She wants to pet the lion, but Mom says no.
They see more animals. They see a monkey, a zebra, a giraffe, and a penguin. They learn their names and sounds. They have fun.
But soon, they feel sleepy. They yawn and rub their eyes. Mom says it is time to go home.
"Can we come back to the zoo?" Anna asks.
"Of course, sweetie. We can come back another day," Mom says.
She hugs them and takes them to the car. They fall asleep on the way. They dream of the animals. They are happy.
