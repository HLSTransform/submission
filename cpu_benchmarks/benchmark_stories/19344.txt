Once there was a fat cat. She woke up one morning and went for a walk. As she went along, the cat spotted the most beautiful ornament. She had to have it! 
The cat went over to the ornament and investigated. It was so sparkly and pretty. The cat decided to take it home with her. 
She finally made it back with the ornament. When she arrived, the cat was so happy with her new item. She set it down in the corner and fell asleep. 
The next morning, the cat woke up and looked at her ornament. She remembered the adventure she had gone on and how she had gotten the ornament. The cat was happy and went back to sleep. 
The end.
