One day, a little girl named Lily went to her friend Tom's house to play. They liked to build forts with chairs and cushions. When Lily got to Tom's house, she saw that he had a big pile of cushions in the living room.
"Let's build a big fort!" said Lily. Tom nodded and they started to put the chairs together. They added a lot of cushions to make it soft and cozy. But there was one cushion that was very uncomfortable. It was hard and not soft like the others. Lily and Tom didn't want to use it.
They finished building the fort and played inside it for a long time. They were having so much fun that they forgot about the uncomfortable cushion. But then, they heard a noise outside the fort. It was Lily's little brother, Max.
"Can I play too?" Max asked. Lily and Tom thought for a moment. They wanted to let Max play, but there was not enough room in the fort. Then, Lily had an idea.
"We can add the uncomfortable cushion on top of the fort!" she said. "That way, it won't be in our way and Max can play too!" Tom agreed and they put the hard cushion on top of the fort. Max joined them and they all had a great time playing together in the big fort they made.
