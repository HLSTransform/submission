Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sleep and always took a pill before bed. One morning, Lily woke up early and saw the sun shining in her window. She was grateful for the beautiful day.
Lily went to the kitchen and saw her mom making breakfast. "Good morning, Mommy!" Lily said. "I woke up early today."
"That's great, Lily!" her mom said. "Are you hungry?"
"Yes, please!" Lily replied.
After breakfast, Lily went to play with her toys. She felt happy and grateful for her mom and her toys. Suddenly, she heard her mom calling her name. "Lily, it's time to go to the park!" her mom said.
Lily was so excited to go to the park. She quickly put on her shoes and ran to her mom. "Thank you, Mommy!" Lily said. "I'm so grateful for you."
"You're welcome, Lily," her mom replied. "Let's go have some fun!"
