Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play golf with his daddy. They would go to the golf course every weekend and hit the ball with their clubs. One day, Timmy found a dirty ball in the bushes. He showed it to his daddy and they decided to decorate it with some paint.
They painted the ball with lots of colors and put some sparkles on it. Timmy was very happy with the ball and he showed it to all his friends. They thought it was very pretty. Timmy and his daddy went back to the golf course and used the decorated ball to play. They had so much fun! 
After they finished playing, they went home and Timmy put the ball on his shelf. He was very proud of it. From that day on, Timmy and his daddy always looked for old balls to decorate and play with. They had lots of fun and made many new friends at the golf course. The end.
