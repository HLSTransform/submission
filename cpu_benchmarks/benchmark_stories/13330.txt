Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. One day, he went for a walk with his mom. While walking, Tim saw a big rock. He wanted to jump over it, but his mom said, "Be careful, Tim. It's important to watch where you walk."
Tim didn't listen and jumped over the rock. "Ouch!" he cried. Tim felt pain in his foot. He was very sad. His mom hugged him and said, "I told you to be careful. Now you know why it's important to listen."
From that day on, Tim always listened to his mom. He knew it was important to be careful and not feel pain. Tim and his mom went on many more walks together, and they were always happy. The moral of the story is to always listen and be careful.
