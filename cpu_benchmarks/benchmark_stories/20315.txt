Mia and Leo were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun making noises and pretending to be animals. But soon they got tired and bored of their toys. They wanted to do something else.
"Let's go to the kitchen and see what Mom is doing," Mia suggested.
"OK," Leo agreed.
They walked to the kitchen and saw Mom sitting at the table with a big book. She looked very busy and serious.
"Hi, Mom," Mia said. "What are you doing?"
"Hi, sweeties," Mom said. "I'm studying for a test. I have to learn a lot of hard words and facts."
"That sounds hard," Leo said.
"It is," Mom said. "But I have to do it to become a better nurse. A nurse helps people who are sick or hurt."
"Wow, that's impressive," Mia said. "You are very smart and kind."
"Thank you," Mom said. "But I'm also very tired and stressed. My head and back hurt a lot."
"Can we help you?" Leo asked.
"Maybe you can," Mom said. "Do you know what a massage is?"
"No," Mia and Leo said.
"A massage is when you rub someone's back or head gently with your hands. It makes them feel good and relaxed," Mom explained.
"Can we give you a massage?" Mia asked.
"Sure, that would be very nice of you," Mom said. "But first, you have to settle down and be quiet. No more playing or making noises. Can you do that?"
"Yes, we can," Mia and Leo said.
They climbed on the chairs next to Mom and put their hands on her back and head. They rubbed them softly and slowly. Mom closed her eyes and smiled.
"That feels wonderful," Mom said. "You are very good at giving massages. Thank you, my loves."
"You're welcome, Mom," Mia and Leo said.
They gave Mom a hug and a kiss. They felt happy and proud. They helped Mom feel better and learned a new word. They decided to give Mom a massage every day.
