Once upon a time, there were two friends, Sam and Joe. Sam stayed at Joe's house for the night. In the morning, Joe was so excited to share a clean room with Sam. 
Joe said to Sam: "We should stay here until it is time to go!" 
Sam agreed it was a good idea. They played all day, but when it was time to leave, Joe felt sad. 
Sam said: "We can always come back." 
Joe said: "Yes, but why should we regret something if we can stay again?" 
Sam smiled and said: "You are so smart, Joe. Let's stay here next time and have more fun!" 
They hugged each other, happy to have a place to be together and clean. 
The end.
