Once there was a happy boy named Jimmy. He was three years old. Every day his mom allowed him to play with his toys. One day he saw a box of tape. He asked his mom if he could use it. She said yes and allowed him to use it. 
Jimmy was so excited. He used the tape to build things with his toys. He built a boat and a castle. He loved making new things with the tape. 
Jimmy's Mom was so proud of him. She always videotaped him while he played. She always said he was a very normal boy and madeher very happy. 
Jimmy and his mom had so much fun together. And it was all because she allowed him to use the tape.
