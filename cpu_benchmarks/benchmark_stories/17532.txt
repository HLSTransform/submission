Lily and Tom are playing in the park. They like to run and jump and slide. Lily sees a big dog. She wants to pet it. She runs to the dog.
"Wait, Lily!" Tom says. "Listen to me! That dog is bad. It can bite you. Come back!"
But Lily does not listen to Tom. She goes to the dog and tries to touch its fur. The dog does not like it. It growls and shows its teeth. It snaps at Lily and bites her leg.
"Ow! Ow! Ow!" Lily cries. She falls to the ground and holds her leg. It hurts a lot. There is blood on her leg.
Tom runs to Lily and hugs her. He is scared and sad. He calls for help. A lady comes and sees what happened. She calls the dog's owner and tells him to take the dog away. She calls an ambulance and tells them to come fast.
The ambulance comes and takes Lily to the hospital. Tom goes with her. He holds her hand and says he is sorry. He says he loves her and he hopes she will be okay.
Lily looks at Tom and says she is sorry too. She says she should have listened to him. She says she loves him and she thanks him for being her friend.
