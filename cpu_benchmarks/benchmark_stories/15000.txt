Once upon a time there lived a human called Jack. One day, Jack went out for an adventure and stumbled upon a very pretty lake. On the lake was a boat and Jack hopped on the boat to explore. 
When the boat reached the middle of the lake, Jack noticed something strange about the lake. He could feel that the lake needed him to restore it. With a determined look on his face, he set out to restore the lake.
Jack gathered stones, sticks and twigs and soon the lake began to look pretty again. Jack was overjoyed by his achievement. 
He said to himself, "That was a hard job! But it sure is nice to see a pretty lake".

Suddenly, a friendly voice said to him,"You sure did a nice job restoring the lake!" 
Jack was surprised and turned around to see a beautiful human by the lake side.
The human smiled at him and introduced herself, "I'm Wendy. I've been living in this lake ever since a polluting company polluted it. Thank you for restoring my home". 
Jack was very happy to know he was able to help and smiled at his new friend. He said, "You're welcome! It was my pleasure to restore this lake for you". 
And from then on Jack and Wendy were best friends. They explored the lake together and shared many stories. They continue to restore the lake and ensure
