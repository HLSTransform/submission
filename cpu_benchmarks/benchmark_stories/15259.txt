Once upon a time, there was a boy and a girl. They wanted to find some treasure! They looked and looked, but nothing could be found. So, they decided to join together to find it. 
The boy and girl looked everywhere, and soon they saw something sparkling in the grass! It looked like a treasure! Both the boy and the girl reached down and picked it up. It was a shiny golden coin!
The two were very happy. They knew it was a good treasure now and they were both so excited. 
The boy and the girl decided to keep their treasure safe. They put it in a special box and buried it in the ground. Now they knew that they had a safe place to keep their treasure. 
From then on, the boy and the girl were able to enjoy their good treasure whenever they wanted.
