Mommy said it was time to go the park. Jack couldn't wait! He grabbed his scooter and raced out the door.
When he arrived at the park, he saw an old man. He stood there, just looking. Jack ran over to the old man and asked, “What are you doing?”
The old man said “I’m waiting for the bus. I need to get downtown.”
“What is downtown?” asked Jack. The old man explained that downtown was a special place. It had lots of stores and people going around.
Jack said, “Let’s wait for the bus together!” The old man smiled and said, “Sure, that’s a great idea.”
They both stood there and waited for the bus. Finally, it came and the old man took his pass, waved goodbye to Jack, and hopped on board.
Jack stood there, watching the bus drive away. He smiled and knew he had made a new friend.
