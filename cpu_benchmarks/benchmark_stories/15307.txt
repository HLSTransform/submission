One day, a Dad and his son went to the park to play. The Dad picked up his son and gave him a big hug. The Dad had a handle and was pushing the son in a swing. The Dad pushed so fast that the son started giggling and laughing.
The Dad gave the handle to the son and showed him how to move the swing by himself. The son was so happy that he could swing all by himself. He was swinging so fast that his Dad could barely keep up with him. 
Suddenly, the Dad heard a bell ringing and realized it was time to go home. He gave the handle back to his son and said it was time for them to go. The son reluctantly gave back the handle, but was still smiling and laughing. 
The Dad and his son walked home, with the son laughing and telling Dad all about his adventure in the park. It was a fun day filled with laughter, a handle and lots of fast swings.
