Lily and Sam love to play baseball. They have a bat, a ball and a glove. They go to the park with Mom and Dad. They find a big field to play.
Lily wants to hit the ball. Sam wants to throw the ball. Mom and Dad want to catch the ball. They take turns. Lily hits the ball hard. Sam throws the ball fast. Mom and Dad catch the ball well.
But then, the ball goes too far. It flies over the fence. It lands in a yard with a big dog. The dog barks and runs to the ball. Lily, Sam, Mom and Dad are sad. They need the ball to play.
Sam has an idea. He is clever. He finds a stick. He throws the stick over the fence. The dog sees the stick. He likes the stick. He drops the ball and runs to the stick. He picks up the stick and plays with it.
Sam runs to the fence. He reaches for the ball. He gets the ball. He runs back to Lily, Mom and Dad. They are happy. They hug Sam. They say he is clever. They play baseball again. They have fun.
