Once upon a time, there was a girl called Rachel. She had a wonderful secret. She was so excited, she just had to share it.
“Mummy, I have something amazing to show you!” She exclaimed. 
Rachel’s mum smiled at her little girl and asked her to unpack her surprise. 
Rachel jumped up with glee, ran over to her bedroom and disappeared for a few minutes. 
When Rachel returned, she was carrying a large box. She began to unpack it, and suddenly the room was filled with a wonderful smell. Rachel had made a delicious cake and iced it with her favourite colours. 
“What a wonderful surprise!” Rachel’s mum said. “Wherever did you learn to bake such a delicious cake, you clever girl?” 
Rachel’s face lit up with a big smile. “I have a great baking teacher!” she said. 
Rachel’s mum was filled with wonder. But suddenly, the room got very quiet. Rachel looked sad and her face was miserable. 
“What’s wrong, sweetie?” Rachel’s mum asked. 
Rachel sighed.  “My baking teacher is at home, but I can’t see her or hug her, because she lives far away.”
