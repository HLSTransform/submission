Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play with blocks. They could build many things with blocks, like houses, towers, bridges, and cars. They had fun sharing and helping each other.
One day, they found a big box of new blocks in the playroom. They were very happy and wanted to build something big and beautiful. But they had different ideas. Lily wanted to build a castle, and Ben wanted to build a rocket. They argued and fought over the blocks. They did not share or help each other. They tried to build their own things, but they were not happy.
Soon, they saw that their castle and rocket were not good. They were weak and ugly. They fell apart easily. They had used too many blocks for themselves, and not enough for their friend. They felt sad and troubled. They wished they had played nicely.
Then, they had an idea. They said sorry to each other, and decided to work together. They mixed their blocks and their ideas. They used some blocks to build a castle, and some blocks to build a rocket. They shared and helped each other. They made a castle-rocket, that was big and beautiful. It was strong and shiny. It did not fall apart. They were very happy.
They learned that playing together is better than playing alone. They learned that sharing and helping is better than fighting and taking. They learned that building with blocks is fun, but building with friends is more fun. They hugged and smiled. They had a good day today.
