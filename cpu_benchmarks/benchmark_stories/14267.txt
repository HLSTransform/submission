Bob was feeling excited one day and so he decided that he wanted to go and explore. He picked up his hat and bag and asked his Mom if he could go out.
"Where do you want to go, Bob?" his Mom asked. 
"I want to carry and explore underground," said Bob with a twinkle in his eye. 
"Good idea," his Mom said. 
So Bob went and he explored. He carried his bag as he looked and marveled at the underground world. He was having such a good time and didn't want to leave.
But when Bob finally did emerge from the underground, he was met with a very pleasant surprise. A bubble-blowing dog! It bounced around, bubbles streaming out of its mouth, making popping noises as they burst. The dog was so happy to see Bob and ran right up to him and started licking him.
Bob couldn't believe it! His underground adventure had led him to a good surprise. And he knew that he would have to carry this memory with him wherever he went.
