Once upon a time, there was a square. It was dull and grey.
Bored and alone, the square wanted to have some fun. It bounced and jumped, hoping to increase its happiness.
Day after day, the square kept trying to increase its fun. And one day it found something that made it very happy!
Across the grass near the square, there were other squares that were bright and full of colour.
The square was so happy to be near these other squares. With them, its fun continued to increase.
So the dull square bounced and jumped and laughed. From that day on, it was never dull again!
