One day, a little infant was crying. Her mommy came to give her a hug. Then, she gave the infant a toy to play with. The infant was very happy.
This made the little infant laugh. This made Mommy smile. Then, she gave the little infant her favorite blanket. The little infant felt so cozy.
The little infant wanted to give something too. She looked around the room and saw a little flower. She picked it up and gave it to Mommy. Mommy was very happy. She gave the little infant a big hug. 
The little infant was so happy. She laughed and laughed. Then, Mommy and the little infant snuggled up together. They were so happy to be together.
