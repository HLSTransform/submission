Once there was a small girl. She was only three years old. She had a microphone and she loved to poke it and make noise. One day, she poked the microphone too hard and it hurt her. She started to cry. Her mom saw what had happened and came to help. She gave the little girl a hug and said she was sorry it hurt. Then she took the little girl and the microphone outside to play. They sang and danced and even used the microphone to talk to each other! The little girl was so happy that the microphone didn't hurt anymore.
