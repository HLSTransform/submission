Once upon a time, there was a wise old bear who lived in the woods. He liked to watch the sun come up each morning and see the trees turning green as summer came near.
One day, the wise old bear decided to bring summer to the woods. He went for a long walk and gathered pretty flowers and seeds from the meadows. After he had everything he needed, he put it all together to make a special gift.
The wise old bear danced through the woods and spread the gifts of summer everywhere. The flowers started blooming and the trees turned green. All the animals in the woods felt happy and thanked the bear for bringing summer.
The woods stayed green and full of life all summer long. Everyone enjoyed the sunshine and warmth, thanks to the wise old bear.
