Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl. One day, she took the elevator to go up to the roof. As she stepped into the elevator, she heard a loud noise. The elevator had broken and the doors wouldn't open!
The brave little girl shouted for help, but nobody answered. She bravely decided to try to get the doors open herself. After much pushing and pulling, the doors slowly opened.
When she stepped outside, the girl was surprised to see a friendly old man. He said, "Well done, brave girl! You sure opened that elevator!"
The girl smiled, feeling very proud of herself. From then on, she always remembered how brave she had been that day.
