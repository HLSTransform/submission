Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park every day. One day, she met a little boy named Jack. Jack seemed troubled and sad. Lily asked him, "What's wrong?" Jack whispered, "I lost my favorite toy last week and I can't find it."
Lily felt sad for Jack and wanted to help him. She said, "Let's look for your toy together." They searched the park, but they couldn't find it. Lily said, "Don't worry, we'll find it soon." Jack smiled and felt happy that he had a friend like Lily. 
Suddenly, Lily saw something shining under a tree. She shouted, "Look, Jack! Your toy is here!" Jack was overjoyed and thanked Lily. From that day on, they played together every day and had lots of fun.
