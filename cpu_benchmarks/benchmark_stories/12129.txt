Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the grocery store with her mommy. One day, while they were walking down the aisle, Lily saw a purple grape. She asked her mommy if she could have it, and her mommy said yes.
Suddenly, a man with a scary mask jumped out from behind the cereal boxes. Lily got scared and hid behind her mommy. The man took off his mask and said, "Don't be scared, it's just me, your uncle!"
Lily and her uncle laughed and continued shopping for groceries. They found some more purple grapes and put them in the cart. When they got home, Lily ate the grapes and told her mommy about how her uncle scared her at the store. They all laughed and had a great time together. The end.
