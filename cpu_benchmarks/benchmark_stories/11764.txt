Once upon a time two friends went on an adventure to find oxygen. They were really excited to go, but also a bit scared because it would be a long journey.
They travelled across the sea until they arrived in a strange land where the trees were weird and the sky was orange. They had never seen anything like it before.
The friends started to explore the strange land and soon they came across some oxygen. It was stored in a huge box, so the friends decided to send it back to their homes for everyone to use.
Finally, the friends returned home. They were so proud to have been brave enough to find and send the oxygen back home. Everyone was overjoyed with the new oxygen and thanked the two friends for their daring adventure.
The two friends were happy to have helped and they were sure they'd remember their weird adventure forever.
