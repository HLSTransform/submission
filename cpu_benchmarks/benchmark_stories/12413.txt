Jack and Sarah were the bravest children around. One day, they decided to explore their backyard. As they stepped out, they felt a strange power swirling in the air. 
Jack said, "This power feels like it could be magical." 
Sarah replied, "Let's find the source of this power and find out what it is!" 
So, the brave children journeyed into the unknown parts of their backyard. After walking for a while, they stumbled across a glowing rock. Jack stepped closer and as he touched it, the rock shifted and transformed into a beautiful butterfly. The butterfly flew away.
Jack said, "We should have asked the butterfly where it came from!" 
Sarah replied, "I know, but we were just so excited about it!" 
Jack felt a deep regret in his heart. He wished he had been braver and asked the butterfly more questions. 
The brave children vowed to be more cautious next time they encounter something unknown.
