Once upon a time, there was a boy named Bill. He was three years old and loved to study. 
One day, Bill had a very special wish. He wanted to be the best in his class, but he was feeling a bit selfish. He wanted to be the best more than anyone else. 
So Bill studied harder than ever. He worked very hard and studied everything he could. 
In the end, Bill's hard work paid off. He did indeed become the best in his class! Everyone was very proud of him. 
From then on, Bill never forgot the power of hard work and never gave into being selfish. He would always put studying first no matter what.
