Anna and Ben love to play in the pool. They splash each other with water and laugh. They see a big slide and want to try it. They climb up the stairs and wait for their turn.
"Are you ready, Ben?" Anna asks.
"Yes, I am ready, Anna!" Ben says.
They slide down together and make a big splash in the pool. They feel the water on their faces and bodies. They are happy and excited.
They swim to the edge of the pool and see a sign that says "massage". They are curious and want to see what it is. They follow the sign and find a small pool with bubbles and jets. They go inside and sit on the seats.
"Wow, this feels nice!" Anna says.
"It tickles!" Ben says.
They feel the bubbles and jets massage their backs and legs. They giggle and relax. They like the massage pool.
They look around and see an enormous ball floating on the water. They want to play with it. They swim to the ball and push it and bounce it. They have fun with the ball.
They hear their mom calling them. It is time to go home. They get out of the pool and dry themselves with towels. They hug their mom and thank her for taking them to the pool.
They had a great day at the pool. They splashed, slid, massaged and played. They can't wait to come back again.
