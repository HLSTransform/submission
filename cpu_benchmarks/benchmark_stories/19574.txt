Jimmy was playing in the garden. He observed a mark on the ground and he found it quite interesting. He started to dig around it, and eventually, he found the cutest thing ever! It was an adorable fluffy puppy! It was soft, and had big brown eyes. Jimmy was so excited and he petted the puppy gently. Soon, the puppy licked his face! From then on, Jimmy and the puppy became great friends. Jimmy even decided to call the puppy Mark! Jimmy enjoyed spending time with Mark every day and observing Markâ€™s different cute quirks. He loved his adorable new friend and he was so excited about his discovery!
