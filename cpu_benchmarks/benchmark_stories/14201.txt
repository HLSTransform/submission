Once upon a time, a small boy was walking through the forest. Suddenly he heard a loud scream. He became scared and looked around for danger.
He spotted a man with a spear, preparing to attack. The small boy shook and felt so scared. He could not move.
The man with the spear stepped forward and said ‘What are you doing here?’
The small boy said ‘I’m looking for help!’
The man smiled and spoke kindly. ‘I can provide help’, he said. He put away his spear and led the small boy back to his village.
Everyone in the village was so happy to see the small boy safe and sound. The man with the spear was welcomed as a hero. They thanked him for providing help and protection.
The small boy smiled and felt safe again. He was no longer scared.
