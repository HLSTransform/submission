Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the store with her mommy. They were looking for a card to give to Lily's grandma. Lily's mommy told her to pick a nice card, but Lily found a cheap one that she liked.
When they got home, Lily's mommy asked her if she had the card. Lily looked in her bag, but she forgot to bring it! "Oh no!" said Lily's mommy. "We have to go back to the store to get the card."
Lily felt bad for forgetting the card, but she was happy when they found the same cheap card at the store. They bought it and went back home. Lily gave the card to her grandma and she loved it. From that day on, Lily always remembered to check her bag before leaving the store.
