Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play outside. One day, they have a picnic in the park. They bring sandwiches, apples, and juice. They find a nice spot under a big tree.
But then, they see a big dog. The dog is hungry. It runs to their picnic. It wants to eat their food. Tom and Mia are scared. They do not want to lose their picnic.
Tom has an idea. He picks up a stick. He waves it at the dog. He says, "Go away, dog! This is our picnic!" Mia helps him. She makes a loud noise. She says, "Shoo, shoo, dog! Leave us alone!"
The dog is confused. It does not like the stick and the noise. It runs away. Tom and Mia are happy. They hug each other. They have protected their picnic. They are helpful friends. They eat their food and enjoy their day.
