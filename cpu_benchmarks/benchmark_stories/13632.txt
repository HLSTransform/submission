Sam and Lily were twins who liked to play together. One day, they found a big box in the garage. They decided to make it into a boat and pretend they were sailing to an island.
"Let's go to the island and look for treasure!" Sam said.
"OK, but we have to be careful of the sharks and pirates!" Lily said.
They cut out some windows and a door in the box and drew a sail and a flag on it. They put some pillows and toys inside and pushed the box to the backyard. They climbed in and started to make boat noises.
"Look, there's the island!" Sam pointed to a pile of rocks and dirt. "Let's go and explore!"
They jumped out of the box and ran to the rocks. They started to dig and look for shiny things.
"Wow, look what I found!" Lily held up a shiny button. "It's a treasure!"
"Me too, me too!" Sam said. He found a bottle cap and a marble. "We're rich!"
They put their treasures in a plastic bag and ran back to the boat. They were very happy and proud.
But they did not see that their dog, Max, had followed them. Max was curious and wanted to play with them. He sniffed the box and saw the pillows and toys inside. He thought they were for him. He jumped in and started to chew and pull and shake them.
"Hey, stop that!" Sam and Lily heard a noise and looked at the box. They saw Max making a mess. "Bad dog, bad dog!"
They ran to the box and tried to get Max out. But Max did not want to leave. He liked the box. He growled and barked and ignored them.
"Max, get out of our boat!" Sam shouted.
"Max, you're ruining our game!" Lily cried.
But Max did not listen. He kept playing with the pillows and toys. He did not care about the island or the treasure. He thought the box was his. He was happy and proud.
