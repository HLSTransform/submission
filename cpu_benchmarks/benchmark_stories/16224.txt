Once there was a little boy named Tim who lived on a farm. Tim liked helping his parents with the farm work, but one day he had a bad idea. Tim saw the cauliflower in the garden and thought he could grab it for himself.
So Tim grabbed the cauliflower, it was hot from being in the sun! He quickly put it in his pocket and ran off into the woods.
But when he got to the woods, Tim felt guilty. He knew he should have not taken the cauliflower without asking his parents. Tim felt so bad he decided he would put it back.
When Tim put the hot cauliflower back into the garden he realised how wrong it had been to take it without permission. Tim knew that it was important to always respect a grown-up's rules.
From then on, Tim never stole anything again and was a very good boy. He learned that it's okay to want something, but it is important to always must ask first!
