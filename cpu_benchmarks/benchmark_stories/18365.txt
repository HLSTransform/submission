Once upon a time, there was a big earthquake. It made a big mess. Rocks and dirt were scattered everywhere. Everyone in the town was scared.
A little boy named Tim saw the impressive mess. He wanted to help. He picked up a broom and started to sweep. His friend Sally saw him and asked, "What are you doing, Tim?"
"I'm helping clean up after the earthquake," Tim said. "Do you want to help me?" Sally nodded and picked up a shovel. Together, they worked to clean up the scattered rocks and dirt.
Soon, more friends joined Tim and Sally. They all worked together to fix the mess. The town looked nice again. Everyone was happy and proud of their hard work.
