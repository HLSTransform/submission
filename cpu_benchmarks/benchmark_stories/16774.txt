Tom was a curious boy who liked to explore new things. One day, he found a shiny whistle in his dad's drawer. He wanted to try it, but his dad told him not to. He said the whistle was very loud and could scare people and animals.
But Tom did not listen. He waited until his dad was busy and took the whistle to the park. He blew it as hard as he could and enjoyed the sound. He did not notice that he was making the birds fly away, the dogs bark and the people frown.
Soon, it was getting dark and Tom had to go home. He started to walk back, but he realized he was lost. He had wandered too far and did not know the way. He felt scared and alone. He wished he had listened to his dad.
He tried to blow the whistle again, hoping someone would hear him and help him. But no one came. The whistle only made the dark more scary. He heard strange noises and saw shadows. He cried and hugged the whistle.
Then, he saw a light. It was his dad, looking for him. He had heard the whistle and followed the sound. He was angry, but also happy to find Tom. He hugged him and took him home. He explained to him why the whistle was not a toy and why he should obey him. Tom said he was sorry and learned his lesson. He never played with the whistle again. He was glad to have his dad and his home.
