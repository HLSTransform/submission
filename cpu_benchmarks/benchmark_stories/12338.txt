It was a sunny day, and a lively kitten was jumping in the garden. The bright light made it hard for the kitten to keep its eyes open. Suddenly, a little girl opened the gate and saw the jumping kitten. She was excited and said, "Look mommy, there's a cute kitten jumping!" She ran towards the kitten, but it was too fast for her. The kitten kept jumping from one side of the garden to the other, happy and carefree. 
The little girl tried to get closer to the kitten, but it jumped away again. She kept following the kitten, but she wasn't able to catch it. She stopped and said, "I can't catch it!" Her mom replied: "Don't worry, sweetheart. We can still admire its lively jumps".
The little girl was sad, but she smiled as she watched the lively kitten jump around the garden. She knew she couldn't catch it, but she was happy just watching it.
