A soldier was walking around the park when he saw a cool playground. He smiled as he remembered when he was a little boy and used to play in the same playground. He sat down on the swing and looked around. Suddenly, he noticed something big next to him. It was a big, cool dragonfly! He was very surprised to see it and he didn't know what to do.
The soldier reached out to touch the dragonfly but it quickly flew away! He was sad that the dragonfly was gone but he knew he had made a friend. He was sure that when he came back to the park, the dragonfly would be back too.
The soldier smiled and decided to take a walk around the park. He heard some children playing and laughing. He waved at them and they waved back. He felt happy knowing that they all had made a cool new friend.
