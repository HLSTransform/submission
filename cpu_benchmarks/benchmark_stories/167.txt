Once upon a time, there was a fireman named Jack. Jack was always very hungry because he worked hard to put out fires. One day, Jack was eating his lunch when a little boy came up to him and asked, "Can I add some ketchup to your sandwich?"
Jack said, "Sure, that would be great!" The little boy added ketchup to Jack's sandwich and they started talking. The little boy said, "I want to be a fireman like you when I grow up."
Jack smiled and said, "That's great! We need more firemen to help keep people safe."
Later that day, Jack got a call that there was a big fire at a nearby building. He rushed over to help, but unfortunately, he didn't make it out. The little boy was sad when he heard the news, but he knew that Jack was a hero who had helped many people.
