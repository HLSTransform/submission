Mommy was very excited as she was about to put a new dress for Lucy, her three-year old daughter. Lucy saw the dress and said, "It's so pretty!" She did not want to change, but Mommy said, "Come on, Lucy. We have to go to Grandma's house and the dress looks pretty." 
Mommy helped Lucy put on the dress, but it just did not look right. Lucy said, "Help! The dress is too tight. I can't walk." Mommy said, "Oh dear! I forgot to check if the dress fits! Don't worry, I think we can save it."
Mommy put some lace at one side of the dress and made a few stitches around it. Lucy said, "Yay! Now, it fits much better." Mommy said, "Yes, that should do the trick." She was very happy that she was able to prevent the dress from tearing.
They took the dress off and put it back in the wardrobe. After that, they got ready to go to Grandma's house. They looked around and Mommy said, "You look so pretty, Lucy!" Lucy smiled as Mommy gave her a big hug.
