Once upon a time, there was a silly frog who loved to jump around. One day, he hopped into a pond and saw his reflection. He thought it was another frog and started to talk to it. "Hello there, would you like to play with me?" he suggested. But when he realized it was just his own reflection, he felt foolish.
The frog decided to explore the pond and met some friendly fish. They suggested he should try swimming instead of jumping all the time. The frog was hesitant at first, but then he gave it a try. He found out that he loved swimming too!
From that day on, the frog spent his time both jumping and swimming. He realized that it was better to try new things and listen to suggestions from others. And he never felt foolish again.
