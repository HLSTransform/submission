Once upon a time, an ant lived in a large tree. The ant liked to balance on the branches, walking from one end to the other. The ant would also climb up and down the trunk of the tree, and use the leaves to balance on.
One day, the ant found a large fruit on one of the branches. The ant took a bite and found that it was very sweet. The ant wanted to carry the fruit with it, so it balanced the fruit on its back.
The ant climbed the tree, carrying the large fruit. It jumped from branch to branch, carefully balancing the fruit on its back. The ant was so careful that it didn't drop the fruit once. 
When the ant reached the ground, it found a new place to live. And it ate the large, sweet fruit. The ant was very happy!
