One day, a little girl named Lucy was walking with her mom. Lucy noticed a big billboard. It had a lot of fun words on it. She asked her mom to read the words, but her mom said "no, it's too hard".
But then, a bossy voice boomed from the other side of the billboard. It was an old man wearing a hat. He said to Lucy, "Do you want me to read it to you? I know all the words."
Lucy gulped and nodded. The old man read all the words on the billboard. Lucy was so happy that she thanked the old man for helping her. 
 
The old man smiled and said to Lucy, "No problem. Just remember that it's good to learn new words every day."
Lucy smiled back and gave the old man a hug. She couldn't wait to tell her mom what she had just learned.
