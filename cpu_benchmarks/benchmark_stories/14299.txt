Once upon a time there was a small boy. He was only three years old. One day, he was walking outside with his mom. She was holding an unusual blue umbrella near a garden. The boy asked his mom if he could peek at the garden. She said yes.
So the little boy peeked. He saw all the colorful flowers. There were bright red ones and dark blue ones. He was so happy and asked his mom if he could pick one. His mom said no and told him why.
She said, "No, dear. Flowers are only for looking at. If you pick them, they will no longer look pretty." The little boy thought about this for a minute and then nodded. He was sad but understood.
The boy and his mom went on their way. The little boy remembered his mom's wise words and never picked any of the flowers. He learned that beautiful things are meant to be admired and not taken away.
