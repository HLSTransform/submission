Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play with blocks and make buildings. One day, they found a big box of purple blocks. They were very happy and started to build a castle.
But soon, they had a problem. Lily wanted to make the castle taller and taller. Ben wanted to make the castle wider and wider. They did not agree on how to build the castle. They started to argue and push each other.
"Stop it, Lily! You are making the castle fall!" Ben shouted.
"No, you stop it, Ben! You are making the castle too big!" Lily shouted back.
They were so angry that they knocked down the castle. The purple blocks scattered everywhere. They both felt sad and sorry.
They looked at each other and saw tears in their eyes. They remembered that they were best friends. They did not want to fight anymore.
"I'm sorry, Lily. I was mean to you. Can you forgive me?" Ben asked.
"I'm sorry, Ben. I was mean to you, too. Of course I can forgive you." Lily said.
They hugged and smiled. They decided to build the castle again, but this time, they listened to each other and shared their ideas. They had fun and made a beautiful purple castle. They were happy and proud of their building.
