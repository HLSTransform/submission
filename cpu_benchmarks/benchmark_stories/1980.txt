Once upon a time, there was a boy. He was feeling very lonely and wished he could find something to do. One day, he heard a noise outside his house. It was a bicycle! The bicycle was moving along the road and it looked like it was searching for someone.
The boy ran outside and introduced himself to the bicycle. The bicycle was very pleased to meet him. They played together for the rest of the day. They raced each other and had lots of fun.
However, the next day, the bicycle was gone. The boy was very sad. He had no one to play with him anymore. He wandered around, feeling very lonely and sad.
A few days later, the boy heard the same noise again. It was the bicycle! The bicycle had come back. The bicycle said it couldn't stay away any longer and decided to come back to introduce the boy to its friends.
The boys smiled with joy. He was no longer lonely. He had lots of new friends to play with every day. They all had lots of fun together!
