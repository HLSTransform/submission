Once upon a time, an old fisherman went to the river to catch some fish. He cast his net and waited patiently. Suddenly, he felt a tug on his line and he pulled it up. He was excited to receive a big fish, but it was too heavy for him to lift.
The fisherman struggled and pulled with all his might, but the fish was too strong. He knew he needed help, so he called out to his friends. They came running and together they were able to pull the fish out of the water.
But then a problem arose. The fish was so big that they couldn't decide who should get to keep it. They argued and fought, but the old fisherman reminded them that they should share the fish and be happy together. In the end, they all went home with a piece of the big fish and they were all happy.
