Lily liked to learn new things with her tutor, Miss Jane. Miss Jane was very kind and patient, and she taught Lily how to read, write, and count. Lily always had many questions for Miss Jane, and Miss Jane always answered them with a smile.
One day, Lily had a very hard question for Miss Jane. She asked, "Miss Jane, why do some people hurt other people?" Miss Jane looked sad and serious. She said, "That is a very big question, Lily. Some people hurt other people because they are angry, or scared, or selfish. They do not care about how other people feel. They do not listen to their hearts, or to God, or to anyone who tries to help them."
Lily felt confused and scared. She said, "But Miss Jane, you are not angry, or scared, or selfish. You care about how I feel. You listen to your heart, and to God, and to me. Why would anyone want to hurt you?" Miss Jane hugged Lily and said, "You are very sweet, Lily. I wish everyone was like you. But sometimes, bad things happen to good people, and we do not know why. We can only pray, and hope, and try to be brave."
The next day, Lily did not see Miss Jane. She waited for her at the door, but she did not come. She asked her mom, "Where is Miss Jane? Is she sick?" Her mom looked sad and serious. She said, "Lily, I have some bad news. Miss Jane was hurt by some bad people. They had guns, and they shot her. She is in the hospital, but she is very sick. She might not get better."
Lily felt a big pain in her chest. She cried and cried. She said, "No, no, no! Miss Jane is good! She does not deserve to be hurt! Why did they do that? Why did God let that happen?" Her mom hugged her and said, "I do not know, Lily. I do not know. I am so sorry." Lily did not stop crying. She did not want to learn anything anymore. She did not want to ask any more questions. She only wanted Miss Jane to be okay. But she was not.
