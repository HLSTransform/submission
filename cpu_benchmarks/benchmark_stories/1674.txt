Once upon a time, there was a musician named Tom. He played amazing music with his guitar. One day, he went to the park to play music for the children. 
A little girl named Lily came up to him and said, "Your music is so amazing! Can you play more?" Tom smiled and played another song. 
But then, a naughty boy came and spoiled the fun. He hit Tom's guitar and broke it. Tom was sad and said, "Now I can't play music anymore." 
Lily felt bad and said, "I'm sorry that boy spoiled your guitar. Can I help you fix it?" But Tom said, "No, it's too broken. I can't play music anymore." 
And so, Tom had to stop playing music and Lily never got to hear his amazing music again. The end.
