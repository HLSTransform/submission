Molly and Max were playing by the beach. They saw a big wreck and Max wanted to explore it. 
"Can we go near the wreck?" asked Max.
"Yes, I think it's available," said Molly.
Max and Molly raced to the wreck. Molly was so excited to see what was inside. 
But then Max teased her. "You're too slow. I'll get inside first!" He laughed, and ran inside. 
Molly was mad and followed him inside. She was determined to beat him.
The wreck had some treasures, so the two of them raced to pick up the most. 
In the end, they both had the same amount of treasure. Molly was happy because she was able to find the same amount as Max.
