One day, Tom was ready to go to the library. He put on his shoes and hat. He walked with his mom to the big building with many books. He was very happy.
In the library, Tom met his friend, Tim. They both liked to read about animals. They found a book about dogs and cats. Tim said, "I like dogs more than cats." Tom said, "I like cats more than dogs." They started to fight about who was better, dogs or cats.
A nice lady who worked at the library came over. She said, "Please don't fight. Dogs and cats are both good. You can read about both." Tom and Tim stopped fighting. They read the book together and learned that dogs and cats can be friends too.
