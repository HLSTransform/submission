Sam was walking in the park. He looked around and saw nothing but boring grass. He sighed and said to himself, "this is no fun". 
Suddenly, he saw a beautiful, shiny coin in the grass. He couldn't believe his luck, so he quickly picked it up. 
Sam said, "wow! I've gained something special."
He jumped and ran around in circles with excitement, not noticing a nearby fairy who had been watching him. 
The fairy smiled and said, "you've gained something special. Would you like something more?"
Sam replied, "Yes, I would like something more!"
The fairy sprinkled some magical glitter on the grass and it started to grow. Suddenly, the boring grass transformed into a beautiful field of wild flowers. 
"Now you can play and explore in the wonderful field of flowers," said the fairy. "It will never be boring again!"
Sam thanked her and ran off to explore his new and magical world.
