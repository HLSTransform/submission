Once upon a time, there were two friends who liked to play hockey. They were both very fast, so they raced each other up and down the rink.
As they were playing, they heard a loud noise that made them tremble. The noise was so big and so loud that the two friends became very scared.
Suddenly, they saw two big animals coming towards them. They were both shaking and trembling! One of them said, “let’s run!” 
So they started to run as fast as they could, faster than they had ever run in their lives. They raced around the rink until they were safe. 
After a few moments, they stopped to catch their breath and realized that the animals weren’t chasing them at all – they were just playing hockey like them! 
The two friends laughed and smiled and then started racing each other around the rink again. They were never so scared of the big noise again.
