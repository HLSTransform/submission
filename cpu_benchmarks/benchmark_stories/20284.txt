Once upon a time, there was a little monkey named Momo. Momo lived in a big tree in the jungle. He loved to play with his friends and eat yummy bananas. Momo was a very careful monkey, always making sure not to fall from the tree.
One sunny day, Momo and his friends were playing hide and seek. It was Momo's turn to hide. He was so excited! Momo found a big bush to hide behind. He was very quiet and careful, so his friends could not find him. 
Momo was so good at hiding that it seemed like he vanished! His friends looked and looked, but they could not find him. Finally, Momo jumped out of the bush and surprised them all. They laughed and clapped, amazed at how well Momo had hidden. From that day on, Momo was known as the best hide and seek player in the jungle.
