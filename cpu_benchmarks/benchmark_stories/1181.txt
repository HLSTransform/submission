Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot liked to play and run all day. One day, Spot saw a big ball in the yard. He wanted to play with it, but he knew it was not his ball. Spot thought it would be fun, so he took the ball anyway.
Spot played with the ball all day. He did not know that he was making trouble. The ball belonged to his friend, Sam the cat. Sam was sad because he could not find his ball to complete his game. When Sam saw Spot with his ball, he felt very sorry.
Spot saw that Sam was sad and knew he made trouble. He felt sorry too. Spot gave the ball back to Sam and said sorry. They played together with the ball and had a great day. From that day on, Spot learned to share and not take things that were not his.
