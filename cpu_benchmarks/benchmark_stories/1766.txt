Once upon a time there was a foolish puppy. This silly puppy was always asking silly questions. One day, he asked a three year old boy how to swim. The boy said, "I don't know how to swim either."
The puppy didn't give up. He asked a fisherman. The fisherman said to the puppy, "It's easy! Put your paws in the water and move them around."
The puppy tried his best, but he just kept sinking! The fisherman smiled at the foolish puppy and said, "Maybe a boat will help you."
The puppy thanked the fisherman and jumped in a little boat. He paddled around the lake until he was splashing and swimming just like a big fish. 
The three year old boy watched the puppy swimming and said, "Wow! Now I know how to swim too!" 
The silly puppy was so happy he had been able to help the three year old boy. He barked with joy and swam back to the shore.
