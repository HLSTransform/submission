Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wander around her neighborhood and see all the pretty houses. One day, she saw a big parade with lots of people dancing and singing. Lily was so happy to see all the colors and hear the music.
As the sun began to set, Lily noticed the light was getting dimmer. She started to feel scared and wanted to go home. But then she saw a kind lady with a bright light. The lady helped her find her way home safely.
From that day on, Lily always remembered the parade and the kind lady who helped her in the light. She continued to wander around her neighborhood, but she made sure to always stay safe and look for the light.
