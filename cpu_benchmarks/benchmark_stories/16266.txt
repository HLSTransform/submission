Once upon a time, there were two siblings, Jack and Polly. Jack wanted to surprise Polly with something special, so he got some paint and started to paint their bedroom. He worked quickly, zipping around to make sure he was done in time.
 Jack showed the room to Polly, who was very pleased. 
Polly asked, "Is it dry?" 
Jack looked at the wall and said, "Not yet. We should wait a little bit more." 
They both waited patiently for the paint to fully dry. After what seemed like a long time, the paint had dried and Jack and Polly were very pleased. They hugged each other in joy and laughed with glee. 
"It's perfect!" They both said in unison. 
And they lived happily ever after.
