Once upon a time there were two best friends, Jack and Jill. They were both three years old and always had fun together.
One day they were playing in the garden when they saw a parade pass by! It was full of loud noises and fantastic floats. Jack and Jill were so excited. They wanted to join in on the fun so they ran up the street.
Jack found a spot right at the front but Jill did not fit between all the people. Jack urged Jill to find a better spot and she ran around to the side street. There she found a perfect spot to see the whole parade.
Jill clapped and cheered as the parade passed by. When it was finished she ran back to Jack. They both hugged and laughed. From that day on, Jack and Jill always knew to find a fit spot for the parades.
