Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved to wander. Everywhere she went she found something new and exciting, but today she was in a meadow, looking for something special. She spotted a pale fork in the grass and knew at once what it was. She picked it up, excited by the new find, and started to wander again.
The meadow was very big and it seemed to stretch on forever. The little girl wandered and wandered until the sun started to set. She was getting very tired and knew she had to go home soon. Suddenly she spotted something beautiful in the sky, a big rainbow that shone brightly! She was so happy and started to run back home, the pale fork still in her hand.
When she got home she showed her mom the pale fork and told her about the wonderful rainbow she had seen. Her mom was amazed by the pale fork and gave her a big hug. From then on the little girl kept the pale fork in a special box so she could remember the fun day she had spent wandering in the meadow.
