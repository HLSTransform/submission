Once upon a time, there was an ordinary beetle. He seemed very happy, as he scurried around the meadow. Suddenly, something shiny caught his eye. He cautiously moved closer to have a closer look. To his delight, it was a tiny green beetle just like him.
He greeted her warmly, introducing himself in his own special way. She answered him with the same enthusiasm and seemed very nice. The two beetles struck up a friendship right away and happily went off to explore together.
The sun was beginning to set, so the two beetles said their goodbyes and headed off in opposite directions. As they said farewell, they both knew they had made a special friend. From then on, the beetle's life seemed much brighter and more exciting.
