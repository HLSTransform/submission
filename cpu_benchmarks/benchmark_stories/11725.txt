One day, two children decided to explore the forest near the village. They were very excited but their mothers were worried. 
As they jumped over a fallen log, they saw a group of strange men. "What have you got there?" one man shouted. The children were scared and ran away. 
The children ran for what felt like hours. They reached a clearing in the forest and looked around. They had no idea where they were. 
Suddenly, the strange men appeared again. The children were scared and screamed for help. The men grabbed them and dragged them away from the clearing. 
The men took them to the village. Everyone there was so worried. Nobody knew what was going to happen to the children. 
The men took them away, and the children were never seen again. Everyone in the village was very worried and sad.
