Once upon a time, there was a chubby little boy. He was wearing a nice red jacket.
The boy was walking along in the park when he suddenly lost his balance. He dropped the red jacket and started to cry.
Suddenly, a big and kind lady came to help him. She picked up the dropped jacket and handed it back to the chubby little boy.
The boy smiled and thanked the kind lady. He was so happy that he put on the red jacket and twirled around in circles!
The chubby little boy was so excited to have his red jacket back that he ran off to play in the park with his friends.
