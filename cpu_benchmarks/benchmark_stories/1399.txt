One day, a little girl named Emma was playing hide-and-seek with her mom. She was so great at hiding that she made her mom search for her all over the house. Finally, mom found her hiding under the bed. 
Emma thought it would be funny to try and make her nose disappear. She tried scrunching up her face and squinting her eyes really tight, but it didn't work.
So she decided to try using magic. She waved her hands around her nose and said some special words. "Vanish, disappear!," she shouted. 
And just like that, her nose disappeared! Her mom was so surprised, she almost dropped her cup of tea. Emma laughed and laughed and then her nose reappeared. 
They both had a great time playing hide-and-seek that day.
