Once upon a time, there was a small bunny named Alice. She had a fluffy white tail and big brown eyes. One day, Alice decided to go exploring. She hopped around the field and enjoyed the sunny day. Suddenly, she saw a big angry dog!
Alice was so scared, she screamed and ran away. She hopped as fast as she could, her tail flapping behind her. But the dog was quick and hot on her tail. Poor Alice was so scared. 
Alice came to the edge of a lake, and there was nowhere to go. She was trapped! But then she remembered a trick her mommy taught her. She made a loud and bitter sound, and the dog stopped in his tracks. He turned and quickly ran away!
Alice was so relieved! She hopped back home, happy to have had such an adventure. From then on, she was a bit more careful when exploring, but never stopped having fun!
