Once upon a time there lived a tall man who was brave and strong. He was wise and never lost his courage.
One day the man took a journey underground. He traveled a long way and eventually he came to a great dark hole. The hole seemed to keep growing bigger and bigger. In the distance, the man saw a giant monster inside the hole.
The man tried to back away, but the monster was moving closer. The man was getting scared, until he remembered he was brave and strong. He took a deep breath, and he spoke firmly to the monster.
The man said: “No matter how much you increase in size, I will never lose my courage.”
The monster then began to shrink. Soon, he was back to his normal size. The man was very happy, and he learned a valuable lesson: no matter how scared you are, don’t lose your courage.
