Once upon a time, there was a bright nation. Everyone in the nation had happy days filled with laughter. On a special day, everyone gathered together in the town square.
Suddenly, a whistling sound came from the clouds. Everyone looked up to see a big, beautiful bird that was flying in the sky. It circled above them, making music with its whistle.
The people cheered and began to whistle too. Each one of them put a finger to their lips and blew their own tune. Everyone danced and sang along with the bird.
The day was bright and full of joy. The bird stayed with them until the sun went down. Before flying away, it gave a final whistle that made everyone smile.
