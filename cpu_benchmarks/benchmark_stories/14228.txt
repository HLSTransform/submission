Once upon a time there was a grumpy kangaroo. He had a very important job to do. His job was to make the sun go up each morning and make sure the night was dark each night.
One morning, the kangaroo was feeling very grumpy. He didn't want to do his job of making the sun come up. But then he heard a sound of a zoom. He looked up and saw a little bird flying away.
It was so beautiful that the kangaroo forgot about being grumpy. He jumped up and started to fly.The sun came up and everyone was happy.
From then on, the kangaroo always felt happy when he heard the sound of a zoom. He decided he should definitely jump for joy each morning.
