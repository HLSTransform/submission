Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl. She stepped out of her house and into a wild place. The grass was tall and the trees swayed in the wind.
The girl stepped further into the meadow. She was a bit scared, but her curiosity made her go forward. She stepped over the tall grass and tall rocks. She spotted something. It was a big beast! The beast was roaring and the girl was fearful.
But that brave little girl didn't run away. She stepped closer and saw that the beast was really just a friendly dragon. Its wings were purple and green and its belly was so soft.
The dragon smiled at the small girl. She was no longer fearful - they became fast friends! Together they stepped around the meadow and explored. The day was filled with fun and adventure. 
The brave girl went back home at night - happy, safe, and with a new friend.
