Tom and Mia liked to play pirate in the garden. They had a big box that was their ship, and a hose that was their cannon. They wore hats and eye patches and said "Arrr!" a lot.
One day, they saw a big orange cat sitting on the fence. It looked like a tiger. Tom said, "Look, Mia, a pirate enemy! Let's spray him with our cannon and make him run away!" Mia said, "Yes, let's do that!" They grabbed the hose and aimed at the cat.
But the cat was not afraid. He jumped off the fence and ran towards them. He hissed and spat and showed his sharp teeth. Tom and Mia were scared. They dropped the hose and ran back to their box. The cat followed them and jumped on the box. He scratched and bit the box and made a big hole.
Tom and Mia crawled out of the hole and ran into the house. They slammed the door and locked it. They were safe. They looked out of the window and saw the cat sitting on the box. He looked very angry. He had water on his fur and his eyes were green.
Tom and Mia learned a lesson. They decided not to spray the cat again. They said, "Sorry, cat, we won't bother you anymore. You are a very brave pirate. We are sorry we made you wet." The cat heard them and meowed. He seemed to forgive them. He jumped off the box and walked away. Tom and Mia smiled and hugged each other. They were happy. They said, "We are still pirates, but we are nice pirates. We don't spray anyone who doesn't want to be sprayed." They went back to their box and played pirate again. But they left the hose alone.
