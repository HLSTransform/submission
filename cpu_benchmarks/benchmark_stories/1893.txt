Once upon a time, there were two best friends. They were called Lulu and Jack.
 
One day, Lulu and Jack were playing in the garden when it suddenly got dark. It was time to go inside but Lulu was scared of the dark.
"Jack," said Lulu, "Please get the lamp!" 
So Jack went inside and he found a pale lamp. He carried it outside and put it on the grass. It lit up the garden with a calming, warm light.
Lulu was very happy. She gave Jack a big hug and said, "Thank you for bringing the lamp!"
The two friends played until it was time for them to go to bed. Then they said goodnight and went inside. 
The End.
