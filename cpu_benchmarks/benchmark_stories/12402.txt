John and his mother went out for a walk. John looked around and noticed a big green hill. His mom said, "Let's take a walk up the hill!"
John was excited and said, "Yay!"
They started to walk up the hill but after walking a while they noticed there was a big rock blocking their way.
John's mother said, "Oh no, now we can't go any further. What should we do?"
John thought for a moment and then said, "We should take zero steps and go around the rock!"
So that's what John and his mother did. They took zero steps and went around the rock and continued their walk up the green hill.
