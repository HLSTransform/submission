Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and trucks. One day, Tom has a new car. It is red and shiny. Sam likes it very much. He asks Tom if he can play with it.
Tom says yes, but he tells Sam to be careful. He says the car is very special. His dad gave it to him for his birthday. Sam says he will be careful. He takes the car and runs to the sandbox.
Sam plays with the car in the sandbox. He makes hills and tunnels. He has fun. But he is not careful. He pushes the car too hard. The car hits a rock. The car breaks. The wheel falls off. Sam is sad. He does not know what to do.
He thinks Tom will be angry. He thinks Tom will not be his friend anymore. He thinks of hiding the car. He thinks of lying to Tom. But he knows that is wrong. He knows that is not what friends do.
He decides to tell Tom the truth. He picks up the car and the wheel. He walks to Tom. He says he is sorry. He says he broke the car. He shows Tom the car and the wheel.
Tom is sad. He likes his car very much. He is angry at Sam. He wants to yell at him. He wants to take his car back. But he sees Sam's face. He sees Sam is sorry. He sees Sam is his friend.
He remembers his dad told him something. He told him that things can break, but friends are loyal. He told him that loyal means you stay with your friends, even when they make mistakes. He told him that loyal means you forgive your friends, and help them fix their mistakes.
Tom decides to be loyal. He decides to forgive Sam. He decides to help him repair the car. He says it is okay. He says they can fix the car together. He says they are still friends.
He takes the car and the wheel. He finds some glue. He glues the wheel back to the car. He waits for the glue to dry. He gives the car back to Sam. He says they can play with it again. He says they can share it.
Sam is happy. He thanks Tom. He says he is sorry again. He says he will be more careful. He says Tom is a good friend. He says Tom is loyal.
He gives Tom a wink. He says they can play with the car in the grass. He says the grass is softer than the rock. He says the car will not break again.
Tom smiles. He winks back. He says they can play with the car in the grass. He says the grass is fun. He says the car is special. He says their friendship is more special.
They run to the grass. They play with the car. They have fun. They are loyal friends.
