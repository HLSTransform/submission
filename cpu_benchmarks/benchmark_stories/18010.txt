Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going on adventures with her family. One day, they went on a trip to the mountains. They stayed in a cozy cabin. 
Lily's mom said, "Lily, can you help me count the trees?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, I can number them for you!"
Later that day, Lily and her dad went for a walk. Her dad saw that she was very quiet and asked, "Lily, is everything okay?"
Lily looked up at her dad and said, "I'm just being thoughtful. I'm thinking about how much I love being here with you and mom." 
Her dad smiled and said, "I love being here with you too, Lily."
