Once there was a girl named Sarah. Sarah loved bells. She wanted to buy a bell so every day she asked her parents to go to the store. 
One day they went to the store. Sarah walked up and down the aisles until she saw a bell that was very light. She thought it was perfect and asked her parents to buy it. They said yes and Sarah was very happy. 
At home Sarah hung the bell in her bedroom. Every time she saw it she was happy and sang a song. But the bell did more than make Sarah happy - it rang! It was the sweetest sound and Sarah loved it. 
Her parents were so pleased that they bought Sarah more bells. Every time a new bell came it was different. Some were dark, others were big and others were light. But Sarah loved all of them. 
Sarah knew she'd found her special bell - the one she'd bought at the store. Everyday she rang it and sang her song, and it was the happiest sound in the world.
