Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park with their toys. One day, they saw a big slide that looked very fun. Ben wanted to try it, but Lily was scared.
"Come on, Lily, let's go on the slide. It will be brilliant!" Ben said.
"But it looks too high and too fast. And what if it is hot from the sun?" Lily said.
"Don't worry, Lily. I will go first and show you. It is not hot, it is cool. And it is not scary, it is exciting. Trust me, I recommend it!" Ben said.
He ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. He waved to Lily and slid down with a whoosh. He landed on the grass and laughed.
"See, Lily, that was so much fun! Do you want to try it now?" Ben said.
Lily watched Ben and saw that he was happy and safe. She felt a little brave and curious. She decided to give it a try.
"Okay, Ben, I will try it. But you have to wait for me at the bottom and catch me if I fall." Lily said.
"Of course, Lily, I will be right here. You can do it!" Ben said.
Lily walked to the slide and climbed up the ladder. She looked down and felt a little nervous. But she also saw Ben smiling and cheering for her. She took a deep breath and slid down with a whoosh. She landed on the grass and laughed.
"Wow, Lily, you did it! That was brilliant!" Ben said.
"Thank you, Ben, you were right. That was brilliant! And it was not hot, it was cool. And it was not scary, it was exciting. I'm glad you recommended it!" Lily said.
They hugged and high-fived. Then they ran to the slide again and again. They had a lot of fun and felt very proud. They were best friends.
