Once upon a time there was a young fish named Jake. Jake loved to explore the reef. He would swim around it every day and explore all of its nooks and crannies. 
One day, as he was exploring, he noticed something odd. He said to himself, "Where did all the coral go?". He looked around but he couldn't find it anywhere. 
Suddenly, he saw a magical bubble floating towards him. When it came close, it vanished! Jake gasped. He knew that he had to act fast if he wanted to see where it went. 
He jumped into the water and started swimming. He followed the bubble until it stopped at the edge of a cliff. Looking down he saw something strange- a secret hidden cave with glimmering objects inside it!
Jake curiously peered inside and saw a large collection of coral. He was amazed! He quickly swam down to retrieve the coral before it could vanish again! He was able to save the reef and protect all of the young fish living there.
Jake was proud of himself for saving the reef. He swam back to his home, with a big smile on his face.
