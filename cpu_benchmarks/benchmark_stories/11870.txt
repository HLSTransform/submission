Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was three years old and her name was Susie. Every day after school, Susie wanted to go to the caf√© with her Mom. She loved looking through the menu and picking out something delicious for dinner.
Today, Susie wanted to order some nachos. She picked out the mild version because she knew Mom would like it. The nachos came with her favorite cheese and some mild salsa on top. It was the perfect dinner for Susie and her Mom.
When the nachos arrived, Susie dug in. She thought the mild flavor was just right. She savored every bite and was glad she had picked nachos from the menu.
Once dinner was done, Susie and Mom asked for the check. They had had a delicious, mild meal and were both happy. 
The end!
