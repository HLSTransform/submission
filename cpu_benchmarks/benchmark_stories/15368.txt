Once upon a time, there was a boat. It was a big boat, and it sailed on the water.
On the boat there was a girl. She wore a pretty dress and she liked to play in the sunshine.
One day, the girl wanted to have an adventure. She kneeled down on the deck of the boat and wished for an adventure. Suddenly, something very spicy happened. The boat began to quiver and shake.
The girl was excited. She knew that she was off on a new adventure! The boat sailed over the waves and the girl laughed and smiled.
When the boat stopped, the girl looked around. She saw beautiful birds and tall trees. She had reached a new place and she was ready for a new adventure!
