Once there was a family of three that liked to have fun and always sang together. They loved to make music. One day, the father decided to bury something special in the backyard. He ran around, looking for the perfect spot, and then he took out a smooth, shiny box and buried it in the ground.
Everyone in the family was very excited. They kept wondering what was in the box and what the father was trying to hide. They asked the mother, but she just said it was a secret. 
The family cheered and danced as the father dug the box back up. The father opened it carefully and out came a surprise for everyone: a bright and colorful drum! 
The family hugged and jumped for joy as soon as they saw the drum. They all took turns having a go on it and soon made some smooth music together. They had so much fun that all their neighbors came over to listen and join in!
