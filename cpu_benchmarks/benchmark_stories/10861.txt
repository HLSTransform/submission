Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she found a shiny red shoe on the ground. It was so pretty! She put it on her foot and it fit perfectly. 
Lily walked around with her new shoe and felt very happy. She saw some birds playing in the trees and decided to join them. They sang songs and flew around together. It was a peaceful moment. 
After playing with the birds, Lily went back home. She showed her mom the new shoe and they both smiled. Lily felt grateful for her fun day outside and her new shoe. She went to bed that night with a happy heart.
