Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play dress up. They have many clothes and hats and shoes. They can be anything they want.
One day, they want to be pirates. They find black clothes and scarves and belts. They put them on and look in the mirror. They laugh and say "Arrr!"
They go to the living room and pretend it is a ship. They have a cardboard box for a treasure chest. They put some toys and coins inside. They say "This is our sight. No one can take it from us!"
But then, they hear a noise. It is their dog, Spot. He is curious. He comes to the living room and sees the box. He thinks it is a toy. He jumps on it and opens it. He takes out some toys and coins and runs away.
Lily and Ben are angry. They say "Spot, no! That is our sight! Give it back!" They chase him around the house. They try to catch him and get their sight back. But Spot is fast and clever. He hides and runs and plays.
Lily and Ben are tired. They stop and sit on the couch. They say "Spot is a bad pirate. He stole our sight. We are sad."
But then, they see Spot. He comes to them and wags his tail. He has a toy and a coin in his mouth. He drops them on their lap. He licks their face. He says "Woof!"
Lily and Ben smile. They say "Spot, you are a good pirate. You share your sight. We are happy." They hug him and play with him. They are friends.
