Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends went to the park to play hide and seek. 
Lily found a long towel on the ground and decided to hide behind it. Suddenly, she heard a voice saying, "I found you!" It was her friend, Tim. 
Lily giggled and said, "You're good at finding me, Tim." 
After playing for a while, it was time to go home. Lily's mom came to pick her up and said, "Let's go home, Lily. Don't forget to lock the door." 
Lily nodded and said, "Okay, Mommy. I will lock the door." 
And so, Lily and her mom went home, happy and tired from a fun day at the park.
