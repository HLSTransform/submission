One morning, Papa and Sid went outside to seat in the sun. Papa was excited for the new season. He said: "Sid, this season is very important. We need to be sure to enjoy it!" Sid nodded his head in agreement. 
They seated outside for a long time, soaking up the sun's warm rays. After a while, Mama joined them and said the skies were getting darker. Papa and Sid looked up and saw black clouds rolling in. 
Mama said: "We need to hurry inside, Sid! It looks like a storm is coming." Papa and Sid quickly got up and ran inside. Papa waited by the window to see what would happen.
Sure enough, a few minutes later, the rain started pouring down. The thunder roared and the lightning lit up the sky. Papa said: "Well, Sid, I was right - this season is very important! We can be thankful we got inside in time." 
Sid smiled and nodded, feeling lucky that he and Papa had made it inside before the storm.
