Once upon a time, there was a frog called Joe. Joe loved to explore and find new things.
One day, Joe decided to go to the swamp. He was excited to see what was there. 
When he arrived, he saw two worms talking to each other. Joe was surprised, and he jumped over to introduce himself. 
The worms were very friendly, and they asked him to stay for a while. The three of them talked and laughed together. 
Suddenly, it started to rain very heavily. The worms said that Joe had to stay with them and said he should hide in a tight hole. Joe thought it would be ok, so he stayed in the hole.
It kept raining for days and days and soon, Joe was stuck in the tight hole. He was scared and he cried for help, but nobody heard him. 
Joe was stuck in the swamp forever and ever. 
The end.
