Once there was a girl named Jane. Jane wanted to learn how to ride a bike. So her mom went outside with her. She put the bike on the ground and told Jane to wait. Jane watched her mom carefully. Her mom taught her how to use the pedals, and how to turn the handlebars. The bike had wide wheels and was a lot to learn. But Jane was brave and listened carefully. Her mom said to practice and wait until she felt ready to try. So Jane practiced and practiced until she felt like she could do it on her own. Finally, Jane was riding the bike on her own! She was so proud. She waved to her mom and thanked her for teaching her. Jane was so happy that she had learned to ride the bike!
