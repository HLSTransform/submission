Once upon a time, there were two brave warriors, Will and Grace. They were ready to fight for victory. Will looked at Grace and said, "Are you ready?" Grace nodded her head and smiled.
Will and Grace then each grabbed a wooden sword and shield. They started to practice how to fight and block. Will would try to hit Grace with his sword and Grace would swing her shield to block it.
After an hour, Will and Grace felt ready for battle. They ran outside, ready to fight. No one was there. Will asked Grace, "Where is our opponent?" Grace began to look around, but there was no one.
Then, Grace spotted a flag on a hill. She pointed at the flag and shouted, "Victory!" Will and Grace looked at each other in excitement and ran to the top of the hill. When they reached the top, they realized they had won the battle and they felt victorious, ready to celebrate their victory!
