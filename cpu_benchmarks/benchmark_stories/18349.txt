Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a funny little girl named Amy. She loved to play with her toy triangle. She would make it dance and sing. Amy had lots of fun with her triangle.
One day, it started to rain. Amy wanted to play outside, but her mom said, "No, it is wet and you will get sick." Amy was sad, but she had an idea. She took her triangle and played inside the house. She made her triangle dance in the rain.
Amy's friends saw her playing inside and wanted to join. They all played with their toys and had lots of fun, even though it was raining. They learned that they could have fun inside the house too.
The moral of the story is that even when things don't go the way you want, you can still find a way to have fun and be happy.
