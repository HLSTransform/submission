Once upon a time, there was a little fish called Bobby. Bobby had a big wish. He wanted to have something delicious to eat. But all Bobby could find in the sea was seaweed. One day, Bobby asked his mother if there was anything better than seaweed. His mother got a twinkle in her eye and said, "I can give you the most incredible thing in the world. I promise I will get you some tuna if you follow me." Bobby was so excited he could barely contain himself! He swam after his mother and they came to a magical cave. Inside the cave, Bobby saw a big pile of golden tuna. He couldn't believe his eyes! Bobby gobbled as much tuna as he could, saying thank you to his mother. His mother smiled and said, "You are welcome, Bobby. I promised you the most incredible thing in the world and here it is!" Bobby smiled and enjoyed his delicious treat!
