Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to school because he got to play with his friends and learn new things. One day, Timmy's teacher asked him to help her push the blackboard to the other side of the room. Timmy was very excited to help, so he pushed with all his might.
As Timmy was pushing, he noticed that the blackboard was very heavy and he was starting to feel weak. "I can't do it!" Timmy exclaimed. But his teacher encouraged him and said, "You can do it, Timmy! Just keep pushing!" So Timmy pushed and pushed until the blackboard was finally in its new spot.
Timmy felt so proud of himself for helping his teacher. "I did it!" he shouted. His teacher smiled and said, "Yes, you did! You're such a strong and helpful boy." Timmy beamed with happiness and went back to his seat, feeling like he could do anything.
