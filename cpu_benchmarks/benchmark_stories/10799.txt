Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to help her in the kitchen. She said, "Timmy, can you count how many potatoes we need for dinner tonight?" Timmy counted the potatoes and said, "We need five potatoes, Mommy!"
As Timmy and his mom were cooking, they heard a knock at the door. It was their neighbor, Mrs. Smith. She had a big turkey with her and she said, "I have too much turkey for my family. Would you like to have some, Timmy and Mommy?" Timmy's mom said, "Yes please, Mrs. Smith! Thank you so much!" 
Timmy's mom was careful when she cooked the turkey, making sure it was cooked just right. When dinner was ready, Timmy's dad came home and they all sat down to eat. Timmy said, "Mommy, this turkey is so yummy! Thank you for being careful when you cooked it." Everyone laughed and enjoyed their delicious dinner together.
