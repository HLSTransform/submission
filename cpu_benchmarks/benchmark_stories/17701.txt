Fred was a little puppy. He was so excited to go outside and play! He smelled the fresh air and ran around with joy.
Suddenly, Fred felt tired. He yawned, which made him even more sleepy. He tried to keep playing, but it was no use. Fred found a cozy spot and curled up for a nap.
But Fred wasn't alone! Nearby, he heard a gentle voice casting a spell. It seemed like a magical spell that was keeping Fred safe and sound.
The spell came from a careless fairy. She had fallen asleep while practicing her magic!
Fred was so happy that he was feeling better! He stretched and yawned one more time before heading off to explore again. He had a feeling the careless fairy was watching him with a smile and it made Fred so happy.
