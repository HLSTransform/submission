Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a baby. Mommy wanted to make something special for the baby so she decided to bake a cake. Mommy used lots of yummy ingredients to make the cake.
Mommy mixed up some green batter. She poured it into a pan and put it in the oven. Then she waited and watched the cake bake. 
Suddenly, Mommy heard a loud crash! When Mommy looked outside, she was surprised to see lightning streaking across the sky. It was so bright and exciting! 
When the lightning was gone, Mommy's cake was ready. It smelled so yummy, the baby couldn't wait to take a bite. They both enjoyed the cake with its yummy green frosting. 
The baby smiled and said, “Yum! Mommy made a very special cake!”
