Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved her blanket very much. It was warm and cozy, and she took it with her everywhere she went. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She was playing on the swings when she saw a little boy who looked very cold. 
Lily felt sad for the boy, so she went over to him and asked if he wanted to share her blanket. The boy was very grateful and snuggled under the amazing blanket with Lily. They played together for a while, and the boy went home feeling happy and warm. 
Lily's mom was very proud of her for sharing her blanket and helping someone in need. She explained to Lily that it's always nice to help others and to order your things in a way that you can share them with others. From that day on, Lily made sure to always bring an extra blanket with her to the park, just in case someone else needed it too.
