Once upon a time there was a colorful bottle. It was filled with the most amazing sounds. Everywhere the bottle went it sang sweet tunes. People stopped to listen and smiled with joy.
One day the bottle went to a park. There were children playing and laughing. The bottle wanted them to hear its music. So, it flew to the swing set and sang its loudest song. All the children stopped and looked around in wonder.
The bottle sang and sang until it couldn't sing anymore. When it stopped the children cheered with delight. They asked the bottle to sing again and it sang even louder. The children laughed and danced to the cheerful music. 
The bottle was so happy that everyone was listening to it. The sun went down and the children said goodbye to the bottle. The bottle watched them all walk away, still listening to its beautiful music.
