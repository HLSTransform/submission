Once upon a time, there was a little boy who liked to zoom around the house. He especially liked to go outside and play in the garden.
One day, he saw a jar in the garden. Inside the jar there were some sour green apples. He decided to try one, so he reached in and grabbed one out of the jar.
When he bit into the apple, it was so sour that he made a funny face! The little boy did not like the sour apple and soon decided that he did not want to eat it anymore.
But he still wanted to play with something, so he grabbed the jar and started to zoom around the garden with it. He had so much fun that he forgot all about the sour apple!
