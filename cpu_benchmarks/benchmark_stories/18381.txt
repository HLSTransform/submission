Once upon a time, there was a big ranch. On the ranch, there were many animals. One day, a little dog named Spot was very impatient. He wanted to play with his friend, the horse.
Spot ran to the horse and said, "Let's play now!" The horse was busy eating and said, "Wait, please." But Spot did not want to wait. He wanted to play right away. The horse did not like that Spot was so impatient.
Then, an old wise owl saw the problem. He flew down and said to Spot, "You need to pause and learn to wait." Spot did not understand. The owl explained, "When you wait, your friends will be happy to play with you."
Spot listened to the owl and learned to pause and wait. He became a better friend to the horse and all the other animals on the ranch. The moral of the story is that it's important to be patient and wait for our friends.
