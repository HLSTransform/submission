Once upon a time there was a little infant. She was only 3 days old and very small. She was snuggled up close to her mama and dad.
Unfortunately, one day, something terrible happened. The baby started to suffer from a sickness and nothing her parents did could make her better.
The poor family were so sorry that the baby was ill. They did all they could to help her. They bought her the best medicines and even called the doctor to see what could be done.
But the infant continued to suffer and her parents had to stay with her night and day to keep her safe. Eventually, the baby was cured and things went back to how they were before.
This story teaches us that it is important to stay strong when something bad happens. Even though it can be difficult to watch somebody suffer, it is worth it in the end if that person can be helped. In this case, the infant was helped and the family was able to go back to their happy life again.
