Once upon a time, there was a drum. The drum was very special and made lots of interesting sounds. But it had never been used.
One day, a brave girl wanted to know what would happen if she tried to make the drum rise. She looked around and saw a stick that seemed just the right size.
The brave girl picked up the stick and hit the top of the drum. The drum started to rise, getting higher and higher. Soon, the drum was up in the air.
As the drum hovered above the ground, the girl could hear beautiful music. Everyone around was amazed. They asked her why the drum was rising. The brave girl just smiled, she wasn't sure herself.
The drum began to slowly descend. Eventually it stopped, sitting in the same spot where it had been. The brave girl had made something very interesting happen!
