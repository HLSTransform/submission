Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. He loved to play all day. One day, he found an amazing toy car. Tom was so happy and played with the car all day and night.
His mom told him, "Tom, you need to stop playing and go to bed at night. It is important to rest." But Tom did not listen. He played with the car even when it was dark outside.
After a few days, Tom was very tired. He could not play or have fun anymore. He learned that he must stop playing at night and go to bed. From that day on, Tom always listened to his mom and had a good night's sleep. And he felt amazing every day.
