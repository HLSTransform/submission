Once upon a time, there was a big elephant named Ellie. Ellie was very friendly and loved to play with her animal friends in the jungle. One day, Ellie met a little monkey named Max. Max wanted to play with Ellie, but he was too scared to follow her into the jungle.
"Don't be afraid, Max," said Ellie. "I'll show you a quiet place in the jungle where we can play together."
Max followed Ellie through the jungle and they found a quiet clearing where they could play. Ellie showed Max how to play with a ball and they had lots of fun together. After playing for a while, Max said, "Thank you, Ellie. You're my big friend!"
Ellie smiled and said, "You're welcome, Max. I'm happy to have a new friend to play with." From that day on, Max followed Ellie everywhere and they had many more adventures together in the jungle.
