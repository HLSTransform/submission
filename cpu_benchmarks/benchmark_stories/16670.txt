Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to ride the bus with her mom every day. One day, Lily saw a brilliant toy in the store and she wanted it so much. She asked her mom if they could buy it, but her mom said no.
Lily was sad and started to cry. Her mom told her, "If I buy you that toy, it will spoil you. You won't appreciate the toys you already have." Lily didn't understand what "spoil" meant, but she knew she wanted the toy.
The next day, Lily saw a boy on the bus playing with the same toy she wanted. She said, "That's a brilliant toy! Where did you get it?" The boy replied, "My mom bought it for me, but I don't really like it. I wish I had your toy instead."
Lily realized that her mom was right. She was happy with the toys she already had and didn't need the new one. She said to her mom, "I don't want that toy anymore. I love my toys." Her mom smiled and said, "That's great, Lily. You're such a good girl."
