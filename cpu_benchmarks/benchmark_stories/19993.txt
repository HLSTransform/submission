Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play by the river. One day, they found a big raft made of wood and rope. They wanted to ride on it and have fun.
"Let's go on the raft!" Lily said. "It looks attractive and strong."
"OK, but we have to be careful," Ben said. "The river is fast and deep."
They climbed on the raft and pushed it into the water. They felt happy and excited as the raft moved with the current. They saw fish, birds and flowers along the way.
But soon, they came to a narrow part of the river, where there were many rocks and branches. The raft was too big to fit through the gap. It got stuck and started to break.
"Help! Help!" Lily and Ben shouted. "We are in trouble!"
They were scared and did not know what to do. They wished they had listened to their parents, who told them not to go near the river without an adult.
Luckily, a man who was fishing nearby heard their cries and came to help. He threw them a rope and pulled them to the shore. He also rescued the raft and fixed it.
"Thank you, thank you!" Lily and Ben said. "You saved us!"
"You're welcome, but you should not have gone on the raft without permission," the man said. "The river is dangerous and the raft is not safe. You could have been hurt or drowned."
"We are sorry, we were foolish," Lily and Ben said. "We learned our lesson. We will never do that again."
They hugged the man and thanked him again. Then they ran back to their homes and told their parents what happened. Their parents were angry but also relieved. They hugged them and forgave them.
Lily and Ben never forgot that day. They realized that the raft was not as attractive as it seemed, and that they should always be careful and obey their parents. They also appreciated the kindness of the man who helped them. They became more responsible and wise.
