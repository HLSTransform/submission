Once upon a time there were two friends named Joe and Lou. Joe and Lou went to the opera together. Joe was very jolly and said, "Letâ€™s go explore the opera house!"
So Joe and Lou ran around the opera house, looking at all the cool sights. Joe said, "This is so much fun!" Lou said, "Let's look in this room!"
The two friends opened the door and found a big beautiful stage! They saw a man dressed in fancy clothes singing happy songs. Joe said, "Look! It's an opera!" Lou clapped her hands and said, "This is so jolly!"
The two friends watched the show, laughing and singing along. They had so much fun that they went back to the opera every weekend. And every time they left, they felt very jolly.
