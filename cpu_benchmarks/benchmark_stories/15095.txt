Once upon a time, there lived a curious little boy named Jack. He always loved to explore. One day, he was exploring his house when he stumbled upon a strange metallic box. Upon examining it, he realized that the box was a refrigerator! 
Jack was filled with excitement and could not wait to have a peek inside. He opened the door, and sure enough, the refrigerator was filled with delicious food. Jack was so overwhelmed, he couldn't help but reach out and grab something to eat. All of a sudden, a voice called out.
“Jack! What do you think you’re doing?” It was his mom.
Jack looked up, a little sheepish. “I was being curious,” he replied.
“Well, curiosity is good,” Mom said, “but let’s make sure you feed yourself properly, okay?”
Jack nodded, and was happy to find that his mom was not mad. She helped him pick some healthy food to eat and he enjoyed his meal. After that, Jack knew he should always feed himself properly, but it was okay to be curious too!
