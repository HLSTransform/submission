Sara and Ben were at the beach with their mom and dad. They liked to play in the sand and look for shells and rocks. Sara found a big, round shell that was closed. She wondered what was inside.
"Look, Ben, I found an oyster!" she said, holding up the shell.
"Can I see?" Ben asked, reaching for the shell.
Sara did not want to share. She wanted to keep the oyster for herself. She acted mean and pushed Ben away.
"Go away, Ben, it's mine!" she said.
Ben felt sad and angry. He ran to their mom and told her what Sara did.
Mom was not happy. She went to Sara and took the oyster from her.
"Sara, that was not nice. You should share with your brother. He is your friend. How would you feel if he did that to you?" she said.
Sara felt bad. She knew she was wrong. She looked at the oyster and saw that it was not very pretty. It was gray and hard and had no color.
"I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry, Ben. I was fearful that Ben would take my oyster. But it's not a good oyster. It's ugly and boring. I don't want it anymore," she said.
Mom smiled and hugged Sara.
"It's okay, Sara. I'm glad you said sorry. But you know, sometimes oysters have a surprise inside. They have a shiny, white thing called a pearl. It's very beautiful and rare. Maybe this oyster has one. Do you want to open it and see?" she said.
Sara nodded. She was curious. She and Ben helped Mom open the oyster. Inside, they saw a small, round pearl. It sparkled in the sun.
"Wow, it's a pearl!" Sara said.
"It's so pretty!" Ben said.
Mom gave the pearl to Sara.
"Here, Sara, this is for you. You can keep it as a reminder to be kind and generous. Sharing is caring. And sometimes, when you share, you get something better in return," she said.
Sara smiled and thanked Mom. She felt happy. She gave the pearl to Ben.
"Here, Ben, you can have it. I want to share it with you. You are my friend. And friends are more precious than pearls," she said.
Ben smiled and hugged Sara. He thanked her and put the pearl in his pocket.
They played together in the sand and had fun. They learned a lesson that day. They learned that oysters are not always what they seem. And they learned that acting nice is better than acting mean.
