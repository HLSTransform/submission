Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars and trucks all day long. One day, Timmy's mom told him they had to go to the store to buy some food. Timmy was excited to go because he loved to ride in the shopping cart.
At the store, Timmy saw a man with a big nose. Timmy thought the man was nosy because he kept looking at everyone. Timmy's mom told him not to stare at people because it's not nice.
While they were walking down the aisle, Timmy saw a shiny knife. He asked his mom if he could have it, but his mom said no because it's not safe for kids to play with knives. Timmy understood because he knew knives can cut things.
After they finished shopping, Timmy's mom told him they have to follow the law and pay for the food before leaving the store. Timmy didn't know what the law was, but he knew it was important to do what his mom said. They paid for the food and went home to make dinner. Timmy was happy because he got to ride in the shopping cart and learn new words.
