John had a phone. He used it to talk and play games. One day he asked a question. He held the phone up to his ear and heard the dull sound of a dial tone. He was confused. He looked at the phone and shook it, wondering what was wrong.
He asked his mom. She told him it meant that no one was answering his call. John asked how he could reach someone. His mom said he would have to dial a number and wait for someone to answer.
John tried again. He dialed a number and this time heard the sound of someone speaking. He smiled. Now he could ask his question and get an answer. He talked excitedly shouting his question.
His mom looked at him and smiled. She was proud that he could use the phone to get the answer he wanted.
