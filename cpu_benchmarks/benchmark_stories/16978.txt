Tom and Anna like to play in the park. They have a big bucket of seeds. They want to feed the birds. They scatter the seeds on the grass and wait for the birds to come.
But then the sky turns dark and it starts to rain. The rain is very heavy and fast. The park becomes a flood. The water covers the grass and the seeds. The birds fly away.
"Oh no!" Tom says. "The seeds are gone! The birds are hungry!"
"Don't be sad," Anna says. "We can share our cookies with the birds. They are sweet and yummy."
Tom and Anna take out their cookies from their backpacks. They break them into small pieces. They throw the pieces on the water. The birds see the cookies and come back. They eat the cookies and sing.
"Look!" Tom says. "The birds are happy! They like our cookies!"
"Yes!" Anna says. "We are good friends to the birds!"
Tom and Anna smile and hug. They watch the birds and listen to their songs. They don't mind the rain. They are happy too.
