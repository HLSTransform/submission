Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play together. One day, they go to the park with their moms. The sun is hot and bright. Lily and Tom feel thirsty and tired.
They see a fountain in the park. It has water that goes up and down. Lily and Tom run to the fountain. They want to splash in the water. They think it will be cool and fun.
But when they get to the fountain, they hear some people talking. They talk in a language that Lily and Tom do not understand. They sound different and strange. Lily and Tom feel scared and curious.
"Who are they?" Lily asks Tom.
"I don't know," Tom says. "Maybe they are from another place."
Lily and Tom watch the people. They see that they are smiling and laughing. They look happy and friendly. Lily and Tom feel brave and interested.
"Hello," Lily says to the people.
"Hello," one of the people says back. "What is your name?"
"I am Lily. This is Tom. We are friends."
"I am Ana. This is Marco. We are friends too. We are from Spain. We speak Spanish. That is our language."
"Wow," Lily says. "That is a nice language. Can you teach us some words?"
"Sure," Ana says. "How about agua? That means water."
"Agua," Lily and Tom repeat. "That is easy and fun."
They learn some more words from Ana and Marco. They splash in the water together. They feel happy and cool. They make new friends. They like to learn new languages.
