Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a special doll named Angel. Lily loved Angel very much because she was so pretty and delicate.
Lily wanted to play with Angel all the time, but her mommy told her that Angel was fragile and she needed to be careful with her. Lily promised to be gentle and take good care of Angel.
One night, Lily went to bed and left Angel on the shelf. While she was asleep, a gust of wind blew through the window and knocked Angel off the shelf. Angel fell to the ground and broke into many pieces.
Lily woke up in the morning and saw Angel on the floor. She was very sad and started to cry. Her mommy came in and saw what had happened. She hugged Lily and told her it was okay. She explained that accidents happen and that she still loves Lily very much. From that day on, Lily learned to trust her mommy's advice and to be careful with her fragile toys.
