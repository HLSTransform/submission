Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a copper penny that he loved to show to his friends. One day, Timmy went to the park with his friends. They saw a big swing and Timmy wanted to try it. He sat on the swing and started to swing higher and higher. It was so much fun! Suddenly, Timmy's penny fell out of his pocket and he couldn't find it. Timmy's friends saw him looking sad and they decided to help. They all looked for the penny together and finally found it! Timmy was so happy and thanked his fair friends. From that day on, Timmy knew that his friends would always be there to help him.
