Lily and Tom were happy. They wanted to have a picnic in the park. They packed some bread, cheese, fruit and juice in a large basket. They took a blanket and a ball too.
They walked to the park with their mom. They found a nice spot under a big tree. They spread the blanket on the grass and put the basket on it. They were ready to start their picnic.
"Can I have some juice, please?" Lily asked.
"Sure, here you go," mom said and gave her a cup.
"Can I have some cheese, please?" Tom asked.
"Sure, here you go," mom said and gave him a slice.
They ate and drank and talked. They were having fun.
Then they heard a loud roar. They looked up and saw a large bear. The bear was hungry. It smelled the food. It ran towards them.
"Run, run, run!" mom shouted.
They grabbed the blanket and the ball and ran. But the basket was too heavy. They had to leave it behind.
The bear reached the basket. It opened it and ate everything. It was happy.
Lily, Tom and mom were sad. They had no picnic. They had no food. They had to go home. They were scared of the bear. They did not have fun.
