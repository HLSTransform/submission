Once upon a time there was a cute little bear named Beary. He lived in a big forest with a lot of other animals. Every day Beary would go out to find something to do.
One day, he came upon a bucket in the forest. He had never seen a bucket before, so he decided to take a closer look. He poked and prodded at it and he was so curious!
Suddenly, a voice came from behind Beary. It was a squirrel! "Hey Beary," the squirrel said. "Do you want to play a game with me?"
Beary was so excited. He asked the squirrel what the game was called. The squirrel smiled and said, "It's called Bucket Toss. I'll throw the bucket up in the air and you catch it!" Beary thought this game sounded like fun, so he agreed to play.
He tossed the bucket up and Beary managed to catch the bucket every time. After a few rounds of playing, the squirrel thanked Beary for a fun game and the two went their separate ways. 
It was a fun day in the forest that day, and Beary was very glad he had asked the squirrel to play.
