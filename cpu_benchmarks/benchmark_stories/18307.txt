Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She wore a pretty skirt that twirled when she spun around. One day, Lily went for a walk in the park. She saw a tree with a delicious apple at the top. She wanted to eat it, but it was too high to reach. 
Lily looked around and saw a peaceful pond with some ducks swimming in it. She walked over to the pond and sat down. Suddenly, a duck waddled over to her and quacked loudly. Lily was scared at first, but then the duck started to flap its wings and fly up towards the apple. 
The duck grabbed the apple with its beak and brought it down to Lily. She was so happy and thanked the duck. From that day on, Lily and the duck became the best of friends and went on many peaceful walks in the park together.
