Once there was a little boy named Josh who was three years old. He was very curious and always asked a lot of questions. So one day he asked his mom, "Mama, why do we sneeze?"
Mama smiled and said, "When something tickles your nose, then you sneeze. It's your body's way of getting rid of unwanted things and keeping you healthy."
Josh was excited to learn something new so he decided to go and explore the world around him. He went outside and and smelled some flowers. As he got closer though, they tickled his nose and he sneezed. 
Mama laughed and said, "See, I told you! That was your body's way of saying, 'Hey this is not what I want!' " 
Then Josh asked, "But how does it help me stay healthy?"
Mama replied, "It keeps the unwanted things away from you. It's like having a protector who takes good care of you and keeps you safe."
Josh was so happy to learn something new. He was also very anxious to try it again. He said, "Let's go get some cake, Mama! I want to test my sneezing."
Mama agreed and they went to get some cake. As they walked into the bakery, delicious smells filled the air. Josh took a deep breath and felt a tickle in his nose
