Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a big, red cookie jar. It was full of yummy cookies. Tim loved to eat cookies every day.
One day, Tim saw that his original cookie was gone. He looked everywhere, but the cookie was not there. It had disappeared! Tim was very sad. He asked his mom, "Where did my cookie go?"
His mom said, "I saw your sister take it. She must have eaten it." Tim was still sad, but he knew there were more cookies in the jar. He decided to share the cookies with his sister, so they could both be happy.
From that day on, Tim and his sister always shared their cookies. They had lots of fun eating them together. And Tim's original cookie was never forgotten.
