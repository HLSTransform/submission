Once upon a time there was a puppy named Anna. She was black and fluffy and loved to play all day long. One day, Anna was trying to learn a new trick but she just couldn't seem to get it right. She kept trying and trying and she was feeling very ashamed.
Finally, after a lot of hard work, Anna got the trick right. She was so excited and ran over to show her family. Everyone clapped and cheered and Anna was so happy that she barked and wagged her tail.
Her family all asked Anna to do the trick again, so she did. Then, they gave her a lot of rubs and treats. Anna felt so good that she was wagging her tail with joy!
Everyone was so proud of Anna and they applauded her as she finished her trick. Anna was so happy that she did a big jump in the air and every one cheered. Anna was so proud and she knew she had done a big job!
