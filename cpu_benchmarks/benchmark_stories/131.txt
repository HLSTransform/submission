Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat avocados, they were her favorite food. One day, Lily and her mom went to the grocery store to buy some avocados. They picked a bright green one and brought it home.
When they got home, Lily's little brother Jack was playing with his toys. Lily wanted to show Jack the avocado and said, "Look Jack, we got a big green avocado!" Jack looked up and yelled, "Wow, it's so big!"
Lily's mom cut the avocado and they all had some for a snack. It was very yummy and they all smiled. Lily said, "I love avocados!" and Jack yelled, "Me too!"
