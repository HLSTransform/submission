Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Tim. He had a blue ball that he loved to play with. Tim would throw the ball up in the air and catch it. He was very happy when he played with his blue ball.
One day, Tim's friend, Sam, came to play. Sam wanted to play with the blue ball too. But Tim did not want to share his ball. Tim and Sam started to disagree about who could play with the blue ball.
They argued and argued until they were very mad at each other. Tim and Sam did not want to be friends anymore. They both went home, feeling very sad. The blue ball was left all alone, and nobody played with it again.
