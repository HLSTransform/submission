Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play at the gym. The gym has many things to do. They can run, jump, climb, swing, and slide. They have fun at the gym.
One day, Anna and Ben go to the gym with their moms. They see a new thing at the gym. It is a big ball. It is soft and round. It is blue and yellow. Anna and Ben want to try the ball.
They ask their moms if they can play with the ball. Their moms say yes, but they have to be careful. The ball is big and heavy. They have to share the ball and not push or hit each other.
Anna and Ben go to the ball. They take turns to sit on the ball and bounce. They laugh and giggle. They roll the ball to each other and catch it. They have more fun with the ball.
After a while, they feel tired. They stop playing with the ball. They go to their moms and drink some water. They sit on a mat and relax. They breathe slowly and close their eyes.
Their moms smile and say, "You did a good job, Anna and Ben. You played well with the ball. The ball is useful. It helps you exercise and relax. Do you like the ball?"
Anna and Ben nod and say, "Yes, we like the ball. The ball is fun. Can we play with the ball again?"
Their moms say, "Sure, you can play with the ball again. But now, it is time to go home. Say bye to the ball and the gym. We will come back another day."
Anna and Ben say bye to the ball and the gym. They hug their moms and go home. They are happy and sleepy. They dream of the ball and the gym.
