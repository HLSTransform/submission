Once upon a time there was a tidy girl. She was out playing one day when she found a bottle. She was so excited, so she showed it to her mum. 
“Look mum! I found a bottle!" she said. Her mum smiled and said, “That is lovely. Put it somewhere safe.” 
The girl did as she was asked and put the bottle in a safe place. But then something strange happened. The girl noticed that when she got close to the bottle, it began to repeat what she said. 
The girl was so excited and began to repeat things to the bottle. But then she made a mistake. She said something she shouldn’t have and the bottle repeated it too. Her mum heard it and was so angry. 
The girl felt bad and her mum was very angry. She was told to put the bottle away and never speak to it again. The girl was sad and put the bottle away in a very safe spot, never to speak to it again. 
The end.
