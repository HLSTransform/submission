Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a cactus in her backyard. It had lots of prickly needles on it. Lily was curious about it, but her mom warned her not to touch it.
Later that day, Lily's little brother started to misbehave. He was throwing his toys and making a big mess. Lily's mom told him to calm down and behave. She reminded him that if he didn't behave, he wouldn't be able to go outside and play with Lily.
The next day, Lily and her brother went outside to play. They saw the cactus again, but this time they remembered to be careful and not touch it. They played together and had so much fun. Lily's brother behaved and didn't make a mess. They were both happy and calm. The end.
