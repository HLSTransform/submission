Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to look at the flowers and the bugs. They saw a butterfly with yellow and black wings. It was very pretty.
"Wow, look at the butterfly!" Lily said. "Can we catch it?"
Ben nodded. He ran to get a net. He wanted to keep the butterfly in a jar. He thought it would be fun.
But Lily did not want that. She knew the butterfly needed to fly and find food. She did not want to make it sad. She wanted to prevent Ben from catching it.
She ran after him and shouted, "No, Ben, stop! The butterfly does not want to go in the jar. It will be cold and lonely. Let it go!"
Ben did not listen. He swung the net at the butterfly. He almost caught it. But Lily was faster. She jumped in front of the net and blocked it. The butterfly flew away.
"Hey, why did you do that?" Ben asked. He was angry. He wanted the butterfly.
"Because it is not nice to catch the butterfly," Lily said. "It is not a toy. It is a living thing. It has feelings. It wants to be free."
Ben looked at Lily. He saw that she was right. He felt sorry. He put down the net.
"Sorry, Lily," he said. "You are a good friend to the butterfly. I did not think about that. Can we still be friends?"
Lily smiled. She hugged Ben.
"Of course we can," she said. "We can still play in the garden. But we have to be gentle with the bugs. They are our friends too."
They held hands and went to look for more flowers and bugs. They saw the butterfly again. It was flying happily. They waved at it and said, "Bye, butterfly!"
