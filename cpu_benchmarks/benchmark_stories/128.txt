Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go on adventures with her family. One day, they went on a trip in their car. Lily sat in the back seat with her brother, Max. 
As they drove down the road, Lily noticed a noisy sound coming from the trunk. "What's that noise?" she asked her mom. "It's probably just some things bouncing around in the trunk," her mom replied. 
Lily and Max were curious, so they asked if they could see what was in the trunk. Their dad pulled over and opened the trunk. They saw lots of bags and boxes, but one box was making the noisy sound. 
When they opened the box, they found a toy car that Max had forgotten to put away properly. "I'm sorry," Max said. "I didn't know it would be so noisy." Lily forgave him and they all continued on their adventure, happy to have solved the mystery of the noisy trunk.
