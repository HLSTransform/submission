Lily liked to follow her big brother Tom everywhere. She wanted to do what he did and learn from him. Tom was good at many things, like drawing, reading and playing games. He had a big brain and many original ideas.
One day, Tom decided to make a rocket out of cardboard boxes, tape and paint. He told Lily to help him and follow his instructions. Lily was happy to help, but she also wanted to add her own touches. She found some stickers, glitter and feathers and stuck them on the rocket. She thought it looked more fun and pretty.
Tom was not happy when he saw what Lily had done. He said she ruined his rocket and made it look silly. He said she should follow him, not do her own thing. He said she had a small brain and no original ideas.
Lily felt sad and hurt. She did not want to make Tom angry, but she also liked to be creative. She ran away to her room and cried. She wished Tom would like her rocket and her ideas.
Mom heard Lily crying and came to see what was wrong. She saw the rocket and smiled. She said it was a wonderful rocket and she loved how Lily decorated it. She said Lily had a big brain and many original ideas. She said she was proud of Lily for being herself and not just following others.
Lily felt better and hugged Mom. She said she was sorry for upsetting Tom, but she also liked her rocket. Mom said it was okay to follow Tom sometimes, but it was also good to be original sometimes. She said Tom would calm down and see that Lily's rocket was not ruined, but different.
She asked Lily if she wanted to play with the rocket with her. Lily said yes and smiled. She hoped Tom would join them later and see that they could all have fun with their big brains and original ideas.
