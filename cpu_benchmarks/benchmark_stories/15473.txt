Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jane. Jane was very spoiled and always got whatever she wanted. One day, she wanted a pair of sunglasses. Her mom said that if Jane managed to be nice all day, she could have the sunglasses.
So, Jane managed to be good all day. She smiled, gave her baby brother a toy, and even ate all of her dinner. Her mom was so proud of her for managing to be good.
At the end of the day, Jane's mom took her to the store and she got a pair of brand new sunglasses. Jane put them on with a big smile and enjoyed the way they made her face look. She was so proud of herself for managing to be good all day!
Jane went home and played with her new sunglasses all day. Everywhere she went, people admired her sunglasses. Jane was so happy with her new sunglasses and she never forgot how proud she felt that she managed to be good all day so she could have them.
