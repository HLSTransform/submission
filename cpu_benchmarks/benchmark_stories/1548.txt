Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big red case with her everywhere she went. One day, she went to the park to play. She saw her friend, Timmy, and ran over to him. 
"Hi, Timmy! Want to play with me?" asked Lily.
"Sure, what do you want to play?" replied Timmy.
"I want to play house. You can be the dad and I'll be the mom," said Lily.
"Okay, I can do that. Where should we set up our house?" asked Timmy.
"Over there, by the big tree," said Lily, pointing to a spot. 
So, they set up their house and played for hours. They were so busy having fun that they didn't even notice when it was time to go home. Lily picked up her red case and said goodbye to Timmy. She couldn't wait to come back and play again tomorrow.
