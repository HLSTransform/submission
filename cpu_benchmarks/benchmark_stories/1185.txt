Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had to choose a toy to play with at school. There were many toys, but he saw one that caught his sight. It was an ugly old toy that no one liked to play with. Tim thought it was special, so he chose it.
Every day, Tim played with the ugly toy. The other kids laughed at him, but Tim didn't care. He loved his ugly toy. One day, a new kid came to school and saw the toy. He wanted to play with it too. Tim didn't want to share, so the new kid was sad.
As days went by, Tim kept playing with the ugly toy. The new kid tried to make friends, but Tim wouldn't let him play. One day, the ugly toy broke. Tim was sad and had no toy to play with. The new kid still had no friends. The moral of the story is to always share and be kind, or you might end up sad and alone.
