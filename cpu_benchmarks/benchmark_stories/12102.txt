Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and eat his favorite snacks. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a sandwich to eat. Timmy loved sandwiches, but he didn't like the way his mom spread the peanut butter. 
"Mommy, can you spread the peanut butter faster?" Timmy asked.
His mom smiled and said, "Sure, Timmy. I'll spread it faster for you."
After his mom spread the peanut butter faster, Timmy picked up his sandwich and took a big bite. It tasted much better with the peanut butter spread faster! Timmy learned that sometimes it's okay to ask for help and that things can be done faster if you ask nicely.
