Once there was a little girl who really loved to celebrate. Every weekend her family celebrated something. One weekend they celebrated the sun. They put their hands out and shouted "hurray for the sun!"
One day there was a special celebration. The little girl went to the hospital to take an x-ray. She was a little bit shy because she didn't know what an x-ray was. But the doctor was so friendly and explained it to her.
When the x-ray was done she was so happy. Her family celebrated by having a big party. All her friends came over and they ate cake, played games, and had so much fun.
After the party was over the little girl knew that it was because of the x-ray that they had a reason to celebrate. She was so glad that she was able to take an x-ray and have a reason to celebrate with her family and friends.
