Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color. One day, Lily's mommy brought home a big turkey for dinner. 
Lily saw the turkey and said, "Wow, that's a big bird!" 
Her mommy said, "Yes, it is. But we have to cook it first before we can eat it." 
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I have an idea! Let's draw a picture of the turkey before we cook it." 
Her mommy thought that was a creative idea, so they took out their crayons and drew a picture of the turkey. 
After they finished drawing, they put the turkey in the oven to cook. When it was done, they took it out and put it on the table. 
Lily said, "Now we can eat the turkey and remember how creative we were when we drew it!"
