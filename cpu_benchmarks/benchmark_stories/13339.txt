Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily saw her friend throwing a candy wrapper on the ground. Lily said, "Don't waste that! We should put it in the trash can."
Her friend said, "Why does it matter? It's just a little piece of trash."
Lily replied, "Throwing trash on the ground isn't good for the Earth. We should be intelligent and take care of our planet."
Her friend realized Lily was right and said, "You're right, Lily. I'll put it in the trash can. Thank you for allowing me to learn something new." From that day on, Lily's friend made sure to always throw their trash away in the proper place.
