Anna and Ben are going to the airport with Mom and Dad. They are very happy because they are going to see Grandma and Grandpa. They have big bags with clothes and toys.
At the airport, there are many people and planes. Anna and Ben see a big sign that says "Welcome". They also see signs with pictures of animals and places. They like to look at the signs and say what they are.
Mom and Dad have tickets for the plane. They show the tickets to a lady who smiles and gives them stickers. Anna and Ben put the stickers on their shirts. They feel very special.
They follow the signs to the gate where their plane is. They see a big plane with a blue and white tail. They hear a man say their plane is ready to go. They walk to the door of the plane and say "bye" to the lady.
They find their seats on the plane and buckle their belts. They look out the window and see the airport get smaller and smaller. They wave to the signs and the people and the planes. They are very excited to see Grandma and Grandpa soon.
