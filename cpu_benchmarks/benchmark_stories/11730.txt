Once upon a time there was a little girl called Abby. Abby was very brave and strong, but one day she felt helpless.
It was a dark evening and Abby was standing in a room all by herself. She looked around and wondered what to do.
Then she saw a tall man wearing a suit and tie. He was walking towards her and Abby felt scared. He was a big man and his face looked serious.
The man stopped and said, “Abby, kneel down.” Abby was terrified and did not know what to do. She was scared and felt helpless.
But then she thought of all the brave things she had done in her life. She decided to kneel down and take this challenge.
The man smiled and said, “You are strong, Abby. I'm proud of you.”
Abby stood up and felt happier, like she had won something important. She had used her courage to face the situation and she felt proud of herself.
From that moment on, Abby always remembered the time she had felt helpless and knew she could get through anything in life.
