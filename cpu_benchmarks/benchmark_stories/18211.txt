Once upon a time, there was a big white dog named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to play in the yard. The yard had green grass and a big tree.
One day, Fluffy saw a little boy named Tim. Tim was sad because he lost his ball. Fluffy wanted to help Tim. So, Fluffy looked for the ball in the yard.
Fluffy found the ball under the big tree. Tim was very happy. He said "Thank you, Fluffy!" Tim clapped his hands to applaud Fluffy. They played in the yard together and became best friends.
