Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a video that he loved to watch every day. It was a video about a big, friendly dog who went on fun adventures. Tim would laugh and clap his hands when the dog would find hidden treasures.
One day, Tim could not find his video. He looked under his bed, behind the couch, and inside his toy box, but it was hidden very well. Tim started to complain to his mom. "Mom, I can't find my video!" he said with a sad face.
Mom came to help Tim look for the video. They searched the whole house together. Finally, Mom found the hidden video behind a big pillow. Tim was so happy that he hugged his mom and said, "Thank you, Mom!" Tim watched his favorite video with a big smile, and he did not complain anymore.
