Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, her mom gave her a delicate plate to decorate with pretty stickers. Lily was so excited! She carefully placed the stickers on the plate, making sure they looked just right. 
When she was finished, she showed the plate to her mom. Her mom was so proud of her! She said the plate was very pretty and delicate, just like a flower. Lily smiled and felt very happy. 
Later that day, they used the plate to have a yummy snack. Lily felt so special eating her snack on the plate she decorated all by herself. From that day on, Lily loved to decorate things and make them pretty, just like her special plate. The end.
