Sara liked to create things with her toys. She had many blocks, dolls, cars and animals. She liked to make houses, roads, farms and stories with them. She was very good at creating.
One day, her dad brought home a new toy. It was a microscope. He said it was a tool to see very small things that you cannot see with your eyes. He showed Sara how to use it. He put a drop of water on a slide and put it under the microscope. He let Sara look through the eye-piece.
"Wow!" Sara said. "What are those things? They are moving and swimming!"
"Those are called microbes," her dad said. "They are very tiny living things that are in the water. They are too small to see without the microscope. They are amazing, aren't they?"
Sara nodded. She was amazed. She wanted to see more. She asked her dad if she could use the microscope to see other things. He said yes, but she had to be careful and gentle with it. He said it was a very special and expensive toy.
Sara thanked her dad and hugged him. She was very happy. She said she would share the microscope with her friends. She said she wanted to learn more about the small things in the world. She said she was very humble and grateful for the microscope.
Her dad smiled. He was proud of Sara. He said she was a very smart and kind girl. He said he loved her very much. He said he was happy to see her create and explore with the microscope. He said he would help her whenever she needed. He said they could have fun and learn together.
