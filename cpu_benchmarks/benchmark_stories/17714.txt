Once there was a soldier who was very brave. He was wide and strong and wanted to study. He had a book that was as tall as him, and it was full of facts to learn. 
Every day the soldier studied the book. He looked very carefully at each page and learned lots of new words. He practiced writing with a pencil and drew pictures of flags and maps. 
The soldier was very clever. He studied hard and soon he knew everything that there was to learn in the book. He was so proud of himself and his accomplishments. 
The soldier was finally ready to show off his knowledge. He went to the town square and told everyone everything he knew. Everyone was so impressed with the soldier's wide knowledge, and he proudly marched back home. 
The end.
