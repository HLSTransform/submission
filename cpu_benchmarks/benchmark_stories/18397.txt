Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw on the sidewalk with chalk. One day, her friend Max came over to play.
"Can I draw with you?" Max asked.
"Of course!" Lily said. She poured some chalk onto the ground and they drew together.
Max looked at Lily's chalk and said, "Wow, your chalk is so modern!"
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you! I got it from my mom's store."
They spent the whole afternoon drawing and having fun. When it was time for Max to go home, Lily said, "Let's do this again soon!"
"Definitely!" Max replied. They hugged and said goodbye. Lily felt happy to have such a great friend to share her love of chalk with.
