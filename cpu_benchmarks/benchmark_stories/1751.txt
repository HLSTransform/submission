Once upon a time there was a little boy who went to the river. He was so excited and he ran as fast as he could. When he arrived, he saw the water and it was shiny and blue. His eyes sparkled!
He took off his shoes and socks. Then he stepped into the water. It felt so cool and he giggled. He waved his arms and jumped up and down. Splash, splash, splash!
He looked at his thumb and saw that it was wrinkled. He was patient and waited until it was normal again, but he still had fun. He jumped and splashed and the water rippled around him.
When he was done, he gave the river a big hug and said goodbye. He put his socks and shoes back on and ran home. He had so much fun splashing his thumb in the river.
