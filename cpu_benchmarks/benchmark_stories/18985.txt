There once was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy vehicle. It was a red car. He loved his car very much. He felt lucky to have it. He would hold the car and play with it all day.
One day, Tim went to the park with his mom. He took his lucky car with him. At the park, he saw a girl named Sue. Sue had a toy vehicle too. It was a blue truck. Tim and Sue played together with their vehicles.
Tim said to Sue, "I like your truck!" Sue smiled and said, "I like your car too!" They played and laughed together. They felt lucky to have their toy vehicles and a new friend to play with.
