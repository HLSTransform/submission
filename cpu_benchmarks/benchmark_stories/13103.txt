Once there were two friends who were looking for something interesting to do. The two friends decided to go on an adventure and follow a road they had never been down before.
The first friend thought it was a very long road. Even though they had been walking for a long time, the road never seemed to end.
The second friend thought it was an exciting adventure. Along the way, they saw many interesting things like trees, birds, and flowers. They also saw an old house and a tall bridge.
At the end of the road, the two friends reached a beautiful waterfall. They had so much fun exploring and playing in the waterfall.
The two friends had an amazing adventure! Even though they were tired from all their walking, they never forgot their journey down the interesting road.
