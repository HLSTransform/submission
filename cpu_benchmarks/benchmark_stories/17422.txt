Anna likes to play with her dolls. She has a big box where she keeps them. The box has a lock and a key. Anna knows where the key is. She hides it under her bed.
One day, Anna wants to play with her dolls. She goes to her room and looks under her bed. But the key is not there. Anna is sad. She thinks someone took her key. She asks her mom and dad, but they do not know. They are busy in the kitchen.
Anna does not give up. She looks everywhere for her key. She looks in the living room, in the bathroom, in the closet. She does not find it. She is very sad. She thinks she will never play with her dolls again.
Then she sees something shiny on the floor. It is her key. It fell out of her pocket when she was playing outside. Anna is happy. She picks up the key and runs to her room. She puts the key in the lock and turns it. The box opens. Anna sees her dolls. They are clean and pretty. They have soft hair and smooth skin. Anna hugs them and smiles. She is very happy. She says thank you to the key. She puts the key back under her bed. She plays with her dolls all day.
