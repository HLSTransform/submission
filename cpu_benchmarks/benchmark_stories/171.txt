Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the water. He would jump and splash in the big puddles after it rained. One day, Timmy went to the beach with his mommy and daddy. They brought a big flag to put in the sand. Timmy loved the flag because it was red and had white stripes. He thought it was so pretty. But then, a big wave came and splashed Timmy and the flag. The water was bad and salty, and Timmy didn't like it. But he still loved playing in the sand and watching the flag wave in the wind. The end.
