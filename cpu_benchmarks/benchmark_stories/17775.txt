Once there was a kid named Jimmy. He was 3 years old and he didn't understand a lot of things. One day, Jimmy was playing in a park near his house when he saw something that was very tall. It was called a cliff and it was huge! He couldn't believe how tall it was. 
Jimmy wanted to understand the cliff so he asked his mom what it was. His mom told him that it was a cliff and it marked the edge of a large mountain. She also said that it was a very dangerous place and that he shouldn't go too close. Jimmy understood and promised to stay away. 
From that day on, Jimmy always knew what a cliff was and he knew not to go near it. He was safe and he ended up having a lot of fun in the park.
