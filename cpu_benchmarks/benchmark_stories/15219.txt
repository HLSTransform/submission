Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl named Lucy. She loved to wear a pretty tie in her hair. One day, she saw a big race in the park. Lucy wanted to run in the race too. She put on her shoes and her special tie.
At the start of the race, Lucy saw a big boy. He told her she was too little to finish the race. Lucy felt sad, but she knew she was brave. She said, "I will finish the race, just watch me!" The big boy laughed, but Lucy did not care.
Lucy ran and ran. She was very tired, but she did not stop. The big boy was far behind her. At last, Lucy crossed the finish line. She won the race! Everyone cheered for the brave little girl with the pretty tie in her hair. The big boy was surprised, and he knew that Lucy was very brave.
