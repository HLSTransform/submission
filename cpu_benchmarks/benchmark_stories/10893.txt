Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and dolls. One day, Lily wanted to measure how tall her favorite doll was. She found a ruler and measured her doll from head to toe. She was happy to find out that her doll was very tall!
Later that day, Lily went outside to play. She saw a bird flying in the sky and it was a beautiful sight. The bird had colorful feathers and Lily thought it was very pretty. She watched the bird fly around for a while before it flew away.
As the day went on, Lily decided to draw a picture of her doll. She used her favorite colors and made an original drawing. She was proud of her artwork and showed it to her family. They thought it was amazing and hung it up on the fridge for everyone to see.
