Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very curious and always wanted to explore.
One day, as she was playing in the garden, she saw something gleaming in the sun. It was a nail! She made up her mind to kick it.
Lily tried to kick the nail, but she couldn't reach it. She asked her dad to help her.
Her dad said, "Lily, I know you want to kick the nail, but it looks fragile. You would hurt yourself if you did that." 
Lily thought for a moment and then came up with a plan. She asked her dad if she could use a stick instead of her feet.
Her dad smiled and said, "Yes, that's a brilliant idea!" 
Lily grabbed a stick and carefully used it to kick the nail until it moved away. 
She was so proud that she had done it all by herself. From that day on, she knew to be careful when dealing with fragile things.
