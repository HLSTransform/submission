Once there was a man called Max. He was very bossy. One day, Max was drinking his juice when his sister Jane came into the room. Jane said to him, "Max, I'm having trouble with my puzzle. Can you help me?"
Max looked at the puzzle, but he couldn't figure out how it was suppose to fit together. He kept trying again and again, but he couldn't figure it out.
Jane said, "Max, please help me. I don't understand!" 
Max said, "I'm sorry Jane. I'm not bossy enough to figure it out." 
Jane said, "Don't worry, I can do it. I'm bossy enough to figure it out." She smiled and started to put the pieces of the puzzle together until they all fit. Max smiled back and said, "Nice job, Jane!"
Jane said, "Thank you Max. Now let's go get some more juice!" 
And off they went, a bossy brother and a bossy sister, hand in hand.
