Once upon a time, there was a thin package that needed to be delivered. The delivery man was walking down a long, winding road. Suddenly, he saw a little girl who was just three years old.
The delivery man smiled and said, "Would you like to follow me? I have a package that needs to be delivered."
The little girl was so excited. She nodded and followed the delivery man.
The delivery man and the little girl walked for a long time. The package was thin, so it was easy to carry. Finally, they reached their destination. The delivery man handed the package to a man dressed in a blue suit.
The delivery man thanked the little girl for following him and said goodbye. The little girl waved goodbye and she was very proud of herself. She had done such a great job helping the delivery man!
