Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She was very weak and couldn't run fast like her friends. One day, Lily decided to go for a walk in the park. She saw a butterfly and wanted to catch it, but her weak arms couldn't reach it. Suddenly, her friend came running and caught the butterfly for her. Lily was so happy and thanked her friend. From that day on, Lily knew that even though she was weak, she had a strong friend to help her.
