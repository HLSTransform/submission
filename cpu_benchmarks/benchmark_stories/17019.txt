Lily was a little girl who liked to play in the garden. She liked to see the flowers and the bugs and the birds. She did not like the bees. She was afraid of the bees. She thought they were mean and they would sting her.
One day, she saw a big hive in a tree. She wanted to see what was inside. She was curious and ignorant. She did not know that the hive was the home of the bees. She did not know that the bees would get angry if she disturbed them. She took a stick and poked the hive.
The bees heard the noise and came out of the hive. They saw Lily and they were furious. They buzzed and flew around her. They tried to sting her. Lily was scared and sorry. She dropped the stick and ran away. She cried and called for her mom.
Her mom heard her and came to the garden. She saw the bees and the hive and the stick. She understood what happened. She hugged Lily and took her inside. She put some ice on her stings and gave her some juice. She told her that the bees were not mean, but they were protecting their home. She told her that she should not poke the hive or bother the bees. She told her that she should be careful and respectful of the animals and plants in the garden.
Lily learned her lesson. She was not ignorant anymore. She was sorry for the bees and for herself. She said she would not poke the hive again. She said she would be nice to the bees and the other creatures in the garden. She said she would listen to her mom and learn more about the world.
