One day, a mommy and her daughter went for a picnic in the park. The girl was excited to be outside and wanted to pick some flowers. She saw a patch of grass and ran over to it. "Mommy, look at all the pretty grass! Can I pick some?"
Mommy smiled and nodded. She helped the girl remove some of the pale blades of grass and handed them to her daughter. The girl twirled the grass in her hands, smiling with delight.
Suddenly, a gust of wind blew the grass out of her hands. "Oh no! The grass is gone!" The girl started to cry.
Mommy put her arms around her daughter. "Don't worry. We can get more grass," she said.
The girl smiled again and they went off to search for more pale grass. They found a patch and the girl was able to remove some grass and take it with her. They both enjoyed the picnic and had a wonderful day.
