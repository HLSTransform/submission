Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the bathtub and splash water all around. One day, she turned the faucet on and water started to flow. But when she tried to turn it off, it wouldn't stop. She called out to her mommy, "Mommy, the water won't stop!"
Mommy came running and saw the faucet was broken. She said, "Don't worry, Lily. We can fix it." Mommy found a flexible hose and used it to stop the water from flowing. Then she turned the faucet off and said, "All done!"
Lily was happy that the water stopped, but she was sad that she couldn't play in the bathtub anymore. So, mommy said, "Let's make a game out of it. We can seat your toys on the edge of the tub and pretend they're on a boat in the water." Lily loved the idea and they played together until it was time for bed.
