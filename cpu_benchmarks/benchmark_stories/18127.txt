Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She went to the fair with her mommy and daddy. They had so much fun riding on the merry-go-round and eating cotton candy.
But then, Lily's mommy bought her a muffin. Lily was so happy to eat it, but she forgot it on a bench when she went to ride on the Ferris wheel. When she came back, the muffin was gone! Lily was very sad and cried a lot.
But then, a kind lady found the muffin and gave it back to Lily. Lily was so happy and hugged the lady. From that day on, Lily always remembered to hold onto her muffin tightly and not forget it again.
