Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy jeep. His jeep was brown and had big wheels. One day, Timmy went outside to play with his jeep. He drove it around in the dirt and had so much fun.
Suddenly, Timmy saw a bird in the sky. He stopped playing with his jeep and gazed up at the bird. "Wow, look at the bird!" Timmy said to his mom who was watching him play. "It's flying so high!"
Timmy's mom smiled and said, "Yes, it's a beautiful bird. But don't forget about your jeep. It's fun to play with too." Timmy nodded and continued to drive his jeep around, but he couldn't stop thinking about the bird he had just seen.
