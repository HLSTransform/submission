Sam was walking down the street when his feet started to wander. Even though he knew he shouldn't, Sam started to explore and soon he was far from home. He noticed a cottage, and remembered his mum said never to go look inside, but his feet kept taking him closer. Sam looked around, but could not see anyone. He took a few steps inside, and saw lots of toys scattered around the room. Sam knew he wasn't supposed to be there, and felt a bit guilty, but he wanted to explore more. He looked around a bit more, and decided to take a toy. When he left, he made sure no one saw him. 
On the way home, Sam looked around and saw his mum talking with a neighbour. He knew he had done something wrong, so he felt very guilty. He put the toy behind his back and walked closer. His mum noticed him and asked Sam where he had been. Sam was too scared to tell the truth, so he said nothing. His mum knew something was wrong, but she didn't know how Sam had wandered away. 
Sam felt ashamed and embarrassed, but he was so glad that he had been able to find his way back home. From then on, he was always very careful to not wander too far away from his mum.
