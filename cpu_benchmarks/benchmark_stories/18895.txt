Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide on the grass. They saw a big sign that said "Zoo". They wanted to see the animals.
"Can we go, Mom?" Lily asked.
"OK, but we have to be careful and stay close to me," Mom said.
They followed Mom to the zoo. They saw monkeys and birds and snakes. They were very noisy and colorful. Lily and Ben liked them, but they wanted to see something bigger and stronger.
"Look, there is a leopard!" Ben said. He pointed to a big cat with spots. It was lying on a rock and licking its paw.
"Wow, it is so pretty!" Lily said. She wanted to touch it, but Mom said no.
"It is not a pet, Lily. It is a wild animal. It can bite and scratch. We have to respect it and keep a distance," Mom said.
Lily nodded. She was a thoughtful girl. She understood that the leopard had its own space and feelings. She did not want to bother it.
They watched the leopard for a while. It yawned and stretched. Then it got up and walked to the edge of the rock. It looked at Lily and Ben with its yellow eyes.
"Hello, leopard," Lily said softly.
The leopard seemed to hear her. It tilted its head and blinked. Then it jumped off the rock and landed on the ground. It walked towards the fence that separated it from the people.
Lily and Ben were excited. They wanted to see it closer. They ran to the fence and leaned over. But they did not notice that the grass was wet and slippery.
They both slipped and fell on their bottoms. They cried out in surprise and pain.
Mom heard them and ran to help them. She picked them up and hugged them.
"Are you OK, my loves?" she asked.
They nodded. They were not hurt, just dirty and wet. They looked at the leopard. It was still near the fence. It looked at them with a curious expression.
"Sorry, leopard," Lily said. "We did not mean to fall."
The leopard seemed to understand. It licked its nose and made a soft sound. Then it turned around and walked back to the rock. It lay down and closed its eyes.
Lily and Ben smiled. They felt a connection with the leopard. They waved goodbye and thanked it for being so nice.
"Let's go see the other animals," Mom said. "But be careful not to slip again."
They agreed. They held Mom's hand and walked to the next exhibit. They had a fun and educational day at the zoo.
