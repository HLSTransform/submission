Once upon a time, there lived a princess. She loved fashion and had all kinds of dresses, hats and shoes. But one day, something bad happened. Everything got broken! The princess felt so sad and shook her head sadly.
Suddenly, a fairy appeared! The fairy touched her wand and fixed everything that was broken. The princess was so happy, she started to shake with joy. She danced around the room, showing off her beautiful fashion.
The princess thanked the fairy for her magical help and the friendly fairy waved goodbye. The princess felt so happy and thanked the fairy again. She smiled and laughed their troubles away.
The end.
