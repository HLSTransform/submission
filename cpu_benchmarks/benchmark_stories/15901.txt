Once upon a time there was a small girl named Lily. She was just 3 years old.
One day, Lily was at the park with her mom. She saw lots of new friends to play with. In the middle of the playground, there was a big puppy. When Lily looked at it, the puppy began to bark.
Lily's mom smiled. She said, "Let me introduce you. This is Flower. She's a very nice puppy. Would you like to pet her?"
Lily was scared, but with her mom's help, she slowly reached out her hand. Lily gently petted Flower's fur. It was so warm.
Then Lily tried patting Flower's nose. Flower licked Lily's finger! Lily laughed and giggled. She was so happy that she made a new friend.
