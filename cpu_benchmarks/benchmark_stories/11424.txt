Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mandy. She had a big sister who was very bossy. One day it was Mandy's birthday, and she wanted to bake a cake. She asked her big sister to help her bake the cake.
"No!" her big sister said in a bossy voice. "You need to do it yourself."
So Mandy got some flour, eggs and sugar, and she tried to bake the cake. She mixed all the ingredients together and put it into a cake tin. But then she realized she had no oven!
Mandy started to cry, but then she saw something strange. Her big sister had very big lips, and when she blew on the cake mix it started to bake! Mandy was so happy she clapped her hands.
When the cake was done, Mandy shared it with her big sister. She was so surprised that Mandy had managed to bake the cake. They both enjoyed the cake, and the birthday was a great success!
