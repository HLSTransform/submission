Once upon a time, a very lonely bear sat and looked out at the world. He wished with all his heart that he could find a friend to play with.
Just then, he heard a voice calling out to him.
It was a sheep, who had trotted over to the edge of the forest and said, “Bear, will you lend me a napkin? I need to wipe my face.”
The bear was so happy to have someone to talk to that he quickly said yes. He dug into his bag, pulled out a napkin, and handed it to the sheep.
The sheep thanked the bear and said, “Let’s be friends!”
The bear was overjoyed. “Yes!” he cheered.
From that day on, the bear and the sheep were the best of friends. They played together every day and never felt lonely again.
