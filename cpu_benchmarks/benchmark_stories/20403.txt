Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to her grandma's house. She loved going there because her grandma always had cookies and milk for her. One day, while playing hide and seek, Lily saw a door she had never seen before. She asked her grandma what was behind the door, but her grandma said it was a secret and she couldn't go in.
Lily was very curious and wanted to know what was behind the door. She asked her grandma again and again, but her grandma said no. Lily didn't believe her grandma and thought she was hiding something from her. She decided to sneak into the room when her grandma wasn't looking.
When she opened the door, she saw a small chamber with a big safe inside. She wondered what was in the safe and tried to open it. Suddenly, her grandma came in and saw her. She was angry and told Lily that it was dangerous to go into the chamber and try to open the safe. Lily felt bad and promised to never go into the chamber again without permission.
