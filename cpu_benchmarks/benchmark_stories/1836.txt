Once upon a time, there was a boy called Sam. Sam had a very special goal. He wanted to be the best at playing hide-and-seek! 
One day, Sam was playing hide-and-seek with his friends. He ran and ran until he found a nice, comfortable spot to hide. Sam waited and waited, but then he began to feel a little bit sleepy. 
Suddenly, Sam slipped and fell asleep. He slept and slept until it was time to go home. 
When he woke up, Sam was excited. He knew he was very close to achieving his goal. He had played the best hide-and-seek game ever! 
From then on, Sam felt very comfortable whenever he played hide-and-seek. He knew he could always rely on himself to win!
