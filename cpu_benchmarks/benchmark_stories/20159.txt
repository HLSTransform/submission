Sam likes to write. He writes on paper, on walls, on books. He writes his name, shapes, animals. He writes with pens, pencils, crayons. He writes every day.
But his mom does not like his writing. She says it is messy and bad. She takes his paper and puts it in the bin. She takes his pens and pencils and crayons and hides them. She says he must not write anymore.
Sam is sad and angry. He wants to write. He thinks his writing is good and fun. He does not want to stop. He looks for his pens and pencils and crayons. He finds them in a drawer. He takes them and runs to his room.
He writes on his wall. He writes big and bright. He writes "Sam is brave". He smiles and feels happy.
But his mom hears him. She comes to his room. She sees his wall. She is very mad. She shouts at him. She says he is naughty and bad. She says he must clean his wall and go to bed.
Sam is scared and sorry. He does not want to make his mom mad. He does not want to clean his wall. He likes his writing. He thinks he is brave. He says to his mom, "Please, mom, let me write. I love to write. Writing is good. I am brave."
His mom looks at him. She sees his eyes and his smile. She sees his writing. She thinks for a moment. She says to him, "Sam, I know you love to write. Writing is good. You are brave. But you must not write on the wall. The wall is not for writing. The wall is for painting. You can write on paper. You can write in books. You can write with me. I will help you write. I will teach you write. I will write with you. Do you want to write with me?"
Sam nods and hugs his mom. He says, "Yes, mom, I want to write with you. Thank you, mom. I love you, mom." He takes his paper and his pens and pencils and crayons. He goes to the table with his mom. They write together. They write their names, shapes, animals. They write big and bright. They write "Sam is brave. Mom is brave. We are brave." They smile and feel happy.
