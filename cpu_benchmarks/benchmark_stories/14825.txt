Anna and Ben like to play in the tent. The tent is big and blue. They put the tent in the garden. They bring toys and books inside the tent.
One day, they hear a noise outside the tent. It sounds like a big dog. Anna and Ben are scared. They hug each other and whisper.
"What is that?" Anna asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a monster," Ben says.
They peek out of the tent. They see a big brown dog. The dog is slow and friendly. He wags his tail and sniffs the tent. He wants to play.
"Hello, dog," Anna says. "Do you want to come in the tent?"
The dog barks and nods. He crawls into the tent. He licks Anna and Ben. They laugh and pet him.
"Look, we have a new friend," Ben says.
They play with the dog in the tent. They share their toys and books. They are happy. Nothing bad happens.
