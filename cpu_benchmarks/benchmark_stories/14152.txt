Once upon a time, there was a little old lady. She was silly and liked to dance and sing. One day, she was walking down the street and suddenly had an idea. She said to herself, "I will drop my old hat on the ground and I will dance around it!" So, she took off her old hat and dropped it on the ground.
Suddenly, a boy walked by and saw her silly hat on the ground. He wanted to keep it for himself. He started to pick it up and the old lady said, "No! That's my hat." The boy didn't listen and kept trying to take the hat.
The old lady was very angry and decided to teach the boy a lesson. She said, "If you don't drop my hat, I will start singing a silly song and dance around it!" The boy was scared and quickly dropped her hat and ran away.
The old lady was very happy. She was glad that she stood up to the boy and was able to get her hat back. She picked it up, put it on her head and then started to sing and dance around it.
