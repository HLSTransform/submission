Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was an eager little girl and very excited about the day. 
Today, Lily's parents told her they were going to send her some delicious rice in the mail. Lily was full of joy and eagerly waited for it to come.
Every day, Lily asked her mom when her rice would come in the mail. Every day, her mom said it was coming soon.
Finally, Lily could hardly believe it when one day, her mom said her rice had arrived! Lily ran to the mailbox, and sure enough, there it was! 
Eagerly, Lily opened the package and inside she found a big box of rice. She was so excited, she jumped up and down.
Lily's parents were happy to see her so full of joy and they shared the rice with her. It was the most delicious rice she had ever had! 
From then on, Lily looked forward to receiving delicious rice in the mail every day.
