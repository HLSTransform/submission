Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat yummy snacks. One day, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her room. But Lily didn't want to because she was playing with her toys. 
Her mom said, "Lily, you need to clean up your room before dinner." Lily felt worried because she didn't want to stop playing. But she knew she had to listen to her mom. 
As she was cleaning, she found some junk under her bed. She said, "Ew, this is yucky!" and threw it away. Finally, her room was clean and she felt happy. Her mom said, "Good job, Lily! Now you can play again." And Lily smiled and played with her toys happily ever after.
