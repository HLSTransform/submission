Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. It was her birthday and she was very happy. Her mom made her a big cake with lots of frosting and sprinkles. 
Lily's friend, Timmy, came over to celebrate with her. He brought a present wrapped in shiny paper. "Happy birthday, Lily!" Timmy said. 
Lily was excited to open the present, but when she did, she didn't like what she saw. It was a toy that she already had. "I don't like this toy," Lily said. 
Timmy was sad that Lily didn't like his present. He felt ashamed. "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't know you already had it," Timmy said. 
Lily felt bad for making Timmy sad. She gave him a hug and said, "It's okay. Let's play with it together." They played with the toy and had a lot of fun. But then, Timmy accidentally slapped Lily's hand. "Ouch!" Lily said. 
"I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to slap you," Timmy said. 
"It's okay. Let's just eat some cake now," Lily said. They ate cake and had a great time together.
