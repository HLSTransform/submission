Molly and her dad went to the mall. Molly was so excited to go. She was dressed in her favourite dress which had lots of pretty flowers on it.
Molly and her dad walked around the mall. They both looked at all the different shops. Molly saw a toy shop and her eyes lit up. She asked her dad if they could go inside.
Molly's dad said yes and they went inside. Molly was so excited to see all the toys. She ran around the shop and saw toys she had never seen before.
Molly's dad called her over. He had found a special toy. He said it was just for her.
Molly smiled and knew it was the perfect toy. She carefully held it in her hands and asked her dad if she could stand next to it. 
Her dad said yes and kissed her on the head. Molly was so excited that she could show everyone in the mall her brand new toy. She beamed as she held it proudly and took a lot of pictures to show her friends. She was sure they would be excited too!
