One day, there was a purple stream. It was so bright and sparkly. Along came a brown squirrel. He had a big twig in his mouth! He stopped at the edge of the stream and carefully twisted it in the water. The squirrel was very busy. He twisted and twisted and twisted.
Time passed and soon night had come. The moon shone on the purple stream and the twig the squirrel had twisted had become a bridge! He was so proud of his bridge. 
The next day, when the sun rose, a friendly rabbit hopped across the bridge and said hello to the brown squirrel. He said thank you for the bridge and they both were really glad!
