Anna and Ben were going to the park with Mom. They put on their coats and hats and gloves. Mom helped them with their zippers. "There, you are all warm and cozy," she said.
But when they opened the door, they saw a lot of snow outside. It was white and fluffy and covered everything. "Wow, look at the snow!" Anna said. "It's so pretty!"
Ben wanted to play in the snow. He picked up some and made a snowball. He threw it at Anna. "Hey, that's not fair!" Anna said. She made a snowball too and threw it back at Ben. They laughed and chased each other in the snow.
Mom watched them and smiled. She liked to see them happy. But she also knew they had to go to the park soon. She called them. "Anna, Ben, come on, we have to go. The park will close soon."
Anna and Ben did not want to go. They wanted to stay in the snow. They said, "Please, Mom, can we play a little more? Just a little more?"
Mom looked at the clock. She saw they had some time left. She said, "Okay, you can play a little more. But only for five minutes. Then we have to go. No more delays."
Anna and Ben were happy. They thanked Mom and hugged her. They said, "You are the best, Mom. Thank you for letting us play."
Mom hugged them back. She said, "You are welcome, my loves. But remember, five minutes only. Then we have to zip up and go."
Anna and Ben nodded. They ran back to the snow. They made a big snowman. They gave him a hat and a scarf and a carrot nose. They were very proud of their snowman. They thought he was impressive. They showed him to Mom. Mom agreed. She said, "He is very impressive. You did a great job."
Then she looked at the clock again. She said, "Time's up. We have to go now. Come on, let's go to the park."
Anna and Ben said goodbye to their snowman. They said, "We will see you later, Mr. Snowman. Have fun in the snow."
They followed Mom to the car. They zipped up their coats and got in. They buckled their seat belts. They drove to the park. They had a lot of fun there too. They played on the swings and the slide and the seesaw. They met some friends and shared their snacks. They had a wonderful day. They were happy and grateful. They loved Mom and each other. They loved the snow and the park. They loved life.
