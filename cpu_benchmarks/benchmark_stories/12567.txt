Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a map on a bench. The map has a big X on it.
"Look, a map!" Anna says. "Maybe it is a treasure map!"
"Let's follow it!" Ben says. "Maybe we can find gold or jewels!"
They take the map and start to walk. They follow the lines and arrows on the map. They go past the swings, the slide, the pond and the bridge. They come to a big tree.
"The X is here!" Anna says. "The treasure must be under the tree!"
They dig with their hands and their sticks. They dig and dig, but they find nothing.
"Where is the treasure?" Ben asks. "Did someone take it?"
Suddenly, they hear a laugh. They look up and see a boy in the tree. He is holding a camera.
"Gotcha!" the boy says. "It was a joke! I made the map and put it on the bench. I wanted to see if you would fall for it. I filmed everything. It is so funny!"
Anna and Ben are angry. They do not like the boy's joke. They think it is mean and silly.
"That is not funny!" Anna says. "That is rude! You made us waste our time and get dirty!"
"Yeah!" Ben says. "You are not nice! You are a bully! We do not want to play with you!"
They throw the map at the boy and run away. They go back to the park and play with their other friends. They forget about the boy and his joke. They have fun and laugh.
They are brave and smart. They do not let the boy's joke ruin their day. They are happy.
