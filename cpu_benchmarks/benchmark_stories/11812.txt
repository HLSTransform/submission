Once upon a time there was a boy who liked to march. One day he decided to march to the store to get a melon. He walked in and saw all the melons. Some were big, some were small, some were green, and some were yellow. The boy saw the perfect melon for him and he couldn't wait to eat it. 
But when he bit into the melon he made a funny face. The melon was sour! He marched back to the store to ask the clerk why the melon was sour. The clerk smiled and said, "That's a sour melon! It's supposed to be like that!"
The boy thanked the clerk and got a new melon. This time the melon was sweet and the boy was so happy. He marched all the way home, eating the melon and feeling satisfied.
