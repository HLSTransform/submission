Ben and Lily were twins who liked to eat cereal for breakfast. They had a big box of cereal with many colors and shapes. Sometimes they played with the cereal and made funny pictures on their plates.
One morning, Ben had an idea. He wanted to make a surprise for Lily. He took some cereal and hid it under his napkin. He smiled and waited for Lily to come.
Lily came and sat next to Ben. She poured some cereal on her plate and started to eat. She did not see the cereal under Ben's napkin.
"Look, Lily," Ben said. He lifted his napkin and pointed at the cereal. "I made a face for you!"
Lily looked and saw the cereal. It was a face with two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. But the mouth was not smiling. It was frowning and had two sharp teeth.
Lily screamed and jumped back. She was scared of the face. She thought it was a monster.
Ben laughed and laughed. He thought it was funny. He was playful and liked to make jokes.
Lily was not happy. She was angry and sad. She did not like Ben's joke. She did not think it was funny.
She grabbed some cereal and threw it at Ben. It hit him on the head and made a mess.
Ben stopped laughing and looked at Lily. He saw that she was crying. He felt sorry and bad. He did not mean to make her cry.
He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was just playing. I love you."
He hugged Lily and gave her a kiss. He said, "Do you want to share my cereal?"
Lily nodded and smiled. She said, "I love you too, Ben. But don't scare me again."
They ate their cereal and made happy faces on their plates. They were twins who liked to eat cereal for breakfast.
