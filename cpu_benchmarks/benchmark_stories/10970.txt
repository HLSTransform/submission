One day, a red bird was flying high in the sky. It saw a tall tower made of blocks. The tower was very big and colorful. The red bird wanted to play with the tower, so it flew down to take a closer look.
A little boy was playing with the tower. He saw the red bird and said, "Hi, red bird! Do you want to play with me and my tower?" The red bird nodded its head and they started to play together. They had lots of fun building the tower higher and higher.
As they were playing, the tower began to shake. The little boy and the red bird looked at each other, worried. Suddenly, the tower started to fall. The little boy and the red bird jumped back to stay safe. The tower fell down with a loud crash, but nobody was hurt. The little boy and the red bird laughed and started to build the tower again, happy to be playing together.
