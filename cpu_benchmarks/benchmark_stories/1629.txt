Sam and Mia were playing near the cliff. They liked to look at the big rocks and the water below. They saw some birds flying and some fish jumping.
"Look, Sam, a big bird!" Mia said, pointing at a gray and white eagle.
Sam blinked. He was scared of the big bird. He thought it might hurt them.
"Let's go away, Mia. The big bird is angry," he said, pulling her hand.
But Mia did not want to go. She wanted to see the big bird more.
"No, Sam, the big bird is not angry. It is ancient. It knows many things. Maybe it can talk to us," she said, letting go of his hand.
She walked closer to the cliff, where the big bird was sitting on a branch. She smiled and waved at it.
"Hello, big bird. What is your name?" she asked.
The big bird looked at Mia with its yellow eyes. It opened its beak and made a loud sound.
"Kaaaw! Kaaaw!" it said.
Mia was not afraid. She thought the big bird was saying hello.
"Kaaaw! Kaaaw!" she said back.
Sam was very afraid. He saw the big bird flap its wings and fly towards Mia. He thought the big bird was going to take her away.
"Mia, come back! The big bird is bad! It will eat you!" he shouted, running after her.
But Mia did not hear him. She was too happy to see the big bird. She reached out her hand to touch it.
The big bird landed on Mia's hand. It was heavy and warm. It looked at Mia with its yellow eyes. It opened its beak and made a soft sound.
"Mia. Mia," it said.
Mia was amazed. The big bird knew her name. She felt a special bond with it.
"Wow, you can talk! You are amazing, big bird. What is your name?" she asked.
The big bird made a soft sound again.
"Ella. Ella," it said.
Mia smiled. She liked the big bird's name.
"Ella, you are my friend. I like you, Ella," she said.
Ella nodded. She liked Mia too. She felt a special bond with her.
"Mia, you are my friend. I like you, Mia," she said.
Sam reached the cliff. He saw Mia and Ella talking and holding hands. He was shocked and confused. He did not understand how the big bird could talk and be friendly.
"Mia, what are you doing? How do you know the big bird? How does it know you?" he asked.
Mia turned to Sam. She saw that he was scared and worried. She felt sorry for him.
"Sam, don't be scared. This is Ella. She is an ancient bird. She knows many things. She knows my name. She is my friend. She will not hurt us. She can be your friend too," she said.
Sam blinked. He did not know what to think. He looked at Ella. She looked at him with her yellow eyes. She opened her beak and made a soft sound.
"Sam. Sam," she said.
Sam felt a strange feeling in his chest. He felt curious and calm. He reached out his hand to touch Ella.
"Hello, Ella. You are an ancient bird. You know many things. You know my name. You are Mia's friend. You can be my friend too," he said.
Ella nodded. She was happy to have two friends. She felt a special bond with them.
"Mia, Sam, you are my friends. I like you, Mia. I like you, Sam," she said.
Mia, Sam, and Ella smiled. They felt a special bond with each other. They stayed on the cliff, talking and playing, until the sun set. They did not notice the time. They did not notice the other birds and fish. They only noticed each other. They were happy. They were friends.
