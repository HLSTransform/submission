Ben loves his rabbit, Fluffy. Fluffy is soft and white and has long ears. Ben likes to hug Fluffy and feed him carrots. Fluffy likes to hop and play in the garden.
One day, Ben hears a loud bark. He sees a big dog running towards Fluffy. The dog has sharp teeth and a mean look. Ben is scared. He wants to protect Fluffy from the dog.
Ben runs to Fluffy and picks him up. He holds Fluffy close to his chest. He shouts, "Go away, dog! Fluffy is mine!" The dog stops and growls. He wants to bite Fluffy.
Ben sees his mom coming out of the house. She sees the dog and Ben and Fluffy. She is angry. She says, "Bad dog! Leave my son and his rabbit alone!" She picks up a stick and waves it at the dog. The dog is afraid. He runs away.
Ben is happy. He says, "Thank you, mom! You saved me and Fluffy!" His mom hugs him and Fluffy. She says, "You're welcome, Ben! You are brave and kind. You love your rabbit and you protect him. I'm proud of you." She takes them inside the house. She gives Ben a cookie and Fluffy a carrot. They are safe and happy.
