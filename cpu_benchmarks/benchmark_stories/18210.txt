Once upon a time, there was a humble little bunny named Ben. Ben lived in a small house near the woods. He had many friends like birds, squirrels, and mice. They all played together and had fun.
One day, Ben saw a trail in the woods. He started to wonder where it went. He asked his friends if they knew, but they didn't. So, Ben decided to follow the trail to see what he could find.
As Ben hopped along the trail, he saw pretty flowers and tall trees. He met new friends like a baby deer and a tiny frog. At the end of the trail, he found a beautiful pond with ducks swimming in it. Ben was very happy he had followed the trail, and he couldn't wait to tell his friends about his adventure.
