Once upon a time, there was a little bunny called Dennis. Dennis was a very hungry bunny, so he went out to look for food. He hopped through the forest, hoping to find something to eat.
Dennis passed by a carrot garden, and his tummy started to rumble. He looked around to make sure nobody was watching and hopped over to the carrots. He started to eat one, but then he heard a voice.
"What do we have here?" said the voice.
Dennis felt helpless. He turned around, and saw a big bear standing right behind him. The bear asked him what he was doing.
"I was just trying to find something to eat," said Dennis. "I'm really hungry."
The bear smiled. "Well, you guessed right, you can have as many carrots as you'd like," he said. "But don't tell anyone."
Dennis thanked the bear and started to eat the carrots. He ate until he was full and hopped away, his tummy full of delicious carrots. He never told anyone about the bear and the carrots.
