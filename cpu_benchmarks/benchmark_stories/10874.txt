Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play pretend with her friends. One day, she pretended to be a princess in a big blue castle. She wore a pretty blue dress and had a shiny crown on her head. 
Before she went to play with her friends, her mom helped her brush her hair. Lily's hair was long and curly, but her mom was very gentle and careful. She used a soft brush to make Lily's hair smooth and pretty. 
Lily had so much fun playing with her friends in the park. They ran around and laughed together. When it was time to go home, Lily was tired but happy. She told her mom all about her adventures and how she pretended to be a princess in a blue castle. Her mom smiled and hugged her tight. It was a wonderful day for Lily.
