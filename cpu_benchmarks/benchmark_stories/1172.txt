Once upon a time, there was a little brown spider. The spider lived in a big tree. It was a happy spider.
One day, a bird came to the tree. The bird said, "Hello, spider! Can I live in your tree too?" The spider replied, "Yes, bird! Let's be friends and share the tree."
But the bird refused to be friends with the spider. The bird said, "No, I don't want to be friends with you. You are small and brown." The spider felt sad.
The next day, the bird got stuck in a net. The bird cried for help. The little brown spider heard the bird and went to help. The spider used its web to free the bird from the net.
The bird said, "Thank you, spider! I was wrong. You are a good friend." The spider and the bird became friends. They lived happily in the tree. The moral of the story is to not judge others by their looks.
