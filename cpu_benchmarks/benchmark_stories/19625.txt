Once upon a time, there was an adventurous jellyfish. Every day, his friends would ask him to do things with them. He wanted to say 'yes' but he often disagreed. 
One day, his friends asked him to go swimming with them. He wanted to say yes but he disagreed because he was scared to go. His friends were upset but they said it was ok.
The next day, he decided to go on an adventure with his friends. Everyone was so surprised and excited! Together, they set off on a journey.
At the end of their journey, they sailed over a calm sea. They saw jellyfish everywhere! The jellyfish was excited to find his family, so he waved to them excitedly.
The jellyfish eventually learned that it was okay to disagree. He also learned that it was important to be adventurous and try new things. He was glad he took the adventure that day!
