Tom and Mia were twins who liked to play in the big house. They had many toys and books and games, but their favorite place was the fireplace. They liked to sit on the soft rug and watch the fire dance and crackle. Sometimes they would rub their hands to feel warm and cozy.
One day, when it was very cold and snowy outside, they decided to play a new game. They pretended they were explorers in a cave, and the fireplace was their campfire. They took some sticks and stones and made a circle around the fire. They also took some blankets and pillows and made a tent.
"Look, Mia, we are in a dark and scary cave," Tom said. "But we have a fire to keep us safe and happy."
"Yes, Tom, we are brave explorers," Mia said. "But we have to be quiet, or the monsters will hear us."
They whispered and giggled and told stories. They rubbed their feet and noses and drank hot chocolate. They felt very happy and snug.
But they did not notice that one of the sticks they used for the circle was too close to the fire. It caught fire and started to burn. The fire grew bigger and bigger, and soon it reached the blankets and pillows. The tent was on fire too.
"Tom, Mia, what are you doing?" their mom shouted. She smelled the smoke and ran to the fireplace. She saw the fire and grabbed a bucket of water. She threw the water on the fire and put it out.
"Mom, we are sorry, we were playing a game," Tom and Mia said. They were scared and sad. They did not mean to make a fire.
"Thank God you are okay," their mom said. She hugged them and kissed them. "But you have to be careful, fire is dangerous. You can't play with fire, or you will get hurt."
Tom and Mia nodded. They learned their lesson. They said sorry to their mom and helped her clean up the mess. They still liked the fireplace, but they never played with fire again.
