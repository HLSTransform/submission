Once upon a time there was a witch. She was very silly and did many funny things. People often laughed when they saw her.
One day the witch wanted to fly. She put on a big hat with stars on it and waved her wand. Suddenly she was in the air!
The witch flew through the sky and had great fun. She flew over farms, lakes and houses. Everyone was happy to see her flying.
At the end of the day the witch was very tired. She needed to rest. So she waved her wand one more time and flew back home.
The end.
