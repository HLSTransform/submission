Once upon a time, there lived a loving brother and sister. They lived by the sea and often played in the sand. 
One day when they were at the beach, they saw a crab. The crab quickly scurried away as they approached. 
The brother wanted to touch it, but his sister was afraid. "No, don't," she said.
The brother was confused. "Why not?" he asked.
"Because the crab might get scared," the sister said. "If we are going to touch it, we have to be honest."
The brother thought about it for a moment and then nodded his head. "Let's be honest."
The siblings slowly approached the crab. When it saw them, it didn't scurry away this time. Very carefully, the brother touched the crab. The crab scuttled away with a smile. 
The brother and sister shared a hug. They had been honest and kind, just like they promised.
