Once upon a time, there was a little puppy. Her name was Bella. Bella was very happy. She liked to play and run. Every day she would grow bigger and bigger.
One day, Bella became very ill. Her mommy worried a lot. She took Bella to the vet. There she met the veterinarian. The vet was very busy, but he was nice.
Bella saw lots of animals in the vet's office. There were cats, bunnies, and even a turtle! They were all very sick, and the vet was taking care of them. 
Bella was scared, but the vet was gentle and he made her feel better. He gave her medicine and special food, and she slowly began to feel better. 
The vet visited Bella a few times and each time she got healthier. Finally, she was totally better! Bella was so happy that she could run and play again.
The vet had done a great job and Bella's mom was very thankful. He had taken care of her, and Bella was able to grow up and stay happy and healthy.
