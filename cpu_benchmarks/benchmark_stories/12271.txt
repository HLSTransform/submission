Once upon a time there was a lonely bear. He wanted to have a friend to play with. So, he decided to make a costume. As soon as the costume was finished, he put it on and went outside.
He watched as the other animals ran and played together. He felt so lonely. He wished he had a friend to play with. 
Just then, a little rabbit hopped up to him. "Hi bear! What are you doing?" asked the rabbit. The bear smiled and said, "I'm wearing a costume so I can make a new friend." 
The rabbit was excited. "That's a great idea! Can I join you?" The bear happily agreed. They both continued to watch the other animals, imagining what it would be like if they had a big group of friends. From that day forward, the bear and the rabbit were best friends.
