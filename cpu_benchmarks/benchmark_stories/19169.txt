Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to eat cream. One day, she saw an open jar of cream on the table. Kitty wanted the cream so much, but she knew it was not hers.
Kitty called her friend, Birdy, to help her decide what to do. Birdy said, "Kitty, it is not good to take what is not yours. You should wait and ask if you can have some cream later."
Kitty listened to Birdy and did not take the cream. Later, her owner saw Kitty being good and gave her some cream as a treat. Kitty was happy she made the right choice. The moral of the story is to always be honest and not take what is not yours.
