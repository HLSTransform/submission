The little girl was so excited. She was getting ready to play a new game, and she just couldn't wait! The rules were simple: when someone says "surrender", you have to quickly run over to a chair and sit down.
Her friends all raced around the room, and the little girl was very fast. She watched as her friends found a chair and sat in it. Everyone was having so much fun.
Even though the game was exciting, the little girl wasn't sure if she wanted to surrender yet. She ran and ran, but nobody said the word. Suddenly, a loud shout rang through the room -- "Surrender!" 
The little girl froze and then quickly sprinted towards a chair. She was the first one to sit down! Everyone cheered and the little girl smiled. She was so happy that she had won the game. 
The little girl was excited to play again tomorrow. She knew that she would be even faster the second time around!
