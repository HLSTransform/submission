One day, a boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, went to the park. They saw a big tree with a sign that said "History Tree". Tim asked, "Why is it called the History Tree?" A girl named Sue said, "It's very old and has seen many things. It's a special tree."
Tim and Sue decided to have a race around the tree. They were both competitive and wanted to win. They ran as fast as they could, but it was a tie. They laughed and said, "Let's race again!"
While they were racing, Spot found a big bone under the tree. He started to chew on it. Tim and Sue stopped racing and watched Spot. They said, "Good job, Spot! You found a treasure!" They all played by the History Tree and had a fun day.
