Once there was a little girl named Ann who loved to learn. She asked her mom to teach her something new every day. Ann's mom was happy to teach her. Today, Ann's mom taught her about hurricanes. She told Ann about how powerful hurricanes were and how they moved around the world.
Ann was fascinated by hurricanes and asked her mom to teach her all about them. Ann's mom taught her how hurricanes are colorful and that they come from the ocean. The wind and the rain makes them so powerful and fast. Ann was so excited to learn about something new.
Then, her mom asked her if she knew the best way to be safe from hurricanes. Ann thought for a bit and then answered, "I should prepare for hurricanes by staying safe indoors?" Her mom smiled and said, "That's exactly right!" Together, Ann and her mom put together a colorful safety kit to prepare for a hurricane.
Ann and her mom felt proud. Ann had learned a new thing, and was ready to be safe in case of a hurricane.
