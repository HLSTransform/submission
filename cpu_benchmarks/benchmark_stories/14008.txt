One day, a small, independent cat named Kitty went for a walk. She loved to rock on the swings at the park. Today, she saw a big box. Kitty was very excited. She thought it was a surprise just for her.
Kitty asked her friend Doggy, "What do you think is in the box? I hope it's a surprise for me!" Doggy said, "I don't know, but you should be careful. Surprises can be good or bad."
Kitty didn't listen to Doggy. She wanted to see the surprise. So, she opened the box. Inside, there were many bees! The bees were not happy. They flew out and started to chase Kitty and Doggy.
Kitty and Doggy ran away as fast as they could. But the bees caught up and stung them. It hurt a lot. Kitty and Doggy went home, feeling very sad. They learned that not all surprises are good, and sometimes it's better to listen to friends.
