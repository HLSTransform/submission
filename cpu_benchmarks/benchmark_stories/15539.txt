Once upon a time, there was a pig. He was a very stubborn pig. He was always getting into trouble. The pig had many friends, but he liked to be independent and do things his own way.
One day, the pig wanted to explore a nearby forest. But he knew it could be dangerous. So he asked his friends to help him protect him. His friends agreed and they followed him into the forest.
They had a great time exploring the forest together. Eventually, it was time to head back home. The pig's friends kept him safe and they took him safely back home.
From that day onward, the pig knew he could always count on his friends to protect him. And even though he was still stubborn, he was glad to have their help.
