Once upon a time, there was a modern wolf. He was the cleverest wolf of them all.
One day, the wolf was so exhausted after a long day of walking and running, he decided to take a nap. He laid down in a shady spot and rested his eyes.
Suddenly, he heard a loud noise and the wolf was startled awake! A modern car was parked nearby, its headlights shining in the wolf's face. It was time for the wolf to go back on his journey. 
He slowly got up and began walking away from the car. He couldn't wait to take another nap when he arrived at his destination.
