Once upon a time, there was a girl. She had a toy that was very useful. Her friend came over to play and asked if she could borrow the toy. The girl refused and said, "No, I want to play with it." 
Her friend felt sad and said, "But I really want to play with it too." The girl thought about it and said, "Okay, you can play with it for a little bit, but then I want it back." 
Her friend was happy and played with the toy for a little while. When she was done, she gave it back to the girl. The girl was happy that she was able to share her useful toy with her friend.
