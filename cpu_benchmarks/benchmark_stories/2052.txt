Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her toys and her cat, Mittens. One day, Lily's mom gave her a pretty vase. It was shiny and had flowers on it. Lily loved it very much and put it on her dresser. 
That night, Lily was scared of the dark. She saw shadows on her wall that looked like monsters. But then, she saw Mittens waving his tail and she felt better. Mittens jumped up on her dresser and accidentally knocked over the vase! 
Lily was sad that her vase broke, but she knew it was just an accident. She hugged Mittens and went to sleep feeling happy that her cat was there to wave his tail and make her feel better.
