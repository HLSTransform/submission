Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy tank. He would make it go "vroom vroom" all around the house. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy saw Timmy's tank and asked if he could play with it too. 
Timmy was a polite boy and said "Sure, you can play with it too!" So, Timmy and Billy played with the tank together. They made it go up and down the stairs and through the living room. 
After a while, Billy asked Timmy if he could keep the tank. Timmy thought about it for a moment and then said "No, I want to keep playing with it too." Billy understood and they continued to play together. The two friends had so much fun playing with the tank that they forgot all about asking their moms for a snack.
