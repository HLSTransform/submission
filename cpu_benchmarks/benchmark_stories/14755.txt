Sam was a humble sheep who lived on a farm with many other sheep. He liked to eat grass, play with his friends, and sleep under the stars. He had a lot of wool on his body, which kept him warm and cozy.
One day, a man came to the farm with a big machine. He said he wanted to cut the wool from the sheep and make clothes and blankets. Sam was scared of the machine. It looked loud and sharp. He did not want to lose his wool. He ran away and hid behind a big tree.
The man cut the wool from all the other sheep, but he could not find Sam. He looked everywhere, but Sam was very good at hiding. He covered himself with leaves and branches, so he looked like part of the tree. The man gave up and left with his machine and a big bag of wool.
Sam was happy that he still had his wool, but he was also lonely. He missed his friends and the warmth of the flock. He realized that his wool was not only for himself, but also for sharing and helping others. He decided to go back to the farm and join his friends.
When he got there, he saw that his friends were shivering and sad. They had no wool to keep them warm and cozy. Sam felt sorry for them. He had an idea. He used his teeth to tear off some of his wool and gave it to his friends. They wrapped themselves with the wool and thanked Sam for his kindness. Sam felt warm and cozy, not only from his wool, but also from his heart. He learned that being humble means being generous and caring. He was happy to be a humble sheep.
