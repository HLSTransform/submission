Ben and Lily are twins. They like to eat cereal for breakfast. They have a big box of cereal with many colors and shapes. They call it rainbow cereal.
One morning, Ben and Lily wake up early. They are hungry and want to eat rainbow cereal. They go to the kitchen and find the box on the shelf. They try to reach it, but it is too high. They need a stool.
"Ben, can you get the stool?" Lily asks.
"OK, Lily, I will try," Ben says.
Ben goes to the corner and pulls the stool. It is heavy and makes a loud noise. Ben does not notice the noise. He is happy to get the stool.
But Mom and Dad notice the noise. They are sleeping in their room. They hear the loud noise and wake up. They wonder what is going on.
They get out of bed and go to the kitchen. They see Ben and Lily with the stool and the box of cereal. They look surprised and a little angry.
"Ben, Lily, what are you doing?" Mom asks.
"We want to eat rainbow cereal, Mom," Lily says.
"But it is too early, Ben," Dad says.
"We are hungry, Dad," Ben says.
Mom and Dad sigh. They are not happy, but they are not very mad. They love Ben and Lily. They decide to help them.
"OK, Ben, Lily, you can eat rainbow cereal, but only a little bit. And next time, please wait for us to wake up. Do you understand?" Mom says.
"Yes, Mom, we understand," Ben and Lily say.
They smile and hug Mom and Dad. They pour some cereal in their bowls and add some milk. They eat their rainbow cereal and enjoy it. They are happy and full. They say thank you to Mom and Dad.
Mom and Dad smile and hug them back. They are glad that Ben and Lily are good and polite. They make some coffee and toast for themselves. They sit with Ben and Lily and talk. They are a happy family.
