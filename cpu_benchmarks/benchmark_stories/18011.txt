Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Tall. Tall had a very long neck and loved to eat leaves from tall trees. One day, while Tall was eating leaves, he saw a lion coming towards him. The lion wanted to eat Tall for dinner!
Tall was scared and his legs started to shake. He tried to run away, but his legs were too long and he couldn't move. The lion got closer and closer. Tall knew he had to do something to protect himself.
Suddenly, Tall had an idea. He stood very still and made his neck go straight up in the air. The lion was surprised and stopped in his tracks. Tall's neck looked so pale and big that the lion thought he was too scary to eat. The lion turned around and ran away. Tall was safe and happy that he could stand up to the lion.
