Once upon a time there was a wild dog. He was very slow but he liked to jump. He was so slow he had to rest a lot and he was always tired. So one day he decided he wanted to jump more.
He ran and ran, until he reached a really big field. He got really excited and jumped high in the sky. It was so much fun!
The wild dog kept jumping until he was really tired. He then stopped to rest. Suddenly, he heard a noise. It was a rabbit! The rabbit jumped over a log and the wild dog chased him. The wild dog ran slow but he kept jumping over rocks and trees.
Eventually he wore himself out and had to stop. He looked around. He had done lots of jumping and he was so proud of himself. From that day on, he knew that he could do anything with just a bit of practice. He realized that slow and steady wins the race.
