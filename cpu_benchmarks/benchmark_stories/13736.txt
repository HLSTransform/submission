Once upon a time, there was a big gorilla. He was very smart and liked to play. One day, he wanted to set up a picnic in the forest. He gathered some fruits and sandwiches and set them on a blanket. Suddenly, a mischievous monkey came along and tried to steal the food. But the smart gorilla chased the monkey away and saved the picnic. From that day on, the gorilla and his friends had many more picnics in the forest. The end.
