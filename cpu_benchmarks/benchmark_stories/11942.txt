Once upon a time, there was a big dragon who lived in a cave. The dragon liked to play with his toys and fly around the cave. One day, the dragon found a mysterious alarm clock on the ground. He didn't know what it was, but it made a loud noise when he pressed a button. 
The dragon was curious, so he kept playing with the alarm clock. But then, he accidentally pressed a button and the alarm clock started to make a loud noise. The dragon got scared and angry, so he decided to destroy the alarm clock. He breathed fire on it and smashed it with his tail. 
After he destroyed the alarm clock, the dragon felt much better. He went back to playing with his toys and flying around the cave. From that day on, he made sure to be careful with mysterious things he found on the ground.
