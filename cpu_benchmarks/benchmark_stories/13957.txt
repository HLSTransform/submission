Once upon a time, a fox was playing in the forest. The fox was very dirty because he had been playing in the mud. Suddenly, the fox saw a zipper on the ground. The fox was curious and tried to zip it up and down. But the zipper was stuck, and the fox couldn't move it. 
The fox decided to ask for help. He saw a little girl walking by and asked her to help him with the zipper. The little girl was very kind and tried to help the fox. She pulled and pulled until finally, the zipper moved. The fox was so happy that he gave the little girl a big hug. 
From that day on, the fox and the little girl became friends. They played together every day and had lots of fun. And the fox was no longer dirty because the little girl helped him clean himself up.
