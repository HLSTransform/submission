Once there was a little boy who was very cold outside. He looked up at the sky and saw dark clouds in the sky. He wanted to stay warm, so he had a plan. The plan was to put on his coat. He went in to find his coat and he saw a big dark coat. He put the coat on and it kept him warm and cozy.
He was happy and he smiled. Then he ran back outside and the dark clouds were still there. But, he was not cold anymore. He kept running around, playing, and having fun.
He was so glad he had a plan for staying warm. He just had to put on his coat and he was nice and warm.
