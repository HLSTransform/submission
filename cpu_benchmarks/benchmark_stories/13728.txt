Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with yarn and make pretty things. One day, Lily's friend came over to play. Her friend wanted to play with the yarn too, but Lily didn't want to share. She was being very selfish.
Lily's friend asked if she could play with the yarn, but Lily said no. Her friend got very sad and went home. Later that day, a big storm came and lightning struck the house. The yarn caught on fire and the whole house burned down. Lily was very sad and realized that being selfish was not nice.
