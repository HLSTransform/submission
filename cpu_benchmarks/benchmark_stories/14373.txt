Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved the color orange and had a big orange ball that she played with every day. One day, while playing with her ball, it went into the street and a car almost hit it. 
Lily's mom told her, "You need to mind where you play with your ball, or else you could get hurt." 
Later that day, Lily saw some police officers walking down the street. She asked her mom, "What are the police doing?" 
Her mom replied, "The police are here to help keep us safe." 
Lily thought about what her mom said and decided to be more careful when playing with her ball. She also felt happy knowing that the police were around to keep her and her family safe.
