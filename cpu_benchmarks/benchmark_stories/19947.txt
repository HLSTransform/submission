Tom and Lily were going to visit their grandma. They had to pack their bags with clothes and toys. Tom wanted to bring his toy car, but Lily said it was too big. Tom was sad.
"Can I bring my trap?" Tom asked. He had a trap that he made with a box and a stick. He liked to catch bugs with it.
"No, Tom, you can't bring your trap. It is too dirty and grandma will not like it," Lily said. She was kind to Tom, but she did not like his trap.
Tom was very sad. He did not want to leave his trap behind. He had an idea. He put his trap in his bag when Lily was not looking. He smiled.
The next day, they went to grandma's house. Grandma was happy to see them. She gave them hugs and kisses. She showed them their room. Tom and Lily unpacked their bags. Lily saw Tom's trap.
"Tom, why did you bring your trap?" Lily asked. She was angry.
"I wanted to catch some bugs," Tom said. He was not sorry.
"Tom, you can't catch bugs here. Grandma has a garden with flowers and birds. She loves them. You will hurt them with your trap," Lily said. She was worried.
Tom did not listen. He took his trap and went outside. He looked for a good spot to set his trap. He saw a big butterfly. He liked its colors. He put his trap near a flower. He waited.
The butterfly flew closer to the flower. It did not see the trap. Tom was ready to catch it. But then, he heard a voice.
"Tom, what are you doing?" It was grandma. She saw Tom and his trap.
Tom was scared. He knew he did something bad. He dropped his stick. The trap fell down. The butterfly flew away.
"Tom, this is not a nice thing to do. You could have hurt the butterfly. It is a living thing, like you. It has feelings, like you. It is beautiful, like you. You should be kind to it, not trap it," grandma said. She was not angry, but she was sad.
Tom felt sorry. He did not want to hurt the butterfly. He did not want to make grandma sad. He hugged grandma.
"I'm sorry, grandma. I won't trap bugs anymore. I will be kind to them," Tom said.
Grandma smiled. She hugged Tom back.
"That's good, Tom. I'm glad you learned your lesson. Come, let's go inside. Lily is waiting for us. We can have some cookies and milk. And maybe, later, we can watch the butterflies together," grandma said.
Tom nodded. He followed grandma. He left his trap behind. He did not need it anymore. He learned to be kind.
