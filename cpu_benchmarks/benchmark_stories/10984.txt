Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man named Bob. He had a big house and lots of food. One day, he cooked a big pot of spaghetti for dinner. Bob loved spaghetti very much.
Bob's friend, Tim, came to visit. Tim was not careful and spilled the spaghetti on the floor. Bob was sad but he knew that everyone makes mistakes. So, Bob said "I forgive you, Tim."
Together, they cleaned up the mess and cooked more spaghetti. They laughed and had a great time. From that day on, Bob and Tim were better friends. They learned that saying "I forgive you" can make everything better.
