Once upon a time, there was a little birdie named Tweety. Tweety loved to play with his friends and eat yummy seeds. One day, Tweety found a big, shiny egg. He was so happy and wanted to show it to his friends. But when he tried to carry it, the egg was too heavy and he dropped it. The egg cracked and Tweety was sad.
Tweety's friends saw him crying and asked him what happened. Tweety showed them the cracked egg and they all felt sorry for him. But then, one of the friends had an idea. She said they should pray to the birdie gods to help fix the egg. Tweety and his friends closed their eyes and prayed really hard.
Suddenly, something amazing happened. The egg started to move and wiggle. It was like magic! The egg hatched and a cute little chick came out. Tweety was so happy and his friends were amazed. They all hugged and played with the new chick. Tweety learned that even when things seem bad, praying can make them better. And the little chick was so flexible, it could even do somersaults!
