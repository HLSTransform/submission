Once upon a time, there was a big, yellow squash. This squash lived in a garden with many other small plants. The squash was very happy and liked to play with its friends.
One day, a rabbit saw the expensive squash and wanted to eat it. The rabbit started to rush towards the squash. The squash was scared and called for help.
Just in time, a kind bird heard the squash's cry. The bird swooped down and picked up the rabbit. The rabbit was taken far away from the garden. The squash was safe and thanked the bird. They all lived happily ever after.
