Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his toys. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to help her tidy up his room. 
Timmy didn't want to tidy up his room. He wanted to play with his toys. But his mom said, "Timmy, please help me tidy up your room. It won't take long."
So Timmy started to pick up his toys and put them away. He saw a saw on the floor and asked his mom, "Mommy, what's this?" 
"That's a saw, Timmy," his mom said. "It's a tool that we use to cut things." 
Timmy was curious and asked, "Can I use it?" 
"No, Timmy," his mom said. "It's not safe for you to use. Let's finish tidying up your room first." 
After they finished tidying up, Timmy's mom said, "Great job, Timmy! Now let's fill up your toy box with all your toys." 
Timmy was happy that he helped his mom and he couldn't wait to play with his toys again.
