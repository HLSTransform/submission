Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a lucky guitar that he loved to play. One day, Tim took his guitar to the park to play some music.
At the park, Tim met a girl named Sue. Sue liked the music that Tim played on his lucky guitar. She asked, "Can I play your guitar too?" Tim nodded and said, "Yes, you can play my guitar."
Sue played the lucky guitar, and they both had fun. They played music and sang songs together. They were very happy, and they became good friends. From that day on, Tim and Sue would often play the lucky guitar together at the park.
