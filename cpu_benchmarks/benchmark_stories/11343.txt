There was once a dolphin who was very hungry. He swam and swam, searching for food, but he couldn't find anything. Suddenly, he saw something in the distance. He stepped closer to find out what it was and came face to face with a little boy.
The dolphin said, "Hi! Are you hungry too?"
The boy nodded with a smile.
The dolphin said, "Let's go find some food. Come and step on my back, I'll carry you."
So the boy stepped on the dolphin's back and they swam away. After a while, they reached the shore. The dolphin said, "Look! A pile of fish! Let's get them and eat!"
So, the hungry dolphin and the boy had a delicious feast together. They were so happy and full. Then, the dolphin said goodbye and went back in the sea. 
The boy waved until he couldn't see the dolphin anymore, grateful for the day they'd had together.
