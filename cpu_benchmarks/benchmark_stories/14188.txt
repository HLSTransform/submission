Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Clara. She was very brave and brave and adventurous.
One day, she went to a field to explore and she found a big box. She wanted to open it, so she grabbed the lid and pulled it open. Inside was a win!
Clara was surprised and happy. She took the win home with her, but her parents were worried. It was a dangerous win, and they told Clara to put it back in the box.
Clara was sad, but she listened to her parents. She put it back in the box and closed the lid. She promised to never open the dangerous win again.
