One sunny day, a little boy named Timmy went to the park with his mom. They saw a man playing music with a band. The music was loud and fun, and Timmy wanted to dance. 
He ran to the grass and saw a ball. It was soft and colorful, and he wanted to play with it. He threw it up and down, and then he bounced it. 
Suddenly, the ball bounced away from him and hit the band. The music stopped and everyone looked at Timmy. He felt embarrassed and sad. But then, the man in the band smiled and picked up the ball. He started to bounce it too, and the music began again. Timmy was happy and danced with his mom.
