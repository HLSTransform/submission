Anna likes to play doctor with her toys. She has a stethoscope, a bandage, and a clipboard. She pretends to check her toys' hearts, ears, and eyes. She writes down what she sees on her clipboard.
One day, she finds a new toy in her room. It is a big, soft, pink thing. It has two parts and a tube. Anna does not know what it is. She picks it up and looks at it. She puts her stethoscope on it and listens. She hears a sound like air.
Anna thinks it is a lung. She remembers that lungs are important for breathing. She thinks her new toy is sick. She wants to help it. She wraps a bandage around it and puts it on her bed. She writes on her clipboard: "Lung. Needs rest and love."
She gives her new toy a hug and a kiss. She tells it not to worry. She says she will be back soon. She goes to find her mom and dad. She wants to show them her new toy and tell them what she did. She is proud of being a good doctor. She hopes her lung will get better.
