Lily loved to imagine stories in her head. She would pretend to be a princess, a pirate, a fairy, or anything she liked. She would tell her stories to her toys, her mom, and her dad. They all liked to listen to her stories and praise her imagination.
One day, Lily wanted to tell her story to her teacher, Miss Rose. She raised her hand and asked, "Miss Rose, can I tell you a story?" Miss Rose smiled and said, "Of course, Lily, but you have to wait until after we finish our lesson. Can you be obedient and listen to me first?" Lily nodded and said, "Yes, Miss Rose, I can be obedient."
Lily waited patiently while Miss Rose taught them about numbers, letters, and colors. She did not interrupt or talk to her friends. She paid attention and answered the questions. She was very obedient and respectful. Miss Rose was very proud of her and said, "Lily, you are a very good student. Now you can tell us your story. What is it about?"
Lily stood up and said, "My story is about a mermaid who lives in the sea. She has a lot of friends, like a dolphin, a turtle, and a starfish. She likes to swim and play with them. But she also wants to see the land and the people. She is very curious and brave. She decides to go to the shore and explore. But she has to be careful, because some people are not nice to mermaids. They want to catch them and put them in cages. She has to be smart and fast to avoid them. Do you want to hear more?"
The other children and Miss Rose nodded and said, "Yes, Lily, we want to hear more. Your story is very interesting and creative. We like your imagination." Lily smiled and continued to tell her story. She made everyone laugh and wonder with her words. She was very happy and proud. She learned that being obedient and respectful can help her share her imagination and make others happy. She also learned that being curious and brave can help her create stories and make others interested. She thanked Miss Rose and her friends for listening to her story. They thanked her for telling them her story. They all had a good time.
