Once upon a time, there was a naughty pet named Max. Max was a little dog who loved to play all day. He liked to run, jump, and bark with his friends.
One sunny day, Max saw a big tree with a swing. He wanted to hang on the swing and play. Max jumped up, grabbed the swing, and started to hang on it. He swung back and forth, having lots of fun.
But Max was naughty and did not wait for his turn. The other pets wanted to play on the swing too. They all learned to share and take turns. Max was not naughty anymore, and they all played happily together.
