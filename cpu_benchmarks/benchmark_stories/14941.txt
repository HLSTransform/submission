Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was only three years old and he lived in the city. One day, Tom's mom wanted to show him something special. She said, "Tom, let's go outside and we can see something very wild!"
Tom was very excited. He put on his coat and followed his mom to a nearby field. As soon as Tom saw the field, he was amazed. There were so many animals there; he had never seen anything so wild!
Tom's mom told him that these animals were very important. She explained that animals help people in a lot of ways. Tom didn't really understand, but he was happy just to be there watching.
Tom's mom saw that he was still confused, so she said, "One day, when you are older, you will understand how important animals are to us."
Tom smiled and nodded his head. He was happy to know that even though he didn't understand now, he could learn about it later. Tom and his mom watched the animals together for a while, until it was time to go home. Tom knew he would never forget the wild field and all the animals in it.
