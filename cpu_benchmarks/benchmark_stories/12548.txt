Anna and Ben like to play with their toy cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They pretend to drive them on the floor, on the sofa, and on the table. They make sounds like vroom, beep, and screech.
One day, their mom says, "It is time for dinner. Come to the kitchen, please." Anna and Ben put their cars away and run to the kitchen. They see a large pot on the stove. It smells good. Their mom says, "I made soup for dinner. It has carrots, potatoes, and chicken. Do you like soup?"
Anna and Ben nod. They like soup. They sit on their chairs and wait for their mom to serve them. Their mom gives them each a bowl of soup and a spoon. She says, "Be careful, the soup is hot. Blow on it before you eat."
Anna and Ben blow on their soup. They taste it. It is yummy. They say, "Thank you, mom. This is a good dinner." Their mom smiles. She says, "You are welcome, my loves. I am glad you like it."
After they finish their soup, their mom gives them a cookie for dessert. They eat their cookie and drink some milk. They say, "We are full, mom. Can we play with our cars again?" Their mom says, "Yes, you can. But first, wash your hands and put your dishes in the sink." Anna and Ben do as they are told. Then they run back to their room and play with their cars until bedtime. They have fun driving their cars and making sounds. They are happy.
