Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Mary who loved to admire everything around her. One day, she and her dad went for a walk in the park. They stopped near a big open field where she could admire the clouds in the sky.
"Look dad!" she said, pointing to the clouds, "Do you see all the shapes the clouds make?"
Her dad replied, "Yes, Mary, I too admire the beautiful shapes they make."
Mary and her dad continued walking and soon they came across a pile of coal. Mary was surprised to see this and asked her dad, "What is that?"
Her dad explained, "That is coal. It is used to make fire and heat."
Mary continued to admire the coal, but her dad warned her, "You need to be very careful around the coal, Mary, an open flame can be very dangerous."
Once they were finished admiring the coal, Mary's dad told her an important lesson. "Admiring things from a distance is important, but it is also important to know when something is too dangerous to get too close to."
The moral of the story is that it is important to admire the things around us, but it is also important to know when something is too risky to get too close to.
