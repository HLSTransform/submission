Once upon a time there was a girl who lived in a land far away. She was very generous and loved to help people. One day she saw an invitation in the sky that said, "join us!" She wanted to join whatever it was, so she flew up into the sky.
When she reached the top, she saw a whole new land that was full of colorful creatures. They smiled and welcomed the girl. She was so excited and wanted to join this new land.
The creatures said that if she promised to be generous with her time and talent, she could join them. She promised and became part of the land.
The girl spent her days helping the creatures, and she was so happy to be part of their land. She never forgot to be generous, and the creatures were thankful for her help. She would never forget the land and the friends she made there.
