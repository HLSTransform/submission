Once upon a time, in a wild forest, there lived a tiny cell. The cell was so small that it could pass through a straw. It was very lonely and wanted to find a friend.
One day, the cell met a big bear. The bear was eating honey from a tree. The cell said, "Hello, bear! Can I pass by? I am looking for a friend." The bear looked down and said, "Sure, little cell. You can pass by. Good luck finding a friend!"
As the cell passed by, it met a small ant. The ant was carrying a big leaf. The cell said, "Hello, ant! Can I help you carry the leaf?" The ant smiled and said, "Yes, thank you, cell! You are very kind. Let's be friends!" The cell and the ant became best friends, and they had many fun adventures in the wild forest together. And they lived happily ever after.
