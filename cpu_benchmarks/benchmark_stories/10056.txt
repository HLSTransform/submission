Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with toys. Anna likes dolls and Ben likes cars. One day, they go to the toy store with their mom. They see many toys. Some are big, some are small, some are colorful, some are noisy.
Anna sees a doll that she likes. It has long hair, a pretty dress, and a crown. She says to her mom, "Mom, can I have this doll? It is my dream doll!"
Ben sees a car that he likes. It has four wheels, a shiny body, and a horn. He says to his mom, "Mom, can I have this car? It is my dream car!"
Mom looks at the price tags. She says, "I'm sorry, Anna and Ben, but these toys are too expensive. We can't buy them today. Maybe you can save your money and buy them later."
Anna and Ben are sad. They want their dream toys. They start to cry. Mom says, "Don't cry, Anna and Ben. There are many other toys that you can play with. Look, here are some puzzles, some books, some blocks. They are not expensive, but they are fun and good for your brain."
Anna and Ben stop crying. They look at the other toys. They see some puzzles, some books, some blocks. They think, maybe they are fun and good for their brain. They pick one puzzle, one book, and one block each. They say to their mom, "Mom, can we have these toys? They are not expensive, but they are fun and good for our brain."
Mom smiles. She says, "Yes, you can have these toys. They are not expensive, but they are fun and good for your brain. I'm proud of you, Anna and Ben. You learned to be happy with what you have, and not to be greedy for what you don't have. That is a good lesson to learn."
Anna and Ben hug their mom. They say, "Thank you, mom. We love you. We love our toys. They are not our dream toys, but they are our happy toys."
The end.
