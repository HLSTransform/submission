John was walking through the park one day when he suddenly noticed an enormous brown box sitting on the bench. He was curious and decided to carry it back home. When he opened it up he was surprised to find a napkin inside. He picked it up and asked his mum, "What is this enormous napkin?" She smiled and said, "It's special. It can carry all the goodies you put inside it!" John was amazed. He had never seen anything like it before. He carefully put some sweets and other snacks inside the enormous napkin and carried it back to the park. He was so proud of his special new napkin and couldn't wait to show it off to all his friends.
