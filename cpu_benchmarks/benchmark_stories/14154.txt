Once upon a time, there were two cows who were very different. One was grey and one was white. They lived together in the same meadow.
The white cow was always running and playing, but the grey cow was quite shy. She would watch the white cow from a distance, feeling very sad.
One day, the grey cow wanted to join the white cow. She tried to catch up, but she couldn't go as fast. The white cow was surprised to see her, but happy too!
The white cow and the grey cow became good friends. They ate grass, and ran around together. The grey cow was very happy.
But one day, the grey cow noticed that the white cow was gone. She searched all around the meadow and called out her name, but she couldn't find her. She felt a big ache in her heart, and she knew she was missing her friend.
