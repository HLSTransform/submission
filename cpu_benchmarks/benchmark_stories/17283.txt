Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited to go to her first dance class. She put on her pretty pink tutu and ran to the dance studio. When she got there, she saw other girls who were also eager to dance.
The teacher told them to clap their hands and follow her instructions. Lily tried her best to clap along with the other girls. She felt happy when she did it right. 
After the class, Lily's mom asked her how it went. Lily said, "I had so much fun! I learned that when we clap together, we can make beautiful music." Her mom smiled and hugged her, and said, "That's right, Lily. When we work together, we can make wonderful things happen."
