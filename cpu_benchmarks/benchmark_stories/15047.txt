One day, Josh was playing in the kitchen when he suddenly noticed the dishwasher. He had never seen it before and was very curious. He poked it with his finger. It felt cold and smooth.
He decided to take a closer look and opened the door. It was full of silver dishes, ready to be cleaned. Josh had never seen anything like it before and he was finding it very exciting.
'What is this big silver thing, mummy?' He asked his mum who had just walked in the kitchen.
'It's called a dishwasher, honey.' His mum replied.
'What does it do?' Josh asked, getting more and more curious. 
'It cleans the dishes.'
Josh thought about it for a bit before he got an idea. He took off his shoes, climbed inside the dishwasher and closed the door. The experience felt very uncomfortable but Josh thought it was great fun. 
'Come out, honey! The dishwasher is not for playing' his mum shouted. Josh happily complied and his mum hugged him with relief. She couldn't help but smile at Josh's adventurous spirit.
