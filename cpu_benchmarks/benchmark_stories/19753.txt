Sam had a really big box, and he owned lots of toys in it. He had a car, a doll, a ball and a plane. He put them all in the box, and he kept the box safe.
One day, a thief came to Sam's house. He saw the big box and wanted to own it too. So he tried to run away with it, and Sam saw him. Sam shouted at the thief, and ran after him.
But the thief was too fast! He ran away with the box, and Sam couldn't catch him. Sam didn't have his box anymore, and he felt so sad.
When the thief opened the box, he saw that there were only boring toys inside. He didn't want them, so he threw the box away and ran away.
Sam was sad for a while, but he was glad that he didn't lose his toys. He got a new box, and he still owned all his toys.
