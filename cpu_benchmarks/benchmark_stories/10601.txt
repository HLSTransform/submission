Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucy. She liked playing with her dolls, but one day her daddy told her a secret - they were going to the theater! Lucy was excited, so she hopped up and down with joy.
On the way to the theater, she saw a big building with lovely wide windows and huge doors. Inside, she saw lots of chairs and a big stage. Lucy was so excited! It was time to join in the fun.
At the theater, Lucy saw lots of people and heard music and singing coming from the stage. She couldn't wait to watch what was happening. Soon, a heavy curtain came down and the show started. Lucy was captivated.
When it was time to go home, Lucy said "I'm sad it's over, can we come back tomorrow?" Her Daddy nodded and said "Yes, if you'd like heavy, I'm sure we can!" 
So, Lucy and her Daddy returned to the theater the next day, and the day after that, and everyday for the next week. Lucy was so happy to join the fun at the theater that she smiled from ear to ear!
