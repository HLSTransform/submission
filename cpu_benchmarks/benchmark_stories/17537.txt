One day, Tom and Sue found a big toy car in the park. It was red and shiny and had four wheels. They wanted to play with it, but they did not know how to make it move.
"Maybe it needs a wire," Tom said. He looked around and saw a long wire hanging from a tree. He pulled it and tied it to the car.
"Let's go!" Sue said. She sat in the car and Tom pushed it. The car rolled down the hill, faster and faster. Sue laughed and waved to Tom.
But then, the car hit a rock and stopped. Sue bumped her head and cried. The wire snapped and fell to the ground. Tom ran to help her.
"Are you okay?" he asked.
"That hurt!" Sue said. "And the car is broken!"
They looked at the car and saw that it had a dent and a scratch. They felt sad and sorry.
"Maybe we should not have taken the car," Tom said. "It was not ours."
"You're right," Sue said. "We should have asked first."
They decided to take the car back to the park and look for the owner. They hoped he would not be angry.
As they walked, they met a man who was looking for something. He had a remote control in his hand.
"Hey, that's my car!" he said. "Where did you find it?"
"We're sorry, mister," Tom said. "We thought it was a toy. We did not know it had a remote control."
The man looked at the car and saw the damage. He frowned and shook his head.
"That's not a toy, kids," he said. "That's a model car. It's very impressive and expensive. It can go forward and reverse and do tricks. But you need the remote control and the wire to make it work. Without them, it's just a piece of metal."
He took the car and the wire from them. He was not happy.
"Next time, don't touch things that don't belong to you," he said. "You could get hurt or break something. And always ask before you borrow something. That's the polite thing to do."
Tom and Sue nodded and said they were sorry. They learned their lesson. They walked away, feeling ashamed and sad. They wished they had been more careful and respectful.
