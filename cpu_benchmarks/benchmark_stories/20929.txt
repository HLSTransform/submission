Once there was a girl who lived on a hill. She thought the hill was very interesting. One day she wanted to record how amazing it was.
The girl looked around at everything. She saw the flowers, the trees and the birds flying. She wanted to remember all of these things so she decided to record it.
So she started singing. She sang and sang and sang, singing about all the things she saw on the hill. Everyone heard her singing and they smiled.
Once she finished recording, she was so happy. She knew she would always remember the hill she loved so much.
