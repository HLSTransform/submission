It was a bright and sunny morning in the forest. Mick and his friend, Folly, were out for a walk. Suddenly, a spear hung down from a tree right in front of them. Folly looked afraid.
"Don't worry," Mick said in a kind voice. "I'm sure it's nothing scary."
Mick tried to take the spear down, but it was stuck. Folly stood at a safe distance and watched anxiously.
"What are you going to do?" asked Folly.
Mick thought for a moment, then brightened up. He ran back to the house and grabbed a ladder.
He returned with the ladder and placed it against the tree. He climbed up and unhooked the spear. Then he leaned down and passed the spear to Folly.
"See?" said Mick with a smile. "It was just stuck. Nothing too scary! Now you can be kind and hang it back up."
Folly smirked and said, "Ok, I can do that!" Together they hung the spear back up in its place.
Mick and Folly smiled at each other. They were glad that they had solved the problem together.
