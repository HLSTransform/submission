Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a shiny coin on the ground. Anna picks it up and puts it in her pocket.
"Look, Ben, I have a coin!" she says. "It is very pretty and bright. I can buy candy with it."
Ben feels sad. He does not have a coin. He wants candy too. He thinks Anna is not nice. He says, "That is not fair. You should share the coin with me. We are friends."
Anna thinks for a moment. She remembers that Ben is her friend. She remembers that sharing is good. She feels sorry for Ben. She says, "You are right, Ben. We are friends. I will share the coin with you. We can buy candy together."
Ben smiles. He is happy. He says, "Thank you, Anna. You are very kind and humble. I am sorry I was angry. You are a good friend."
Anna and Ben hug. They go to the candy store. They buy candy with the coin. They share the candy. They are happy. They are friends.
