Tom and Mia were playing on the beach. They liked to find shells and make piles of them. Tom found a big shell that was shiny and had many colors. He was very happy and showed it to Mia.
"Look, Mia, I found a nice shell!" he said.
Mia looked at the shell and frowned. She recognized it. It was the same shell that she had found yesterday and left on her towel. She thought Tom had taken it from her.
"That is my shell, Tom!" she said. "You took it from me!"
Tom was confused and sad. He did not take the shell from Mia. He found it in the sand. He did not want to make Mia angry.
"No, Mia, I did not take your shell. I found it here. See, there are more shells like it." he said and pointed to the sand.
Mia did not believe him. She thought he was lying. She wanted her shell back. She tried to grab it from Tom's hand.
"Give me my shell, Tom! It is mine!" she said.
Tom did not want to give up his shell. He liked it too much. He held it tight and pulled it away from Mia.
"No, Mia, it is my shell! I found it first!" he said.
They both pulled and tugged on the shell. They were both angry and loud. They did not hear their mom calling them.
"Tom! Mia! Come here, please!" their mom said.
She saw them fighting over the shell. She was not happy. She walked over to them and took the shell from their hands.
"Stop it, both of you! What is going on?" she said.
Tom and Mia both tried to explain. They both said the shell was theirs. They both said the other one was wrong.
Their mom looked at the shell. She recognized it too. She had seen it before. She knew who it belonged to.
"Tom, Mia, this shell is not yours. It is not mine. It is not anyone's. It is a shell that belongs to the sea. It is a gift that the sea gives us to enjoy, but not to keep. Do you understand?" she said.
Tom and Mia looked at the shell. They looked at their mom. They looked at each other. They felt sorry for fighting. They nodded.
"Yes, mom, we understand." they said.
Their mom smiled and hugged them. She gave them the shell to hold together.
"Good. Now, why don't you share this nice shell and look for more shells to admire? But remember, when we leave the beach, we have to leave the shells behind. They are not ours to take. They are the sea's to give." she said.
Tom and Mia agreed. They thanked their mom and said sorry to each other. They held the shell and looked at its colors. They felt happy and peaceful. They went back to playing on the beach. They found more shells and made piles of them. They shared them and admired them. They did not fight over them. They had fun.
