Once upon a time, there was an old man who was very greedy. Every day, he wanted to find a rare reward in the forest.
One day, he finally found it! He ran with the reward to his house, but the reward was so rare that it began to burn in his hands.
The old man started to cry. He went to see his neighbour, another old man, and asked for help. 
The neighour said, "I cannot help you. You had what you wanted, and now it is gone".
The old man cried even harder. The precious reward he found was gone, and he could never get it back. He was very sad, and never found another rare reward again.
