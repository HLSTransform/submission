Sam jogged along the path. He could smell a delicious smell coming from the nearby strawberry fields. He had been wanting to get some strawberries, but they weren't available.
Suddenly, a voice called out to him. He looked around and saw a small girl, about 3 years old, standing at the edge of the path. "Do you have any strawberries?", she asked.
Sam smiled at her and said, "Sorry, I don't have any, but I know where you can get some." He pointed to the strawberry fields.
The girl beamed a big smile. "Thanks!" she said, then gave Sam a wave before jogging off to get some strawberries.
Sam smiled, happy that he had been able to help. He knew how much the girl had been wanting some strawberries. He watched as she ran into the strawberry fields, probably to get some of the sweet, juicy strawberries that were now available.
