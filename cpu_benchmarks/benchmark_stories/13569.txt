Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. But one day, he noticed that the air was filled with smoke. The smoke was making it hard for Timmy to breathe and it smelled bad too. 
Timmy decided to tell his mom about the smoke. His mom listened to him and said that they should improve the air. She opened the windows and turned on a fan to blow the smoke away. Soon, the air was much better and Timmy could breathe easily again. 
But then, Timmy's sister started playing her music really loud. It was hurting Timmy's ears! Timmy told his sister to turn the music down, but she didn't listen. So, Timmy went to his mom again and told her about the loud music. His mom talked to his sister and asked her to play her music more quietly. Now, Timmy was happy because the air was clean and the music was not too loud. The end.
