Once there was a clever needle. She had an important job to do. Each day, she had to match up the clothes in her owner's drawer. It was a big job, and sometimes she had trouble getting it all done. 
One day, the needle felt like she was missing something. She thought for a long time about what it could be. Finally, she figured it out. It was a companion. She needed a friend to help her with all her matching. 
So the needle decided to look for somebody who was as clever as her. The needle went outside, hopped in the grass and looked for the perfect match. She found a little caterpillar who seemed to be very smart. 
The needle said, "Will you be my friend? I need your help to match all the clothes in my owner's drawer." The caterpillar said, "Yes! I would love to help you." 
From that day forward, the needle and caterpillar were the best of friends. They worked together each day, matching all the clothes and having lots of fun. They were really quite clever and proved that with the right friend, anything is possible.
