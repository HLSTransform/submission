Once upon a time there was a small theater. Inside, there were many people having fun. Suddenly, a loud noise scared one of them. They started to panic and ran away. Everyone else was confused. They all wanted to find out what had happened. So they looked inside the small theater. What they saw made them panic too. All around the theater were little bugs! Everyone ran out of the theater as fast as they could. The small theater was empty and quiet again. The end.
