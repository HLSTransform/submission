Once upon a time, there was a popular cat named Tom. Tom was very good at getting things. One day, Tom went to the kitchen to find some food. He saw a big, yummy cake on the table. Tom wanted the cake very much.
But, there was a problem. The kitchen door was closed. Tom tried to push it, but it did not move. He felt sad because he could not get the cake. He sat down and thought about how to open the door.
Then, Tom had an idea. He saw a ball near him. He pushed the ball with his paw and it hit the door. The door opened! Tom was very happy. He went into the kitchen and got the cake. From that day on, Tom was even more popular with his friends because he could get things from the kitchen.
