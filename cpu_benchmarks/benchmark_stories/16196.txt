Once upon a time there was a boy who was very clumsy. Whenever he tried to do something, he would always end up making a mess - like spilling the milk or dropping his toys. As his mum saw him getting messy more and more, she said 'it's time to bathe and get clean'. So they made their way to the bathroom and the boy jumped in the bath. 
But just as he was about to start washing, he found something strange. It was a big sausage! It had floated into one corner of the bath. At first the boy was frightened, but then he had a bright idea. Instead of eating, he decided to bathe the sausage! He rubbed it up, reaching every little bit and after some time the sausage was sparkling clean. Even his mum couldn't believe it when she saw.
The moral of the story is that anyone can do something great - no matter how clumsy they are! Even the tiniest things can be done with care and attention. All it takes is a little bit of patience and determination.
