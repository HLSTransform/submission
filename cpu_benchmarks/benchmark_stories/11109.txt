Once upon a time, there was a charming little girl named Lily. She loved to dress up in her pretty clothes. One day, she found a big cobweb in her room.
"Mom, there is a big cobweb in my room!" Lily cried. Her mom came to see.
"Oh no, we must clean it up," said her mom. But Lily had an idea. She wanted to use the cobweb to make her dress look even more pretty.
Lily and her mom worked together to make her dress look nice with the cobweb. But it was hard work, and the cobweb kept sticking to their hands. They both started to feel a little sad.
Just then, Lily's dad came in and saw what they were doing. He laughed and said, "Let's all work together to clean up the cobweb and find a different way to make your dress pretty."
So, they all cleaned up the cobweb and then found some shiny beads to put on Lily's dress. In the end, Lily's dress was more pretty than ever, and they all lived happily ever after.
