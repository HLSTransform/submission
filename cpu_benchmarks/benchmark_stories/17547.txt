Anna loved blueberries. She wanted to eat them every day. But blueberries were expensive. Mommy said they could only buy them sometimes.
One day, Anna and Mommy went to the store. Anna saw a big basket of blueberries. They looked juicy and sweet. Anna asked Mommy, "Can we buy some blueberries, please?"
Mommy looked at the price tag. She shook her head. "No, Anna, we can't. They are too expensive. We have to buy other things we need."
Anna felt sad and angry. She wanted blueberries so much. She did not care about other things. She said, "But I want blueberries, Mommy! Please, please, please!"
Mommy said, "Anna, stop. You are being rude. You have to listen to me. I am not going to allow you to have blueberries today. Maybe another day, when they are cheaper."
Anna did not listen. She grabbed a handful of blueberries and stuffed them in her mouth. She smiled. They tasted good.
Mommy saw what Anna did. She was very mad. She said, "Anna, what are you doing? That is stealing. You have to pay for the blueberries. You are in big trouble, young lady."
Anna realized she did something bad. She felt sorry. She spit out the blueberries. She said, "I'm sorry, Mommy. I was wrong. I won't do it again."
Mommy took Anna to the cashier. She paid for the blueberries. She said, "Anna, you have to learn to respect the rules. You can't take things that are not yours. You have to be patient and grateful for what you have."
Anna nodded. She said, "I understand, Mommy. I love you."
Mommy hugged Anna. She said, "I love you too, Anna. But you are still grounded. No blueberries for a week."
