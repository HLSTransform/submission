Once upon a time, there was a graceful rabbit. It loved to explore the world and would hop everywhere it went. One day, while hopping around, it came across a jar of ink. The ink was a vibrant blue color and was so shiny.
The rabbit was fascinated by it. It wanted to take the ink with it but knew it couldn't carry it. So the rabbit made a plan! It covered its small body with the ink and hopped away to show everyone its new fancy look.
As the rabbit hopped around, its friends couldn't recognize it. It hopped up to them and said hello, but they were too surprised. It then started hopping around in circles and singing a silly song.
The rabbit's friends soon realized who it was and started laughing. They told everyone about the rabbit and from then on, it was known as the most graceful creature in all the land. That rabbit would always be remembered for its ink-covered body and playful spirit.
