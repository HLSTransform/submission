Once upon a time, there was a stubborn little zebra who wanted to gain something special. This little zebra was determined, so she kept trying and trying, but nothing worked. After a few days, she had an idea. She went to a nearby pond and started to drink the water. She drank and drank until her belly was nice and full. She felt much stronger and soon, she had gained what she wanted. The other animals were very happy for the little zebra and from then on everyone admired her determination!
