There was once a bee who wanted to find the perfect place to lay her eggs. She looked all over the city, but nothing seemed quite right.
Finally, she decided to fly up to the mountains. To her delight, she found a nice, easy spot to lay her eggs. It was soft and warm, perfect for a cozy nest!
So the bee laid her eggs and flew away. She was so happy to have found just the right place.
As time went on, the eggs hatched and little baby bees started to crawl around. They were so glad to be in their new home. It was safe, cozy, and so easy to fly around in.
The bees were all so happy living amongst the mountains. They buzzed and flew around in the sunshine, happy to have found such a wonderful place to lay their eggs.
