Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He had a big head and loved to play with his friends. One day, he wanted to invite his friend Billy to come over and play with him. So, he went to Billy's house and knocked on the door. Billy's mom answered the door and Timmy asked if Billy could come over and play. Billy's mom said yes and Timmy was very happy.
When they got to Timmy's house, they played with toys and had lots of fun. But then, Timmy accidentally broke one of Billy's toys. He felt ashamed and didn't know what to do. But then he remembered his mom telling him that when you make a mistake, you should say sorry and try to make it right. So, Timmy apologized to Billy and promised to buy him a new toy. Billy forgave him and they continued to play happily. The end.
