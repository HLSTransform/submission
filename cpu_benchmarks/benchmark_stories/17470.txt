Lily and Tom were playing hide and seek in the garden. Lily was the seeker and Tom was the hider. Lily counted to ten and then looked for Tom. She saw a big bush with green leaves and smelled something nice. She thought Tom might be hiding behind the bush.
She walked to the bush and peeked behind it. She saw Tom sitting on the ground with a bunch of herbs in his hands. He was chewing on some of them and making funny faces.
"Tom, I found you!" Lily said. "What are you doing with those herbs?"
Tom looked at Lily and smiled. "I'm eating them. They taste good and make me feel funny. Do you want some?" He offered Lily some herbs.
Lily was curious and took a bite. The herbs were bitter and spicy. She did not like them at all. She spit them out and made a yucky sound.
"Tom, these herbs are gross! Why do you eat them?" Lily asked.
Tom shrugged. "I don't know. I just like them. They make me dizzy and happy. Come on, let's eat more and play some more."
Lily shook her head. "No, thank you. I don't want to eat more. I don't want to be dizzy and happy. I want to be normal and safe. These herbs are not good for you, Tom. They might make you sick or hurt you. We should stop eating them and tell Mommy."
Tom frowned. "No, I don't want to stop. I don't want to tell Mommy. I want to eat more and more. You are no fun, Lily. Go away and leave me alone."
Lily felt sad and scared. She did not like how Tom was acting. She did not want to leave him alone, but he did not listen to her. She ran away from the bush and looked for Mommy. She wanted to tell her what Tom was doing and ask for help.
But it was too late. Tom ate too many herbs and got very sick. He fell asleep and did not wake up. Mommy found him and cried. She called the doctor, but he could not help. Tom was gone. Lily lost her brother and her friend. She wished she had never peeked behind the bush. She wished Tom had never eaten the herbs. She wished they had played a different game. She wished they had a happy ending.
