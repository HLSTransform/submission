Once upon a time there was a little girl, she was only three years old. Her name was Penny and she was very adventurous.
One day, Penny's mother gave her a little cloth sack to play with. She showed her how to put things in and take them out of the sack. Penny thought it was so fun and wanted to find more things to put in it.
So she went off on an adventure! She filled her sack with leaves, stones and shells. But the more she filled her sack the heavier it got, so she had to stop.
She looked around and saw her messes all around her. She saw piles of leaves, stones and shells. Penny felt so ashamed and ran back home.
When she got back, her mother smiled. "I knew you would make a big mess, but now put all your mess into the sack."
Penny was so surprised! It turns out her mother had given her the sack so she could carry her messes around and clean them up. Now Penny has her little cloth sack with her everywhere she goes, filled with the things she finds on her adventures.
