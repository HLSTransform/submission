Once upon a time, there was a clever dog named Max. Max lived in a big yard with his family. One day, Max's friend, a cat named Lily, came to visit him. 
"Max, I have a plan," said Lily. "Let's play hide and seek!"
Max thought it was a great idea and agreed to play. Lily went to hide while Max counted. After a while, Max found Lily hiding behind a tree. 
"You are so intelligent, Lily!" said Max. "You always find the best hiding spots."
Lily purred with happiness and they continued to play together in the yard.
