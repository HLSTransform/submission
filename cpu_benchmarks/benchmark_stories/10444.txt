Once upon a time there was a girl who liked to feel music. She loved the way the notes of a song filled her heart with joy. One day she saw an ordinary piano in the park. She walked over to it and started to press the keys. As soon as she touched them, she felt a special kind of happiness. She kept playing and soon the park was filled with wonderful music.
The girl kept playing every day and soon people started to gather around her. They all clapped and sang along with the songs she played. The girl was so happy that she wanted to play even more.
She started to practice the piano every day until she could play it like a master. She felt so proud of herself and knew that she could do anything. From that day on, the girl always knew she could find her own happiness by playing the piano.
