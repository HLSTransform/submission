Once there was a puppy named Rusty. He was a very obedient puppy. One day, Rusty was playing near the bay when he saw a beautiful big yacht. He wanted to get closer and have a better look at it, so he started to run towards it. All of a sudden, a gust of wind scattered the leaves around him.
Rusty was so surprised by the gust of wind that he was stopped in his tracks. A voice called out from the boat then.
"Be careful Rusty," the voice said. It was his owner, Mrs. Johnson.
"Sometimes things that seem very fun and exciting can be dangerous," she said.
Rusty realized that Mrs. Johnson was right. He had almost been too careless and run right into the water. From then on, Rusty was extra careful and obedient. This was a valuable lesson for Rusty; being curious is great, but it's important to be careful too!
