Once upon a time there were two brothers called Tom and Jack. Tom was 3 years old and Jack was 6 years old. Tom was very gentle and Jack was a little bit naughty.
One day Tom received a beautiful trophy. It was gold and shiny with a big red bow on top of it. It said "Tom, Best Big Brother". Tom was so proud and he wanted to show Jack.
Jack was happy for his brother, but he wanted the trophy for himself. So he tried to spoil it. He shook it and held it the wrong way up. 
Tom was sad and said, "Stop it Jack! Please treat my trophy gently." 
Jack stopped and hugged his brother. He said,  "I'm sorry Tom. I won't spoil your trophy again. You deserve it!"
Tom smiled and hugged Jack back. From that day on, Jack was always very gentle with Tom's trophy.
