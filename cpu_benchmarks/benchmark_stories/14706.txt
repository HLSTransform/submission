There was a little girl called Sally. She loved to explore and discover new things. One day, Sally went outside to play. She saw a big box next to her house. She was very excited and started to unpack it. 
Inside the box were hundreds of sunflowers. They were beautifully bright and colourful and Sally could smell their sweet scent. She carefully removed them from the box and dotted them around her house and garden. 
Sally was so excited to look and feel the sunflowers, yet she felt disappointed. They all felt so hard and prickly. She wished that they were soft and gentle like the petals of a rose. 
But suddenly, she saw something that made her heart leap - the biggest and most beautiful sunflower she had ever seen! It felt so soft and velvety - it was perfect!
Sally hugged the sunflower and knew that she had found a new friend. From that day on, when Sally played outside, she took her soft sunflower with her.
