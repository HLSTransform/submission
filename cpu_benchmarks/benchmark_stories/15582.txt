Tom and Mia are playing in the park. They like to run and slide and swing. They see a big hill with many trees. They want to climb the hill and see what is on the other side.
They hold hands and start to walk up the hill. They see many birds and bugs and flowers. They hear a loud noise. They stop and look. They see a huge man. He is very tall and fat and hairy. He has a big stick and a big bag. He is hitting the trees with his stick and putting the birds and bugs and flowers in his bag.
Tom and Mia are scared. They hide behind a tree. They whisper to each other.
"Who is he?" Tom asks.
"I don't know. He is bad. He is hurting the trees and the animals and the plants." Mia says.
"What do we do?" Tom asks.
"We have to find help. We have to tell someone." Mia says.
They look around. They see a path that leads to the other side of the hill. They hope to find someone there who can help them. They run as fast as they can. They don't look back. They hope the huge man doesn't see them. They hope the trees and the birds and the bugs and the flowers are okay.
