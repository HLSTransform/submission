Timmy was so excited to go to the park. He had a picnic lunch packed in his bag and was wearing his favourite shorts. When he arrived at the park, he saw something unusual. Through the faucet, water was coming out and it was shooting into the air wildly! Timmy had never seen anything like it before. 
He started to laugh and run around the faucet, letting the water spray all over him. His mom, seeing this, laughed and said, “What an unusual surprise!” She reached into her bag and pulled out a bright red umbrella. She opened it and twirled it around with Timmy, so the water sprayed them both. 
The water show was so much fun. Timmy and his mom kept playing and laughing until the water began to slow down and eventually stopped altogether. Timmy thanked his mom for the best park trip ever, and they hugged before heading home.
