Once upon a time there was a girl named Lucy. She was three years old and loved playing in the sun. 
One day, Lucy and her family went to a great festival. There were lots of fun things to do and Lucy loved it. She rode a big ferris wheel that was all lights and made funny sounds. She ate yummy food and saw funny clowns. 
Lucy was so happy at the festival. She wanted to remember it forever. She took lots of pictures with her family, so she would always remember. 
Lucy smiled when she thought back on the great festival. Every time she went to the pictures to look back at it, she felt happy. She would always remember!
