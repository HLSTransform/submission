Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to go picking berries. She would often take her bucket outside and find the sweetest berries that she could.
One day the little girl noticed a big berry bush. It was full of the plumpest berries that she had ever seen. She couldn't help but clap with joy at the sight.
The little girl smiled and went over to the bush. She started picking berries and popping them into her bucket. She was so excited!
"I can't believe how sweet these berries are!" she said to herself.
Just then, the little girl heard a voice from the bush.
"Don't forget to clap for me when you finish picking the berries," said the bush.
The little girl was surprised but followed the bush's instructions. When she finished, she clapped for the berry bush.
The little girl was so happy with her bucket full of sweet berries that she shared some of her delicious bounty with her family and friends. They all clapped together for the berry bush - with appreciation for the sweet harvest.
