Once upon a time there was a kind lady called Julie. Julie was very persistent, which meant she never gave up. One day she had a plan. She took a rope and went to a high tree. She wanted to fly like a bird and she thought if she could just relax and swing on the rope, then she would be able to do it.
So she started to swing and swing. She kicked her feet and tried to fly, but it wasn’t working. She tried and tried, but she just couldn’t get off the ground.
But Julie didn’t give up. She kept on swinging and swinging and trying. Suddenly, after lots of persistence, she took off! She flew around the tree and even higher up into the sky.
Julie had done it! She had learned to fly and she felt so happy and relaxed. She had shown that no matter how hard it is, if you keep trying, you can achieve anything.
