Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go on adventures. One day, he went on an adventurous walk in the woods. He saw a white bunny hopping around. 
Timmy wanted to catch the bunny, so he sat down on a log and waited. The bunny hopped closer and closer until it sat right beside Timmy. Timmy was so happy to see the white bunny up close. 
After a while, Timmy got up and continued his adventure. He walked and walked until he found a big tree. He decided to climb up and sit on a branch. From up high, he could see everything around him. It was an exciting and adventurous day for Timmy.
