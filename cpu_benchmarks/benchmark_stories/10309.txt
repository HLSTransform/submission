Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books and games. But they do not share well. They always fight over who gets what.
One day, Mom says, "Boys, I have a surprise for you. We are going to spend the day at the zoo. You can see the animals and have fun. But you have to be good and not fight. Can you do that?"
Tom and Sam nod and smile. They love the zoo. They put on their coats and shoes and follow Mom to the car. They are very excited.
At the zoo, they see lions and tigers and bears. They see monkeys and elephants and giraffes. They see birds and fish and snakes. They have a lot of fun. They also see a panda. Mom says, "Look, boys, a panda. It is very rare. You do not see it often. It is special."
Tom and Sam look at the panda. It is black and white and fluffy. It eats bamboo and rolls on the ground. It is very cute. Tom and Sam both want to touch it. They run to the fence and reach out their hands.
"Stop!" Mom says. "You cannot touch the panda. It is not a toy. It is a wild animal. It can bite you. You have to be careful and respectful. You have to share the space with the panda and the other people. Can you do that?"
Tom and Sam nod and say sorry. They realize they were wrong. They do not want to hurt the panda or make Mom angry. They step back and watch the panda from a distance. They also let other children see the panda. They learn to share and be kind.
Mom smiles and hugs them. She says, "Good boys. I am proud of you. You are learning and growing. You are special too. Just like the panda."
