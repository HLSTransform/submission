Once there was a loyal dolphin. Every day the dolphin would crawl slowly to the beach. He was looking for someone to play with.
One day, the dolphin saw a three year old boy standing by the sea. The dolphin jumped out of the water and smiled. The boy was excited and started to crawl toward the dolphin.
The boy and the dolphin started to play together. They would swim and dive in the ocean. The loyal dolphin even let the boy ride on his back.
The loyal dolphin and the three year old boy became good friends. They would spend time together every day. The dolphin was so happy to have a new friend.
