Once upon a time, there was a big forest. In the forest, there lived a small rabbit and a big bear. They were best friends. They liked to play together and have fun all day long.
One day, the rabbit and the bear found a weird tree. The tree was very tall and had many colors. The rabbit wanted to climb the tree, but the bear was scared. He warned the rabbit, "Please be careful. It might not be safe."
The rabbit listened to the bear and they both decided to play near the tree instead. They had so much fun and were happy to be safe. The rabbit and the bear learned that it is important to listen to their friends' warnings. And they lived happily ever after in the big forest.
