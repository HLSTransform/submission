Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her puppy, Max. One day, Lily's tummy hurt a lot and she felt sick. Her mommy asked her if she needed to go to the toilet, and Lily said yes.
When Lily went to the toilet, she felt much better. She told her mommy, "I suffered a lot, but now I feel better." Her mommy was happy to hear that Lily was feeling better. 
Afterwards, Lily and Max played together. Max was very lively and ran around the room. Lily laughed and said, "Max, you are so lively!" Max barked and wagged his tail, happy to play with his best friend.
