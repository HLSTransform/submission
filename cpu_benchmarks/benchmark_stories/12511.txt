Once upon a time, a little boy named Timmy went to visit his grandma. Grandma cooked Timmy a yummy meal with his favorite food, chicken nuggets. Timmy thought the meal was so cool because he got to eat with his hands and dip his nuggets in ketchup. 
After dinner, Timmy and his grandma played a guessing game. Grandma would say a word and Timmy had to guess what it was. Timmy guessed "dog" and "ball" but he couldn't guess "banana" because he didn't like bananas. 
When it was time for Timmy to go home, he gave his grandma a big hug and said "Thank you for the cool meal and fun guessing game, grandma!"
