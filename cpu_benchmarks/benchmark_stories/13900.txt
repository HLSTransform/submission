Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a favorite shirt that was very popular. It was a red shirt with a big, happy sun on it. He loved to wear it all the time.
One day, Tim and his friend Sam were playing in the park. Sam saw Tim's shirt and wanted one too. They started to discuss where Tim got his shirt. Tim told Sam that his mom bought it for him. Sam was happy to know this and decided to ask his mom for the same shirt.
The next day, Sam wore his new popular shirt to the park. At first, Tim was sad because now his shirt was not special anymore. But then, he saw that other kids liked their shirts too and wanted to be friends with them. Tim and Sam made many new friends that day. They learned that sharing good things can bring more happiness and friends to everyone.
