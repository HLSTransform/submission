Once upon a time, there was a big, hairy rabbit named Bongo. Bongo loved to eat radishes from the garden. One day, Bongo saw a little bird sitting on a branch. Bongo wanted to play with the bird, but he accidentally slapped the bird with his big, hairy paw. 
The little bird was very sad and flew away. Bongo felt bad and wanted to say sorry, but the bird was already gone. Bongo went back to eating his radishes, but he didn't feel happy anymore. 
Later that day, a big, scary fox came into the garden. Bongo tried to run away, but the fox caught him and ate him for dinner. The end.
