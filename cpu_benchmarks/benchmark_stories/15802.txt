Once upon a time there were two animals who were very competitive with each other. Their names were Bunny and Duck.
One day Bunny said to Duck, “I can measure the ground better than you.”
Duck replied, “No you can’t! I can do it better!”
Bunny was excited. “Let's have a competition to see who can measure the ground the best.”
Duck said, “OK, I’m ready, let’s go!”
So, both Bunny and Duck started to measure the ground and try to figure out who was the best at measuring. They went around and around the ground and finally, Bunny was finished first. 
“I measure the ground better than you!” exclaimed Bunny proudly.
Duck was a little sad, but said, “That’s ok, try again next time and I’ll do better.”
Bunny and Duck were still very competitive, but they were also very good friends. They laughed and hugged as they continued to measure the ground together.
