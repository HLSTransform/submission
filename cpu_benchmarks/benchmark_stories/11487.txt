"Mommy, I want to swing!" said the three year old.
"You need to hold on tight and trust your reliable lungs!" said mom.
The three year old grabbed the rope and with mom's help pulled herself onto the swing. She pushed off and away she went, swinging higher and higher.
The three year old felt so free, it was like she was flying! The wind tickling her face and passing through her hair.
"Look mom, no hands!" exclaimed the three year old.
"Oh my! Now make sure to use your reliable lungs and hold on tight, ok?" said mom with a smile.
The three year old couldn't help but laugh and smile. She never wanted the moment to end.
