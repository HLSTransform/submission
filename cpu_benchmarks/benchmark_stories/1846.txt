Mama was feeling good. With a smile on her face, she said to her three year old daughter, "Let's have an idea. What do you think we should pour?"
The daughter thought for a moment, then with a gleam in her eyes said, "Let's pour water in an old bucket".
Mama smiled, grabbed an old bucket and filled it with water.
The daughter was so excited and looked around her garden. She saw the old watering can and a light bulb came on in her brain. "Let's pour the water from the old bucket into the old watering can!" she shouted.
Mama thought it was a wonderful idea. Together they poured the water from the bucket into the old watering can.
Just then, the daughter noticed something in the garden. On a branch of an old tree was a pot of freshly watered plants. It looked like they had been there a while, as they were quite old.
"Mama, did you pour the water from the bucket into the pot too?" the daughter asked with surprise.
Mama smiled. "Yes, I thought it was a good idea."
The daughter's eyes widened. She couldn't believe Mama had made such a clever plan.
