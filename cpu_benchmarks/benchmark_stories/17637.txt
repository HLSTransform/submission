Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a bulb that she loved to water every day. One day, Lily's mom said to her, "Lily, can you listen to me for a minute? We need to go to the store to buy some food." Lily was eager to go to the store with her mom.
At the store, Lily saw her friend Timmy. Timmy said, "Lily, what do you have there?" Lily showed him her bulb and said, "I water it every day." Timmy said, "Wow, you are a good gardener!" 
When Lily got home, she watered her bulb again and said, "I love my bulb. It makes me happy." Her mom listened to her and said, "I'm glad you love your bulb, Lily. It's important to take care of the things we love."
