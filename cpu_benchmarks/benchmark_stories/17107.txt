Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat grapes, and her mommy always gave her a big bowl of them to snack on. One day, Lily was playing outside when she saw a bird flying in the sky. She looked up and said, "Wow, look at the bird! It's so pretty."
Later that day, Lily's mommy asked her to help pick some grapes from the garden. Lily was very excited because she loved grapes. As she was picking the grapes, she saw the same bird she saw earlier sitting on a tree nearby. She said, "Hi birdie, do you want some grapes too?" The bird looked at Lily and flew away.
Lily was thoughtful and wondered why the bird didn't want any grapes. She thought maybe the bird didn't like grapes or maybe it already had its own food. As she finished picking the grapes, she saw the bird again. This time, it was holding a grape in its beak. Lily smiled and said, "Oh, the birdie wanted a grape after all! How nice!"
