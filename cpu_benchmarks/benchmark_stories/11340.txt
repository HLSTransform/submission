Once upon a time there was a puppy. He loved to slide all day long! He was so fast, it was like he was flying! He tried to slide up the hill but it was too hard. The puppy got stuck.
The puppy tried to climb the hill but it was too difficult. He felt sad and wished he could slide up the hill.
Then, the puppy saw a collar. It looked so easy. He tried to put the collar around his neck. The collar fit perfectly and suddenly he was able to slide up the hill!
The puppy was so happy! He was able to slide up the hill with ease and have lots of fun. He wished he could wear the collar forever!
