Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play hockey with his friends. He would always run around with his stick and try to score a goal. One day, Timmy's friend Johnny came to play with him. Johnny was very impatient and always wanted to win.
Timmy and Johnny started playing hockey together. Johnny was very good at hockey and kept scoring all the goals. Timmy felt sad because he couldn't score any goals. But Timmy had a secret trick up his sleeve. He knew how to bow very low and sneak up on Johnny.
When the time was right, Timmy bowed low and snuck up on Johnny. He quickly took the puck and scored a goal! Johnny was surprised and happy for Timmy. From that day on, Timmy and Johnny played hockey together and had lots of fun.
