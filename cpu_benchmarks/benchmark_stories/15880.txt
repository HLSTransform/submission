Once upon a time there lived a little old man.  He lived all by himself behind a big hill. Every day the old man would go down the hill to the stream and fish.
One day, when he was fishing, he heard a loud noise. He looked around and saw a big bear. The old man was frightened and he started to complain.
The old man said, "Go away bear! Why are you here?"
The bear said, "I'm looking for food. Can you help me?"
The old man was not sure what to do. He thought for a moment and then said, "I can give you some of my fish. Then you can go and find something else to eat."
The bear thanked the old man and took the fish. The old man was glad he did not have to fight the bear. He watched as the bear went away and he was no longer frightened. 
The old man continued to complain, but he was happy that the bear was gone. He went back to his fishing and continued to enjoy his days near the stream.
