Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved playing soccer with his friends. One day, Timmy's dad came to watch him play. "What's the goal, Timmy?" asked his dad. "To score a goal!" Timmy replied with a big smile. 
During the game, Timmy's friend Billy kicked the ball towards him. Timmy ran as fast as he could and kicked the ball with all his might. The ball went flying into the goal! "I did it! I scored a goal!" Timmy shouted happily. 
After the game, Timmy's mom brought out some snacks for the team. Timmy noticed that his friend Sarah had a different snack than everyone else. "What did you bring, Sarah?" Timmy asked. "I brought some cut-up apples," Sarah replied. "Can I try some?" Timmy asked politely. Sarah smiled and shared her apples with Timmy. They were delicious! 
From that day on, Timmy brought cut-up apples to every soccer game. He loved trying different snacks and sharing them with his friends. And he always remembered the goal - to have fun and score as many goals as possible!
