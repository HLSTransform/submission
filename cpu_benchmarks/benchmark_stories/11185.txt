Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toy top that could spin round and round. She would spin it so fast that it made her dizzy.
One day, Lily's mommy was cooking something on the stove. She saw the steam coming out of the pot and it smelled delicious. Lily asked her mommy what she was cooking, but her mommy said it was a surprise.
Later that day, Lily's mommy called her over to the kitchen. She had a big surprise for Lily. It was a cake that had steam coming out of it and it smelled so delicious. Lily was so happy and she spun around with joy.
