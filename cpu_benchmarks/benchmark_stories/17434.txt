Ben and Lily liked to play outside in the sun. They ran and jumped and laughed. They saw many flowers and bugs and birds. They were happy.
One day, they saw a big cloud in the sky. It was dark and loud. It made a boom sound. Ben and Lily were scared. They ran to their mom.
"Mom, mom, what is that?" they asked.
"That is a storm, my loves. It is part of the season. Sometimes the sky makes rain and wind and thunder. It is okay. It will go away soon," mom said.
She hugged them and gave them a cookie. She told them a story about the seasons. She said there were four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. Each season had different weather and different things to see and do.
"Can we follow the seasons, mom?" Lily asked.
"What do you mean, sweetie?" mom asked.
"Can we go where the seasons go? Can we see the snow and the leaves and the flowers?" Lily said.
Mom smiled. She said they could follow the seasons with their eyes and their minds. She said they could look at books and pictures and videos of different places and different seasons. She said they could imagine and pretend and learn.
Ben and Lily liked that idea. They were not scared of the storm anymore. They were curious and excited. They wanted to follow the seasons and see the world.
