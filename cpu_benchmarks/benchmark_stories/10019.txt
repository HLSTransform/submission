Once upon a time, there was a big race. The racers ran fast and tried to win. One racer was very quick and won the race. He was happy and proud.
After the race, the racers went to a big structure. It was a tall building with lots of floors. They went inside and saw the clear windows. They could see everything outside.
The winner looked out the window and felt happy. He had won the race and now he could see the world from the clear structure. It was a good day for him.
