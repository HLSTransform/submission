Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wake up early and watch the sunrise. One day, she went for a walk with her mom and saw a lively bird singing on a tree. 
Lily said, "Mommy, can we have a bird like that?" 
Mommy replied, "We can't have a bird, but we can make a birdhouse for the bird to live in." 
Lily was excited and they went home to make a birdhouse. They worked hard and finally finished it. They put the birdhouse in the tree where the bird was singing. 
The next day, Lily woke up early to watch the sunrise again. She saw the birdhouse and was happy. Suddenly, the bird flew away and Lily was sad. But then, the bird came back and landed on the birdhouse. Lily was so happy and said, "Mommy, we did it! We made a home for the bird!" 
Mommy smiled and said, "Yes, we did. And we also made a new friend." 
Lily smiled and said, "I like making new friends. It's like reversing the sad."
