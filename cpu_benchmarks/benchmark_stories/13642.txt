Lila and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a big box. They pretend the box is a car. They travel to different places with the box.
One day, Lila wants to travel to the zoo. She puts on her vest. Her vest has animals on it. She says, "Tom, let's go to the zoo. I want to see the lions and the monkeys."
Tom says, "No, Lila. I don't want to go to the zoo. I want to go to the moon. I have a helmet. My helmet is shiny. The moon is shiny too."
Lila and Tom start to argue. They both want to drive the box. They pull and push the box. The box breaks. They are sad. They have no car.
They look at each other. They say sorry. They hug. They say, "We are still friends. We can share. We can take turns. We can travel to the zoo and the moon."
They fix the box. They get in the box. They smile. They travel to the zoo and the moon. They have fun. They see lively animals and stars. They are happy.
