One day, a small boy named Tim and his soft toy, Bunny, went for a walk. They saw a big tree with many turns. Tim and Bunny wanted to climb the tree.
Tim said, "Let's take turns climbing the tree, Bunny!" Bunny nodded and let Tim go first. Tim climbed up the tree and saw a bird's nest. The bird said, "Hello, Tim! Can you tell me a story?" Tim smiled and began to tell the bird a story about a brave cat.
When Tim finished, it was Bunny's turn to climb. Bunny climbed up the tree and saw the bird too. The bird asked, "Bunny, can you tell me a story too?" Bunny thought for a moment and then told the bird a story about a kind dog.
The bird liked both stories and thanked Tim and Bunny. They all became friends and played together until the sun went down. Tim and Bunny went back home, excited to tell their mom about their new friend and the fun they had.
