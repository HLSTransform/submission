Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to drink juice, especially apple juice. She asked her mommy if she could have some juice, but her mommy said she had to pay for it. 
Lily didn't know what "pay" meant, so her mommy explained that it meant she had to give something in exchange for the juice. Lily went to her piggy bank and found some coins. She gave the coins to her mommy and her mommy gave her a cup of juice.
Lily drank the juice and felt happy. But then she noticed that her tummy was feeling a bit fat. She didn't like feeling fat, so she decided to go play outside and run around. She had fun and forgot all about feeling fat. From that day on, Lily always remembered to pay for her juice and to play outside to stay healthy. The end.
