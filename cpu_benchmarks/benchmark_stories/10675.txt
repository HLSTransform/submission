It was a sunny day and two teddy bears, named Kelly and Jim, had just come home from the park. 
Kelly wanted to play with her toy cars, but Jim was interested in the bookshelf on the other side of the room. Kelly followed him to the empty bookshelf and tried to take it away from him. As soon as Jim saw this, he got angry and the two teddy bears started to fight. 
They scratched each other with their claws and knocked over books and other toys. In the end, Jim won the fight and took back the bookshelf. 
Kelly was sad but decided to make the best of the situation and helped Jim put the books back in the shelves. In the end they both hugged and made up with each other.
