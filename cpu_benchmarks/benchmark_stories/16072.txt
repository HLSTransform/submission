Jimmy was a three-year-old boy who was playing with his toys. His mum was in the kitchen making dinner. Jimmy pointed his finger at his truck and said, "Go!" He then saw something moving out of the corner of his eye. He turned and saw a bird flying in the open sky. He was so excited and shouted out, "Look mummy, motion!" 
Jimmy's mum smiled and said, "That's right, Jimmy. It's a bird". "Point! Point," shouted Jimmy as the bird flew closer. His mum smiled again and said, "It's ok, Jimmy. The bird won't hurt you". She then opened the window and waved her hand in the air to show Jimmy the motion. 
Jimmy was amazed. He couldn't contain his enthusiasm, so he ran over to the window and shouted, "Hello bird!" The bird chirped and flew away. Jimmy turned to his mum and said, "Bye bye bird!". His mum smiled and said, "Goodbye bird." Jimmy was happy and said, "I love motion!"
