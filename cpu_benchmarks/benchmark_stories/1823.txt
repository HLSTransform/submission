Once there was a little red cart. It was a wagon that used to belong to Jack and Jill. It was their favourite thing to play with.
One day, Jack and Jill were having so much fun with their cart that they decided to go on an adventure. They scattered around the forest, looking for adventure.
Jack and Jill soon found a tall tree. It was full of colourful fruit. "Let's get these fruits and fill our little red cart!" said Jack.
They jumped with joy and started to gather the fruits and stuff them into their red cart.
When they had enough, they raced as fast as they could back home. They couldn't wait to show their parents all the fruits they had collected!
