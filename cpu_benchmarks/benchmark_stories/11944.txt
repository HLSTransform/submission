Once upon a time, there was a clever snowman named Frosty. Frosty loved to play in the winter with his friends. He was very intelligent and always had good ideas for games to play. 
One day, Frosty and his friends decided to have a snowball fight. They all made snowballs and began to throw them at each other. Frosty was very good at dodging the snowballs and he even displayed some fancy moves to avoid getting hit. 
After the snowball fight, Frosty and his friends built a fort out of snow. They used big blocks of snow to make the walls and decorated it with icicles. It was a beautiful display of their creativity. 
As the sun began to set, Frosty and his friends said goodbye and went home. Frosty was happy because he had so much fun with his friends. He couldn't wait for the next winter adventure.
