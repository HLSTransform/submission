One day, a boy called Joe was in his garden. He was looking for something to do. Suddenly, he spotted a parrot in a tree. He was so excited that he ran off to tell his mum. 
"Mum! Mum! Come outside, there's a parrot in the tree," Joe shouted. 
Mum replied, "That's fantastic Joe! Let's prepare a special treat for it." 
Joe smiled. He and his mum went to the kitchen. They found some bread and some fruit, which they cut up into small pieces. Then they took the treat outside and placed it underneath the tree. 
The parrot spotted the food straight away. It flew down and started to eat. But then it heard something. Someone was shouting harshly. 
The parrot flew away quickly, back up into the tree. Joe and his mum saw the parrot fly away and realised that the harsh noise had made it scared. 
Joe said sadly, "Maybe next time, we'll try to prepare a quieter treat for the parrot."
