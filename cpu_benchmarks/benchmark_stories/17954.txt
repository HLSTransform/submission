Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. Sally loved to visit her grandma's house. Grandma had a big, pretty house that was very organized. Sally liked to play with her toys there.
One day, Sally saw a frame on the wall. It had a picture of a happy family inside. Sally asked, "Grandma, who is in this frame?" Grandma smiled and said, "That is a picture of your mommy and daddy when they were little like you."
Sally loved to look at the frame and think about her mommy and daddy being little. She would visit Grandma's house and look at the frame every time. It made her feel happy and loved.
