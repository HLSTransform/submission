Once upon a time, there was a small bunny. The bunny loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, the sky turned dark and it started to rain. The bunny got scared and ran to find cover under a big tree. 
As the bunny waited for the rain to stop, it saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky. The bunny felt happy and wanted to play in the rainbow. But the rain kept falling and the bunny was sad. 
Suddenly, the bunny saw a small bird who was also stuck in the rain. The bunny felt sorry for the bird and invited it to share the cover under the tree. The bird was happy and they both watched the rainbow together until the rain stopped. From then on, the bunny and the bird became good friends and played together in the sunshine and rainbows.
