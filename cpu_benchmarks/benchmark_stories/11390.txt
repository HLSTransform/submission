Once upon a time there was a kind dog called Shadow. One day, Shadow was running along a beautiful trail when something shiny caught his eye. It was a bone!
Shadow stopped and thought "Wow, this looks yummy!" He was about to take a bite when he heard a voice.
"That's not yours," the voice said. "Come, I will show you what to do with it."
Shadow followed the voice, and it belonged to an old man. The old man said "Let's bury this bone, and make it a present for the animals in the forest."
Shadow dug the hole, and he helped the old man bury the bone. When they finished, the old man said "You are a very kind dog."
Shadow felt so happy. He thanked the old man, and ran off down the trail. From that day on, Shadow always buries bones as presents for the animals in the forest.
