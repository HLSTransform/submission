Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear pink dresses and play outside with her friends. One day, she ate too much candy and her stomach hurt. 
Lily's mom asked, "How do you feel, sweetie?"
Lily said, "My tummy hurts, Mommy. It feels like there are butterflies in there."
Mommy gave Lily some medicine and told her to rest. Lily lay down and closed her eyes. She felt better when she woke up and went outside to play with her friends again.
