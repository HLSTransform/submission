Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She was three years old. One day, she was very anxious because she wanted to gain something. She wished and wished for something special.
Suddenly, there was a magical present in the sky. It looked like a bag with oats inside it. She was so excited and quickly ran to get it! She opened the bag carefully and discovered that it was full of oats.
Amy was so happy because now she had oats! She could eat them for breakfast every day and would never be hungry again. Amy smiled and thanked the magical present from the sky. She was no longer anxious because she had gained something special.
The end.
