Once upon a time there was a man. He was all alone in the world. One day he set off on an adventure. He walked and walked until he came to a big lake. The lake was so wet! He jumped in with a big splash.
The man swam and swam. Suddenly he saw something. It was a little boat! He got in the boat and set off. The wind blew the boat further and further away.
The man sailed for many days and nights. He sailed under the stars and the sun. He smiled to himself. He had been on such a big adventure! 
Eventually the man made it back to shore. He was very tired but also excited. He set off again, ready to explore the world once more.
