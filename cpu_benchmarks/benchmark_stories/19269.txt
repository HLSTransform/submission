Once there was a little boy who was playing outside with his friends. He had a rope and his friends started to play a game. They decided to pass the rope around in a circle, and everyone got to take a turn. 
Once the rope came back around to the little boy, he noticed something. It was a furry string that was hanging from the rope! Everyone was excited and tried to guess what it was. 
The little boy touched the furry string and suddenly realized what it was. It was a hairy caterpillar! The little boy and his friends were amazed and started asking lots of questions about the caterpillar. 
It was a fun game and the little boy felt happy as he watched the hairy caterpillar crawl away. He waved goodbye as he passed the rope to his friends and they continued to play the game.
