Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat yummy food, especially cookies. One day, her mom made some delicious cookies and put them on the kitchen counter. But then, Lily saw a leak in the sink and wanted to help. She grabbed a towel and tried to reach the leak, but it was too high. Suddenly, her dad came and fixed the leak. Lily was so happy and ran back to the kitchen to eat her cookies. They tasted even more delicious because she had helped her family.
