Josh and his sister were playing in their yard. Josh was digging a deep hole in the ground while his sister was swinging on the swing.
Josh's dad was watching them from the kitchen window. He was worried that Josh may hurt himself. He opened the door and stepped out into the yard.
Dad: "Josh! Please rest. That hole is getting too deep!"
Josh: "But dad, it looks fun!"
Dad: "It may be fun, but it's also very harsh. If you don't rest, you might get hurt."
Josh listened to his dad and reluctantly stopped digging. He found a comfortable spot in the yard and laid down on the grass. His sister soon followed, lying down next to him.
Dad smiled and watched as the two siblings enjoyed their rest in the yard. Josh and his sister were finally taking a break.
