Tom and Sue were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a shiny thing under a bench. They ran to it and saw that it was a gold ring.
"Wow, look at this!" Tom said. "It is so pretty and bright!"
"Let me see!" Sue said. "I want to wear it!"
They both reached for the ring, but it was too small for their fingers. They tried to pull it off, but it was stuck.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tom cried. "It hurts! Give it to me!"
"No, it is mine!" Sue shouted. "I saw it first!"
They began to disagree and tug on the ring. They did not see the elderly man who was walking towards them. He had a cane and a hat. He looked angry.
"Hey, you two!" he yelled. "What are you doing with my ring? That is mine! I dropped it by accident!"
He grabbed the ring from their hands and hit them with his cane. Tom and Sue fell to the ground and cried. They had bruises and scratches. They were very sorry and scared.
The man put the ring on his finger and walked away. He did not care about them. He only cared about his gold.
Tom and Sue learned a hard lesson. They should not have disagreed and fought over something that was not theirs. They should have been kind and shared. They lost their friend and their fun. They had a bad ending.
