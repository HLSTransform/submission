One morning, Bill woke up feeling very lively. He loved reading. He went to his bedroom and found a book. It was a story about a boy who went on a magical adventure. He opened the book and started to read. 
As he read, he felt like he was flying with the boy in the story. He imagined himself sailing around different lands and meeting creatures he had only dreamed of.
He was so excited that he couldn't sit still. He jumped out of bed and ran around the house, laughing and pretending to be the boy on the pages. 
When he was finished, he put on his shoes and ran outside to play. He couldn't wait to tell all his friends what he had read that morning.
