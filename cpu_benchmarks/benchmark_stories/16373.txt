Once upon a time, there was a cheerful little girl named Sally. She loved going to her class every day to learn new things and play with her friends. One day, Sally's teacher taught the class how to tie their shoes.
Sally practiced tying her shoes at home. At first, it was hard for her, but she did not give up. She kept trying and trying until she could tie her shoes all by herself. Sally felt very proud and happy.
The next day, Sally saw her friend Timmy struggling to tie his shoes in class. Sally remembered how hard it was for her too. She went to Timmy and helped him learn how to tie his shoes. Timmy was grateful, and they both felt good about helping each other. The moral of the story is to never give up and always help your friends when they need it.
