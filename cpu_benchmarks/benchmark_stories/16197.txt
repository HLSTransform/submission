Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack who lived with his two parents. He loved to play in the garden and often helped his parents in the kitchen.
One day, Jack was in the kitchen when he heard his parents quarrel. His parents were arguing about potatoes. Jack was curious, so he asked them what was wrong.
"It's not important," said his dad.
"It is important," said his mom. She said, "Your dad wants to have potatoes for dinner and I don't like potatoes."
Jack decided to help both of his parents. He grabbed a potato from the pantry and quickly cut it in half. He put one half in his mom's bowl, and the other half in his dad's bowl.
Both of his parents smiled and thanked Jack. His dad said, "You are so alert and loving, Jack. Thank you for helping us out."
His mom added, "Yes, we appreciate your help. Let's never quarrel over potatoes again, okay?"
Jack smiled and nodded. From that day on, Jack's parents enjoyed meals together and were careful never to quarrel again.
