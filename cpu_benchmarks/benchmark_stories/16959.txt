Lila and Tom are at the beach with their mom and dad. They like to play in the sand and look at the sea. The sea is big and blue and makes a loud sound.
"Look, Lila, I made a castle!" Tom says, pointing at his sand pile. He puts a shell on top of it.
"That's nice, Tom. But my castle is bigger and better!" Lila says, showing her sand pile. She puts a feather on top of it.
They start to argue about whose castle is the best. They do not see the big wave coming from the sea. The wave is thick and fast and wet.
"Watch out!" their mom says, running to them. She grabs them and lifts them up. The wave crashes on the sand and washes away their castles.
"Oh no, our castles!" Lila and Tom say, looking sad.
"It's okay, sweeties. You can make new ones. The sea likes to play too, sometimes. But you have to be careful and listen to me," their mom says, hugging them.
Lila and Tom nod and say sorry. They hug their mom back and smile. They still like the sea, even if it is naughty sometimes. They go back to the sand and make new castles, but not too close to the sea.
