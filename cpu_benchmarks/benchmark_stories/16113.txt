Tim was a young boy who liked to try new things. One day, he decided to see how long he could hold his breath. He took a deep breath and began to count. He kept counting for what seemed like a very long time until he heard a loud sound. It was his mother calling him from the other room.
Tim smiled and ran to his mother who said, "Tim, did you succeed?"
Tim proudly replied, "Yes."
His mother said, "That's great! You held your breath for a long time! I'm so proud of you!"
Tim was happy to have succeeded and it made him feel special. From then on, whenever he tried something hard, he remembered he could succeed if he worked hard and persevered.
