Once upon a time, there were two friends, Joe and Kyle. Joe had a big statue that he treasured a lot. One day, Joe decided to send the statue to Kyle as a gift. 
When the statue arrived to Kyle, he was very happy. He decided to keep it in the garden, so he could enjoy it every day. But some days after, the statue started to smell bad. 
Kyle was very confused, so he asked Joe why it was so smelly. Joe explained to him that the statue was made of old garbage, and that was why it smelled bad. 
Kyle was sad and told Joe that it was not a very nice gift. Joe understood, he had acted carelessly and was sorry for his mistake. 
The moral of the story is that it is important to think carefully before giving something as a gift.
