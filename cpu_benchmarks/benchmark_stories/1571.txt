Once upon a time, there was a little squirrel named Bucky. Bucky lived in a big oak tree in the forest. He loved to eat the yummy acorns that fell from the tree.
One day, Bucky woke up and went outside to find that there were no acorns on the ground. He searched the whole forest, but there were no acorns to be found. Bucky was very sad because he was very hungry.
Bucky remembered that his friend, the bird, had a big supply of acorns in her nest. Bucky went to the bird's nest and asked if he could have some acorns. The bird said yes and gave Bucky a big pile of yummy acorns to eat. Bucky was happy again and thanked the bird for her kindness. From that day on, Bucky always made sure to share his acorns with his friends in case they needed a supply of food too.
