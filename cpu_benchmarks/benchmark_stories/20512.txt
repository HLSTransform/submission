Once upon a time, there was a beautiful daisy. She was growing in the garden, under the sun. Every day, she looked around to see what was happening. One day, something very scary came to the garden. It was a big, mean bear! The daisy was very scared. The bear started to walk around the garden and roar. 
The daisy had to behave. She was so scared that she couldn't move. The bear kept walking around the garden and roaring. Then, something unexpected happened - a brave little mouse came out from behind a bush! He was so brave that he ran straight up to the bear and started to shout! The bear was so surprised, it ran away! 
The daisy was so relieved and very happy. She was so proud of the brave little mouse for standing up to the scary bear. She thanked him for saving her. From then on, they were the best of friends and the daisy repaid the mouse's bravery every day by making sure she behaved.
