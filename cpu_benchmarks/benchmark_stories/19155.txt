Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Tim. Tim loved the color blue. He had a blue ball, a blue shirt, and a blue bed. One day, Tim wanted to play with his blue ball outside.
Tim went to open the door, but it was locked. He tried and tried, but he could not unlock the door. Tim was sad because he could not play with his blue ball outside. He sat down and started to cry.
His mom heard him crying and came to help. She saw the locked door and used a key to unlock it. Tim was so happy! He thanked his mom and ran outside to play with his blue ball. The young boy played all day and had lots of fun.
