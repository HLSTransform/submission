Tommy yawned early on Tuesday morning. His mom said the day would be slow. He put on his shoes and stepped outside. The sun was just starting to wake up.
He walked slowly down the sidewalk with his mom. He kicked his feet up in the air. His mom laughed and said, "we're going to the park today!"
At the park, Tommy saw lots of other kids running around. He joined them and played with the toys. He felt happy and laughed as he played.
The sun was getting brighter and brighter, so Tommy yawned again. His mom kissed him on the head and said it was time to go home. Tommy said Good-bye to all his friends and hopped in the car. On the way home, his mom sang him a song and he fell asleep.
