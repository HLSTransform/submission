Once upon a time, there was an otter in the river. He was so pretty with his soft fur, bright eyes, and long whiskers.
One day, the otter came across a new river. He swam up to it and looked inside. He saw a shiny box at the bottom of the river and he knew he had to open it!
So the otter took a deep breath and dived down to the box. He grabbed it in his paws and opened it. Inside was something very special! The otter saw a pretty red flower the most beautiful he had ever seen!
The otter was very happy and he put the flower in his pouch to take home. From that day forward, the otter was never without a pretty flower to show his friends.
