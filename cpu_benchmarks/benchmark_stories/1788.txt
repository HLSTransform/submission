One day, there was a boy who wanted to find something special. He decided to search around his house to find it. He looked in his toy box, under the sofa and in the cupboard but he couldn't find anything. He kept looking until he saw something glimmering in the corner. It was a little bit of gold! He looked at it and it shone brightly in the light. He was so excited that he had found it and he decided to take it home. He was very happy and held the gold close to his heart. He searched and searched for more golden things but he couldn't find anything else. He was still happy because he had found the gold and he vowed to keep looking for more.
