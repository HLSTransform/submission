Lily liked to draw with her pen. She had many colors of pen. She drew flowers and stars and animals on paper. She wanted to show her mom and dad her drawings. She thought they would be happy and proud of her.
She had an idea. She found a high place in the living room. It was a shelf where mom and dad put books and photos. She climbed on a chair and put her drawings on the shelf. She wanted to display them like a gallery. She smiled and got down from the chair.
She ran to the kitchen where mom and dad were making dinner. She said, "Mom, dad, come see what I did! I have a surprise for you!" She grabbed their hands and pulled them to the living room.
Mom and dad followed Lily. They saw the shelf with the drawings. They also saw something else. The pen had leaked on the shelf and the paper. The colors had dripped on the books and the photos. The shelf was a mess of ink and paper.
Mom and dad gasped. Lily looked at them. She saw their faces. They were not happy and proud. They were angry and sad. She felt bad. She said, "I'm sorry, mom, dad. I wanted to display my drawings. I didn't know the pen would leak. Please don't be mad at me." She started to cry.
Mom and dad hugged Lily. They said, "It's okay, Lily. We know you didn't mean to make a mess. We love you and your drawings. But next time, please be careful with your pen and where you put your paper. Let's clean up the shelf together and find a better place to display your drawings." They wiped her tears and smiled. Lily nodded and smiled too. She learned a lesson. She still liked to draw with her pen, but she used a lower place to display her drawings.
