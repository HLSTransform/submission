Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around in the park. One day, she went to the park with her mom and saw a big, colorful kite flying in the sky. 
“Look, Mommy! The kite is zooming!” said Lily, pointing up at the sky. 
“Yes, it’s a beautiful kite,” said her mom. 
Lily wanted to play with the kite, but it was too high up in the sky. She felt anxious and sad. 
Just then, a kind man came over and asked if she wanted to help him spread out his picnic blanket. “Sure!” said Lily. She helped him spread out the blanket and they sat down to eat sandwiches together. 
After they finished eating, the man asked Lily if she wanted to help him fly the kite. “Yes, please!” said Lily, excitedly. 
The man handed Lily the kite and helped her fly it. The kite zoomed high up in the sky and Lily felt so happy. She thanked the man and ran back to her mom with a big smile on her face.
