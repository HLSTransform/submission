Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toys. One day, he found a big, green cactus in the garden. The cactus was original and different from other plants. Tim wanted to touch it, but his mom said, "No, Tim! Don't touch the cactus!"
Tim did not listen to his mom. He wanted to play with the cactus. He thought it would be fun. But when he touched the cactus, it hurt him a lot. Tim cried and ran to his mom. She knew something was wrong.
His mom asked, "Did you touch the cactus, Tim?" Tim nodded and said, "Yes, mom. I'm sorry, I should have listened to you." His mom hugged him and said, "It's okay, Tim. Now you know that the cactus can hurt you. Next time, you should listen when I tell you not to do something." Tim learned his lesson and promised to listen to his mom. He refused to touch the cactus again.
