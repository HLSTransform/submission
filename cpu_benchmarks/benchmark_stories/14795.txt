Tom and Mia were twins who liked to play in the park. They had a lot of toys and clothes because their parents were wealthy. They did not like to share with other kids.
One day, they saw a new boy in the park. He had a red jacket with a zipper. Tom and Mia wanted the jacket. They ran to the boy and tried to pull the zipper.
"Hey, stop that!" the boy said. "This is my jacket. Go away!"
"No, we want it!" Tom and Mia said. "We have more toys and clothes than you. You have to give it to us!"
The boy did not want to give his jacket. He zipped it up and ran away. Tom and Mia chased him. They were angry and mean.
A lady saw them and came to help. She was the boy's mom. She hugged the boy and said, "Are you okay, Ben? What happened?"
"Those kids tried to take my jacket," Ben said. "They said they were wealthy and I had to give it to them."
"That's not nice," the lady said. "You don't have to give your jacket to anyone. It's yours. And being wealthy doesn't make you better than others. It's how you treat people that matters."
She looked at Tom and Mia and said, "You should be ashamed of yourselves. You should apologize to Ben and learn to share and be kind."
Tom and Mia felt sorry. They realized they were wrong. They said sorry to Ben and asked if they could play with him. Ben said yes. They became friends and played in the park. They learned to share and be kind. They also learned that zippers are fun to zip and unzip.
