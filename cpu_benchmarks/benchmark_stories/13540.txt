Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Mittens. Mittens had soft fur that was black and white. She loved to play with her friends and chase after balls of yarn.
One day, Mittens and her friends decided to have a race. They were all very competitive and wanted to win. Mittens tried her best, but she was not the fastest. She was sad that she did not win, but she was happy to be a part of the fun.
Later that day, Mittens curled up in a cozy spot and fell asleep. She dreamed about playing with her friends and having fun. She knew that even though she did not win the race, she was still loved by her friends and that was the most important part.
