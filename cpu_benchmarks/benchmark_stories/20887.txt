Once there was a young boy who loved to whistle. Every day the boy went outside and stood in the sunshine and whistled. The boy's whistling was so beautiful that soon the birds joined in and sang along.
One day the young boy decided he wanted to eat something sour. He went to the shop and bought some lemons. As he was walking home, he ate one of the juicy lemons. The boy was surprised that the lemon was so sour! He licked his lips, which made him laugh.
After eating the lemons, the boy went back outside and whistled. He smiled with delight when he heard the birds singing back to him. He had made a lot of friends and it made the young boy very happy.
