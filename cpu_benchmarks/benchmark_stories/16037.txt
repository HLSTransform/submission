Once upon a time, in a very lonely town, there was a little girl who wanted to play. But, no matter where she looked, nothing seemed interesting.
One day, she noticed a crack in the ground. She decided to poke it with her toe and, to her surprise, with one hard kick, the ground split in two. Excited, she looked into the large gap she'd made and glanced around, but there seemed to be nothing of interest. 
Just then, the little girl heard a small voice from the darkness in the gap.
"What have you done?" the voice asked.
The little girl stepped back, somewhat scared.
"Um...I split the ground," she answered quietly.
The voice laughed and said, "While your curiosity is great, so is its consequence. You must put things back together and learn how to appreciate it in its original form."
The little girl thought long and hard and then carefully, one by one, put the pieces of the ground back together. From then on, she made sure to take a moment to look and appreciate what she already had, instead of trying to manipulate it for entertainment. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to be content with what you have and appreciate all the little things in life, rather than trying to change them to fit your needs.
