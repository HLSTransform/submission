Once upon a time, a boy named Timmy was playing in the park with his friends. They were having fun playing tag and hide-and-seek. Suddenly, Timmy saw something shiny on the ground. He went to pick it up and saw that it was a cool pistol.
Timmy's friend, Billy, saw the pistol too and said, "Wow, that's so cool! Can I hold it?"
Timmy replied, "Sure, but be careful. Don't point it at anyone."
Billy took the pistol and laid it on the ground. They all looked at it and wondered where it came from. Then, they heard a loud voice saying, "Hey kids, what are you doing with my pistol?"
It was the park ranger. He explained that the pistol belonged to him and that it was not a toy. The kids apologized and promised to never touch it again. They continued playing, happy to have learned an important lesson about safety.
