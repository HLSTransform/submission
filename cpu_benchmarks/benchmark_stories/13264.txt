Once upon a time there was a organized cake. It was in a box and it was so special that it needed a wind to remove it from the box.
So the little girl grabbed the wind and put it on the cake. The wind gently moved away the top of the box and the cake emerged.
The little girl was so excited when she saw the cake that she jumped with joy and laughed out loud.
The little girl thanked the wind for helping to remove the cake from the box. She then enjoyed every bite of the organized cake. The end.
