Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a little rabbit named Remy. Remy loved to run and play with his friends. One day, they had a race. Remy wanted to win the race, so he practiced every day. He wanted to be the perfect runner.
One morning, Remy saw a big tree with a hole. He had a question in his mind. "What if I hide in the hole during the race?" he thought. "I can come out at the end and win!" Remy told his friends about the big tree with the hole. They all laughed and said, "Remy, that's not how you win a race!"
The day of the race came. Remy and his friends lined up to start. Remy remembered the big tree with the hole, but he knew his friends were right. He had to run the race, not hide. So, Remy ran as fast as he could. He ran and ran until he crossed the finish line. He didn't win, but he felt like a perfect runner because he tried his best.
