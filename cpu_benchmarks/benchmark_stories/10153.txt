Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had long hair that was pretty and shiny. One day, her mom took her to get a haircut. Lily was scared, but her mom said it would make her even more pretty.
After the haircut, Lily looked in the mirror and smiled. She loved her new haircut and felt very pretty. But on the way home, a big gust of wind blew her hair away. Lily was sad and cried. She missed her long pretty hair.
From that day on, Lily never smiled again. She was always sad and missed her pretty hair. The end.
