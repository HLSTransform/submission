Ben and Lily were twins. They liked to play in the park with their dog, Spot. One day, they saw a big, fat cat on a tree. Spot barked at the cat. The cat hissed at Spot.
"Let's go see the cat," Ben said. He wanted to touch the cat.
"No, Ben, it's too high," Lily said. She was scared of the cat. "And it's getting dark. We have to go home."
But Ben did not listen. He ran to the tree and tried to climb it. The cat scratched his hand. Ben cried out loud.
"Ben, are you okay?" Lily asked. She ran to him and hugged him. She saw blood on his hand. She was very worried.
"Ow, ow, ow," Ben said. He was in pain. He was sorry he did not listen to Lily.
"Come on, Ben, we have to go home," Lily said. She took his hand and helped him walk. Spot followed them. They walked fast. They did not like the dark.
Soon, they saw their house. They saw their mom at the door. She was happy to see them, but she saw Ben's hand. She was angry and sad.
"What happened to your hand, Ben?" she asked. She took him inside and cleaned his wound. She put a band-aid on it.
"I tried to touch a fat cat on a tree," Ben said. He looked down. He was ashamed.
"That was not a good idea, Ben," mom said. She hugged him and kissed him. "You have to be careful and listen to Lily. She is your sister and she loves you."
"I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, Lily," Ben said. He hugged them back. He learned his lesson.
The end.
