Once there was a fat pig. He was really happy and liked to play all day. One day he saw a wire on the ground. He decided to seat on it. He was really wary at first. He didn't know what it would do. Eventually he sat down anyways. But it was ok! He liked sitting on the wire. He could move around and twist and turn. He had lots of fun. He kept sitting on the wire everyday and soon it became his favourite seat. He was so happy.
