Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toy bull. It was his favorite toy in the whole wide world. One day, Timmy went to the park to play with his bull. He was having an incredible time running around and pretending his bull was real.
Suddenly, Timmy heard his mom calling him for lunch. He quickly ran back home, but he didn't realize that he had lost his bull on the way. He searched everywhere but couldn't find it. He was very sad and cried a lot.
Days passed and Timmy still couldn't find his bull. He felt very lonely without it. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the store and he saw a new toy bull that looked just like his old one. Timmy was so happy and hugged the new bull tightly. But when they got home, Timmy realized that it wasn't the same as his old bull. It didn't feel the same and it wasn't as incredible as his old one. Timmy was very sad again and missed his old bull very much.
