Once upon a time there was a little boy who was three years old. He was so excited to learn something new.
One day, he asked his mom to teach him something. She smiled and handed him an envelope. "Inside the envelope is something special," she said.
He opened the envelope and found a fair coin. He gave it to his mom and asked what it was. She said "This is a coin, and it can teach you something very important. Do you want to learn?"
He eagerly nodded and she told him, "This coin teaches you to be fair. That means you should always treat people with respect and kindness."
But the little boy didn't understand what it meant. He just wanted to play with the coin. So he threw it away and ran off to play with his friends.
His mom knew that he had been wrong, but she just shook her head sadly. She knew that the lesson had been lost - the little boy had not learned what it meant to be fair.
