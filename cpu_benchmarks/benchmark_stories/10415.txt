Theodore was building a unique cell in his backyard. He wanted it to look special. He carefully picked out different pieces and put them together like a puzzle. 
Suddenly, he heard a muffled voice coming from inside the cell. "Help me! Can someone help me?" Theodore was shocked and frightened. 
Theodore got closer to the cell and said, "Who are you?"
The voice replied, "I'm Daisy, help me! I'm stuck inside here." 
Theodore knew he had to help Daisy. He used his hand to try to open the door of the cell, but it wouldn't budge.
Theodore looked around and he noticed the small key that he had used to lock the door. He grabbed the key, but just as he was about to unlock the door, his mom came running.
"Theodore! Stop! You can't open the door! It's too dangerous!" she shouted. 
Theodore froze in his tracks. He stared at the small key in his hand. 
"Mom's right," he thought. 
Theodore put the key away and he and Daisy had to find a different way to get Daisy out of the cell. Together, they thought up a unique plan to free Daisy. Finally, they were both free and happy.
