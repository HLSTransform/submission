Once upon a time, there was a weird pirate. He had a funny hat and a funny coat. He always smiled, even when he was sad. 
One day, the pirate wanted to bury something special. He took a shovel and dug a deep hole in the ground. Then he put something in the hole and covered it up with dirt. He said it was a secret. 
The next day, the pirate said he was going on an adventure. He took his funny hat and coat and walked out the door. He never came back. 
People asked, "What happened to the weird pirate?" Nobody knew. 
Some people said, "Maybe he buried something special and never returned." 
Nobody knows the truth. Maybe the secret is buried forever.
