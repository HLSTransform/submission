Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and his dog, Max. One day, Timmy and Max went for a walk in the park. They saw a big tree with a great branch. Timmy climbed up the tree and Max followed him.
Suddenly, Timmy slipped and fell from the branch. Max was worried and asked, "Are you okay, Timmy?" Timmy replied, "I'm okay, Max. I just split my pants." Max laughed and said, "That's funny, Timmy. Let's go home and get you some new pants." Timmy smiled and they walked home together, happy and safe.
