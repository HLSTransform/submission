Sara liked to help her mom at the restaurant. Her mom cooked food for many people who came to eat. Sara helped by bringing plates, cups and napkins to the tables. She was very good at carrying things and not dropping them.
One day, the restaurant was very busy. Many people wanted to eat pizza, but the pizza dough was almost gone. Sara's mom asked her to go to the supply room and get more dough. Sara ran to the supply room and looked for the dough. She saw a big box with a picture of a pizza on it. She tried to lift the box, but it was too heavy for her.
She saw a smaller box next to it. It had a picture of a pretzel on it. She thought, maybe this is also dough, but in a different shape. She opened the box and saw many long and flexible pieces of dough. They looked like snakes. She had an idea. She took some pieces of dough and twisted them into circles. She put them on a tray and brought them to her mom.
Her mom was surprised to see the dough circles. She asked Sara, "What are these?" Sara said, "They are pizza pretzels. I made them from the pretzel dough. Maybe the people will like them." Her mom smiled and said, "That was very clever of you, Sara. You are very flexible and creative. Let's try to bake them and see what happens."
They put the pizza pretzels in the oven and waited. They smelled very good. They took them out and put cheese and sauce on them. They looked like mini pizzas. They brought them to the people who wanted pizza. The people were curious and tried them. They liked them very much. They said, "These are delicious. What are they called?" Sara's mom said, "They are pizza pretzels. They are a special invention by my helper, Sara." The people clapped and cheered for Sara. Sara was very happy and proud. She helped her mom at the restaurant and made many people happy.
