Once upon a time, there was a big and strong bear. He loved to play with his friends in the forest. One day, they decided to have a picnic. The bear brought a large basket of berries and his favorite chair to sit on.
As they were eating, a small bird came flying towards them. "Watch out!" shouted the bird. "There's a big storm coming. You need to prevent getting wet!" The bear quickly put away the basket and his chair, and they all ran to a nearby cave to stay dry.
After the storm passed, the bear and his friends went back to the picnic spot. The bear was relieved that he had prevented his chair from getting wet. "Thank you for warning us," said the bear to the bird. "You saved us from getting soaked!" The bird smiled and replied, "No problem, happy to help!"
