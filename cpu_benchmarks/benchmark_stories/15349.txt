Once there was a gifted little girl. She was always looking for fun things to do and her parents would help her find the perfect task. 
One day, they took her to the park to look for something. She searched and searched until she found the most perfect task. Nestled in the grass was a tiny caterpillar! She was so excited to find the caterpillar, she could barely contain her joy. 
She decided to bring the caterpillar home with her and promised to take good care of it. She watched it as it ate, crawled, and grew. 
The little girl was so proud of her special task and was so talented at taking care of the caterpillar. Eventually the caterpillar turned into a beautiful butterfly and spread its wings, showing off its beautiful colors. 
The girl cheered with delight and waved goodbye as the butterfly flew away.
