Once upon a time, there was a 3 year old boy named Max. He was very curious and loved to explore new things. One day, Max was playing in his room when he discovered a strange machine called an operation. Max was excited to try it out and began examining the machine. 
But the machine looked very complicated and Max felt too scared to touch it. He was worried he might not understand how it works. After a few moments of thought, Max decided to try and solve the operation anyway. He slowly started pressing the buttons and fiddling with the levers.
Even though Max was clumsy, he was able to figure out how the operation worked. He was so excited, he couldn't contain himself! Max wanted to show everyone how he was able to solve the operation. He ran to his parents, who were amazed and proud of what their son had accomplished. 
The whole family rejoiced at Max's success and soon everyone was playing with the operation. Even Max's little sister had a go! This was one of the most exciting days of Max's life, and it was all because he decided to solve the operation.
