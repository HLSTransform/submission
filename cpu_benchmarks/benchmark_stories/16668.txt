Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside, but he was always careless with his toys. One day, he went outside to play with his favorite ball. He kicked it so hard that it went into a puddle and got soaked.
Timmy was sad because he couldn't play with his ball anymore. His mom saw him and asked, "What happened, Timmy?" Timmy said, "My ball got wet and now it's broken."
His mom said, "Next time, be quick to pick up your toys so they don't get ruined. And remember, if you take care of your things, they will last longer." Timmy learned his lesson and from then on, he always made sure to take care of his toys.
