Once upon a time, there was a lively little dog named Spot. Spot loved to run and play all day. He had many friends, like the big cat and the small bird. They all lived in a nice house with a big yard.
One day, Spot found a jar of sauce in the kitchen. He liked the smell of the sauce. He wanted to taste it. So, he jumped up and knocked the jar off the table. The sauce spilled all over the floor. Spot liked the taste and licked it all up.
But, Spot's mom saw what happened. She was not happy. She said, "Spot, you made a big mess! Now, you cannot play with your friends today." Spot was very sad. He learned that making a mess could end his fun day.
