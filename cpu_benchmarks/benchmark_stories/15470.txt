One day, there was a modern child. She liked to explore and learn new things. She was walking in the park when she saw something shiny. She carefully walked over and saw that it was a special pointy rock. She picked it up and pointed it towards the sky. She watched as the sun shone on it and sparkled. She then pointed it towards the ground and saw how it created funny shadows on the grass. She spent a long time picking different things up and pointing them. She also pointed at the birds flying in the sky, the wind blowing in the trees and the different animals she saw! She had so much fun playing with the pointy rock and learning about her environment.
