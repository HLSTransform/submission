Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play outside in the sunshine and pick flowers. She had a big, fluffy dog named Buddy who always followed her around.
One day, Lily and Buddy were walking in the park when they saw a man with a big, scary-looking dog. Lily felt a threat in her tummy and held onto Buddy's leash tightly. She didn't trust the man and his dog, so she decided to go home.
As they walked home, Lily saw a brilliant rainbow in the sky. She pointed up and said, "Look, Buddy! A rainbow! It's so pretty!" Buddy wagged his tail happily. Lily knew she could always trust Buddy to keep her safe and happy.
