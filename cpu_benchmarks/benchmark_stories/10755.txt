Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a girl named True. She was a brilliant little girl who loved to play with her toys. One day, she found a big, soft blanket in her room.
True thought it would be fun to wrap her toys in the blanket. She wrapped her teddy bear, her doll, and her toy car in the blanket. True felt very happy as she played with her wrapped toys.
Then, True's mom came into the room and saw the toys wrapped in the blanket. She smiled at True and said, "You are so brilliant, my dear!" True felt proud and continued to play with her wrapped toys all day long.
