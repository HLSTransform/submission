Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color with her markers. One day, she drew a pretty picture of a flower on her bedroom wall with her purple marker. Her mommy saw it and said, "Lily, we don't draw on walls. Please don't do it again." 
Lily nodded her head and promised not to do it again. Her mommy reminded her that she could draw on paper instead. Lily felt sad but knew her mommy was right. She went to get some paper and her markers. 
As she was drawing, her little brother came into the room. He wanted to play with her markers too. Lily gave him a harmless green marker and they drew together. They had so much fun! 
Suddenly, Lily remembered what her mommy said and checked to make sure they were only drawing on paper. She saw that her brother had accidentally marked the table with his marker. She reminded him that they only draw on paper and showed him how to clean it up. Her brother smiled and said, "Thank you, Lily!" They continued to draw and have fun without making any more marks on the furniture.
