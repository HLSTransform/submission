Lily liked to look at photos of her family. She had a big book with many photos. Some photos were old and some were new. The old photos were black and white. The new photos were colorful. Lily liked the colorful photos more. They looked modern and happy.
One day, Lily wanted to show her photos to her friend Tom. She took the big book and went to Tom's house. Tom was happy to see Lily and the book. They sat on the floor and opened the book. They saw photos of Lily's mom and dad, her brother and sister, her grandparents and cousins. They saw photos of birthdays, holidays, trips and fun times.
But when they turned the page, they saw something bad. The photos were wet and sticky. Lily was sad and angry. She remembered that yesterday she left the book on the table. She also remembered that her brother spilled his juice on the table. He did not tell anyone. He did not dry the table. He did not dry the book. He ruined the photos.
Lily cried and Tom tried to comfort her. He said they could try to dry the photos with a hairdryer. He said they could try to make new photos with his camera. He said they could try to make the book look modern and happy again. Lily liked Tom's ideas. She stopped crying and smiled. She thanked Tom for being a good friend. They went to find a hairdryer and a camera. They hoped the photos would be okay.
