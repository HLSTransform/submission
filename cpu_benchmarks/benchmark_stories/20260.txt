Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to dive in the water. One day, he went to the pool with his mom. Tim saw other kids diving and having fun. He wanted to dive too, but he was scared.
Tim's mom saw him and said, "You can do it, Tim! Just try!" Tim took a deep breath and tried to dive. But he was not successful. He felt sad and wanted to give up.
A girl named Sue saw Tim and said, "Don't be sad! I can help you." Sue showed Tim how to dive. They tried together, and Tim finally did a successful dive. Tim was so happy, and he said, "Thank you, Sue!" They both laughed and played together, diving and having fun all day.
