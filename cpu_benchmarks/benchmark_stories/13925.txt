Once upon a time, there was a modest little boy named Tim. He loved to play with paint. One day, he decided to paint a picture of his house.
As Tim painted, he saw his friend, Sam, walk by. "Hi, Sam!" Tim said. "Come see my paint." Sam came over and looked at the picture. "Wow, Tim! That looks good!" Sam said.
But as they talked, Tim did not see a rock on the ground. He stumbled and fell. His paint went everywhere. Tim and Sam laughed. They had fun cleaning up the paint mess together. And from that day on, they became best friends.
