George was walking home one day. He saw a cross and thought he should be careful. He paused and then took some small steps towards it. It was of wood and was bigger than George. He was so excited to see it and he knew it was an important sign. He decided to be careful and took some more slow steps. It made him feel brave to get close to it. As he walked closer he could smell the wood. He wanted to touch it, but he was a bit scared so he paused to take a breath. He slowly put his finger on it and his heart was racing. George smiled and slowly backed away. Then he ran home and was very proud of himself that he had been so careful.
