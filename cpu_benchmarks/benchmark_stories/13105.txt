Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucy. She loved to move around, so everyday she would go for a walk.
Today, Lucy decided to walk to school. As she got closer and closer to the school, she started to hear a very noisy sound. Lucy wondered what it was, so she moved to a nearby window.
Inside the school, Lucy saw a big moving file. It was filled with papers and it was making the noisy sound. Lucy was very excited and wanted to move closer, but she didn't know how.
Suddenly, Lucy had a brilliant idea. She carefully moved through the door and climbed into the file. As she moved in the file, the noisy sound got louder and louder.
It wasn't long before everyone noticed Lucy in the file. They stopped the machine, helped Lucy out and gave her a big hug.
Afterwards, Lucy smiled and said, "I like moving in the noisy file!"
