Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mommy. She saw a bird on a tree and stared at it for a long time. 
Suddenly, a boy came and asked, "What are you looking at?" 
"I'm staring at the bird," Lily said. 
The boy said, "I know a poem about birds. Do you want to hear it?" 
Lily nodded her head and the boy recited a poem about birds. It was so beautiful that Lily's face lit up with joy. 
But then, the boy said, "I don't like your dress. It's too plain." 
Lily felt sad because she loved her dress. She said, "I like my dress. It's my favorite." 
The boy realized he hurt her feelings and said sorry. They became friends and played together in the park.
