Sam and Ben are friends. They like to play with shapes. They have a box of shapes. They have circles, squares, triangles and more. They take turns to pick a shape and show it to each other.
Sam picks a triangle. He says, "Look, Ben, I have a triangle. It has three sides and three points. Do you like it?"
Ben nods. He says, "Yes, Sam, I like it. It is a nice shape. Can I see it?"
Sam gives the triangle to Ben. Ben holds it and looks at it. He says, "Thank you, Sam. You are a good friend. You share your shapes with me."
Sam smiles. He says, "You are welcome, Ben. You are a good friend too. You are kind and polite."
They hug each other. They are happy. They hear a sound. It is a whistle. They look around. They see a bird. The bird is on a branch. The bird is whistling. The bird is friendly. The bird says, "Hello, Sam and Ben. You are nice children. You play well together. You share your shapes. You are good friends."
Sam and Ben wave to the bird. They say, "Hello, bird. You are a nice bird. You whistle well. You are friendly."
The bird whistles again. It says, "Thank you, Sam and Ben. You are welcome. I like to see you happy. Happiness is good. Friendship is good. Sharing is good. Be happy, be friends, and share always."
Sam and Ben nod. They say, "Yes, bird. We agree. Happiness is good. Friendship is good. Sharing is good. We will be happy, be friends, and share always."
The bird flies away. Sam and Ben go back to their box of shapes. They pick another shape and show it to each other. They are happy, they are friends, and they share.
The end.
