Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play with their toys, but they do not like to share. One day, they have a big fight over a red car. Tom says it is his car, and Sam says it is his car. They pull and push and yell.
Mom hears the noise and comes to see what is wrong. She is not happy. She tells Tom and Sam to stop fighting and to share the car. She says they are part of a family, and a family is like a nation. A nation is a big group of people who live together and help each other. She says they have to be kind and fair to each other, or they will make the nation sad.
But Tom and Sam are stubborn. They do not listen to Mom. They do not want to share the car. They want to have it all for themselves. They do not care about the nation. They only care about the car.
Mom sees that they are stubborn and she is very angry. She orders them to go to their rooms and to stay there until they are sorry. She says they cannot play with the car or any other toys until they learn to share. She takes the car and puts it on a high shelf where they cannot reach it.
Tom and Sam go to their rooms and cry. They are sad and lonely. They miss the car and they miss each other. They realize that they were wrong and that they hurt the nation. They wish they had listened to Mom and shared the car. They decide to say sorry to Mom and to each other. They hope that Mom will forgive them and let them play with the car again. They hope that the nation will be happy again.
