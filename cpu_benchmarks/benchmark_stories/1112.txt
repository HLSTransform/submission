Once there was an old man. He liked to write. One day he took out his old knife and wrote on a piece of paper. He wrote about lots of happy things. Then he put the piece of paper and the knife back in his bag.
The old man enjoyed writing so much, he wrote everyday. He wrote about animals, the sky, and the trees. He even wrote about his friends.
One day, he wrote a special story. This story was about a little girl and her adventures. The old man liked it so much, he put it in a special place.
So this old man kept writing and writing. Every time he wrote a story, he was so happy. He was very proud of his writing.
