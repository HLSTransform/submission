Jack ran to the bin. He wanted to see what was in it. Inside, he saw one thing. He tapped it and it made a sound.
Jack: "What is this?"
Mum: "It's a drum. It makes noise."
Jack: "I want it!"
Mum: "No, Jack. That's serious. We don't increase our noise."
Jack: "Please! I want the drum!"
Mum: "No, Jack. You can use it inside the bin, but you cannot take it out."
Jack was disappointed. He didn't want the drum to stay in the bin. But his Mum was serious, so he reluctantly agreed. Jack banged the drum in the bin, again and again. But he knew the answer would not change. He knew the drum must stay in the bin.
