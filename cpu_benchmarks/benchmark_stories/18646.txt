Once upon a time, there was a man named John who had a dove. The dove was white and harmless, and John loved her very much. One day, John decided to sell the dove to a lady who wanted a pet. The lady was happy to buy the dove, and John was happy to sell her.
The lady took the dove home and put her in a cage. The dove was scared at first, but soon she realized that the lady was kind and harmless too. The lady gave the dove some seeds to eat and water to drink, and the dove was very happy.
Every day, the lady would talk to the dove and sing to her. The dove loved to hear the lady's voice and would coo back to her. The dove was no longer scared and knew that she was in a good home. John was happy too, because he knew that the dove was in a happy place.
