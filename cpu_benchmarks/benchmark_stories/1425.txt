Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy who wanted to create something fun and special. So they decided to make a holiday!
They got out their pretty colors and made a bright sign. They decorated the whole house with balloons and painted some fun pictures. Then, they made a big cake and went to the store to get some treats. 
When the special day arrived, everybody was so happy! They all put on their best clothes and had a big party. They played some games, laughed and enjoyed each other's company. 
At the end of the day, they were all so comfortable and cozy. They hugged each other and said, "This was the best holiday ever!"
