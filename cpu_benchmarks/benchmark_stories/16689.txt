Once upon a time, there was a mule named Jack. Jack was a very honest mule. He always did what his owner said and never lied. One day, Jack's owner asked him to carry a big load of apples to the market. Jack agreed and started walking.
On the way to the market, Jack met a sly fox. The fox asked Jack why he was carrying such a heavy load. Jack explained that he was taking the apples to the market. The fox then asked if he could help Jack carry the load. Jack agreed and gave the fox some apples to carry.
But the fox was not honest like Jack. He started eating the apples and soon the load became lighter. When they got to the market, the fox ran away with the remaining apples, leaving Jack with nothing to sell. Jack's owner was very angry and punished him for losing all the apples.
And so, poor Jack learned a lesson that day. He learned that not everyone is as honest as he is, and that sometimes it's better to do things on your own.
