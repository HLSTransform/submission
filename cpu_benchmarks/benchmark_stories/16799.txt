Once upon a time, there was a big, happy family. They lived in a house with a big yard where they played every day. One day, they decided to go to the park. The park was very high because it had a big slide and a tall swing.
At the park, they saw a barber who was cutting hair for the children. The barber was very nice and gave them lollipops. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a boy who was playing with a toy gun and pretended to shoot his friends. The family didn't like it because it was not nice to shoot friends.
After playing at the park, they went back home and had a nice dinner. They talked about the fun they had and how they liked the barber. They also talked about how they didn't like the boy who pretended to shoot. They decided to teach him to play nicely next time they saw him.
