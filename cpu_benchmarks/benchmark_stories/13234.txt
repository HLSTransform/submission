Once there was a girl who loved to draw with chalk. Every day she would take her box of colored chalk and draw pictures on the driveway. One day, she drew a beautiful blue bird. She was so proud of it that she decided to bow to it. She bent down and bowed her head.
Suddenly, a rain cloud appeared and it started to pour. The girl was so sad because her beautiful picture was washed away in the rain. She felt really ashamed.
But then, she noticed that the rain had left something behind. A rainbow! She beamed with happiness and bowed to the rainbow in thanks. She gathered up the pieces of chalk that had washed away and made a brand new picture with them. It was even more beautiful than her original! She was proud of her work, so she bowed to it again.
The girl had learned that even when sadness strikes, something wonderful can always come from it.
