Sally was sitting in her room and looking out the window. She was sad because her mommy had told her to stay inside and play by herself. She wanted to go to the grocery store to get something yummy.
Suddenly, Sally heard a slow knock on her door. It was her mommy. She said, “Sally, how about if we go to the grocery store? Let’s get something special for dinner!”
Sally was so happy. She quickly put on her shoes and ran down the stairs and outside. They slowly drove to the grocery store. On the way, her mommy told Sally about all the different things they could buy.
When they arrived, Sally saw all the different colors, shapes, and smells. She wanted everything! But her mommy told her to be slow and pick just one thing.
Sally saw some yummy ice cream and decided to get it. As they drove home, Sally’s mommy told her stories about the neighborhood and the stars in the sky.
When they got home, Sally’s mommy and daddy enjoyed the ice cream and smiled at Sally. It was a great day!
