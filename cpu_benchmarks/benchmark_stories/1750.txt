Once upon a time, there was a careless bunny. It loved playing in the sunshine, jumping around and having fun.
One day, the bunny was out playing in the sun when he heard a sound. It was a snap! He looked around, but he couldn't see where it was coming from.
The bunny kept hopping and suddenly, he heard the snap again! This time, he looked up and saw a bird, holding a bright yellow seed in its beak. The bird had opened the seed with a snap!
The bunny hopped closer and the bird dropped the seed. The bunny was excited, ate the seed and hopped away.
The bunny stayed careful so he could hear more snaps when the bird came back. He wanted to get more seeds from the bird.
The bunny kept playing in the sun and sure enough, he heard the snap again! He was so happy.
