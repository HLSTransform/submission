One day, Luca went to the gym with his mom. As they walked in, Luca was surprised to see a lot of elderly people. He had not seen many elderly people before.
Luca's mom said, "Look Luca! That lady is elderly."
Luca was surprised and ran over to her. He smiled and said, "Hello!"
The elderly lady smiled back and said, "Hello, dear boy! What brings you to the gym?"
"I'm here with my mom," said Luca.
"That's nice," said the elderly lady. "I come to the gym every day to exercise and stay healthy."
Luca smiled and said, "That's good!" 
The elderly lady gave him a hug and said, "You are a sweet boy, thank you!"
Luca was very surprised but was so happy. From then on, Luca and the elderly lady became friends.
