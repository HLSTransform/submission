Once upon a time, there was a tough river. Every day, it offered a special surprise. When the sun shone, it sparkled. When the wind blew, it sang a special song.
One day, a brave little boy decided to explore the river. He put on his swimming costume, jumped in and began swimming. He splashed and explored the river, looking for its surprise. 
Suddenly, a big friendly fish appeared. It smiled at the boy and asked if he wanted to play. The boy was amazed and quickly agreed. The fish offered him a big hug and the boy hugged it back. 
The two played together for a long time. They raced, splashed and laughed, having so much fun! After a while, the little boy said goodbye to his new best friend and went home tired but happy.
