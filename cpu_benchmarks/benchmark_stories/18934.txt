Ben and Lily are friends. They like to play outside in the sun. But today the weather is bad. It is cold and rainy. Ben and Lily are sad.
They stay inside and look for something to do. They see a big box. They have an idea. They can make a house with the box. They use scissors, tape and crayons. They cut, stick and draw. They make a door, a window and a roof. They are happy.
They want to play in their house. But the box is not strong. It is floppy and wobbly. It needs support. They look for something to help. They see a broom. They use the broom to hold up the roof. They are clever.
They go inside their house. They pretend to cook, read and sleep. They have fun. They forget about the bad weather. They are cozy and warm.
But there is a problem. The broom belongs to Mom. Mom needs the broom to sweep the floor. She sees the box house. She sees the broom. She is not happy. She tells Ben and Lily to give her the broom. She says they are lazy. They need to help with the chores.
Ben and Lily are sorry. They give Mom the broom. They help her sweep the floor. They are good. They learn to share and support. They hope the weather will be better tomorrow. They want to play outside in the sun.
