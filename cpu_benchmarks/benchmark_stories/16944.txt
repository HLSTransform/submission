Tom was very happy. It was his birthday. He had a big cake with four candles. He had many friends to play with. He had a lot of balloons in different colors.
One of his friends was Sam. Sam was new in the town. He did not know many people. He felt shy and lonely. He did not have a balloon.
Tom saw Sam sitting alone. He wanted to be nice to him. He took a red balloon from his pile. He walked to Sam and smiled. He said, "Hi, I am Tom. This is for you. Welcome to my party. Do you want to play with me?"
Sam looked at the balloon. He felt happy. He said, "Thank you, Tom. You are very kind. I like your balloon. It is very pretty. Yes, I want to play with you."
Tom and Sam became friends. They played with the balloons and the other toys. They ate cake and sang songs. They had a lot of fun.
At the end of the party, Tom gave Sam a hug. He said, "I am glad you came. You are my new friend. I hope you like it here."
Sam hugged him back. He said, "I am glad too. You are my new friend. I like it here. You made me feel welcome."
They waved goodbye and smiled. They both had a red balloon. They both had a happy birthday.
