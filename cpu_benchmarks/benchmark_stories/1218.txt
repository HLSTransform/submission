Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He had a razor and he liked to shave his dad's beard. One day, Timmy's dad got angry because Timmy cut his face. Timmy felt sad because he didn't mean to hurt his dad.
Timmy's mom saw him frown and asked him what was wrong. Timmy told her about what happened with his dad. His mom was thoughtful and told Timmy that he should be careful with the razor. Timmy promised to be more careful next time.
From that day on, Timmy was more careful when he shaved his dad's beard. He didn't want to hurt him again. Timmy's dad was happy that Timmy learned his lesson and they continued to shave together.
