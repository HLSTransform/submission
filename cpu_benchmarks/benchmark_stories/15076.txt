Once upon a time, there was a beautiful jet up in the sky. It was so high up that it seemed like it would almost touch the clouds. There was a little girl called Emily who wanted to take the jet for a ride but she was too small. 
So, Emily decided to stretch out her arms and legs and to try to grab onto the jet. She stretched and stretched but, unfortunately, the jet was too far away. Emily was about to give up when a magical fairy flew down from the sky.
The fairy said, "Don't worry, Emily! Just keep on stretching, and I will help you get to the jet". Emily kept on stretching her arms and legs and the fairy held onto her and flew up towards the jet. 
Soon enough, Emily was standing on the jet's wings. She looked around in joy and said, "Wow! This is so beautiful! Thank you, fairy! I'm so glad I can now take a ride on the jet".
The magical fairy smiled and said, "You're welcome, Emily! Enjoy the ride!" And so Emily took the jet for a lovely ride around the sky.
