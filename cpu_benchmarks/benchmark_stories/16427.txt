Lily liked to create things with her crayons and paper. She made drawings of her family, her friends, and her toys. She also liked to create animals that she saw in books or on TV. One day, she decided to create a mouse.
She took a brown crayon and drew a circle for the mouse's body. Then she added a smaller circle for the head, two dots for the eyes, a triangle for the nose, and a line for the mouth. She drew two big ears on the sides of the head, and a long tail behind the body. She was happy with her mouse, but she wanted to make it more unique.
She looked at her other crayons and picked a pink one. She drew a bow on one of the ears, and a heart on the chest. She smiled and said, "This is a pretty mouse. She is unique, like me."
She showed her mouse to her mom, who was in the kitchen. "Mom, look what I created!" she said proudly.
Mom looked at the drawing and smiled. "Wow, Lily, that's a beautiful mouse. I love how you made her unique with the pink bow and the heart. You are very creative, my dear."
Lily hugged her mom and said, "Thank you, Mom. I love you."
Mom hugged her back and said, "I love you too, Lily. And I love your unique mouse."
