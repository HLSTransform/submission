Once upon a time, there was a mother and her little girl walking down a path. The little girl was excited because her mother had promised her a trip. The mother pointed to a sign in front of them that said "Happy Place". The little girl asked "What is this place, Mommy?" The mother replied, "This is the place I promised we would go on our trip!" The little girl was so excited to go on the trip.
When they arrived, the girl noticed all the exciting things there were to do. She pointed to all the fun activities she wanted to do first. The little girl went on some of the rides and played many fun games.
At the end of the day, the little girl and her mother had a successful trip. The mother gave the little girl a big hug and said, "Did you have a good time on our little trip?" The little girl smiled and nodded. She had the best day ever.
