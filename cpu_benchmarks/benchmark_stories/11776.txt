Once upon a time, there was a girl who was very sleepy. She yawned a lot and her mom said it was time to take a nap. So the girl laid down on her bed and closed her eyes.
At first, she was very quiet and still, but then she heard something very nice. It was music playing softly in the background and it was just perfect for napping. The girl felt her eyes getting even heavier and before she knew it, she was snoring away.
Mom came into the room to check on her and she smiled when she saw how snugly the girl was tucked in. The blanket was pulled tight around her and with the music still playing, the girl slept soundly the entire day.
