Once upon a time, there was a tall giraffe named Jerry. Jerry was walking in the jungle when he tripped and fell, hurting his leg. He couldn't walk anymore! Jerry felt sad and scared.
But then, the police animals saw Jerry and came to help. They called a repair animal who fixed Jerry's leg. Jerry felt happy again and thanked the police animals and the repair animal.
From that day on, Jerry was more careful when he walked in the jungle. He knew that if he ever needed help again, the police animals and the repair animal would be there to help him.
