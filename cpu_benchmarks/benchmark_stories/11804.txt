Once there was a little boy who was feeling very miserable. He had been playing outside all day and was feeling so very tired. 
He walked into a big room with a big fireplace in it. All of a sudden, he heard a strange popping sound coming from inside the fireplace. He peeked inside and there was a tiny, sparkly fairy!
The fairy wanted to thank the little boy for discovering her and said to him, "I want to pay you for being so brave, young one". The fairy waved her wand and tiny stars appeared all around him. She then said, "It's all yours now, my little buddy".
The little boy smiled and was so excited. He thanked the fairy and told her that he would never forget her. The fairy then flew away and the little boy waved goodbye. He was so happy that he had made a new, magical friend. 
He carried the tiny stars with him everywhere he went and never felt miserable again.
