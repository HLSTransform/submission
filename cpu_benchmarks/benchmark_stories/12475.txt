Tim and Mia were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big tree with many peaches on it. The peaches looked juicy and sweet, and they wanted to try one.
"Let's get a peach from the tree," Tim said.
"But how? The tree is too high and we are too small," Mia said.
Tim had an idea. He saw a big rock near the tree. He said, "We can use the rock to climb on. Then we can reach the peaches."
Mia agreed. They pushed the rock to the tree and climbed on it. They stretched their arms and tried to grab a peach. But the peaches were still too far.
They saw an old man walking by. He had a long stick in his hand. He saw the children and smiled.
"Hello, little ones. What are you doing?" he asked.
"We want a peach from the tree, but we can't reach them," Tim said.
The old man nodded. He said, "I can help you. I have a stick that can knock down a peach for you. But first, you have to answer a question. Do you know what makes a person wise?"
Tim and Mia thought hard. They remembered what their parents and teachers had told them.
Tim said, "A person is wise if they listen and learn."
Mia said, "A person is wise if they are kind and fair."
The old man smiled again. He said, "You are both right. You are smart and good children. Here, let me get you a peach."
He used his stick to hit a peach from the tree. It fell on the ground and rolled to Tim and Mia. They thanked the old man and picked up the peach. They shared it and ate it. It was delicious.
They were happy. They had succeeded in getting a peach from the tree. They had also learned something from the old man. They decided to be wise like him.
