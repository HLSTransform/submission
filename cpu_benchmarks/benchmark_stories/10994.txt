Lily loves music. She likes to sing and dance and play with her toy piano. She wants to be a musician when she grows up. She likes to watch musicians on TV and listen to their songs.
One day, Lily goes to the park with her mom and dad. She sees a big stage with many people. She hears music and clapping. She runs to the stage and sees a musician playing a guitar. He has long hair and a funny hat. He sings a song that Lily knows. She likes his song. She wants to sing with him.
She climbs on the stage and goes to the musician. She says hello and starts to sing. She sings very loud and very fast. She does not sing the same words as the musician. She sings her own words. She sings about her mom and dad and her toy piano and her cat.
The musician is surprised. He does not know Lily. He does not know what she is singing. He tries to keep playing his guitar. He smiles at Lily. He thinks she is cute. But he is also embarrassed. He does not want Lily to sing on his stage. He wants to sing his own song.
The people in the park are also surprised. They see Lily on the stage. They hear her singing. They do not understand her words. They think she is funny. But they also think she is rude. They want to hear the musician. They do not want to hear Lily.
Lily's mom and dad are shocked. They see Lily on the stage. They hear her singing. They know she loves music. But they also know she is not supposed to be on the stage. They are embarrassed. They are sorry for the musician. They are sorry for the people. They run to the stage. They call Lily. They tell her to come down. They tell her to say sorry.
Lily stops singing. She sees her mom and dad. She sees their faces. They are not happy. They are angry. She does not understand. She thinks she did something good. She thinks she made music. She thinks she made people happy. She does not know she made a mistake. She does not know she was rude. She does not know she has to say sorry.
She feels sad. She feels confused. She feels embarrassed. She does not want to be on the stage anymore. She does not want to be a musician anymore. She wants to go home. She wants to hug her mom and dad. She wants to play with her toy piano. She wants to forget what happened. She wants to start over.
