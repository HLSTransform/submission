Johnny was walking in the park with his uncle. They were enjoying the sunny day and the birds singing. Johnny looked at the tall grass swaying in the wind and smiled. Suddenly, he saw a tough looking bird near a bush. He stopped and gazed at the bird in amazement.
His uncle kneeled down and said, "That's an eagle, Johnny. How cool does he look?" Johnny smiled and kept staring at the majestic bird. They spent the time together just looking at the eagle. 
"Let's keep going, Johnny," said his uncle after some time. Johnny reluctantly took his uncle's hand and they continued walking. Johnny was still day dreaming about the eagle as they walked out of the park.
