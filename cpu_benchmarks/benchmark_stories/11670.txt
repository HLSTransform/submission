Once upon a time, there were two friends who liked to work together. One day, they decided to go to the post office to buy stamps. When they got there, one of the friends opened the stamp box and it was very smelly. They both laughed, and quickly shut the box. After they bought their stamps, they went back home to work on their project. With the stamps, they were able to decorate their project and it came out really nice. The two friends were very happy and had the most fun when they worked together.
