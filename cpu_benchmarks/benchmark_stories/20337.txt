Tom and Sam were brothers. They liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big tree with red apples. They wanted to pick some apples and eat them.
"Look, Sam, the apples are so big and shiny!" Tom said.
"Yes, Tom, they look yummy. But how can we get them? The tree is too high for us," Sam said.
They thought for a while. Then they had an idea. They ran to the shed and got a ladder. They put the ladder next to the tree. Tom climbed up the ladder. He reached for an apple.
"Be careful, Tom!" Sam said.
Tom grabbed the apple. It was heavy and juicy. He smiled and threw it down to Sam. Sam caught it and took a bite. It was sweet and crunchy.
"Mmm, this is the best apple ever!" Sam said.
Tom picked another apple and threw it to Sam. They did this until they had a big pile of apples on the ground.
They climbed down the ladder and sat on the grass. They ate the apples and shared them with their dog, Spot. Spot wagged his tail and licked their faces.
They were happy and full. They thanked the tree for giving them the apples.
"You are a mighty tree," Tom said.
"Yes, you are a good tree," Sam said.
The tree heard them and smiled. It was glad to share its fruits with the boys. It had grown the apples for a whole year. It was proud of its apples. It was a mighty tree.
