Once there was a bird named Xander. Xander was very proud of his wings and he could soar higher than any other birds in the sky. He liked to show off the amazing things he could do when he was soaring in the air.
One day, he was telling the other birds about how great his wings were and how much he could do when he flew. He said, "I can even do math with my wings!"
The other birds were amazed, but when Xander tried to do the math in the sky, he was too clumsy and slipped. He suddenly found himself crashing down and couldn't fly back up again.
The other birds laughed, but the wise old owl swooped down to help Xander. He told Xander, "Sometimes, it pays to be modest and take your time. If you try to do too much at once, it can be dangerous!"
Xander learned his lesson. He realized that it was not a good idea to be too proud and spicy. Feeling embarrassed, he slowly flew back home.
