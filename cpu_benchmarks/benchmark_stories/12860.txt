Peter was a three year old boy who loved going to the park. One day, he noticed a beautiful poppy in the corner of the park. It was red and vibrant, so Peter knew he had to pick it. He carefully plucked the poppy from the ground and smiled to himself with joy. 
Using his small hands he carefully cradled the poppy. Just then, a little old man stumbled up to Peter and told him, “Son, you mustn’t take that poppy. It’s loyal to the ground.”
Peter nervously responded, “Please don’t make me suffer, sir! I just wanted to pick the poppy.”
The wise old man smiled and said, “It’s okay, son. I understand. Go ahead and pick the poppy, but be sure to put it back once you’re done.”
Peter thanked the old man and walked off with the poppy. He couldn’t believe his luck! He held it close and kept it safe until it was time to put it back. Once he had done so, Peter skipped away with a big smile. He had been loyal to the poppy, just like the old man had said.
