John was feeling very scared. He had just gotten a new bicycle and didn't know how to ride it. He was shaking when he saw the other children riding their bicycles around the neighborhood. 
John tried to get on the bicycle but he kept falling down. He was getting more scared by the minute. With the help of his dad, John started to learn how to ride the bicycle. 
He was still scared at first but then he started getting used to it. Soon, he was riding the bicycle faster and faster. 
John was now having a lot of fun. He was no longer fearful and he was able to ride the bicycle around the neighborhood with the other children. 
John was so proud of himself and he hugged his dad. His dad was so happy to see his son riding his bicycle with joy and without fear.
