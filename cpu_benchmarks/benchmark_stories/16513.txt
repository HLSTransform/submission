Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the forest near her house. One day, she saw a big cave. She wanted to go inside, but she was scared. 
Lily went home and told her mom about the cave. Her mom said, "Maybe we can go together tomorrow." Lily was happy and went to sleep dreaming about the cave.
The next day, Lily and her mom went to the cave. It was dark and scary, but they had a flashlight. Suddenly, they saw something shiny. It was a cheap necklace! Lily was so happy and said, "Welcome to our treasure!" 
From that day on, Lily and her mom went to the cave every week. They found many treasures and had fun exploring. Lily learned that sometimes scary things can be fun too.
