Once upon a time, there was a baby girl called Ana. She wanted to succeed in life, she wanted to be the best.
Ana decided to look for the best rhythm to help her succeed. She hopped, skipped and jumped, but she couldn't find the right rhythm.
Then, one day Ana heard a strange, crazy sound. It was the perfect rhythm for her to learn. She jumped up and down to the rhythm and started to feel it in her feet, her heart, and all around her.
Ana followed the rhythm and it helped her to succeed. She could do anything she wanted to do. Ana became the happiest girl in the world and she never forgot her crazy rhythm.
