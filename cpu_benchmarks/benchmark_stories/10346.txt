Ria and Rob are twins. They like to play outside. One day, they see a big black bird on a tree. It is a raven.
"Look, Rob, a raven!" Ria says. "It is so black and shiny. I want to touch it."
"Me too," Rob says. "But it is too high. How can we reach it?"
Ria thinks. She sees a yellow ball near the tree. She has an idea.
"Let's try to throw the ball at the raven. Maybe it will come down," she says.
"OK, let's try," Rob says.
They take turns to throw the ball at the raven. But the raven is smart. It dodges the ball every time. It makes a loud noise. It sounds like it is laughing at them.
"Stop it, raven!" Ria says. "You are not nice. Come down and play with us."
The raven does not listen. It flies away to another tree. Ria and Rob are sad. They want to make friends with the raven.
"Maybe we should try something else," Rob says. "Maybe we should give the raven something it likes. What do ravens like?"
Ria thinks. She remembers a story her mom told her. It is about a raven and a fox. The raven has a cheese in its mouth. The fox wants the cheese. The fox flatters the raven. The raven opens its mouth to sing. The cheese falls down. The fox eats the cheese.
"I know!" Ria says. "Ravens like cheese. Let's find some cheese and give it to the raven. Maybe it will come down and share it with us."
"Good idea," Rob says. "Let's go to the kitchen and get some cheese."
They run to the kitchen. They find a slice of cheese in the fridge. They run back to the tree. They see the raven still on the branch.
"Hey, raven, look what we have!" Ria says. "We have cheese. Do you want some cheese?"
The raven looks at the cheese. It smells good. It feels hungry. It flies down to the ground. It lands near Ria and Rob.
"Thank you, raven, for coming down," Ria says. "Here, you can have some cheese. But can we touch you? You are so soft and pretty."
The raven nods. It takes a bite of the cheese. It lets Ria and Rob touch its feathers. It feels nice. It makes a soft noise. It sounds like it is happy.
Ria and Rob smile. They are happy too. They have made a new friend. They share the cheese with the raven. They play with the ball. They have fun. They are glad they tried to be nice to the raven.
