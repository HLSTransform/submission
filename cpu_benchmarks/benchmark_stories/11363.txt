Max and his family went to the opera house one cold night. His dad carried him in and they walked through the big door. Inside, there was a stage and lots of people.
Max saw the colorful show and he clapped his hands. He watched the musicians and the singers, and he smiled and laughed.
His parents spent lots of money to take him there and he was very excited to be part of the show. He thanked them with a big hug, when the show was over.
He couldn't forget this cold night at the opera, and all the fun he had. It was a special experience for him and his family.
