Lily and Sam were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to make up stories with their dolls and cars. Sometimes they used big words that they heard from their parents or the TV, but they did not know what they meant.
"Look, this is a rare gem," Lily said, holding up a shiny stone. "It is very pretty and valuable. We have to keep it safe from the bad guys."
"Wow, that is a rare gem," Sam said, admiring the stone. "How did you find it?"
"I found it in the garden. It was hiding under a leaf. Maybe it is magic," Lily said.
"Can I hold it?" Sam asked.
"OK, but be careful. Don't drop it or lose it," Lily said, handing him the stone.
Sam took the stone and felt its smoothness and weight. He liked how it sparkled in the light. He wanted to keep it for himself.
"I want to have this rare gem. It is mine now," Sam said, putting the stone in his pocket.
"No, it is not yours. It is mine. I found it first. Give it back to me," Lily said, reaching for his pocket.
"No, I won't. It is mine. Go away," Sam said, pushing her away.
Lily felt angry and sad. She wanted her rare gem back. She did not like how Sam was being mean to her. She started to cry.
"Stop crying. You are being a baby. It is just a stone," Sam said.
"No, it is not just a stone. It is a rare gem. And you are being a bully. You are not my friend anymore," Lily said.
She ran to her mom, who was in the kitchen. She told her what happened.
"Mom, Sam took my rare gem and he won't give it back. He pushed me and he said mean words to me. He is a bad boy," Lily said, sobbing.
Mom hugged Lily and wiped her tears. She looked at Sam, who was still in the living room.
"Sam, come here. We need to talk," Mom said.
Sam knew he was in trouble. He felt guilty and scared. He slowly walked to the kitchen.
"Sam, why did you take Lily's rare gem? Why did you push her and say mean words to her? That is not nice. That is not how we treat our friends," Mom said.
Sam looked down. He did not have a good answer.
"I don't know. I just wanted it. It was pretty. I'm sorry," Sam said.
"Sorry is not enough. You need to give it back to Lily. And you need to say sorry to her. And you need to shut your pocket. You can't take things that are not yours. That is stealing. Do you understand?" Mom said.
Sam nodded. He took out the stone from his pocket and gave it back to Lily.
"I'm sorry, Lily. I was wrong. I should not have taken your rare gem. I should not have pushed you and said mean words to you. Can you forgive me? Can we still be friends?" Sam said.
Lily looked at the stone and then at Sam. She saw that he was sorry. She felt sorry too. She did not want to lose her friend.
"It's OK, Sam. I forgive you. We can still be friends. But don't do that again. And don't shut your pocket. Share your things with me. I will share my things with you. That is what friends do," Lily said.
She smiled and hugged Sam. Sam smiled and hugged her back.
Mom smiled too. She was glad that they made up. She hoped that they learned their lesson. She hoped that they would use nice words and not mean words. She hoped that they would find more rare gems in the garden.
