Ben did not want to sleep in his crib. He wanted to play with his toys and read his books. He said to his mom, "No crib, no sleep, mom. Play, play, play!"
Mom shook her head and said, "No, Ben, it is bedtime. You need to sleep in your crib. You can play tomorrow. Come on, let's go to your room."
Ben tried to resist. He ran away from mom and hid under the table. He said, "No, no, no! Find me, mom. Hide and seek!"
Mom sighed and said, "Ben, this is not a game. You are being naughty. Come out from under the table and go to your crib. Now!"
Ben was creative. He had an idea. He said, "OK, mom, I will go to my crib. But can I take one toy with me? Please, please, please?"
Mom thought for a moment and said, "OK, Ben, you can take one toy with you. But only one. And you have to sleep after that. No more playing. Deal?"
Ben smiled and said, "Deal, mom. Thank you, mom. I love you, mom." He ran to his room and picked his favorite toy. He hugged it and climbed into his crib. He said, "Good night, mom. Good night, toy."
Mom smiled and said, "Good night, Ben. I love you, too. Sweet dreams." She kissed him and turned off the light. She hoped he would sleep well and not make trouble again.
