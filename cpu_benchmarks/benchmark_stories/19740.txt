Joey was feeling embarrassed. He had spilled his milk all over the floor. Little Joey was holding back his tears as he looked around.
His father walked into the room and saw the mess. He smiled and said, "It's alright Joey. Don't be embarrassed." With a humble voice, Joey said "I'm sorry". His father took a pill off the shelf and said,"Let's get this cleaned up" and the two of them started cleaning up the milk. 
After they were finished, his dad said, "Joey, what I want you to remember is that it's ok to make mistakes. They help us learn and grow. Just remember that even if you make mistakes, you're still a wonderful person." 
Little Joey smiled and was so happy that his dad wasn't mad. His father hugged him and said, "Let's have some ice cream to celebrate no more spills." 
Joey smiled, knowing he wasn't embarrassed anymore.
