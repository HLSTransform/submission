Ben woke up one morning, ready to start his day. He hopped in the elevator and got to the top of the building. He could taste the fresh air in the morning. 
When Ben arrived at the top of the building, he saw his best friend, Andy. Andy was always very honest, and Ben knew he could trust him. 
"Good morning, Andy!" Ben said excitedly. 
"Hey Ben!" Andy replied. "I'm so hungry. Do you want to go get some breakfast?"
Ben smiled and said, "Yes, let's go!"
The two of them went to the caf√© and chose the tastiest breakfast they could find. They were so excited to start their day with a honest breakfast. 
Andy smiled and said, "This is going to be a great day!" 
And Ben agreed.
