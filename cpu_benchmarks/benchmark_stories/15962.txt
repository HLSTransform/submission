Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty skirt that she loved to wear every day. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. While she was playing, she accidentally got mud on her skirt. She was sad because she didn't want to ruin her pretty skirt.
Her friend, Sarah, saw that Lily was sad and asked her what was wrong. Lily told Sarah about the mud on her skirt. Sarah was polite and offered to help Lily. She said, "Don't worry, I'll keep your skirt clean while we play." Lily was happy and thanked Sarah for being so kind. They played together and had lots of fun. After they were done playing, Sarah gave Lily back her skirt and it was still clean! Lily was so happy and thanked Sarah again for being such a good friend.
