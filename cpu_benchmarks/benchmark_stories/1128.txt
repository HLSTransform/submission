Once upon a time a girl named Lisa set off on an adventure. She wanted to find some healthy news.
So Lisa went to the park. She saw many people having fun and playing games. Everyone was smiling and having a nice time.
Lisa went to the pond and saw a lot of ducks. One of the ducks was carrying a news paper in its beak! Lisa was very excited. She asked the duck to give the news paper to her.
The duck kindly accepted the request and Lisa started reading the news paper. She saw a lot of healthy news about people eating healthy and exercising. Lisa was very happy. She thanked the duck and went home with a big smile on her face.
From then on Lisa made sure to live a healthy life and to keep reading the news. She shared her healthy news with her family and friends. Everyone in the town was very happy and healthy.
