Anna and Ben were twins who liked to play with their toys. But sometimes they were naughty and did not listen to their mom. One day, mom told them to eat their lunch and then take a nap. But Anna and Ben did not want to nap. They wanted to play more.
They sneaked out of their room and went to the kitchen. They saw a big cake on the table. It looked yummy. They decided to take a bite. They grabbed a napkin and a knife. They cut a big slice of cake and ate it. It was sweet and soft. They smiled and licked their fingers.
But then they heard mom coming. They got scared. They hid under the table with the napkin and the knife. Mom saw the cake and gasped. She saw the napkin and the knife on the floor. She looked under the table and saw Anna and Ben.
"What did you do?" mom asked. She was angry and sad. "This cake was for grandma's birthday. You were naughty and ruined it. How could you?"
Anna and Ben felt bad. They knew they did something wrong. They regretted eating the cake. They said sorry to mom. They gave her a hug and a kiss. They said they loved her and grandma.
Mom sighed. She was still upset, but she loved them too. She said they had to help her make a new cake. And they had to take a nap after that. Anna and Ben agreed. They hoped grandma would like the new cake. They learned their lesson. They did not want to be naughty again.
