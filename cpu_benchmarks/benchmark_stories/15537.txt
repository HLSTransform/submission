Once, there was a little girl named Anne. She was three years old, and loved to laugh. One day, Anne felt cold and shivered. She wrapped her blanket tight around her and looked outside. She saw all the birds laughing and singing in the sky, so loud! 
Anne thought that sounded so fun, so she ran outside. She laughed until her cheeks were red, and her laugh was even louder than the birds! The birds flew away in surprise, and Anne kept laughing and twirling until she felt warm and happy. 
The next day, Anne opened her window and let the cold air in. She laughed and sang until the birds came back. Anneâ€™s laugh was so loud that the birds stayed and sang with her. Anne and the birds laughed and sang all day long until the sun set and it was time to go to bed.
