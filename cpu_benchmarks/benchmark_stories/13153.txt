Once there were two brothers named John and Bill. They were very excited because they were going on vacation. They were planning to go to the beach and so they packed their swimming suits and sunscreen. 
When they arrived they were very naughty. They started playing in the water and they wouldn't listen to their parents. But the parents didn't get angry. They saw that the kids were having so much fun that they just smiled.
John and Bill had the best time of their lives during the vacation. Every morning they woke up early to play in the sand and in the water. And every night they stayed up late, eating ice cream and playing games. 
At the end of the vacation, John and Bill were very sad. But they were also very excited to tell their friends all about their adventure.
