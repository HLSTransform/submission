Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved horses very much. One day, she went to the farm to see the horses. She saw a brown horse and asked, "Can I pet the horse?" The farmer said, "Yes, you can pet the horse, but be gentle."
Lily pet the horse and said, "The horse feels soft." The horse nuzzled her hand and Lily giggled. Then, the farmer gave Lily an apple and said, "Give this yummy apple to the horse." Lily gave the apple to the horse and the horse ate it all up.
Lily said, "The horse is happy now." The farmer smiled and said, "Yes, the horse is happy. Thank you for visiting the farm." Lily said, "You're welcome. I love horses!" and she skipped away, feeling happy.
