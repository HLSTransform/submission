Bob was a little boy who loved to play. He had some new toys that he had got from his grandma. One of his favorite toys was a bright new kite.
One day Bob took his kite outside to fly it. He grabbed the string, but as soon as he let go, the kite disappeared into the sky. "Oh no!" he said sadly.
But then something amazing happened. Bob looked up and saw a boy hanging on to the kite. He was laughing and the kite was waving in the wind.
"Hi there!" shouted Bob. "What's your name?"
The boy smiled down at him.
"My name is Jack," he said. "I flew up to see this beautiful kite up close. It's amazing!"
Bob beamed. He was so happy that his brand new kite was being enjoyed by someone else. He watched with delight as his new friend hung on to the kite and sailed away.
