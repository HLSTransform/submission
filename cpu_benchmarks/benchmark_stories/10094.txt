Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a rabbit hopping on the grass. The rabbit was brown and white and had long ears.
"Look, a rabbit!" Lily said. "It is so cute!"
"Can we pet it?" Ben asked.
They ran after the rabbit, but it was too fast. It ran into a bush and hid.
"Where did it go?" Lily wondered.
They looked for the rabbit in the bush, but they could not find it. They heard a noise behind them. They turned around and saw a big dog. The dog was barking and wagging its tail.
"Hello, doggy!" Ben said. "Are you friendly?"
The dog licked Ben's face and made him giggle. Lily smiled and petted the dog's fur.
"Maybe the dog knows where the rabbit is," Lily said.
They asked the dog to show them the rabbit. The dog barked and ran to another bush. Lily and Ben followed him. They saw the rabbit peeking out of the bush. The rabbit looked scared.
"Shh, doggy, don't scare the rabbit," Lily said.
They approached the rabbit slowly and gently. The rabbit realized they were not mean. It came out of the bush and sniffed their hands. They stroked the rabbit's ears and back. The rabbit liked it.
"Wow, the rabbit is so soft and warm," Ben said.
The dog sat next to them and watched. He was happy to have new friends.
They played with the rabbit and the dog for a while. They gave them some carrots and water. They thanked them for being nice.
They realized they had a lot of fun. They hugged the rabbit and the dog and said goodbye.
They went back to their mom and dad. They told them about their adventure.
They said they loved the rabbit and the dog. They asked if they could come back to the park and see them again.
Mom and dad smiled and nodded. They said they were proud of them for being kind and brave.
They went home happy and tired. They dreamed of the rabbit and the dog. They hoped to see them again soon.
