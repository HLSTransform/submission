Once upon a time, there was a cool little boy. He had a bright red shirt and he loved wearing it. He always wore it to school and to the park. Everywhere he went, people would say how cool his shirt was.
One day, the boy was playing at the park with his friends. They were on the swings when he felt something snap on his shirt. He looked down and he saw a rip in it. He started to cry.
His friends helped him look for something to fix it with. They searched and searched, but nothing would work. Just when he thought all hope was lost, his mom came to the park with a big bag of sewing supplies.
She carefully stitched up his shirt and it was as good as new. He felt so relieved that he hugged her tight. With a smile, she told him to take care of his cool red shirt.
