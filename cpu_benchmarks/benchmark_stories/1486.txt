Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lilly. Lilly liked adventures and one day, she went on the biggest adventure of all - she met a dragon!
The dragon was very big and she was a bit scared but when the dragon introduced itself, Lilly smiled. She even noticed that the dragon seemed hungry.
So Lilly picked some big, juicy apples from her bag and offered them to the dragon. The dragon seemed very happy and Lilly was pleased that she could help.
They became friends and Lilly visited the dragon every day after that. They had lots of fun and Lilly fed her dragon friend more apples each time.
The end.
