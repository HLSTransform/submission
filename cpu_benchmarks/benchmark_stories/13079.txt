Jeremy was three years old and he had a little red eraser. He liked playing with it, so he carried it around with him everywhere. Every day, his mom and dad would help him carry it in his backpack. 
One day, Jeremy was playing by himself with his eraser on the porch. Suddenly, his dad called him to come inside. But Jeremy forgot to bring his eraser with him. His dad said not to worry, that heâ€™s reliable and that he would go get it for him. 
So his dad walked back outside and carried the eraser back to where Jeremy was. Jeremy was so happy to have his eraser back. Now he could play with it again and carry it around without worry.
