One day, a Momma and her little girl went for a walk in a beautiful meadow. "Look, Momma!" said the little girl. "What a pretty arrow!"
Momma smiled. "Yes," she said, "Would you like to bury it?"
The little girl jumped up and down. "Yes!" she said, clapping her hands.
So Momma took out a kind shovel and started digging. When the hole was deep enough, Momma helped the little girl put the arrow in the hole and bury it. 
When they were done, the little girl said, "Momma, why did we bury the arrow?"
Momma smiled and said, "So that other children can look for it in the meadow. It's a kind of game."
The little girl smiled. "That's a fun game! Can we do it again?"
Momma nodded and they set off to find another buried arrow.
