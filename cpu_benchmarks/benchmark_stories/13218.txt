Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sassy. Every day, she liked to go outside and play in the sunshine. Every day, Sassy would bring her own shade to play with. She thought it was important so she could stay cool.
One day, when Sassy was playing outside she noticed something strange. It was dark and she couldn't see the sun. Her own shade was very important because it was protecting her from the rain.
Sassy quickly ran to her own shade because she didn't want to get wet. She was happy that her shade kept her dry and she was able to play outside again soon.
From then on, Sassy always remembered how important it was to bring her own shade whenever she went out to play. That way, she could always stay dry and enjoy the sunshine.
