Once upon a time there was a busy little girl. She was always wearing her favorite red jacket. She loved her jacket so much, she never wanted to take it off. 
One day she decided to take the jacket off and go to the park. The sun was shining and it felt nice without the jacket.
At the park, the little girl saw a bonfire. She stared at the blaze, mesmerized. She said, "I want to go burn my jacket in the fire too!" 
Her mom shook her head. "No, honey. That's not safe. You could get hurt!"
Little girl pouted and said, "But mama, I want to burn my jacket!"
Mom frowned and said, "No, honey. You can't burn your jacket. It is too dangerous."
The little girl was disappointed. She knew her mom was right, but she still wished she could burn her jacket. She went back to the park, quietly watched the flames, and dreamed of the day she could safely burn her jacket.
