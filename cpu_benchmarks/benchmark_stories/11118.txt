Once upon a time, there was a grumpy cat named Tom. Tom did not like to play with others. One day, he saw a rake in the yard. Tom decided to have some fun with it.
Tom used the rake to gather leaves into a big pile. He then wanted to decorate the pile with flowers. So, he picked some pretty flowers and put them on the leaves. The pile looked very nice.
Soon, other animals came to see Tom's pretty pile. They all played together and had fun. Tom was not grumpy anymore. He learned that playing with others can be a lot of fun.
