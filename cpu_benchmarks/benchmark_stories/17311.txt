Once upon a time, there was a good boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his dog, Max. One day, Max started scratching a lot. Timmy saw a flea on Max's fur! 
Timmy said to Max, "Don't worry, Max. I will get rid of the flea." Timmy went to the store to buy flea medicine. The store owner said, "I can deliver the medicine to your house." 
Timmy was happy and said, "That would be great!" The store owner delivered the medicine to Timmy's house. Timmy put the medicine on Max and the flea went away. Max was happy and Timmy was happy too.
