One day, there was a little boy who wanted a pet. He asked his parents but they said no. The boy was very envious of the other kids who had pets. So the boy asked his Grandma if she could provide him with a pet. Grandma said yes and went to the pet store.
At the pet store, Grandma bought the boy a little puppy. The boy was so excited he jumped up and down. Grandma brought the puppy home and gave it to the little boy. He was so happy he hugged the puppy and took it for a walk outside.
Now the little boy was happy because he had his own pet. His friends were envious but happy for him at the same time. All thanks to his Grandma for providing him with his very own puppy!
