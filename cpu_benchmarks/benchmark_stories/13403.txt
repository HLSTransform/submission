Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play outside in the wild, where she could see the trees and the flowers. One day, Lily's mom gave her a cup of milk and asked her to pour it into a glass. Lily was so excited to pour the milk, but she accidentally spilled it all over her pale dress. 
Lily started to cry, but her mom hugged her and said it was okay. They went inside and her mom helped her change into a new dress. Then, they went back outside to play in the wild. Lily saw a butterfly and tried to catch it, but it flew away. She was sad for a moment, but then her mom showed her a pretty flower and they both smiled. 
From that day on, Lily learned to pour her milk more carefully and she had many more adventures in the wild with her mom. The end.
