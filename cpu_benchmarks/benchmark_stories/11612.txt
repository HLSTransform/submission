Once upon a time there was a squirrel. It was a happy squirrel because he had just succeeded in finding a twig! The squirrel scampered as fast as he could to the tree in the forest. 
But when he got there, the twig was dead. The squirrel was very disappointed and started to cry.
Suddenly, a little bunny came up to the squirrel and said, "What's wrong?". The squirrel sniffled and said, "My twig is dead". 
The bunny thought for a while. He hopped around and eventually said, "Maybe you should try to find another twig!". 
The squirrel smiled and said, "You're right! Thank you!". 
So off he went, scurrying through the forest until he found and successfully picked up a fresh twig. The squirrel was so happy that he was able to succeed again, and he continued on his way. 
The end.
