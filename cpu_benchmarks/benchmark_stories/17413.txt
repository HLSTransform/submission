Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her toys. She had a lot of toys, but her favorite was a soft bunny. She always hugged her bunny and took it with her everywhere.
One day, Lily was playing in the living room with her bunny. She saw the fireplace and wanted to see the fire. She knew that fire was hot and dangerous, but she was curious. She left her bunny on the couch and walked to the fireplace.
She reached out her hand to touch the fire, but it was too hot. She felt a pain in her hand and pulled it back. She started to cry and ran to her mommy. Her mommy saw her hand and put some cold water on it. She hugged Lily and told her that fire was not for playing. She said that Lily should never reach for the fire again, or she could get hurt.
Lily said she was sorry and that she learned her lesson. She asked her mommy where her bunny was. Her mommy said that her bunny was still on the couch. Lily ran to the couch and picked up her bunny. She felt its soft fur and kissed it. She was happy to have her bunny and said that she would always listen to her mommy.
The moral of the story is that fire is dangerous and children should not play with it. They should listen to their parents and be careful. They should also appreciate their toys and not leave them behind.
