Sam was very excited to go to the fair. He loved the bright lights and the noisy games.
He asked his nurse if he could win a special toy. The nurse gave a promise, and said if Sam was patient, he would get one.
The nurse took him all around the fair, and they played lots of fun games. Sam was so happy, he just couldn't stop repeating, "I want a toy, I want a toy!"
The nurse eventually gave in and let Sam pick out a special toy from the fair.
But it was too late. When Sam found out how much the toy cost, it was way too much for him to pay. No matter how many times Sam repeated, "I want a toy, I want a toy!", the nurse couldn't turn back time and get the toy for free.
In the end, Sam left the fair that day with no toy, and the happy memories of what could have been.
