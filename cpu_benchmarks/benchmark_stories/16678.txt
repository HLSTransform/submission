Once upon a time, there was a little lamb named Lily. She was very soft and cuddly because she had a coat made of wool. One day, Lily was playing with her friends in a field of flowers. She saw a beautiful flower that was about to bloom. 
Lily said to her friend, "Look, a flower is going to bloom!" Her friend replied, "I'm glad you saw it. It's so pretty."
Lily decided to wait and watch the flower bloom. She was very patient and soon the flower bloomed into a beautiful, colorful blossom. Lily was very happy and said, "It's so pretty, just like my wool!" Her friend agreed and they both enjoyed the beauty of the flower together.
