Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She had a toy cat named Fluffy. Amy liked to play with Fluffy in the kitchen. One day, they found a filthy dish on the floor. The dish was very dirty and had old food on it. Amy knew she needed to clean it.
Amy asked Fluffy, "Who made this dish dirty?" Fluffy could not answer because she was a toy cat. So, Amy decided to ask her mom. Her mom said, "I think you made it dirty when you ate your lunch." Amy felt bad and knew she needed to clean the dish.
Amy took the filthy dish to the sink. She turned on the water and used soap to make it clean. Fluffy watched Amy clean the dish. When the dish was all clean, Amy and Fluffy were happy. They went back to playing in the kitchen, and Amy promised to clean her dishes every time she ate.
