There was a hot day and everyone wanted to stay cool. Gina was playing with her toys on the carpet. She wanted a cold drink, so she went to get one.
At the fridge, she opened the door and saw a yummy ice cream. She wanted it, but then remembered her mom said only one scoop.
When she looked back at the carpet, she saw that all the toys were scattered around. She decided to take the ice cream and go back to play.
Gina picked up all the toys and put them in a neat pile. She then enjoyed her cool ice cream treat. When she was finished, she put the ice cream back in the fridge and helped clean up the mess.
The hot day was coming to an end, so Gina grabbed a blanket and curled up on the carpet for a nap. She had worked hard, so the nap felt very nice. 
When she woke up, the day was over and the carpet was all clean and tidy. Gina was happy and knew that the hot day had ended in a great way.
