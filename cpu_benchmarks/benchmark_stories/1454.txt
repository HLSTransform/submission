Once upon a time there was a little boy. He loved exploring and one day he decided to explore a new place. He came across a hidden path in the woods. He followed the path and soon came to a clearing where he discovered something amazing - a magical week! It glowed with a bright light. The little boy was so excited and decided to pinch it. As soon he touched the week it started to grow and suddenly became larger and larger.
The week got so big that the little boy had to take a step back. But before he knew it the week had grown so large it filled the clearing and the little boy got lost in it. He was so excited to explore. He pinch each day, as he went. He saw different things and discovered new adventures every day. 
He eventually found his way out of the hidden week and back home safe and sound. He had the most amazing adventure and never forgot it. He would pinch the week whenever he closed his eyes, so the adventure would always stay with him.
