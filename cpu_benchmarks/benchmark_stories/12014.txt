Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sing and dance on the stage. One day, Lily was practicing for her big show when suddenly a big thunderstorm came. The lightning struck the stage and frightened Lily. 
Lily ran to her mom and said, "Mommy, I'm scared of the thunder." 
"It's okay, sweetie," her mom said. "Let's go inside and wait for the storm to pass." 
But when they went back outside, they saw that the lightning had started a fire on the stage. The firefighters came, but they couldn't put out the fire in time. 
Lily was so sad that she couldn't perform her show. But her mom hugged her and said, "Don't worry, Lily. We'll build a new stage and you'll have even more fun performing on it."
