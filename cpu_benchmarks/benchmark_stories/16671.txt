Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and toys, but she was always told to be careful with her fragile things. One day, Lily's mom gave her a shiny mint candy, and she was so happy to have it.
Lily's little brother came to play with her and saw the mint in her hand. He wanted it, but Lily didn't want to share. She held onto the mint tightly and wouldn't let go. Suddenly, the mint fell and broke into pieces. Lily was so embarrassed and sad.
Her mom came to comfort her and told her that it's always better to share with others. She said that things can be fragile and easily broken, but friendships and kindness are strong and last forever. Lily learned her lesson and promised to share her toys and treats with her brother and friends.
