Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a flashlight that he loved very much. He took it with him everywhere he went. One day, Tim had a difficult time finding his flashlight. He looked under his bed, in his toy box, and behind the couch, but he just could not find it.
Tim started to feel sad and began to hate not having his flashlight. He asked his mom for help, and she came to look with him. They looked and looked, but it was still hard to find. Tim's mom had an idea. She told Tim to think back to the last time he used it.
Tim thought really hard and remembered he used it outside in the yard when he was playing. He ran outside and there it was, next to his favorite tree! Tim was so happy to find his flashlight. He thanked his mom for helping him and promised to put it away when he was done playing with it. From that day on, Tim took better care of his flashlight and never had a difficult time finding it again.
