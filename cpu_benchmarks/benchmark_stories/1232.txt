Once upon a time, there was a big cat named Max. Max liked to play in the rain and get wet. One day, Max saw a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy had a frame for his picture, but it was broken. Max wanted to help Timmy fix his frame, so they became friends. 
But one day, a bad dog came and tried to fight Max and Timmy. Max knew he had to protect his new friend, so he bravely fought the dog. The dog ran away and Max and Timmy were safe. 
After the fight, Max and Timmy went back to Timmy's house. Max helped Timmy fix his frame and they put Timmy's picture inside. Timmy was so happy and grateful for Max's help. From that day on, Max and Timmy were the best of friends and went on many more adventures together.
