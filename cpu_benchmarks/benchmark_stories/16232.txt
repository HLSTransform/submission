Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Michael. Michael was very hungry, so he got out of bed and went downstairs to the kitchen.
When Michael opened the fridge, he saw a large number of bottles of milk. He was so excited! He grabbed one bottle and stood there to drink it.
Suddenly, a voice said, "You can't drink all of that milk, Michael!"
Michael looked up and saw his mother standing in the kitchen doorway. She said, "There are enough bottles of milk here for everyone! We can all have one."
Michael was happy to know that he and his family would all get to have their own bottle of milk, and he was even more relieved that they were now no longer hungry. He smiled, put the bottle back in the fridge, and went back upstairs to bed.
