Once upon a time there was a brilliant bunny. He hopped around the meadow and enjoyed all the nice smells and sights. One day, he stumbled upon a prize â€“ a shiny carrot. 
The bunny immediately started to demand it. He shouted and stamped his feet, insisting that the prize be his. But the bunny wasn't alone in the meadow. A snake was watching him... 
The snake was wise and said, "If you want the prize you have to do something special first." The bunny was confused. He asked the snake what he had to do. The snake replied, "Jump higher than the tallest blade of grass and then the prize is yours." 
The bunny had never jumped so high before. But he really wanted the prize. So with determination, he used all his energy to jump as high as he could. He jumped until he felt as if he was flying. 
At last, he had jumped higher than the tallest blade of grass. The snake was very impressed and handed the bunny the prize. The bunny held the shiny carrot in his paws and smiled. He had worked hard and he knew that it had been worth it.
