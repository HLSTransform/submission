Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play at the beach. They see the big blue waves and the white sand. They want to test how brave they are.
"Let's go in the water!" Tim says. He runs to the edge of the water and splashes his feet.
"Wait for me!" Sam says. He follows Tim and feels the cold water on his toes.
They laugh and jump in the water. They see the waves coming and going. They try to catch the waves and ride them.
"Look at me!" Tim says. He stands on a wave and balances. He feels like a surfer.
"Wow, you are so good!" Sam says. He claps his hands and cheers.
But then a big wave comes. It is bigger than Tim and Sam. It makes a loud noise and pushes them down.
"Help!" Tim says. He is scared and wants to get out.
"Grab my hand!" Sam says. He reaches for Tim and pulls him up.
They swim to the shore and cough out the water. They are wet and cold and tired.
"That was a big wave!" Tim says. He shivers and hugs Sam.
"That was too big!" Sam says. He nods and hugs Tim back.
They are happy they are safe. They are happy they are friends. They decide to test something else.
"Let's build a sandcastle!" Tim says.
"Let's do it!" Sam says.
They run to the sand and start to dig and pile and decorate. They forget about the big wave and have fun. They are brave and happy.
