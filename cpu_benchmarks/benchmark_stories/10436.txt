Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Molly. Molly asked her friend if she could borrow some chocolate. Her friend said "yes", and Molly was very happy.
Molly wanted to eat the chocolate right away, so she ate it all. But the chocolate was too hard and it made her throat hurt. She started to cry.
Molly's mum came to look at her and saw that Molly had some chocolate near her. Molly told her mum the whole story. Her mum said that Molly should not have eaten the chocolate without asking.
Molly felt very sad and she said sorry. She was sad, because her throat still hurt and she didn't get to enjoy the chocolate.
