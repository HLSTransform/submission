Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play together. They have bicycles. They ride their bicycles in the park. They have fun.
One day, they see a big hill. Tom says, "Let's go up the hill. It will be fun." Mia says, "OK, let's go." They pedal hard and go up the hill. They feel happy.
But when they reach the top, they see a rough path. It has rocks and bumps and holes. Tom says, "Let's go down the path. It will be fun." Mia says, "No, it looks scary. Let's go back." Tom says, "No, it will be fun. Come on." He goes down the path.
Mia is scared. She does not want to go down the path. She says, "Tom, wait for me. Don't go." But Tom does not hear her. He goes fast and bumpy. He likes the rough path.
Mia tries to follow him. She goes slow and careful. But she hits a rock. She falls off her bicycle. She hurts her knee. She cries.
Tom hears her cry. He stops and looks back. He sees Mia on the ground. He feels sorry. He says, "Mia, are you OK? I'm sorry. I should have waited for you." He goes back to help her.
He helps her get up. He hugs her. He says, "I'm sorry, Mia. I was wrong. The path was too rough. It was not fun. It was scary. Are you OK?" Mia says, "I'm OK, Tom. Thank you. You are a good friend. But I don't like the rough path. Let's go back to the park." Tom says, "OK, Mia. Let's go back to the park. Let's play something else. Something nice and safe." Mia says, "OK, Tom. Let's do that." They get on their bicycles. They go back to the park. They play something else. Something nice and safe. They have fun.
