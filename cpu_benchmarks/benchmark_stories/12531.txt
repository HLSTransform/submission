Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One sunny day, they decided to have a picnic in the park. Lily's mom packed a basket full of yummy snacks for them to eat.
When they arrived at the park, they found a big tree with rough bark to sit under. They spread out a blanket and began to eat. After they finished, they played games and ran around. But soon, Lily's friends started to get tired.
One of her friends said, "I'm tired, can we relax for a bit?" Lily replied, "Sure, let's sit under the tree and rest." They sat down and looked up at the leaves swaying in the breeze. It was a peaceful moment and they all felt happy.
