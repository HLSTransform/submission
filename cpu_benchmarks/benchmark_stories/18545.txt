Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a cold and needed some medicine to feel better. His mom told him to take the medicine from the cabinet, but Timmy couldn't open it. He tried and tried, but it wouldn't budge.
Timmy's sister saw him struggling and decided to help. She said, "I'll join you and we can open it together!" They both pushed and pulled until the cabinet finally opened. But when they looked inside, they saw that the medicine was all gone.
Timmy started to cry because he didn't feel well and wanted to take his medicine. His sister hugged him and said, "Don't worry, we'll ask mom to get more medicine for you." And that's exactly what they did. Timmy took his medicine and felt better in no time.
