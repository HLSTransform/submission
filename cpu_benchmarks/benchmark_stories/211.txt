Lily and Ben were very happy. They were going to the park with Mom and Dad. They liked to play on the swings, the slide and the sandbox. They also liked to see the animals in the pond. There were ducks, fish and turtles. Sometimes they fed them bread crumbs.
"Look, Mom, look!" Lily shouted. "There is a big white truck. What is it?"
Mom smiled. "That is an ice cream truck, Lily. It sells cold and sweet treats. Do you want some?"
"Yes, yes, please!" Lily and Ben said. They ran to the truck with Mom and Dad. They heard a funny song from the truck. It made them laugh.
The ice cream man was very nice. He had a big hat and a big smile. He showed them different kinds of ice cream. There were cones, cups, bars and popsicles. There were many colors and flavors.
"What do you want, Lily?" Mom asked.
"I want a pink cone with sprinkles, please," Lily said.
"And you, Ben?" Dad asked.
"I want a blue bar with chocolate, please," Ben said.
The ice cream man gave them their ice cream. They paid him with coins. They thanked him and walked away.
They found a bench to sit and eat their ice cream. They licked and bit their ice cream. It was cold and sweet. They were very happy.
But then they saw something. It was a big black dog. It was running towards them. It had a long tongue and sharp teeth. It looked hungry and angry.
Lily and Ben were scared. They dropped their ice cream. They hugged Mom and Dad.
"Help, help!" they cried. "The dog is coming!"
Mom and Dad were calm. They did not move. They did not scream. They waited for the dog to arrive.
The dog arrived. It sniffed their ice cream. It licked their ice cream. It ate their ice cream. It wagged its tail. It looked happy and friendly.
"See, Lily and Ben, the dog is harmless," Mom said. "It just wanted some ice cream. It did not want to hurt you."
Lily and Ben looked at the dog. They saw that it was harmless. They felt sorry for their ice cream. They felt sorry for the dog.
"Can we give the dog some more ice cream, Mom?" Lily asked.
"Can we pet the dog, Dad?" Ben asked.
Mom and Dad nodded. They smiled. They walked to the ice cream truck with Lily and Ben. They bought some more ice cream. They gave some to the dog. They petted the dog. The dog licked their hands. It made them laugh.
They made a new friend. They were very happy.
