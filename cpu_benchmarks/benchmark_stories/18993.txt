Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a humble house with a big yard. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help find her belt. 
Lily searched high and low but couldn't find the belt. She asked her mom, "Where did you put it?" Her mom replied, "I don't know, sweetie. Can you hear it jingling?"
Lily listened carefully and heard a jingling sound coming from the laundry basket. She dug through the clothes and found the belt. "I found it!" she exclaimed. 
Her mom praised her for being such a good helper and gave her a big hug. From then on, Lily always listened carefully to hear things and was proud of herself for finding the belt.
