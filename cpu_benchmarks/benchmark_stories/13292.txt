One day, a thin cat named Tom went for a walk. He met a big dog named Sam. Tom wanted to be friends with Sam. So, Tom thought of a joke to tell Sam.
Tom said, "Why did the cat sit on the mat? Because he didn't want to be fat!" Sam laughed at the joke. They both liked the story. They played together all day.
At the end of the day, Tom and Sam were tired. They sat under a big tree. Tom said, "I am happy we are friends." Sam nodded and said, "Me too, Tom. Your joke was fun." They smiled and knew they would be friends forever.
