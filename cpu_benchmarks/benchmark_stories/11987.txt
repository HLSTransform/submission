Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved soup, especially chicken noodle soup. One day, Timmy's mom made him a big bowl of soup for lunch. Timmy was so excited to eat it that he accidentally spilled the soup all over his shirt. He felt embarrassed because his shirt was now covered in soup.
Timmy's mom told him not to worry and helped him clean up. She told him to stay calm and that accidents happen. Timmy felt better and continued to eat his soup. It was so yummy that he forgot all about his embarrassing spill. From that day on, Timmy always made sure to be extra careful when eating his soup.
