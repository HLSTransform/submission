Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with her pen and make pictures on paper. One day, she decided to make a special picture for her mom. She got her pen and started to draw a flower.
But then, she realized that the flower needed to be a special color. She remembered that her mom had a big jar of paint. She went to the kitchen and found the jar. She carefully opened it and used a spoon to stir the paint.
Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. She looked up and saw that the jar had fallen off the table. She was scared that the paint would be harmful, but she saw that it was harmless. She cleaned it up and continued to make her special picture for her mom.
