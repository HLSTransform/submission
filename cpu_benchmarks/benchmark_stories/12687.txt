Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and catch bugs in his net. One day, Timmy's mom told him that they were going to celebrate his grandma's birthday. Timmy was excited because he loved his grandma very much.
At the party, Timmy's grandma opened her presents and blew out the candles on her cake. Everyone sang "Happy Birthday" and Timmy gave his grandma a big hug. But then, Timmy accidentally knocked over a vase and it broke into many pieces. Timmy felt sorry and didn't know what to do.
Later that day, Timmy's mom and grandma helped him clean up the broken vase. Timmy learned that accidents happen and it's important to say sorry when we make a mistake. He felt better knowing that his family forgave him and they continued to celebrate his grandma's special day.
