One day, a little bee named Buzz was very tired. He had to fly far and wide to find flowers for his hive. The hive was home to many bees, and they all worked hard to make honey.
As Buzz flew, he saw a big tree with many flowers. "I must tell my friends," he said. Buzz went back to the hive and told the other bees about the tree. "Let's go and get the flowers," they all said.
The bees managed to fly to the big tree, even though they were tired. They buzzed around the flowers and brought them back to the hive. The bees were happy they found the tree, and they made lots of honey. In the end, their tired wings were worth it.
