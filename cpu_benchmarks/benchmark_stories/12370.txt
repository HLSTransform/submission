Once upon a time, there was a speckled bird called Sam. Sam was very rare, and everyone wanted to catch him.
One day, a trapper went into the woods to try and catch Sam. He set up a trap in the hope of luring the bird in.
Sam saw the trap and quickly flew away. He flew up high in the sky, so the trapper couldn't follow him.
Sam called out to the trapper, "No more speaking! I can't be caught." The trapper was angry, but he knew he had to give up.
Sam was glad that he was safe and free. From then on, nobody ever tried to trap him again. He was very rare, so he had to be careful!
