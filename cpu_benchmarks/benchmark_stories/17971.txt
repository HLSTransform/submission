Once, there was a girl named Lily. She had a doll she loved very much. The doll had a smooth dress that Lily liked to touch. One day, Lily's family decided to go to the park. Lily wanted to take her doll with her.
Lily went to her room to pack her bag. She put the doll in the bag with a soft blanket. She also packed a small snack for her and her doll to share. Lily was happy that her doll would go with her to the park.
At the park, Lily and her doll played on the smooth green grass. They had a lot of fun. They shared the snack under a big tree. When it was time to go home, Lily packed her doll and the blanket back into the bag. They went home with big smiles, excited for their next adventure together.
