Once upon a time there was a huge, old man. He lived in an old house by the river.
Every day the old man would go to the river and repair the broken boats that he found. He was so good at repair that he started to teach others how to do it.
The old manâ€™s lessons were a huge success. Soon he had lots of students and he built a huge workshop for them.
Every day everyone would help repair the boats together. Soon they were all big, strong boats and they could go on adventures together. 
The old man was very proud of all of his students and they were all very happy with their work. 
The end!
