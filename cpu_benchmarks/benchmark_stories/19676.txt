One day, a gifted girl walked along the beach. She looked around and saw the beautiful palms all around her. She stopped to take it all in and suddenly wondered a question. "Where did all these beautiful palms come from?" she asked. She walked around, examining the palms with her eyes, until she came to an old man. He told her that every palm tree was planted by a special baby many years ago! He said that the baby was so gifted, that all it had to do was touch the ground with its palm and a palm tree would grow. The girl couldn't believe what she was hearing. She thanked the old man and looked around in wonder. She had never seen of gift like this before, and she wondered what else was possible if you were gifted!
