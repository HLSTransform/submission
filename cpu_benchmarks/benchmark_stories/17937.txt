One day, Jimmy went out to play in the park. He was so excited but he started to worry. What if he didn't find a friend to play with? Then, he heard a happy tune coming from a nearby bush. It was a little bird, whistling away! Jimmy was not worried anymore, he wanted to learn the song and whistle it himself.
He got closer and wanted to make friends. The little bird was scared and flew away. Jimmy kept listening and tried to learn the tune by ear. He kept trying and soon he was whistling the same tune as the little bird.
The bird came back and was amazed at Jimmy's whistling. They got to talking and the bird told Jimmy his name was Tweety. They were soon playing hide and seek. Jimmy felt happy, he wasn't worried anymore.
They played until it started to get dark. Jimmy didn't want Tweety to fly away so he gave him a cheap whistle as a goodbye gift. Tweety said goodbye and flew away. Jimmy was happy, Tweety was his new friend. From that day on, he never worried again.
