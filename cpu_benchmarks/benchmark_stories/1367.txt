The little girl was grumpy. She had been outside playing with her friends in the park, but it was time to go home. She started to complain.
"I don't want to go home," she said. "I want to stay here and keep playing!"
But her parents said that it was time to go. So she walked home, grumbling to herself.
When they got to the house, the little girl saw a big pile of junk in the garden. It was old chairs and toys, broken into pieces. She complained a lot about it.
"Why is this here? It's so ugly," she said. "I don't like it."
Her dad explained that the junk was going to be taken away the next day. The little girl was happy to hear this, but she was still grumpy.
Soon enough, the next day came and the junk was taken away. The little girl was so happy that the ugly pile was gone. She ran outside to play with a smile on her face.
