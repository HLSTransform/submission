Once upon a time there was a lily. The lily lived in a big pond, surrounded by trees and flowers. One day the lily was very troubled. She was so sad that she cried and cried. 
A kind old frog saw her tears and said "Why are you so sad, little lily?". The lily told him that she was so lonely. She said, "I have no one to talk to, so I'm so sad."
The frog was so kind. He said, "I have an idea. Let's fill the pond with lots of other lilies. Then you will never be alone again!".
So the lily and the frog filled the pond with many other lilies. Now the lily was happy. There were so many other lilies to talk to and laugh with. She was no longer troubled. The lily thanked the frog for being so kind and for filling the pond with lilies. And they all lived happily ever after.
