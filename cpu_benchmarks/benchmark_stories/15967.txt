Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sit outside and watch the birds fly in the sky. One day, she saw a beautiful butterfly and she wanted to catch it. 
Lily ran after the butterfly, but she didn't see the lawnmower in front of her. Suddenly, she fell and hurt her knee. Her mom came outside and asked, "What happened, Lily?" 
Lily replied, "I fell down on the grass. It's okay, but my knee hurts." Her mom helped her up and they went inside to get a band-aid. From that day on, Lily learned to be careful and watch where she was running. She still loved to sit outside and watch the birds, but she always remembered to be safe.
