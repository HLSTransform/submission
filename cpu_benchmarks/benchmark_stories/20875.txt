Polly and Tom stood outside, feeling the wind. It was uncomfortable. Tom said to Polly, "It's too windy! I don't like it." Polly replied, "Let's go inside, Tom. The wind makes me uncomfortable too." 
Tom thought for a minute, then said "No! We need to keep playing outside. We can find something to do!" 
They looked around, but the wind kept getting in their way. Every time Polly wanted to do something, the wind would blow it away. Finally, Polly said, "Let's go get mom! Maybe she can help us." 
Tom agreed, and they ran inside to ask their mom. Mom came outside and said, "Let's play tag and chase each other around the yard. That way, the wind won't get in your way." 
So Polly and Tom ran around, playing tag and chasing each other. It was so much fun, they forgot all about the uncomfortable wind.
