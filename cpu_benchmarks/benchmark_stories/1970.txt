Once upon a time, there was a dad and a kid who lived in a cozy little home. Dad was always telling the kid to eat their breakfast and be good. One morning, Dad said, "We are going on an adventure today". So they packed their stuff and got ready to go on their journey. 
The dad and kid had been walking for a while when it started to rain. Then it started to get dark, so they looked for a place to stay. They saw a tall, thick tree and the dad said, "Let's rest here". 
So they snuggled into the thick tree and soon the kid felt really sleepy. Dad whispered, "Stay here and I'll keep watch". But the kid was too tired to stay awake, so soon enough, they both fell asleep. 
The dad and kid were both sound asleep when something scary arrived. A giant monster was growling and stomping its feet. The dad and kid were shaking with fear but it was too late, the monster had found them. 
 
The dad and kid had no time to escape, so all they could do was watch as the monster opened its big, sharp jaws and swallowed them both in one big bite. It had a terrible wake, and then it was gone.
