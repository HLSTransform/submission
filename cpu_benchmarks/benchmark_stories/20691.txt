Today was ordinary. Emma’s mom took her to the park. They played tag, and swung on the swings. It was so much fun! 
But then it was time to go home. Emma felt sad. She hugged her mom and said, “I miss the park.” 
Her mom smiled and said, “Me too. But it will still be here tomorrow.” 
So, Emma said goodbye and went inside. She wished she could stay and play forever, but tomorrow would come. And she knew she would miss the park today, but she could come back tomorrow to play again.
