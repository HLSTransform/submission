Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and write with her crayons. One day, Lily's friend came over and saw all of her pretty pictures. Her friend wanted to draw too, but she said she couldn't because she wasn't good at it. Lily told her friend that it didn't matter if she wasn't good, as long as she had fun doing it.
Later that day, Lily's friend saw a big zero on her math test. She felt sad and said she wasn't good at math. Lily reminded her friend that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone learns at their own pace.
The next day, Lily's friend came over again and wanted to play dress up. She tried on a dress that was too small and said it didn't fit. Lily told her friend that it was okay and that they could find another dress that did fit.
Lily's friend learned that it's important to try new things, even if you're not good at them, and that mistakes are okay. It's also important to find things that fit you and make you happy.
