Lily and Ben were playing in the park with their mom. They liked to slide, swing and run. They saw a big house with a fence and a gate. They wanted to see what was inside.
"Mom, can we go there?" Lily asked.
"No, sweetie, that is not our house. We don't know who lives there. It might be dangerous," mom said.
But Lily and Ben were curious. They waited until mom was talking to another mom. They ran to the gate and tried to open it. It was locked. They saw a key under a rock. They took the key and unlocked the gate. They went inside the yard.
They saw a lot of flowers, trees and birds. They thought it was pretty. They walked to the door of the house. They tried to open it. It was also locked. They saw another key under a mat. They took the key and unlocked the door. They went inside the house.
They saw a lot of books, toys and pictures. They thought it was fun. They wanted to play with them. They heard a noise upstairs. They went to see what it was. They saw a woman in a bed. She had long hair, big eyes and a smile. She looked at them and said:
"Hello, my little friends. I'm so glad you came to visit me. I've been waiting for you for a long time. Do you want to stay with me forever?"
Lily and Ben were scared. They did not know the woman. They did not want to stay with her. They wanted to go back to their mom. They ran to the door. It was locked. They saw the key on a table. They grabbed the key and unlocked the door. They ran to the gate. It was locked. They saw the key on a hook. They took the key and unlocked the gate. They ran to their mom.
"Mom, mom, we're sorry, we're sorry!" they cried.
"What happened, my loves? Where did you go?" mom asked.
"We went to the big house. There was a scary woman. She wanted to keep us. We ran away. We're sorry, we're sorry!" they said.
Mom hugged them and kissed them. She was angry and worried. She said:
"Never do that again, my loves. Never go to a stranger's house. Never take things that are not yours. Never leave me without telling me. That is very dangerous. You could get hurt or lost. Do you understand?"
"Yes, mom, we understand. We're sorry, we're sorry!" they said.
Mom took them home. She gave them a bath, a snack and a story. She tucked them in bed. She said:
"I love you, my loves. You are safe with me. Good night."
"Good night, mom. We love you too," they said.
