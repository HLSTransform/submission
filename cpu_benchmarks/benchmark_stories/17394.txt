Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to be organized and put everything in its place. Lily had a box of dolls and Tom had a box of cars. They shared some blocks and puzzles.
Suddenly, they heard a loud scream from the kitchen. It was their mom. She had burned her hand on the stove. She ran to the sink and put her hand under the water. She was crying and saying "ouch, ouch, ouch".
Lily and Tom were scared. They did not know what to do. They wanted to help their mom. They remembered that their dad had taught them what to do in an emergency. He had said to call 911 and tell them what happened.
Lily grabbed the phone and dialed 911. She said "Hello, my mom burned her hand on the stove. We need help. We live at 123 Main Street. Please hurry". Tom ran to the kitchen and got a towel. He wrapped it around his mom's hand. He said "Don't worry, mom. Lily called 911. They are coming to help you. You will be okay".
Soon, they heard a siren outside. It was the ambulance. Two people came in with a stretcher and a bag. They asked Lily and Tom some questions. They checked their mom's hand and gave her some medicine. They said she had to go to the hospital, but she would be fine. They said Lily and Tom were very brave and organized. They said they could go with their mom or stay with a neighbor until their dad came home.
Lily and Tom decided to go with their mom. They hugged her and said they loved her. They got in the ambulance and waved goodbye to their toys. They hoped their mom would feel better soon. They were glad they knew what to do in an emergency.
