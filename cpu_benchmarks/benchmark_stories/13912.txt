Once upon a time, in a big green garden, there lived a little caterpillar named Cathy. Cathy loved to eat leaves and play with her friends. One day, while eating a leaf, Cathy saw a big scary bug.
Cathy was scared, but she wanted to be brave. She asked the scary bug, "Who are you?" The scary bug said, "I am Bob, the beetle." Cathy and Bob talked and soon they became friends.
One day, Cathy saw a leaf with a hole in it. She asked Bob, "Can you help me remove the hole?" Bob said, "I can't remove the hole, but I can help you eat the leaf." So, Cathy and Bob ate the leaf together and they were happy.
