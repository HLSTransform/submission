Once upon a time, there was a little town by the river. One day, it rained a lot and the river started to grow big. Soon, the river was so big that it flooded the town. The water was not very strong, it was mild. The people had to be careful and stay inside their houses until the flood went away. After a while, the water went down and the town was safe again. Everyone was happy that the flood was gone.
