Once upon a time, there was a furry friend. He wanted to wander and explore outside. So, one day he went out and had lots and lots of fun. He scurried around, discovering all kinds of new things and his long tail wagged behind him. 
But then something happened. There were two big doggies that were really loud and one of them knocked over the furry friend! He was so upset! He wanted to go back home, but he didn't know how.
He tried to find his way back home, but got lost. He wandered and wandered until he could not wander anymore. Then all of a sudden, he saw a familiar face. It was his mommy! She had been so worried about him and was very, very glad to see him.
She hugged him tight and the furry friend was happy to be back home safe and sound. He promised his mommy that he wouldn't wander and get lost again. Now he is back home and playing with his tail.
