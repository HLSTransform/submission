Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and books. They also like to make jokes and tricks. One day, they find a big box in the living room. It has a bow and a tag. The tag says: "To Anna and Ben, from Santa".
Anna and Ben are very happy. They think Santa came early this year. They want to open the box and see what is inside. But they also want to wait for Christmas. They are confused. What should they do?
They decide to make a plan. They will open the box very carefully and see what is inside. Then they will wrap it again and put it back. They will act surprised on Christmas. They think this is a good joke.
They open the box and see a big teddy bear. It is soft and brown. It has a red scarf and a hat. Anna and Ben love it. They hug it and play with it. They forget about their plan. They forget about the time.
Mom and Dad come home. They see Anna and Ben with the teddy bear. They see the box and the paper. They are not happy. They are angry. They ask Anna and Ben what they did. Anna and Ben are scared. They try to lie. They say they found the teddy bear outside. They say they did not open the box.
Mom and Dad know the truth. They are not stupid. They tell Anna and Ben that they are naughty. They tell them that they broke the rule. They tell them that they have to say sorry. They tell them that they have to give back the teddy bear. They tell them that they have to wait for Christmas.
Anna and Ben are sad. They cry. They say sorry. They give back the teddy bear. They wrap it again and put it back. They learn their lesson. They do not make jokes and tricks with presents. They do not lie to Mom and Dad. They wait for Christmas. They hope Santa will forgive them.
