Sara and Ben were twins who liked to play with their toys. One day, they found a big van in the garage. It was dull and dusty, but they thought it looked fun.
"Let's use the van as a spaceship!" Sara said. "We can go to the moon and see the stars!"
"OK!" Ben agreed. They climbed into the van and pretended to push buttons and turn wheels. They made noises like rockets and lasers.
But then, they heard their dad coming. He was angry. He opened the door of the van and saw them inside.
"What are you doing here?" he asked. "This is my work van. You are not allowed to use it. You could break something or hurt yourself. Get out now!"
Sara and Ben felt scared and sorry. They got out of the van and said, "We're sorry, dad. We just wanted to play. We didn't mean to cause trouble."
Dad sighed and looked at them. He was not so angry anymore. He said, "I know you were just playing, but you have to be careful. The van is not a toy. It is a tool. I use it to carry things and help people. You have to respect other people's things and ask before you use them. Do you understand?"
Sara and Ben nodded. They said, "We understand, dad. We won't use the van again without asking. We're sorry."
Dad smiled and hugged them. He said, "It's OK. I forgive you. But next time, why don't you use your imagination and make your own spaceship out of cardboard boxes and paper? That would be more fun and safe."
Sara and Ben liked that idea. They said, "Thank you, dad. We love you."
They learned a lesson that day. They learned to respect other people's things and to use their imagination. They also learned that their dad loved them and wanted them to be happy and safe.
