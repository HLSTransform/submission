Once upon a time, there was a big tank. It was very shiny and had lots of wheels. The tank was very proud and thought it was better than all the other vehicles.
One day, a humble little car came along. The car was not as big or shiny as the tank, but it was very friendly. The car asked the tank if it wanted to play a game of follow the leader. The tank agreed and the car led the way.
As they drove along, the tank started to realize that being humble and following someone else was actually quite fun. The tank learned that it didn't always have to be in charge and that sometimes it was nice to let someone else lead. From that day on, the tank and the car became good friends and played follow the leader all the time.
