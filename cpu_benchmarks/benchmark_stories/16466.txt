Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play with toys in the garden. One day, they find a big box. They want to make a house with the box.
"Look, we can cut a door and a window," Tom says. He gets scissors and tape.
"Be careful, Tom. The scissors are sharp," Mia says. She worries that Tom will hurt himself.
Tom cuts the box. He makes a door and a window. He tapes them together. He is happy.
"Come, Mia. Let's go inside our house," Tom says. He crawls into the box.
Mia follows him. She sees a soft blanket inside the box.
"Wow, this is cozy," Mia says. She snuggles with Tom.
They pretend they are a family. They talk and laugh. They forget to worry. They have fun.
