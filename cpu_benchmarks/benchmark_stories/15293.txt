Once upon a time there was a happy boy. He liked to go outside and play every day. One sunny day he saw something twisting in the breeze. He wanted to find out what it was, so he ran over to take a closer look.
When he got there, it was a cute little kite moving up and down in the sky. The happy boy was so excited, he wanted to fly the kite. He grabbed the strings to control it and started running around, twisting it around and around in the sky.
The kite flew higher and higher above the trees. The boy was laughing with joy and he stayed out flying the kite for many hours. He never wanted to stop it, but eventually he had to go home.
The next day, the happy boy couldn't wait to fly the kite again. He raced outside and watched the kite twisting in the blue summer sky.
