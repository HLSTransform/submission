Once upon a time, there were two best friends who lived far apart. But even though they were far away, they always found a way to unite.
One day, the two friends decided to meet in the middle so they could be together. They packed their bags, said goodbye to their families and started off on their journey.
When they finally arrived, they found a cross in the middle of the road. They stopped, looked at each other and smiled. They were so grateful to have made it to the same place, even though they were so far away. They hugged and said "We made it!"
From that day on, they visited the cross every year to remind themselves that no matter the distance, they could still unite. And they were always filled with hope and gratitude.
