Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and watch cartoons on TV. One day, she found a tube in her toy box. She asked her mom what it was for. Her mom told her it was for blowing bubbles.
Lily tried to blow bubbles with the tube, but she couldn't do it. She asked her mom for help. Her mom showed her how to use the tube and turn it around to make bubbles. Lily was so happy!
Later that day, Lily's friend Timmy came over to play. Lily showed him the tube and how to blow bubbles. Timmy tried to blow bubbles too, but he couldn't hear the sound of the bubbles popping. Lily asked him why he couldn't hear them. Timmy told her he was deaf. Lily didn't know what that meant, so she asked her mom. Her mom explained that being deaf meant that Timmy couldn't hear like Lily could. 
Lily felt sad for her friend, but she still wanted to play with him. She gave Timmy the tube and they took turns blowing bubbles together. They had so much fun!
