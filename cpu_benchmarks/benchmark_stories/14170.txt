Once upon a time, there was a dependable desk. It had lived in the same room for many years. One day, a tiny little creature came crawling along. It was only three years old, and very curious.
As it crawled closer to the desk, it started to explore. It ran its hands along the smooth surface, and noticed the complexity of its design. The desk was big and strong and dependable.
The little creature was so excited! It had never seen a desk before. It began to explore its drawers, delighted by the things it found inside. It rummaged around for hours, unpacking each of the drawers and discovering more and more wonderful items inside.
At the end of the day, the desk and the creature became friends. From that day forward, they were together through thick and thin. The dependable desk had found a loyal companion, and nothing could stand in their way.
