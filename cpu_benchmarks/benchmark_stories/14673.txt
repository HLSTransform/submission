Once there was a girl called Sam. She was three and she loved to shout. Every day she would shout and shout, until her mom told her to stop.
One day, Sam went to the playground. There were lots of fun things to do! But she was very quiet - until she saw a slide!
Sam was so excited she started to shout as loud as she could. She shouted and laughed and jumped around.
After a minute, a group of kids came over to join her. They all shouted and laughed together. Sam was so successful at making friends! 
They played in the playground for hours, and when it was time for Sam to go home, she shouted goodbye to all her new friends. 
She was so happy to have shared her shouting, and it made her smile all the way home.
