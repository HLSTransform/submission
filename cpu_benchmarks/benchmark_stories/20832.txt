Once there was a cute puppy called Spot. He had a bone he liked to carry in his mouth. He went on a walk one day and saw a cat. He barked to tell the cat hello but the cat hissed and ran away. Spot was sad, but he kept walking with his bone. Suddenly he saw another puppy, Rose. Rose was playing with a bone that looked just like Spot's bone. Spot ran over to Rose and told her hello. Rose was so happy and they started to play together. Spot dropped his bone and they each had a bone as they kept playing. Together they were so cute. Very soon they became best friends.
