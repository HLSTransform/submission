Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Kitty. Kitty was a fearful cat. She was scared of many things. One day, Kitty saw a big bowl of milk. She wanted to drink it, but she didn't know if it belonged to her.
Kitty asked her friend, a small dog named Spot. "Does this milk belong to me?" Kitty was scared to drink it, but she was very thirsty. Spot shook his head and said, "No, Kitty. That milk belongs to the big dog, Max."
Kitty was very scared of Max. But she was also very thirsty. She looked at the milk again and decided to drink it. She drank it very fast. When Max came back, he saw the empty bowl and said, "Who drank my milk?" Kitty was scared, but she told the truth. "I'm sorry, Max. I was very thirsty."
Max looked at the fearful Kitty and said, "It's okay, Kitty. Next time, just ask me first." Kitty was happy that Max was not mad at her. From that day on, Kitty and Max shared their milk and became good friends.
