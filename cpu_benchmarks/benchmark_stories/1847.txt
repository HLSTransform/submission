Once upon a time, a prince was walking through the forest. He was on a mission to find a beautiful palace to celebrate his birthday. As he walked further into the forest, he began to believe he had found the most perfect place in the world. The palace looked very fair. 
The prince entered the palace to explore and began to celebrate his special day. Suddenly he heard a loud, deep voice.
"Hello prince, you must leave this palace immediately."
The prince was scared and asked "why?" but received no reply. He reluctantly began to leave. As he walked away, he felt as if something bad was going to happen. 
The next day, the forest was burning and the palace was destroyed. Everyone was sad and thought the fire came from the palace. The prince had known it was dangerous, but it was too late - the fair palace was no more.
