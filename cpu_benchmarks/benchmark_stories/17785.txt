Once, there was an adorable little girl. She had a big box of crayons and she loved to write. Everywhere she went she had her crayons and scribbled in her notebook.
One day, the magnificent sun was high in the sky and it was a beautiful day for writing. What made it perfect was that when she looked outside, the sunshine was so warm and inviting.
She decided she would take her crayons outside and write in her notebook. She sat down in the grass and started to draw circles. On each circle, she wrote a big sunshine and lots of happy words.
The little girl looked up at the sky and saw the bright yellow sunshine in the sky. She smiled and felt so appreciated. She was proud of her writing and it made her happy to fill her notebook with sunshine and smiles.
