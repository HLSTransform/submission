Sally went on a safari. She was very happy and could hardly wait to start exploring. She saw many animals, like elephants, monkeys and giraffes. As she was walking along, Sally stopped to stare at a lion. Her mouth was wide open! She was staring for so long that the lion even moved a little closer. Suddenly, Sally wasn't so sure she wanted to stay. She quickly ran away, giggling the whole time. 
When the safari was over, Sally was very happy. She had seen so many wonderful creatures, and the lion was her favorite. She couldn't wait to tell her friends all about her adventure.
