Once upon a time, there was a barn. Inside the barn was a secret, it was hidden. It was a room full of special things.
 Josie and her brother, Jack, went to see what was inside. It was full of toys! Toys of all shapes, sizes and colors!
They ran around picking up toys and playing with each other loud. After a while, Josie and Jack had to put the toys back into the hidden room. They put them away in boxes, shelves and drawers. When they were finished, the room was almost as neat as before!
Josie and Jack ran outside to tell everyone what they found. They said the barn had a secret room filled with toys. Everyone was excited and wanted to go! 
Now, every weekend, Josie, Jack and their friends go to the barn to store their toys in the hidden room and have lots of fun!
