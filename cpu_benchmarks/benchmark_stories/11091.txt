Once upon a time, in a big green field, there was a little purple cat. The cat was very sad. It lost its toy and could not find it. The cat looked everywhere but the toy was not there.
One day, the cat met a nice dog. The dog saw the sad cat and wanted to help. The dog asked the cat, "Why are you sad?" The cat said, "I lost my toy and I can't find it." The dog thought for a moment and then said, "Let's guess where your toy is!"
The cat and the dog guessed and guessed. They looked under a big tree, in a small hole, and behind a tall bush. Finally, they found the toy near a pretty flower. The purple cat was so happy! The cat and the dog played with the toy all day long. From that day on, the purple cat was never sad again.
