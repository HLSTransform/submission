Once upon a time, there were two friends named Bob and John. Bob had some gas he wanted to sell. He asked John if he wanted to buy it, but John didn't have any money.
Then Bob had an idea. He knew some rich people near the town who might want to buy it. So, Bob and John went to find them.
When they arrived at the rich people's house, Bob asked if they wanted to buy his gas. The rich people were very happy and bought the gas from Bob.
Bob gave the money to John and thanked him for going with him. With the money, John bought some yummy treats for himself and Bob. They both had a great time!
