Once upon a time, there was a fish named Fin. Fin loved to dive in the deep blue sea. One day, Fin found a note that said, "Help! I am lost." Fin knew he had to help. He swam all around looking for the one who wrote the note. After a long search, Fin found a fake fish that was stuck in a rock. Fin quickly helped the fake fish and they became good friends. From that day on, Fin and the fake fish went on many adventures together.
