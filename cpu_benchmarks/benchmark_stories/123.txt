Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, they found a big green structure to climb on. 
Lily's friend, Timmy, said "Be careful, the edges are sharp!" 
Lily replied, "Don't worry, I'll be careful." She climbed up the structure and looked down at Timmy. "I can see everything from up here!" 
Timmy smiled and said, "Wow, you're so brave!" 
Lily felt proud of herself and they continued to play on the green structure for the rest of the day.
