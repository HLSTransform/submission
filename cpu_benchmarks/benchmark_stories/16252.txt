Once upon a time there was a little girl called Sally who loved fashion. One day she decided to search for the perfect dress. She looked everywhere as she wanted to find something special.
Sally asked her mum to help her, so they started searching together. Eventually they found the most beautiful dress, with a lot of flowers. Sally was so happy that she shouted loudly with excitement.
When they arrived home, Sally put the dress on. She looked in the mirror and couldn't believe how wonderful she looked. She twirled around and showed her mum, who said she looked like a princess.
Sally smiled proudly and thanked her mum for helping her find the perfect dress. And they were both happy. The end.
