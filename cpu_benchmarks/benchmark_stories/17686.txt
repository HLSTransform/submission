Once upon a time, there was a small boy who wanted to go to the sea shore. But he had one big problem - he forgot his black bulb!
The little boy was so sad. He did not know how he would find his bulb. He asked his Mama for help. Mama told him to go look for it.
The little boy went outside and looked around. He looked everywhere but he could not find his bulb. Then he remembered he had put it in the kitchen.
He ran back inside, and there it was - his black bulb, right next to the sink. He was so happy he said, "Mama, I found it!"
Mama said, "I knew you could do it. Now let's go to the sea shore!"
The little boy was so excited. He held his black bulb tight in his hand and they set off on their journey.
And they lived happily ever after.
