Once upon a time there lived a little girl and her mommy. Every day they would pretend to go on adventures in the garden. The little girl's favourite thing was her red cart. She loved to fill it up with toys and pretend that it was a special car that went very fast.
One day the little girl was so excited when her mommy said they were going to the park. She quickly grabbed her red cart, and her mommy said she could take it with her. At the park, the little girl used her cart to haul around a big bucket of water. The bucket had little toy boats in it, and the little girl pretended the boats were sailing in the water.
The little girl was so grateful for her red cart, it made her adventures even more fun! She thanked her mommy for letting her take it with her. 
Every time she went to the park, the little girl took her cart. She loved to pretend that it took her everywhere she wanted to go.
