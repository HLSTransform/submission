Once upon a time, there was an incredible paint box. It was full of lots of wonderful colors that made the world brighter. 
One day, a brave 3 year old wanted to try something big. He dared to open the paint box, and mix all the colors together.
He stirred and stirred, until all the paint was gone! When he opened his eyes, an incredible sight greeted him. 
All around him were bright swirls of paint that he had created. It was the prettiest thing he had ever seen. He was so proud of what he had done,
that he ran to tell his family all about it. They all agreed that it was truly incredible!
