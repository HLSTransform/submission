Once there was a gray pet cat named Mittens. Mittens liked to zoom around the house chasing toys and playing with strings. One day, Mittens saw a bird outside and zoomed out the door to try and catch it. But the bird flew away too fast.
Mittens was sad that she couldn't catch the bird, but then she saw a butterfly and zoomed after it. The butterfly was too fast for Mittens too, but she had fun trying to catch it.
At night, Mittens curled up in her cozy bed and fell asleep. She dreamed of zooming through fields and catching all the birds and butterflies she could. Mittens was a happy gray pet cat.
