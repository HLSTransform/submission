Molly was in the stable. She loved it there, it smelled like hay and was filled with colors. All the horses were so big and strong. Molly was wearing her favorite blue dress and she loved it.
She looked around the stable and started to guess what she would see next. She guessed a big horse, but instead she saw a little kitten! Molly was so happy and she ran over to it.
The kitten was blue and it was so cute. Molly petted it and it cuddled up to her. She was so happy and she said, "This is my new friend!"
Molly kept looking around the stable and guessed what she would find next. She finally found a big brown horse. Molly was so happy and she said, "This is the biggest horse I've ever seen!" She petted it and it was so gentle.
Molly had so much fun in the stable and she smiled the whole time she was there. She said goodbye to the horses and the kitten and promised to come back again soon.
