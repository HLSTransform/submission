Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was so frightened. Every night when she tried to sleep, she dreamed about a big key. She couldn't figure out what it meant!
One night, she decided to make the key. She took some paper and crayons and she started to draw. She drew for a long time until finally, she had the key.
The next morning, she took the key and she went for a walk. She soon came to a big door. Using her key, she opened it!
On the other side, she saw a beautiful garden. She was no longer frightened. She had found something magical. Every night she now dreams of her secret garden.
