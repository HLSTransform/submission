Once upon a time, there was a kind lady named Mary. She had a lovely cat named Fluffy. Fluffy was soft like velvet and Mary loved to pet her. 
One day, Mary decided to have a tea party with her friends. She made some yummy sandwiches and poured some juice in a pretty cup. Fluffy sat on the table and watched everything. 
When her friends arrived, Mary served them the sandwiches and juice. Fluffy even got a little treat too! Everyone had a great time and Mary was happy to have shared her food and her lovely cat with her friends.
