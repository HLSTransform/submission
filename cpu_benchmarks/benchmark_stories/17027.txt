Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big slide. Lily wants to go on the slide. Tom is scared.
"Come on, Tom. It is fun. You can do it," Lily says.
"I don't know, Lily. It is high. I might fall," Tom says.
Lily holds Tom's hand. She smiles with her lively eyes. She hopes Tom will be brave.
"Look, Tom. I will go first. Then you can follow me. It is easy. Just sit and slide," Lily says.
Lily goes on the slide. She laughs and shouts. She lands on the soft grass. She looks at Tom.
"See, Tom. It is not scary. It is fun. Come on, Tom. You can do it," Lily says.
Tom looks at the slide. He looks at Lily. He sees her lively eyes. He hopes he can be brave. He takes a deep breath. He sits on the slide. He slides down. He laughs and shouts. He lands on the soft grass. He looks at Lily.
"I did it, Lily. I did it. It was fun. Thank you, Lily," Tom says.
Lily hugs Tom. She is happy. She is proud of Tom.
"You did it, Tom. You did it. You are brave. You are my friend," Lily says.
They smile with their lively eyes. They hope they can play more. They run to the swings. They have fun. They are friends.
