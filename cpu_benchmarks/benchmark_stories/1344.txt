Once upon a time there was a family who lived in a small house with not much furniture. The furniture was very old and pale and it didn't look very nice. Each day the family wished for something better, so one day they decided to improve the furniture. 
They worked hard to make it better. They polished and painted it until it was no longer pale and dingy. It looked bright and new and they were all so happy with their improved furniture. 
They moved the furniture around in the house and it looked so much better than before. Even their friends noticed and came to visit more often. Everyone was very pleased and happy with the improved furniture. 
The family enjoyed living in their house with the new and improved furniture. They would often have movie nights and family time on the furniture, and make the most of their cosy home. 
The end.
