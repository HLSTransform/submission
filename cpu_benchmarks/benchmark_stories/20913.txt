Once upon a time there was a little girl named Daisy. Daisy had two furry friends: a white bunny and a gray kitty.
One day, Daisy was playing with her friends. The bunny was hopping around, and the kitty was chasing her tail. Suddenly, the kitty got scared and ran away. 
Daisy was sad and worried. She wanted to help her friend find the way back home. She thought and thought until she had an idea! Daisy took a big, deep breath and gently called out: “Kitty, kitty! Please come back!” 
The kitty slowly came out of the bushes and blinked. Daisy knew what she had to do! Daisy held out her hand and said, “Come with me, it’s okay. I’ll help you find the way back home.” 
The kitty followed Daisy and they soon reached home. Daisy waved goodbye and smiled.
This story taught us a great lesson: no matter how scared or lost we feel, if we are gentle and kind with our words, then we are able to find the way back home!
