Sam and Mia are friends. They like to play outside in the sun. But today is very hot. Sam and Mia feel sweaty and thirsty.
"Let's go inside and drink some water," Mia says. "It is too hot to play outside."
Sam nods. He follows Mia to the door. But he sees something on the ground. It is a big, rough rock. Sam likes rocks. He wants to pick it up.
"Sam, come on," Mia says. "Don't stay outside. It is hot."
Sam does not listen. He bends down and grabs the rock. But the rock is very hot too. It burns Sam's hand. Sam drops the rock and cries.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Sam says. "The rock is hot. It hurts."
Mia runs to Sam. She sees his hand is red. She feels sorry for Sam.
"I'm sorry, Sam," Mia says. "The rock is hot because the sun is hot. You should not touch it. Come inside with me. I will get some ice for your hand. It will make it feel better."
Sam nods. He holds Mia's hand. They go inside together. Mia gets some ice from the freezer. She wraps it in a cloth and puts it on Sam's hand. Sam feels the cold. It makes his hand feel better.
"Thank you, Mia," Sam says. "You are a good friend."
Mia smiles. She hugs Sam.
"You are welcome, Sam," Mia says. "You are a good friend too. Next time, let's play inside when it is hot. It is safer and cooler."
Sam agrees. They drink some water and play with some toys. They are happy. They stay inside until the sun goes down.
