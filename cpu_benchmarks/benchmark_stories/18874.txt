Sam liked to travel with his dad in the big car. They would go to different places and see new things. Sometimes they would stop and have a picnic in the grass. Sam loved to eat sandwiches and cookies.
One day, they went to a place where there were many deer. Sam was very excited. He wanted to see the deer up close. He asked his dad if he could get out of the car and walk to the deer. His dad said no, it was not safe. The deer might run away or get scared.
But Sam was persistent. He did not listen to his dad. He opened the door and ran to the deer. He wanted to touch them and play with them. He thought they were friendly and cute.
The deer did not like Sam. They saw him coming and they ran away. They did not want to be touched or played with. They wanted to be left alone. Sam was sad and confused. He did not understand why the deer did not like him.
His dad saw what Sam did and he was angry and worried. He called Sam to come back to the car. He told Sam that he was naughty and he should not run to the deer. He said the deer were wild animals and they needed their space. He said Sam could have been hurt or lost.
Sam felt sorry and ashamed. He said he was sorry to his dad and to the deer. He said he just wanted to be friends with them. He said he would not do it again. His dad hugged him and said he loved him. He said he was glad Sam was safe. He said they could still watch the deer from the car, but they had to be quiet and respectful. Sam agreed and nodded. He learned his lesson. He still liked to travel with his dad, but he did not run to the deer anymore.
