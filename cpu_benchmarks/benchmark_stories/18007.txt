Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to climb trees. One day, Timmy saw a really high tree and he wanted to climb it. 
Timmy's mom said, "Be careful Timmy, that tree is really high." 
Timmy said, "I can do it, Mommy!" 
So, Timmy climbed and climbed until he reached the top of the tree. He looked down and saw his mom tapping her foot. 
"Come down, Timmy," she said. 
Timmy climbed back down and said, "That was so much fun! Can we climb another tree tomorrow?" 
His mom smiled and said, "Sure, Timmy. But let's find a shorter one next time."
