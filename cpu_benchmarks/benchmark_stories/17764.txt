Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He loved to go on adventures. One day, he was playing in the park. He noticed a mysterious gear laying on the ground. He walked over to get a closer look. He picked it up, and noticed it was heavier than he expected. He was sure the gear was not from this park! He was very curious. He thought it must be from a far away place. He was so excited! He took the mysterious gear home with him and kept it safely. He was sure it was part of a much bigger adventure. He wanted to find out where it came from, and just what this mysterious gear was all about.
