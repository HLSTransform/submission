Once upon a time, there was a jet. The jet was flying high in the sky, and kept going and going.
One day, a little girl, named Mary, was looking out the window. She noticed the jet, and asked her mom, "Mom! What is that?"
Her mom replied, "That is a jet, honey. It's very fast!"
Mary was so excited and wanted to keep watching the jet, so she asked her mom, "Can we keep flying in the jet?"
Her mom shook her head and said, "No, I'm sorry honey. Flying in a jet is uncomfortable, so we have to take our car."
Mary was disappointed, but she knew her mom was right. So instead of flying in the jet, they drove in their car and kept going and going.
