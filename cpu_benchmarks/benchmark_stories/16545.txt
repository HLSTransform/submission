Lily was a shy girl who liked to play with her dolls. She had a lot of dolls, but she wanted a new one. She saw a pretty doll in the shop window. It had long hair and a pink dress. Lily asked her mom if she could buy the doll.
"Maybe for your birthday, sweetie," her mom said. "But not today. We have to buy some dishes for the kitchen."
Lily was sad. She really wanted the doll. She followed her mom to the dish shop. There were many dishes on the shelves. They were shiny and colorful. Lily saw a dish that looked like a flower. She thought it was pretty. She reached for it, but she was too small. She knocked over the other dishes. They fell to the floor and broke.
"Crash! Bang! Smash!" The dishes made a loud noise. Everyone in the shop looked at Lily. She felt scared and ashamed. She started to cry.
"Oh, Lily, what have you done?" her mom said. She was angry and worried. She had to pay for the broken dishes. They were very expensive. She did not have enough money. She had to borrow some from the shop owner. She said sorry to him.
The shop owner was not happy. He said Lily was a naughty girl. He said she could not come to his shop again. He said he would tell the other shop owners not to let her in.
Lily and her mom left the shop. They did not buy the doll or the dishes. They went home. Lily was still crying. She felt bad. She wished she had not touched the flower dish. She wished she had listened to her mom. She wished she had been a good girl.
