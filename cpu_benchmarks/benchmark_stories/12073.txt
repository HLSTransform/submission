Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy car that could zoom really fast. He loved to play with it every day.
One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy wanted to play with Timmy's toy car, but Timmy didn't want to share. Billy said, "Timmy, why won't you let me play with your car?" Timmy replied, "Because it's my favorite toy and I don't want it to break."
Billy dared Timmy to let him play with the car for just one minute. Timmy thought about it for a moment and decided to be dependable and share his toy with his friend. So, he handed the car to Billy and said, "Okay, but be careful with it."
Billy was so happy and he zoomed the car around the room. After a minute, he gave the toy car back to Timmy and said, "Thanks for sharing your toy with me, Timmy. You're a good friend." Timmy smiled and said, "You're welcome, Billy. I'm glad we can share our toys and have fun together."
