Tom and Mia went to the zoo with their mom. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and elephants. They liked to watch them and learn their names.
When they came to the bird area, they saw a big bird with a long neck and legs. It was an ostrich. Tom and Mia had never seen an ostrich before. They wanted to get closer and touch it.
"Mom, can we go to the ostrich?" Tom asked.
"Sure, but be careful. Don't scare it or make it angry," mom said.
Tom and Mia walked slowly to the ostrich. It was lying on the ground, not moving. Its eyes were closed.
"Is it sleeping?" Mia wondered.
"I don't think so. It looks dead," Tom said.
"Dead? What does that mean?" Mia asked.
"It means it doesn't work anymore. It doesn't breathe, or eat, or run, or play. It's gone," Tom explained.
Mia felt sad. She liked the ostrich. She wanted to see it work.
"Why is it dead?" Mia asked.
"I don't know. Maybe it was sick, or old, or hurt. Sometimes animals die, just like people," Tom said.
"Can we make it work again?" Mia asked.
"No, we can't. When something is dead, it can't work again. It's the end," Tom said.
Mia started to cry. She hugged Tom. Tom hugged her back.
"Mom, can we go now? The ostrich is dead and it makes us sad," Tom said.
Mom came and hugged them too.
"I'm sorry, kids. It's hard to see something dead. But you know what? The ostrich had a good life here. It had food, water, friends, and people who cared for it. It was happy. And now it's in a better place, where it doesn't feel any pain or sadness. It's at peace," mom said.
"Really?" Mia asked.
"Really. And we can remember it and be happy for it. And we can see other animals that are alive and work and have fun. Come on, let's go to the penguins. They're always funny," mom said.
Tom and Mia wiped their tears and nodded. They followed mom to the penguins. They saw them slide, swim, and splash. They laughed and forgot about the dead ostrich. They had a good day at the zoo.
