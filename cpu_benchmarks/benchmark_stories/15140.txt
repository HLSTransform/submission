Once upon a time there was a young boy named John. John was a very organized child and he was always playing with his tool. 
One day, when he was playing, a big mean bully came up to him. The bully started poking John with his tool. John was scared, so he ran away. 
John had to find a way to stop the bully from pocking him. He knew he had to be brave and organized. 
John thought long and hard and he decided to make his own tools, so he could poke back. He collected all the materials he needed and he worked hard to make it the best he could. 
When he was done, he went to find the bully. When the bully saw John with his tools, he knew he couldnâ€™t mess with him. 
Since then, John and the bully have been friends and no more poking has happened!
