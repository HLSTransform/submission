Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing in the park and looking at the fountain. The fountain was big and had water that went up and down. Timmy liked to watch the water go up and down slowly.
One day, Timmy saw a girl at the park. She looked sad and lonely. Timmy wanted to be her friend, but she didn't want to play with him. She ignored him and walked away. Timmy felt sad too.
Later that day, Timmy was playing near the fountain when he saw the girl again. She was trying to throw a coin in the fountain, but she couldn't reach. Timmy remembered how she ignored him earlier, but he still wanted to help her. He went over and helped her throw the coin in the fountain. The girl smiled and said thank you. Timmy felt happy that he helped her and they became friends.
