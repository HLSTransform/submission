Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Jack. Jack was 3 years old and loved to play outside in the sun. One day he noticed that he was hungry and remembered that he had not eaten anything all day. He decided to go to the kitchen to find something to eat.
When Jack entered the kitchen he saw some meat in the fridge. He took out the meat and knew he had to fix it. He cut the meat into small pieces and put them in the pan. Then he added some oil so the meat became smooth. Soon the meat was sizzling hot in the pan. 
Jack was so excited to try it. He added some salt and pepper to make it taste yummy. He knew that this was going to be a great dinner. He put the pan on the table and quickly ate all the meat. It was delicious.
Jack was very happy with his dinner. He learned that if you ever need something to eat, you can fix it with some meat and it will always taste smooth and yummy!
