Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cozy rug in her room that she liked to play on. One day, Lily's mom asked her to be careful while playing on the rug because it was very special to her. Lily nodded her head and promised to be careful.
As Lily played, she heard a knock at the door. It was her friend Timmy. Timmy loved playing with Lily on her rug. He asked if he could play too. Lily said yes and they played together for a while. They were having so much fun that they didn't realize they were making a mess on the rug.
When Lily's mom came in, she saw the mess and was upset. Lily and Timmy looked sad. But then, Lily remembered what her mom had said about being careful. She apologized to her mom and promised to clean up the mess. Her mom smiled and nodded her head, happy that Lily was being responsible.
