Once upon a time, there was a driver named Jack. Jack had a big car and he loved to drive it fast. One day, Jack wanted to go up a big hill, but his car was not strong enough. Jack tried and tried to make his car go up the hill, but it just would not work. 
Jack was very persistent and did not give up. He tried to push his car up the hill, but it was too heavy. Then, he saw a big truck and asked the driver for help. The driver was kind and helped Jack push his car up the hill. 
Finally, Jack made it to the top of the hill and he was so happy! He thanked the driver and drove home safely. From that day on, Jack knew that even when things were hard, he could try and be persistent like the driver who helped him.
