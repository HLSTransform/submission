Once upon a time there were two babies. One baby was very creative and always made beautiful art. The other baby was less interested in art and preferred to play outside.
One day, while they were playing together, the creative baby decided to climb the highest tree in the park. "This will be fun!" said the creative baby, as the other baby watched nervously. The creative baby slowly made their way up the tree, until they could reach the very top. Suddenly, the baby slipped and began to fall!
The other baby ran over and quickly grabbed the falling baby, saving them from certain injury. The creative baby felt so grateful and thanked their lucky friend. 
The other baby said, "You were so brave to climb that tree, but next time be more careful!"
The creative baby smiled and said, "Yes! I'll be creative, but I'll also be careful too!" They hugged each other and continued playing and exploring together.
