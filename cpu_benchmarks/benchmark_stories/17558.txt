Lily and Ben were playing in the bathroom. They saw a shiny thing on the sink. It was a razor. Lily wanted to touch it.
"Look, Ben, a shiny thing!" Lily said. "Can I have it?"
"No, Lily, that is not for us. That is for Daddy. It is sharp and can hurt you." Ben said. He was a reliable brother. He knew some things were dangerous.
But Lily did not listen. She reached for the razor. She wanted to see how it felt. She did not see the water on the floor. She slipped and fell. The razor cut her hand. She cried out loud.
Mommy heard the cry. She ran to the bathroom. She saw Lily and Ben and the razor and the blood. She was very angry and scared.
"What happened here? Who touched the razor?" Mommy asked.
"I did, Mommy. I'm sorry. It was shiny and I wanted it." Lily said. She was in pain and sorry.
Mommy took Lily to the doctor. The doctor fixed her hand. He gave her a bandage and a sticker. He told her not to touch razors again.
Lily learned a lesson. She should listen to her brother and Mommy. They knew what was good for her. She should not touch things that were not for her. They could hurt her and make her sad. She should be careful and safe.
