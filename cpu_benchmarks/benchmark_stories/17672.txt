Once upon a time, a big yoga class were in a park. They were all mixing and stretching. The teacher showed them how to bend and twist their bodies in different ways. All the children were having lots of fun.
Next, the yoga teacher spread out some big mats. She told everyone that it was time to mix. Everyone got busy and began mixing up the colors. Some red and blue, some yellow and green. All the colors made the mats seem like a rainbow.
Finally, when all the mats were finished, everyone got into the first yoga pose. They all looked so big and strong. The yoga teacher was so proud of her students. They all looked like real yogis.
At the end of the class everyone said bye. They all had so much fun mixing yoga. It was time to go home and rest.
