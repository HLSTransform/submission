Once upon a time, there were two friends, Jack and Jill. They were going for a walk. It was a hot day, so Jack and Jill decided to take a break by a lake. The lake was big and wet. Jack and Jill sat down to rest and looked around.
Suddenly, Jill saw something in the lake. She let out a big shout, "Hooray!" and pointed. Jack looked in the lake and saw that it was a surprise - a box filled with yummy desserts! Jack and Jill jumped up and down, they were so excited.
Jack and Jill ran over to the box and let out a gasp. How could they eat it all? Jack had an idea. He said, "Let's take it home and share it with our families!" They both smiled and ran home with the box of wet desserts.
At home, Jack and Jill let their families have some of the yummy treats. Everyone was so happy and thankful that Jack and Jill had found such a wonderful surprise. All the families shared the desserts together, and everyone had a great day.
