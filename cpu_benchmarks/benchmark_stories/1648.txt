Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was a rare teddy bear. One day, Lily's mom told her that they needed to deliver some cookies to their neighbor who was sick. Lily was sad because she wanted to play with her toys, but her mom said it was important to help others.
So, they got into their car and drove to the neighbor's house. When they arrived, the neighbor was very happy to see them and thanked them for the cookies. Lily felt happy too because she helped someone who needed it. She realized that it was better to help others than to play with her toys all day.
From that day on, Lily tried to help others whenever she could. She learned that it was important to be kind and to deliver happiness to those around her.
