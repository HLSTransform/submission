Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo loved to dive in the deep blue sea with his friends. One day, Nemo saw a big orange fish swimming by. Nemo was curious and decided to say hello. 
"Hi, my name is Nemo. What's your name?" asked Nemo.
"My name is Oliver. Nice to meet you," replied the orange fish.
Nemo and Oliver became good friends. Oliver was very obedient and always followed Nemo's lead. They swam together and explored the sea. They saw many different kinds of fish and even found a treasure chest. 
Nemo and Oliver had so much fun together that they promised to always be friends and dive together whenever they could. From that day on, they were the best of friends and always had each other's back.
