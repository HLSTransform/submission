Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a small house. She wanted to go outside and play in the sunshine. So she opened her door and saw a star just sitting there. She was so excited! She picked up the star and brought it inside.
The little girl's mom saw the star and said, "Honey, that's a very special star! Let's wash it so it's nice and clean!" 
Then the girl went to the sink and filled it with soap and water. She began to wash the star with a washcloth. After it was nice and clean, it shone with its original beauty!
The little girl smiled and said, "Now it's ready to go back outside!" She carefully placed the star on the grass and watched it twinkle in the moonlight. She happily ran back to the house and went to bed.
From that day forward, she looked for the star every night and enjoyed its special beauty under the night sky.
