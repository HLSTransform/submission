Once upon a time, there was a woman who was very special. She had an expensive box that was locked. Every day she would come and unlock the box. One day, a 3 year old child saw her. He asked her, "What's in the box?" She smiled and said, "It's a secret." The child wanted to know, so he asked, "Can I unlock it?" The woman said, "Yes, you can. Just turn the key, and the box will unlock."
The child turned the key and opened the box. Inside the box, he found a lot of toys. He was so excited! He thanked the woman and said, "You are so kind!" The woman smiled and said, "You are welcome." With that, the child went away, happy and excited, with the toys he had found in the box.
