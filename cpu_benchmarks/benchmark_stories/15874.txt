Once upon a time there lived a happy little goat. He lived in a big green field, where he liked to eat grass and explore.
One day while he was exploring, the goat found a big pile of meat. He was so excited! He immediately gobbled it all up, until there was nothing left.
The goat's mom came over and saw the empty pile of meat. She looked very worried. She asked the goat why he had been so naughty and ate all the meat.
The goat said "I'm sorry, mom. I won't behave like that again." His mom was so relieved that he had said sorry. She hugged him and said, "That's my good boy."
The goat learnt an important lesson that day. He made sure not to eat things he shouldn't and always behaved himself. 
The end.
