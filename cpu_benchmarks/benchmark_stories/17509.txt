Lily liked to play in the garden. She liked to look at the flowers and the bugs. One day, she saw a frog sitting on a rock. She went to say hello.
"Hello, frog. What are you doing?" she asked.
"Hello, Lily. I am waiting for a princess," the frog said.
"A princess? Why?" Lily wondered.
"Because I am a prince. A witch turned me into a frog. If a princess kisses me, I will turn back into a prince," the frog explained.
Lily felt sorry for the frog. She wanted to help him. She thought for a moment.
"I am not a princess, but I can be your friend. Maybe if I kiss you, you will turn back into a prince," she said.
The frog smiled. He liked Lily. She was kind and polite.
"Thank you, Lily. You are very sweet. But you don't have to kiss me. You can just be my friend. That is enough for me," he said.
Lily was happy. She hugged the frog. They became good friends. They played and talked in the garden every day.
One day, a fairy came to the garden. She saw Lily and the frog. She was the one who turned the frog into a prince. She wanted to see if he learned his lesson.
"Hello, Lily. Hello, frog. I am the fairy who made you a frog. I did it because you were rude and selfish. You only cared about yourself. You did not respect anyone. Have you changed?" she asked.
The frog nodded. He felt ashamed of his past. He learned to be polite and caring. He learned to value friendship.
"Yes, fairy. I have changed. I am sorry for what I did. I am grateful for Lily. She is my best friend. She taught me how to be a good person," he said.
The fairy smiled. She was pleased with the frog. She decided to give him a reward.
"That is good to hear. You have passed my test. You deserve to be happy. I will turn you back into a prince. And if you want, you can marry Lily. She is a princess in my eyes. She has a pure heart and a gentle soul," she said.
The frog and Lily were surprised and happy. They looked at each other. They felt a warm feeling in their chests. They liked each other very much.
"Yes, fairy. I want to marry Lily. She is my true love," the frog said.
"Yes, fairy. I want to marry the frog. He is my true love," Lily said.
The fairy waved her wand. The frog turned into a prince. He was handsome and charming. He kissed Lily. She was beautiful and graceful. They hugged each other. They thanked the fairy.
The fairy blessed them. She flew away. Lily and the frog, now a prince, lived happily ever after.
The moral of the story is: Be polite and kind to everyone. You never know who might be your friend or your true love.
