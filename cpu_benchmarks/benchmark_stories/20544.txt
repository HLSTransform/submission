One Sunday morning, Mary woke up feeling very friendly. She jumped out of bed and put on her best dress. She wanted to make everyone smile.
Mary went outside to find her friends. She saw her friend Jack outside. He was standing there crying.
Mary was very sad to see Jack so unhappy. She asked him why he was crying. Jack told her a big bird had swooped down and taken away his toy.
Mary gave Jack a big hug and asked him to stay and join her to play. She helped him find his toy, and soon he was laughing and playing again.
The sky was so blue and the sun was so bright, they knew it was going to be a very friendly Sunday.
