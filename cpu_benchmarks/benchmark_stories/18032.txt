Once upon a time, there was a little spider named Sammy. Sammy lived in a big house with lots of rooms. One day, Sammy was crawling around the house when he saw a big cobweb. He thought it looked like a good place to rest, so he climbed up and sat down.
But soon, Sammy started to feel uncomfortable. The cobweb was sticky and made him itchy. He didn't like it at all. He wanted to complain, but he didn't know who to talk to.
As the day went on, Sammy felt worse and worse. He tried to crawl out of the cobweb, but he was stuck. He couldn't move. He was scared and alone.
Sadly, Sammy never got free from the cobweb. He stayed there forever, uncomfortable and alone.
