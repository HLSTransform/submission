Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved music and always wanted to learn how to play the piano. One day, she saw a big piano in her neighbor's house and got very eager to play it. 
Lily went to her neighbor and asked, "Can you explain to me how to play the piano?" Her neighbor smiled and said, "Of course, I can teach you!" 
Lily practiced every day and got better and better. One day, her neighbor came to her and said, "Lily, you have learned so much! But remember, it is important to always be kind and patient with yourself when you are learning something new." 
Lily realized that her neighbor was right. She kept practicing and soon became very good at playing the piano. She learned that with hard work and patience, she could achieve anything she wanted.
