Once there was a little girl. She was only three years old. She was very happy, but she was also very fussy.
Everyday she would complain about things. She was always whining. Her parents were very patient but it was getting tiresome. 
One day, the little girl had a nightmare. She became very scared and started to complain even more than usual. Her parents tried to calm her down but it didn't seem to help.
The parents decided to take her to the park. They hoped that being outside and playing with her friends would help her forget about her nightmare. 
It worked. The little girl had a great time at the park. She laughed and played and forgot all about her nightmare. 
She was very successful in forgetting about the nightmare. And from that day on, she stopped complaining so much and was a much happier child.
