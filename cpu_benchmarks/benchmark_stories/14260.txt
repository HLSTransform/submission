Jimmy was playing in the yard one day. He saw a chain and went over to have a look. He was fascinated by the way it sparkled in the sun, so he put it on. It was heavy, but he liked it.
Jimmy decided to show his friend what he found. He started to rock back and forth, clinking the chain as he moved. His friend saw him and suddenly, things changed.
Jimmy's friend said he stole the chain and his dad was very angry. He used harsh words and grabbed Jimmy. Jimmy was scared and tried to take off the chain, but it was stuck.
The dad got even more angry, so he dragged Jimmy inside. Jimmy was scared and kept begging him to let him go, but the dad wouldn't listen. He made Jimmy return the chain and then he told Jimmy never to come back.
Jimmy was very sad that his bad luck caused such a harsh ending. He learned the hard way never to steal something that wasn't his.
