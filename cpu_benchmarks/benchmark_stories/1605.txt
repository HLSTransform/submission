Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. Today, they see a big hat on a bench. The hat is red and blue and has a yellow star.
"Wow, look at that hat!" Anna says. "It is so pretty. Can I try it on?"
"OK, but be careful. Maybe it belongs to someone," Ben says.
Anna puts the hat on her head. It is too big for her. It covers her eyes and ears. She laughs.
"Ha ha, I look funny. How do I look, Ben?"
Ben laughs too. He thinks Anna looks silly. He takes a picture of her with his toy camera.
"You look like a clown, Anna. Cheese!"
Anna and Ben hear a voice. It is a man. He is wearing a white coat and glasses. He is holding a clipboard and a pen.
"Excuse me, children. That is my hat. I need it for my test," the man says.
"Your test? What test?" Anna asks.
The man smiles. He points to a big balloon. The balloon is green and has a number on it. It is tied to a string.
"I am testing how high the balloon can fly. The hat has a device that can measure the height. See this button?" the man says.
He shows Anna and Ben a small button on the hat. He presses it. The balloon starts to rise in the air.
"Wow, that is cool!" Ben says.
"Can we watch?" Anna asks.
"Sure, you can watch. But please give me back my hat. I need to record the data," the man says.
Anna takes off the hat. She gives it to the man. She is sorry to lose the pretty hat, but she is curious about the balloon.
"Thank you, children. You are very nice. Do you want a reward?" the man asks.
He opens his coat. He has a pocket full of candies. The candies are colorful and shiny. They look yummy.
"Yes, please!" Anna and Ben say.
The man gives them each a candy. They unwrap it and put it in their mouths. It is sweet and chewy.
"Mmm, this is yummy!" Anna says.
"Thank you, mister. You are very nice too," Ben says.
The man smiles. He puts the hat on his head. He watches the balloon fly higher and higher. He writes something on his clipboard.
Anna and Ben watch too. They hold their candies and their hands. They are happy. They have made a new friend. And they have learned something new.
