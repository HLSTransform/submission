Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big teddy bear named Max. Max was very hairy and always made Lily laugh. One day, Lily's mom told her that they were going on a journey to visit her grandma. Lily was excited to see her grandma and Max was excited to come along too.
As they were getting ready to leave, Lily's mom asked her to help wrap Max in a blanket so he wouldn't get cold. Lily happily wrapped Max up and said, "Max is all cozy now!" 
On the journey, Lily and Max saw many things outside the car window. They saw trees, birds, and even a big mountain. Lily asked her mom, "Are we there yet?" and her mom replied, "Not yet, we still have a little ways to go."
Finally, they arrived at grandma's house. Lily hugged her grandma and Max gave her a big furry hug too. Lily said, "I love our journey, but I'm happy to be here with you, grandma!"
