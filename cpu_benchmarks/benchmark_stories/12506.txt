Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she found a big box in her room. She wanted to see what was inside, so she opened the box. Inside the box, there were many toys. She took out a doll and examined it closely. 
After playing with the doll, Lily saw a step stool in the corner of her room. She climbed up on the step stool to see what else was in the box. She found a toy car and a ball. She played with them for a while, but then it was time for dinner.
Lily's mom came in and saw the toys all over the floor. She asked Lily to put them back in the box. Lily put the toys back in the box and closed it. She was excited to play with them again tomorrow. The end.
