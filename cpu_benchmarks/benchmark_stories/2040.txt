Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved animals, especially wild ones like lions and tigers. One day, Timmy's friend Jack invited him to go on a safari. Timmy was very excited and quickly packed his bag.
When they arrived, Timmy saw all kinds of animals he had never seen before. He saw a monkey swinging from a tree, a giraffe with a long neck, and even a crocodile with a big crack in its tooth! Timmy was amazed and couldn't stop smiling.
As the sun set, Timmy and Jack sat around the campfire and talked about all the wild animals they had seen. Timmy was so grateful that Jack had invited him on this adventure. He knew it was a day he would never forget.
