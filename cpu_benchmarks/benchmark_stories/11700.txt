Once upon a time there was a mysterious little girl who loved to measure things. Everywhere she went she had her umbrella. One day she went down to the park to measure the swings. She measured all the swings and then noticed something very strange.
Up in the sky she saw a mysterious umbrella. She ran to measure it and then, to her surprise, found out that it was much bigger than her own! She was so excited.
The next day, she went back to the park to measure the mysterious umbrella again. She wanted to know just how big it was. She was so amazed that it was still larger than hers.
The little girl then took her own umbrella and ran around the park, measuring everything. She had so much fun. This mysterious umbrella would always be a mystery and a reminder of the wonderful day she spent at the park.
