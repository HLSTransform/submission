Once upon a time there was a girl named Lucy. She was only three but she was very adventurous.
One day, Lucy wanted to explore the world outside her house. She walked and walked, looking at all the pretty things she saw. Suddenly, Lucy came to a dry page. It looked like a big leaf with lots of lines and squiggles.
Lucy wanted to reach the page, so she stretched her arms up high. She found that she could not reach it no matter how hard she tried. She jumped and jumped, but still the page stayed just out of reach. 
But then, she had a great idea. She grabbed a rock and put it down on the ground beneath the page. She climbed up on the rock and then she could reach the page.
Lucy was so happy! She touched the dry page with her tiny hand and smiled with delight. She had reached the page!
