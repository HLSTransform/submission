Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden. One day, she saw a lizard crawling on the wall. It was green and had a long tail.
Lily asked the lizard, "What are you doing?"
The lizard replied, "I am waiting for my friend to ring me. We are going to have lunch together."
Lily thought the lizard was very attractive with its shiny scales. She said, "You look very pretty. Can I be your friend too?"
The lizard smiled and said, "Of course! The more friends, the merrier."
From that day on, Lily and the lizard became the best of friends. They played together and had lots of fun. And whenever the lizard's friend rang, they all had lunch together.
