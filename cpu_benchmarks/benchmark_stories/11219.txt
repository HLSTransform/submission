Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Maia. Maia had a big heart and a special love for the ocean. Every day, she would take her swimming gear, go to the shore, and swim all day.
One day, Maia noticed that her swimming gear was torn. She was very sad and looked up at the sky and said, “What do I do now?”
Just then, her Grandpa appeared and said, "Let me help." Grandpa took the swimming gear, repaired it and returned it to Maia. Maia was very happy and thanked him.
Grandpa said to Maia, "Remember to never give up, and when something doesn’t work out, you have to look for a way to repair it. That’s the only way you can find a solution."
Maia was so inspired by her Grandpa’s words, she began to repair all the other things that weren’t working in her life. From then on, her life was a lot easier and happier. 
Moral: When things don't work out, look for a way to repair them and never give up.
