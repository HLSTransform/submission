Tim and Sue were playing in the park. They saw a big tent with many colors. They wanted to go inside and see what was there.
"Come on, Tim, let's look!" Sue said.
"OK, Sue, but be careful. Maybe there are scary things inside," Tim said.
They ran to the tent and lifted the flap. They saw a man with a funny hat and a long whip. He was making a lion jump through a hoop. There were many people watching and clapping.
"Wow, Sue, look! It's a circus!" Tim said.
"Wow, Tim, look! It's a lion!" Sue said.
They were so excited that they did not see the sign that said "Do not enter". The man with the whip saw them and was angry.
"Hey, you two, get out of here! This is not a place for children. You are foolish to come here. You could get hurt by the lion," he shouted.
He cracked his whip in the air. The lion roared. Tim and Sue were scared. They ran out of the tent as fast as they could.
"Sorry, mister, sorry!" they said.
They ran back to their mom, who was waiting for them on a bench. She hugged them and asked them what happened.
"We saw a circus, mom. But the man with the whip was mad at us. He said we were foolish," Sue said.
"We were not foolish, mom. We just wanted to look," Tim said.
Mom smiled and kissed them.
"I know, my loves. But you have to be careful and follow the rules. The circus is not for children. It is for grown-ups who pay money. Maybe when you are older, we can go and see it together. OK?" she said.
"OK, mom," they said.
They learned their lesson and played in the park. They did not go near the tent again. They had fun with their mom and each other. They were happy.
