Once upon a time, there was a grumpy old man who worked at a store. He was always in a bad mood and never smiled. One day, some kids came into the store and started to tease him. They were laughing and making fun of him.
The old man didn't like it and he told them to stop. But the kids didn't listen and they kept teasing him. The old man got even grumpier and he told them to leave the store.
The kids felt bad and they apologized to the old man. They didn't want to make him feel sad. The old man forgave them and even gave them some candy. From that day on, the kids never teased anyone again and the old man wasn't so grumpy anymore.
