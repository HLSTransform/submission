Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Amy. She was three years old and loved playing with her toys. One day, Amy saw her dad measuring something in the garage.
"What are you doing, Daddy?" she asked.
"I'm measuring something, sweetheart," her dad replied.
Amy was curious, so she followed him into the garage. There was a big box with lots of switches, dials, and buttons.
"What is this, Daddy?" asked Amy.
"It's a machine that measures things," her dad said.
Amy was fascinated.
"Can I use it?" she asked.
Her dad said yes, so Amy started to measure everything she could find. She found that when the switch was tight, the measurements were extra accurate.
After a few hours, Amy was tired but very happy. She had discovered how to measure things, just like her dad.
