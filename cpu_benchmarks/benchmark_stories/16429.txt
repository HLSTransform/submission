Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big dog in the park. The dog had a steak in his mouth. Tom and Sam both wanted the steak. They thought it looked yummy.
"Let's get the steak from the dog," Tom said. He was brave and greedy. He ran towards the dog and tried to grab the steak.
"Wait, Tom, that's not nice!" Sam said. He was kind and smart. He knew the dog would be angry and scared.
The dog saw Tom and barked loudly. He showed his sharp teeth and growled. Tom was afraid and stopped. He started to tremble. He wished he had listened to Sam.
Sam ran to Tom and hugged him. He said, "It's okay, Tom, I'm here. The dog is not bad, he just wants his steak. We should not take what is not ours. We should be happy with what we have."
Tom nodded and said, "You're right, Sam, I'm sorry. I was envious of the dog and his steak. But I have you and our toys and our food. I don't need the steak. I love you, Sam."
Sam smiled and said, "I love you too, Tom. Come on, let's go home and share a cookie."
The dog watched them leave and wagged his tail. He was glad they did not bother him anymore. He ate his steak and enjoyed it.
The end.
Moral: Do not be greedy and envious of what others have. Be kind and grateful for what you have.
