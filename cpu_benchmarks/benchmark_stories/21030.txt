Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy who loved to chew. One day, Lucy was given a toy iron to play with but she wanted to chew it.
Lucy's mom said, "No Lucy, you can't chew the toy iron, it's not food." But Lucy love to chew so much that she just couldn't resist.
Lucy chewed the toy iron and it made her mouth very spicy. Her lips started to burn and she could taste the spicy iron in her mouth. She didn't like it and started to cry.
Mama heard Lucy's cry and ran to help her. She soothed Lucy's mouth and gave her a yummy treat. Lucy was so happy to have something to chew that wasn't spicy. 
From then on, Lucy knew that sometimes things were not meant to be chewed. She vowed to never chew something again that wasn't for eating.
