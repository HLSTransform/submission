Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack. Every day he had a new problem to solve. One day Jack thought of a new game. He had a special box filled with matches. Every time he solved a problem he had to find the right match. 
Jack tried his best to find the right match. But one day he couldn't find the right match and he was very sad. 
His mom knew how to help. She said, "Sometimes being foolish can help you solve a problem. So try something foolish and it may help you solve this match problem."
Jack smiled. He chose the most silly looking match and he was right! It worked! That day he learned a very important lesson. Being foolish can help you solve problems. 
The end.
