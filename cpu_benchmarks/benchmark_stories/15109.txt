Once upon a time there was a famous driver. His car could reverse faster than anyone else's. 
One day, a little girl asked him,  "Can I see your car reverse? Please!"
The driver smiled and said, "Yes, of course!" 
So the driver drove in reverse fast, and the little girl couldn't believe her eyes. She clapped her hands with joy.
The driver laughed and said, "That was fantastic!"
The little girl said, "You're the most famous driver in the world". The driver felt really happy.
The driver gave the little girl a big hug and said, "Thank you for noticing me."  From then on, the driver was known to be the best driver in the world.
