Once there was a little girl called Bonnie. She was only three years old, but she had a big dream. She wanted to be the best player of a game called the Butterfly Game.
But the game was difficult and Bonnie had to practice hard. She tried her best every day, but she didn't seem to get any better. Finally, one day, Bonnie decided to take a break and see if she could do better after that. She shrugged her tiny shoulders and went for a walk.
As she walked, she saw a group of children playing the Butterfly Game. She watched them carefully and noticed that they all had high scores. She felt weak and discouraged when she saw how well they played.
But she didn't give up. Bonnie kept practicing and finally, her score began to increase. Soon she was playing the game better than ever! Bonnie's hard work and determination paid off, and she became the best player of the Butterfly Game.
