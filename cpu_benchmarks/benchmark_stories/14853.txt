Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore the world around him. One day, he found a lost puppy in the woods. He knew he had to help the puppy find its way home.
Timmy asked his human parents for help, but they were too busy to lend a hand. So, Timmy decided to use his useful map to lead the puppy back to its home. It was a long journey, but Timmy never gave up.
Finally, they arrived at the puppy's home and the owner was very happy to see his lost pet. Timmy felt proud of himself for helping the puppy and learned that even though he was small, he could still make a big difference in the world by being kind and helpful.
