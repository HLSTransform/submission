Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweetie. Tweetie was very lonely because he didn't have any friends to play with. He would sit on a branch all day and watch other birds fly together.
One day, Tweetie saw a big, juicy worm wriggling on the ground. He wanted to grab it, but he was too scared. So, he watched it move and motion until it disappeared into the ground.
The next day, Tweetie saw the same worm again. This time, he decided to be brave and grab it. He flew down and picked up the worm with his beak. As he was flying back to his branch, he saw another bird looking at him. The bird asked if he could share the worm with Tweetie. Tweetie was so happy to have a new friend and they shared the worm together. From that day on, they played together every day and Tweetie was never lonely again.
