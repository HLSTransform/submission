Once upon a time, there was a little duck named Ducky. Ducky lived in a pond with his family and friends. One day, Ducky decided to go on an adventure. He got on a raft and started to paddle.
Ducky paddled and paddled until he arrived at a big river. He was scared because he had never seen such a big river before. But then he saw a harmless fish swimming by and he felt better.
Ducky decided to follow the fish and they swam together for a while. They saw many things on their adventure, like big rocks and tall trees. Finally, it was time for Ducky to go back home. He got on his raft and paddled all the way back to his pond. When he arrived, he was very happy to see his family and friends again. The end.
