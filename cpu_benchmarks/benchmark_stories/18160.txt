One day, a man was walking in the park. He saw a big rock and wanted to climb it. But the rock was too high. The man felt frustrated. He thought, "I know! I will crawl up the rock like a little bug." So, he got on his hands and knees and started to crawl.
As the man crawled, a little girl saw him. She asked, "Why are you crawling like a bug?" The man said, "I want to climb this big rock, but it is too high for me. So, I am crawling like a bug to get up there." The little girl laughed and said, "That's funny!"
The man crawled and crawled, but he could not get up the rock. He was very tired and frustrated. He sat down and cried. The little girl came to him and said, "I'm sorry you can't climb the rock. Maybe you can try again another day." But the man was too sad. He walked away from the park and never tried to climb the big rock again.
