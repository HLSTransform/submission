Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toys and go on adventures. One day, Tim went on a boat ride with his family to an island. The island was very pretty with lots of trees and flowers. Tim thought it was so attractive!
While on the island, Tim found a shiny rock. He picked it up and showed it to his mom. She told him that the rock was very valuable and he should keep it safe. Tim was so happy to have something so special. He put the rock in his pocket and continued to explore the island with his family. 
When it was time to leave, Tim didn't want to go. He wanted to stay on the island forever because he loved it so much. But his mom told him they had to go home. Tim was sad, but he knew he could always come back and visit his special island and his valuable rock.
