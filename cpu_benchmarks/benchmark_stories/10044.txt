Jill and Ben were playing with their cars in the living room. They liked to make sounds with their mouths as they zoomed their cars around. Vroom, vroom, beep, beep, crash!
Mom was in the kitchen, making lunch. She was not happy with the noise. She told Jill and Ben to be quiet, or they would have no lunch. She was very bossy.
Jill and Ben did not listen to Mom. They thought it was fun to make sounds. They wanted to delay lunch and play more. They made louder and louder sounds. Vroom, vroom, beep, beep, crash!
Mom got very angry. She came to the living room with a big frown. She took away their cars and put them in a box. She said they were naughty and rude. She said they would have no lunch and no cars for the rest of the day. She was very mean.
Jill and Ben started to cry. They were hungry and sad. They wished they had listened to Mom. They learned that making sounds was not worth the delay. They had a bad ending.
