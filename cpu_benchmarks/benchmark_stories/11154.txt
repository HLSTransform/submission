Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a cute puppy running around in the park. The puppy was so adorable that Lily wanted to catch it and take it home with her.
But when she tried to catch the puppy, it ran away from her. Lily chased after it, but she didn't want to get in trouble with her mom for running too far away. So, she decided to go back home and ask her mom for help.
Together, Lily and her mom went back to the park and they were able to catch the puppy. Lily was so happy to have a new friend to play with. From that day on, Lily and the puppy played together every day and had lots of fun.
