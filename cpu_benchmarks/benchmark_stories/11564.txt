Once upon a time, in a small house, a little girl named Lily lived with her mom and dad. Lily loved to find new things. One day, she found a smooth rock in the garden. She was very happy and showed it to her mom.
"Mom, look! I found a smooth rock!" said Lily. Her mom smiled and said, "That's a nice rock, Lily. Let's keep it and make a story about it."
So, they sat down and made up a story about the smooth rock. The rock was lost and wanted to find its family. It went on a long journey, asking other rocks if they knew its family. Finally, the smooth rock found its family, and they were all happy together.
Lily loved the story about the smooth rock. She kept the rock in her room and would tell the story to her friends when they came over to play. The smooth rock became Lily's favorite thing, and she always remembered the special story her mom made up for her.
