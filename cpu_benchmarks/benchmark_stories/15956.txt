Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear pink socks every day. One day, Lily lost one of her pink socks. She was sad because she loved those socks so much.
Lily's mom saw her sad face and asked, "What's wrong, Lily?"
"I lost my pink sock," Lily said sadly.
"Don't worry, we'll find it," her mom said with a smile.
Lily felt happy knowing her mom loved her and wanted to help her find her favorite sock. They searched all over the house until they finally found the missing pink sock under the bed. Lily was so happy to have her favorite sock back and she hugged her mom tightly, saying "I love you, Mommy!"
