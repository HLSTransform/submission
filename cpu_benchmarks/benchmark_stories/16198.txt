Once upon a time, there was a small bear named Bee who was very sleepy. She was walking around her forest home and yawning a lot. To Bee's surprise, she saw a bright purple flower in the middle of the forest. She went closer to the flower to get a better look.
Just then, a friendly bee flew up to Bee and said, "hello there, I can explain why this flower is purple." Bee was very excited and asked, "why is the flower purple?"
The bee said, "well, it is so special because it blooms only during the night and gets its beautiful purple colour from the moonlight." Bee was amazed and thanked the bee for explaining.
After that, Bee was even more sleepy, so she waved goodbye to the bee and walked back home. She was very happy that she discovered the mysterious purple flower and went off to take a nap in her comfy bear cave.
