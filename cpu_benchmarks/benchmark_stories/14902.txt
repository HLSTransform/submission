Mum and Dad were singing in the car. Charlie was happy and he joined in too. Soon they arrived at the airport.
Dad said, "We're here to see the planes!"
Charlie was excited. He loved watching the planes take off, but the plane he was looking for wasn't there. He felt sad and upset.
Mum said, "It looks like we missed it. Shall we stay and watch the other planes?"
But Charlie shook his head. He wanted to go home.
At home, Mum and Dad sang softly together. Charlie wanted to join them, but he was still too upset. That night, he tucked his favourite toy plane under his arm and sang to himself until he felt better.
