Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty scarf that her grandma gave her. The scarf was pink and soft. Lily loved to wear it when it was cold outside.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy. She saw a merry-go-round and wanted to ride it. Her mommy helped her get on and the ride started to spin. Lily felt so happy and lively as the wind blew in her face.
As the ride slowed down, Lily noticed her scarf had come loose. She held onto it tightly so it wouldn't fly away. When the ride stopped, she was so happy to still have her pretty pink scarf. From that day on, Lily made sure to always tie her scarf tightly when she went on fun rides.
