Once upon a time, there was a pretty princess named Lily. She had a shiny case to keep her jewels in. One day, a sneaky thief came and tried to steal her case. 
"Oh no! Someone is trying to steal my pretty case!" cried Lily.
"Don't worry, Princess Lily. I will help you catch the thief," said the brave knight.
The knight chased the thief and caught him. He returned the pretty case to Princess Lily and she was very happy. "Thank you for saving my case, brave knight!" exclaimed Lily.
"You're welcome, Princess Lily. I will always protect you and your pretty things," replied the knight.
