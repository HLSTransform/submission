Once upon a time, there was a shy girl. She loved to wear her favourite hat wherever she went. One day, she decided to try something new. She looked up at the sky and spread her arms wide. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, then she started to fly! 
The girl and her hat floated higher and higher into the sky. She twirled and twirled, feeling the wind blow her hair and clothes. She was so happy!
As the girl flew higher and higher, she noticed something strange. There were lots of other people flying with her!
The girl smiled. She had discovered a secret flying club! Everyone was very friendly, and the girl soon felt right at home.
The girl and all the other flyers flew around the world, all day long. She would never forget this magical day. Even when she was grown up, she would still remember the time she flew around with her favourite hat.
