Once upon a time, there were two friends who liked to celebrate. Jimmy and Jane loved a good party with lots of music and friends. Every day, they marked the end of their fun with a dance around the garden.
One day, Jimmy said to Jane “Let’s make our party special. Let’s have a long and big celebration.”
Jane was excited. She said to Jimmy “Yes! Let’s invite lots of friends and have a really big celebration.”
The friends planned the party and invited lots of their friends. Everyone had a great time dancing and singing.
At the end of the party, Jimmy and Jane sat around the garden and thanked their friends. They then said “That was a long and happy celebration. We showed everyone how much we love them and how to celebrate.”
Jimmy and Jane realised they had taught their friends an important lesson: that it’s important to celebrate and be thankful for the good times.  They had shown everyone how to spread love and joy with a long and happy celebration.
