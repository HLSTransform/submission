Once upon a time there were two friends, Bobby and Sally. They liked to play together. One day, Bobby and Sally were having a pretend race. Sally was very excited and ran as fast as she could. But Bobby tripped and fell! Sally won the race and got a trophy.
Bobby was sad that he didn't win the trophy. Despite this, Sally wanted to be a kind friend and said, "It's alright! Let's both have the trophy!" Bobby smiled and was so happy that Sally was being generous.
The next day, Bobby bought a trophy for Sally. It was a fake trophy, but Sally was still happy because it was from her friend. Bobby said to Sally, "I'm sorry for tripping and falling in the race. Can you forgive me?" Sally smiled and said, "Yes, I forgive you!" 
The two friends hugged, and then continued playing together.
