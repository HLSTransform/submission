Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs. They found a big mushroom that was brown and white. It looked yummy.
"Can we eat it?" Lily asked.
Tom shook his head. "No, no, no. Mommy said some mushrooms are bad. They can make you sick."
Lily pouted. "But it looks so good. I want to try it."
She reached for the mushroom, but Tom grabbed her hand. "No, Lily, don't!"
Suddenly, they heard a loud roar. They turned around and saw a big, ugly dog. It had sharp teeth and angry eyes. It was running towards them.
"Help!" Tom and Lily screamed. They dropped the mushroom and ran to the house. They were very scared.
The dog chased them, barking and growling. It wanted the mushroom. It thought it was a toy.
Tom and Lily reached the door and banged on it. "Mommy, mommy, open the door!"
Mommy heard them and opened the door. She saw the dog and panicked. She grabbed Tom and Lily and pulled them inside. She slammed the door and locked it.
"Are you okay, my babies?" Mommy asked, hugging them.
"Yes, mommy, we're okay," Tom and Lily said, sobbing.
"What happened? Why was that dog after you?" Mommy asked.
Tom and Lily told her about the mushroom. They said they were sorry for trying to eat it.
Mommy sighed. "It's okay, my babies. I'm glad you're safe. But you have to listen to me. Some mushrooms are bad. And some dogs are mean. You have to be careful in the garden."
Tom and Lily nodded. They learned their lesson. They hugged Mommy and said they loved her.
Mommy smiled. She loved them too. She gave them some cookies and milk. They forgot about the mushroom and the dog. They were happy.
