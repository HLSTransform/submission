Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tom. Tom loved the snow! He saw snow outside his window and he got so excited. He quickly put on his warm coat, hat, and mittens and ran outside. The snow was so yummy, so he put some in his mouth and it was so cold! Tom was having so much fun when he saw something shining in the snow. He pointed to it and saw that it was a toy car! He put the car in his pocket and ran inside. He showed everyone the car and everyone said it was so cool. Later on, Tom and his family went to the kitchen and had a special yummy treat - snow ice cream! It was full of yummy flavours and everyone enjoyed it so much. The snow was the best treat yet!
