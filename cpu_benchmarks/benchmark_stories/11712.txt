Once upon a time, there was a crazy bear. The bear loved to snap his own skull. Every day he would snap his skull so loudly the neighbours would complain. 
One day, a little fox heard the noise and decided to find out what was going on. When he got there, he saw the crazy bear and noticed he was snapping his skull. He asked the bear why he was doing this, but the bear just kept snapping his skull. 
The little fox didn't know what to do. He was scared of the bear and wanted to get away, but he knew he had to help the bear. He came up with an idea and offered to show the bear how to snap his skull quieter.
The bear was sceptical at first, but the little fox taught him how to snap his skull with less noise. The bear was amazed and grateful and they became friends. From then on, they would snap their skulls together every day without bothering their neighbours.
