Bob was walking through a thick forest when he heard something. It was a loud scream! He was scared, so he ran towards the noise. As he got closer, he saw something large and shiny. It was a motorcycle! Bob was so excited that he wanted to ride the motorcycle. He screamed out loud in delight and hopped onto the big seat. Bob started to ride away, feeling strong and brave. 
The motorcycle was fast and Bob felt like he was flying through the air. He screamed in happiness and when he finally stopped, he was very far from where he started. He was so proud of himself for riding the motorcycle. Then he got off of the motorcycle and looked for his way back home.
