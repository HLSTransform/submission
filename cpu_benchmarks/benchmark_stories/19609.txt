One day, Daisy was in the garden playing with her doll. She was having lots of fun. Suddenly, she started to sneeze. Daisy was so confused. She rubbed her nose and looked around.
Suddenly, Daisy heard a noise. It sounded like a reef. She jumped forward and looked around. She saw a big reef in front of her. Daisy was even more confused. She had never seen a reef before.
Daisy then heard a music. She looked up and saw a bird singing on a tree. Daisy clapped her hands because she liked the song very much.
Then Daisy started to feel better. She wasn't sneezing anymore. Suddenly, she saw a butterfly on the reef. She thought it was beautiful. Daisy was no longer confused. She laughed and started to play with the butterfly again.
