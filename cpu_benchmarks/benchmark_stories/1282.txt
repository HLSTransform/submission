Once upon a time, there was a polite bear who lived in the woods. One day, the bear decided to invite some of his friends for a special picnic. He said he would meet them by the stream. 
When the bear arrived at the stream, all his friends were already there. They had brought lots of delicious food and drinks for the picnic. 
The bear was very happy to see his friends and thanked them for coming. They had a wonderful time at the picnic, chatting and playing games, while the stream quietly babbled away in the background. 
At the end of the picnic, the bear thanked everyone for being so polite and enjoy the day together. Then, they said goodbye and went home. The bear was already looking forward to inviting his friends to his next picnic.
