Once upon a time, in a deep, deep forest, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to play with her toy iron. One day, she took her toy iron and went to the forest to play.
As she played, she heard a loud scream. Lucy was scared, but she wanted to help. She picked up her toy iron and followed the sound of the scream.
She found a small bird stuck in a hole. The bird was very scared and screamed again. Lucy used her toy iron to help the bird get out of the hole. The bird was so happy and flew away. Lucy felt good for helping the bird and went back home with her toy iron.
