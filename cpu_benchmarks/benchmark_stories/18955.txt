One day, a little girl named Mia went for a walk with her mom. They saw a lot of cars and trucks. They were in traffic. The cars made a lot of noise. Mia felt scared and began to cry.
Mia's mom said, "Don't cry, Mia. It's just traffic. The cars are lively because they want to go places."
Mia stopped crying and looked at the cars. They were lively, just like her mom said. She saw a red car, a blue truck, and a yellow bus.
Mia and her mom walked past the traffic. They went to a park. Mia played with other kids. She was happy and didn't cry anymore.
When it was time to go home, they walked by the traffic again. Mia didn't cry this time. She knew the cars were just lively. She held her mom's hand and smiled.
