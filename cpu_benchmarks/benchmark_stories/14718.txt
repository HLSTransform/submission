Once there was a small girl with long, brown hair. She was very stubborn and often wanted things her way. One day she wanted to go outside, but her mom said it was too dark. She started to pout and stomp her feet.
Her mom then said they could turn on the light. The small girl looked around and saw a switch next to her. She wanted to turn it on, but she was too small to reach it. She kept on staring at the switch, hoping it would turn itself on.
Her mom saw that the girl was being stubborn and offered to help. She stood on a chair and slowly flipped the switch on. The room lit up and the small girl was happy.
She smiled at her mom and then started to explore the room. Now that the light was on, she could stay up a bit longer and play with her toys.
