James and his mom were walking to the park one day. James saw a beautiful raven flying in the sky. He asked his mom, ‘what is that?’ She said it was a raven. He asked what a raven was. Mom said, “A raven is a big, black bird.”
James wanted to see the raven, so his mom and him ran to the park. But, when they arrived, the raven was gone. James asked where the raven went and his mom said, “It was an unknown bird, so we won’t know where it went.”
James and his mom sat in the park, looking for the raven. They waited for a long time, but the raven never came back. Eventually, it was time to go home and the raven had not returned. James asked what happened to the bird and his mom answered, “We may never know. This is the end of the raven.” 
James was sad because his mom said the raven was gone. He told his mom, “I wish I could have found the raven.” His mom replied, "Me too, James. Me too."
