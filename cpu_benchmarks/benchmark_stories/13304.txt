Once upon a time, there was a tall boy named Tim. Tim lived on a ranch with his mom and dad. They had many animals on the ranch like cows, horses, and chickens.
One day, while Tim was playing, he saw a big horse. Tim wanted to ride the horse, so he rushed to it. But his dad said, "No, Tim! That horse is not nice. You can't ride it."
Tim didn't listen to his dad. When his dad went away, Tim went to the horse again. He tried to ride it, but the horse didn't like it. The horse ran very fast, and Tim fell off. Tim was hurt and sad. He should have listened to his dad.
