Once upon a time, there was a worried knob named Sarah. Sarah lived on top of a tall hill and wanted to explore the world. She asked her parents if she could go, but they didn't want her to go alone. They told her she could go if a family member or friend could support her.
So Sarah asked her little cousin, Timmy, to come along with her. Timmy was excited to join her on her adventure. They set off together and climbed the tall hill. Timmy held Sarah's hand and supported her as they went.
Then they reached the top of the hill and Sarah was amazed. She looked at how the world looked from the top of the hill. Timmy smiled, seeing how happy Sarah was. Together the two carefully made their way down the hill, with Timmy still supporting Sarah.
Once they reached the bottom, Sarah looked up at the hill and said: "Thanks for supporting me Timmy. Let's do it again tomorrow".
