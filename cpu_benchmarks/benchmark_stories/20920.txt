Once there was a girl. She had a special dress that she loved to wear. She was so excited to put it on, but she found it was very hard. The girl looked around and saw a strawberry hanging on the nearby bush. She thought it would be the perfect solution to make her dress softer. 
She picked the strawberry and gently placed it inside her dress. It fit perfectly. 
Finally the girl was able to put her dress on with ease and she felt very special. She twirled around the garden and felt like the most beautiful girl there. 
The strawberry not only made her dress much softer, but it also added an extra layer of unique sweetness to her look. She was so glad she had found the strawberry, because otherwise she would have never been able to wear her beautiful dress.
