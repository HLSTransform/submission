Tim had a teddy bear that he loved. He would hug it often and his teddy felt warm and heavy in his arms. One day, Tim's teddy got sick and he knew there was nothing he could do. His heart felt guilty for not being able to help him.
Tim went to his mom and asked her if there was anything they could do to help his teddy. His mom smiled and said they could try giving the bear a hug. Tim went back to his room and carefully wrapped his arms around his teddy bear.
The hug seemed to work, as soon Tim felt the teddy bear's weight slowly getting lighter. After a few more hugs, the bear was back to his normal self. Tim was so happy that he hugged his teddy bear even tighter and vowed not to forget to hug him most days.
