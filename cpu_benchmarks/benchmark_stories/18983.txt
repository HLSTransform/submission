Once upon a time, in a big park, there was a hidden play area. Many kids did not know about it. But one day, a little girl named Lily found it.
Lily loved to play there. She would swing, slide, and run all day. She made new friends, too. They would all play together and have so much fun.
One day, it was time for the play to end. Lily and her friends were sad. But they knew they could come back to the hidden play area another day. They said goodbye and went home with big smiles on their faces.
