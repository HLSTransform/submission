Tom is a big cat who likes to chase mice. He thinks mice are fun to play with and tasty to eat. One day, he sees a small mouse hiding under a chair. He runs to catch it, but the mouse is very fast and smart. It runs into a hole in the wall.
"Come out, little mouse!" Tom says. "I want to play with you!"
The mouse is very scared. It thinks Tom is mean and wants to hurt it. It stays in the hole and does not answer. It feels helpless and alone.
"Please, leave me alone!" the mouse says in a small voice. "I do not want to play with you!"
Tom is curious. He hears the mouse talking. He thinks the mouse is funny and cute. He does not want to eat it anymore. He wants to be its friend.
"I am sorry, little mouse," Tom says. "I did not mean to scare you. I just wanted to have some fun. Can we be friends?"
The mouse is surprised. It does not trust Tom. It thinks Tom is lying and wants to trick it. It does not want to be friends with a cat.
"No, we cannot be friends," the mouse says. "You are a cat and I am a mouse. Cats and mice are enemies. You should go away and leave me alone."
Tom is sad. He does not understand why the mouse does not like him. He thinks cats and mice can be friends. He does not want to go away. He wants to talk to the mouse and make it happy.
"Please, little mouse," Tom says. "Do not be afraid of me. I am not your enemy. I am your friend. I will not hurt you or eat you. I will protect you and share with you. Please, come out and talk to me."
The mouse is curious. It hears Tom talking. It thinks Tom is different from other cats. It wonders if Tom is telling the truth. It wants to have a friend. It feels lonely and bored.
"Are you really my friend?" the mouse asks. "Will you really not hurt me or eat me?"
"I promise, little mouse," Tom says. "I am really your friend. I will really not hurt you or eat you. Come out and see for yourself."
The mouse is brave. It decides to trust Tom. It comes out of the hole and sees Tom. Tom is big and furry and has sharp teeth and claws. But he also has kind eyes and a gentle smile. He does not look mean or hungry. He looks friendly and happy.
"Hello, little mouse," Tom says. "I am glad you came out. What is your name?"
"Hello, big cat," the mouse says. "I am sorry I was rude to you. My name is Max."
"Hello, Max," Tom says. "I am Tom. I am happy to meet you. Do you want to be my friend?"
"Yes, Tom," Max says. "I want to be your friend. Thank you for being nice to me."
Tom and Max smile at each other. They forget that they are cat and mouse. They remember that they are friends. They start to talk and play and have fun. They are not helpless or alone anymore. They are happy and together.
