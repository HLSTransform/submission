Once upon a time, there was a big purse. Inside it were some very special things. Every day, the little girl would put her favourite toys and her secret treasures in it.
One day, she wanted to put even more things in the big purse, but it was too full! She thought and thought about what to do and finally, she had an idea.
She ran to the store to buy a bigger purse. When she opened the new purse, it was even bigger than the old one. She was so excited! She could fit so much more in it.
So she went on an adventure. She put lots of fun things in her big purse and took it everywhere with her. Even when she was at school, she carried the big purse with her! She had so many adventures, and the big purse kept all her secrets safe.
