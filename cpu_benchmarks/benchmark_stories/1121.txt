One day, Tom was riding on his bike. He had big pedals and he was happy to try to make himself go faster. He had his eyes on the big hill in the distance, and he was determined to make it to the top.
Tom pushed down on the pedal with all his might, and the bike moved faster and faster. Then he zoomed up the hill, and made it to the top! He was so successful!
As he was coming back down the hill, he kicked his feet up in the air and made a silly sound. He was so excited and happy. He had made it to the top of the hill and it felt so good!
Tom was so happy with himself. He was proud of what he had achieved, and he vowed to try it again. He was sure the next time he would be even more successful!
