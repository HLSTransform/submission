Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat candy. One day, Lily went to visit her aunt who was very rich. Her aunt had a big house with lots of toys and candy.
Lily said, "Wow! You have so many toys and candy. I believe you are very rich!" Her aunt smiled and said, "Yes, I am very rich. But I also believe that sharing is important. Would you like to play with some of my toys?"
Lily was very happy and said, "Yes, please!" She played with her aunt's toys and they had a fun time together. Before she left, Lily said, "Thank you for letting me play with your toys. I believe you are the best aunt ever!" Her aunt hugged her and said, "I believe you are the sweetest little girl ever!"
