Anna and Ben were playing in the snow. They made a big snowman with a pine cone for a nose and a scarf for a neck. They were very happy.
But then a mean boy came and kicked their snowman. He broke the pine cone and the scarf. He laughed and ran away.
Anna and Ben were very sad and angry. They wanted to make the mean boy sorry.
They saw the mean boy hiding behind a pine tree. They made some snowballs and threw them at him. The snowballs hit him hard and made him cold and wet.
"Ow! Stop it! You are mean!" the mean boy shouted.
"No, you are mean! You broke our snowman!" Anna shouted back.
"Shut up! Go away!" the mean boy said.
"No, you shut up! You go away!" Ben said.
They kept throwing snowballs and shouting until their mom came and saw them.
"What are you doing? Why are you fighting?" mom asked.
She made them stop and come inside. She gave them some hot chocolate and cookies. She told them to be nice and share.
The hot chocolate was sweet and warm. The cookies were soft and yummy. Anna and Ben felt better.
But the mean boy was still outside. He had no hot chocolate or cookies. He had no friends or mom. He was cold and hungry and lonely. He felt bitter.
