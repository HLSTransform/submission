Once upon a time, there was a reindeer who was very big. She had a special secret. She could part the sky! Every evening she would go up to the sky, and part big chunks of the clouds. 
The reindeer was special, and soon the other reindeer wanted her secret. But she wouldn't tell. She kept it a secret. 
The reindeer liked to part the sky and watch the stars twinkle. She liked the way the moon shone down on her, and she liked that she had a special secret. 
So every single night, the big reindeer would go up to the sky and part the clouds. And she enjoyed keeping it a secret.
