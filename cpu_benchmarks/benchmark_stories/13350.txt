Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go on adventures with his mommy and daddy. One day, they went on a hike in the forest. Timmy's mommy had a map to help them find their way.
As they were walking, Timmy stumbled over a big rock and fell down. But he got back up and kept walking. Suddenly, they saw a dead tree with no leaves. Timmy thought it looked spooky, but his mommy said it was just nature.
Finally, after walking for a long time, they found a beautiful waterfall. Timmy was so happy and they had a picnic by the water. They used the map to find their way back home and Timmy fell asleep in the car, dreaming of their next adventure. The end.
