Once upon a time, there was a zebra who liked to walk around the forest. One day, the zebra saw a weird animal that looked like a big, scary monster. The zebra got scared and started to run away. 
As the zebra ran through the forest, it saw other animals like birds and squirrels. The zebra asked them if they had seen the weird animal, but they had not. The zebra kept walking and looking for a safe place to hide. 
Finally, the zebra found a cave and went inside. It was dark and scary, but the zebra felt safe. Suddenly, the weird animal appeared at the entrance of the cave. The zebra was very scared, but it remembered that it had strong legs and could run fast. So, the zebra ran out of the cave and away from the weird animal. 
After a while, the zebra realized that the weird animal was not chasing it anymore. The zebra felt relieved and continued to walk around the forest, enjoying the beautiful scenery and the company of its animal friends.
