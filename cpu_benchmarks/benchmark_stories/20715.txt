Once upon a time, there lived a big ugly fish in a deep blue pond. One day, he saw a jar of ink and he was very curious. He swam over to the jar and splashed it with his tail. The jar broke, and the ink splashed into the pond.
 
The fish laughed and laughed as the ink flew all around. The ink was everywhere in the pond, so he quickly dashed away. But unfortunately, the ink had made the pond very dark and ugly!
 
The fish was sad and he was worried. He didn't know what to do. Then suddenly, he saw a little butterfly fluttering around the pond. He asked the butterfly for help. The butterfly told him he could help make the water sparkle again.
So the butterfly waved her wings and the ink started to disappear. Soon, the pond was sparkly and clean again. The fish was so happy and he thanked the butterfly for helping him. From then on, he was always careful whenever he saw ink nearby!
