Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy car that was very popular with his friends. One day, Timmy's friend Billy asked to borrow the car. Timmy said yes, but he was worried Billy might break it.
So Timmy tied a string around the car and put it in a bin to keep it safe. When Billy came to play, Timmy showed him the car in the bin. Billy was sad he couldn't play with it, but Timmy explained that he didn't want it to get hurt. Billy understood and they played with other toys instead.
Later, Timmy felt happy that he made a good choice to keep his toy safe. He learned that it's important to take care of things that are special to us. The end.
