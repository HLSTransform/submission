Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the gym with her mommy every day. One day, Lily saw her friend Sarah playing with a big toy. She got jealous and wanted to play with it too. But Sarah didn't want to share.
Lily asked, "Can I play with it too, please?"
Sarah said, "No, it's mine!"
Lily got angry and tried to take the toy away. But the toy snapped and broke into pieces. Sarah started crying and Lily felt bad. She said sorry but it was too late. Sarah didn't want to be friends anymore.
Lily learned that it's not nice to be jealous and take things that don't belong to her. She felt sad and wished she could make things right with Sarah.
