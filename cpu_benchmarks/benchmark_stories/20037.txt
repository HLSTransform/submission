Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play outside. They had an aunt who was adventurous. She liked to travel and see new things. Sometimes she sent them postcards from far away places.
One day, their aunt came to visit them. She brought them a big suitcase full of gifts. She said, "I have something for each of you. But you have to guess what it is."
Lily and Ben were excited. They opened the suitcase and saw many things. There were books, toys, clothes, and more. They started to grab and pull the things they liked.
"Stop!" their aunt said. "You have to share and take turns. And you have to be careful. Some of these things are fragile or special. They are not for playing. They are for learning and remembering."
Lily and Ben did not listen. They wanted to have everything. They did not care about the other things. They did not care about their aunt. They fought and argued and made a mess.
Their aunt was sad and angry. She said, "You are being selfish and rude. You do not appreciate what I brought you. You do not respect me or my stories. You are not ready for these gifts. You have to learn to be grateful and curious and kind."
She took the suitcase and closed it. She said, "I will keep these gifts until you grow up. Maybe then you will understand their value. Maybe then you will want to be adventurous like me."
She left the room and went to talk to their mom. Lily and Ben remained in the room. They looked at each other and felt ashamed. They realized they had made a mistake. They wished they had listened to their aunt. They wished they had asked her about the things and the places. They wished they had been more adventurous.
Moral: Be grateful for what you have and curious about what you don't. Respect and learn from others who are different from you. Be adventurous and open-minded.
