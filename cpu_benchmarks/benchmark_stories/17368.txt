Lily and Max were playing in the garden. They had a toy car that they liked to drive around. But the car was old and broken. One of the wheels was missing and the door was loose.
"Can we repair the car, Lily?" Max asked.
"I don't know, Max. We need a new wheel and some glue," Lily said.
They looked around the garden for something to fix the car. They saw a bottle cap, a stick, and some flowers. They decided to use them as parts.
They put the bottle cap on the axle where the wheel was gone. They used the stick to hold the door in place. They decorated the car with the flowers. They were very proud of their work.
"Look, Max, we repaired the car!" Lily exclaimed.
"It looks beautiful, Lily!" Max agreed.
They drove the car around the garden again. They were having fun. Then they saw something in the sky. It was a rainbow. It had many colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
"Wow, Lily, look at the rainbow!" Max pointed.
"It's so beautiful, Max!" Lily said.
They stopped the car and looked at the rainbow. They smiled. They felt happy. They liked the rainbow and their car. They were good friends.
