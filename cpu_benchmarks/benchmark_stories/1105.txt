Once upon a time, there was a famous pistol. It was big and shiny, and all the other pistols in the world were jealous. One day, a nice man called Tom saw the pistol and thought, "I need to wrap this pistol up so it is kept safe." So Tom took some nice, sparkly paper and he wrapped the pistol all up. He tied it with a big, pretty bow and put it under a tree. 
When Tom opened the box to show the pistol, everyone was astonished. It was so beautiful! People clapped and cheered for the famous pistol and wanted to take a look. Tom smiled and was very proud of the pistol. 
The pistol was so happy to be looked after and wrapped so nicely. From that day on, the famous pistol lived happily ever after.
