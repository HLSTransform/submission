Mom and Dad took Katy to the park. Katy saw a big field with lots of trees. She saw many kids playing and running around. She also saw some pretty kites in the sky.
Katy wanted a kite too. So Mom and Dad helped her choose one. There were so many to choose from! But Katy chose a beautiful kite with colorful stripes.
Mom showed Katy how to use the kite. She ran with the kite and it flew up in the sky. The breeze pushed the kite further and further. Katy laughed and smiled, she was so happy!
Katy kept using her kite and soon she learned how to make it soar. She flew her kite high in the sky and it was so much fun! She could tell that it was a very useful toy.
