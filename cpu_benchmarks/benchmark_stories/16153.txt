Once upon a time, there was a small, adorable puppy called Bobo. One day, Bobo was out walking in the park when he saw a pretty bow on the ground. He decided to go up to it and meet it.
Bobo asked, “Hi there, what’s your name?”
The bow answered, “My name is Rainbow!” 
Bobo was so excited to meet the bow. He said, “Oh, hi Rainbow. It’s nice to meet you! You’re very adorable!” 
Rainbow smiled and said, “It’s nice to meet you too, Bobo. Let’s be friends!” 
Bobo and Rainbow became best friends from then on. They played together every day like super close friends do. They had lots of fun together and Bobo was so happy to have met the beautiful, adorable Rainbow.
