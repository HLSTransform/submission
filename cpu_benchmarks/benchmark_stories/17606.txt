Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her toys. One day, she saw an enormous yacht in the lake. She ran to her mommy and screamed, "Mommy, look at the big boat!" 
Her mommy said, "Yes, that's a yacht. It's very big and expensive." 
Lily asked, "Can we go on the yacht, mommy?" 
Her mommy replied, "No, sweetie. We can't go on the yacht. It's not ours." 
Lily felt sad, but her mommy hugged her and said, "We can still have fun playing with our toys." And they went back to playing together.
