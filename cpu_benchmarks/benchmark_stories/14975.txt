Once upon a time, there was a boy called Jack. He was three years old and he loved playing with his toys. One day, Jack was playing in his bedroom when his mom called him to come to the living room. When Jack came to the living room, he saw a new TV. It was huge and fit perfectly on the wall.
Jack was so excited that he couldn't believe his eyes. 
"Mom, is this new TV for us?" he asked.
His mom smiled and said "Yes, this one is for us. You can watch your favorite cartoons on it." 
Jack was so happy that he ran to the TV and hugged it. He just wanted to keep playing with it. 
His mom said, "Come on Jack, let's put some cartoons on for you to watch."
Jack was so excited that he couldn't stop jumping. He watched his cartoons and played some games on the TV. He was having so much fun. 
When it was time for dinner, Jack said "Mom, this TV is fit for me!"
