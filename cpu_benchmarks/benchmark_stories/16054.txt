Once there was a baby elephant. He was very excited for his birthday. On his birthday, he found a heavy envelope on the ground. He couldn't wait to open it and see what was inside!
He couldn't wait to open it. He ripped it open and found a big rock inside. He was so disappointed! He wanted something special, but all he got was a heavy rock.
He was so disappointed he started to cry. His mom came over and saw what happened. She said, "It's okay baby elephant. Even if it's not what you wanted, this rock is special." 
But it was too late. The baby elephant was too sad to listen. He went off alone and stayed away from home. He was so sad, it was very heavy in his heart.
