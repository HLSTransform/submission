Once upon a time there was a colorful plastic duck. Every day, the duck would go for a swim in the puddle. But each time it got out, it would be all slimy and covered in mud.
One day, the duck's mother saw all the mud and knew it was time to give the duck a wash. She filled up the bath and put in some bubbles. Then she put the duck in the bath water and began to scrub it with a sponge.
The duck felt scared but it also felt good to be in the warm, soapy water. Soon it began to feel squeaky clean and its yellow and orange colors shone brightly again.
The duck's mother took it out of the bath and dried it off with a towel. The duck felt so much better and happy to be clean again!
