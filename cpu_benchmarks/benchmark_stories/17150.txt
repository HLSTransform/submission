Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went to play outside in the snow. But it was very cold outside and Lily didn't have her coat on. She started to shiver and her teeth chattered.
Suddenly, she heard a noise. It was her friend, Max the dog! Max had come to rescue her from the cold. He brought her coat and helped her put it on. Lily was very happy and hugged Max.
After Lily was warm again, she saw a human who was stuck in the snow. Max and Lily ran over to help the human. They pulled and tugged until the human was free. The human was very grateful and thanked them for rescuing him. From then on, Lily and Max were known as the heroes of the neighborhood.
