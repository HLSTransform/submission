There was a figure in the window. It was tall and dark and it made Alexis shiver. She looked out of her window and saw it there. She tried to run away but the figure was too fast. 
Alexis couldn't believe her eyes. She wanted to scream but she couldn't. The figure was coming closer and the feeling of fear was all around her. 
The figure stepped closer and Alexis could smell something smelly. The figure was close enough now that she could see it was a scary witch. Alexis screamed and ran away as fast as she could. 
She ran to her room and closed the door. Now she was safe from the smelly witch. Finally, all the shivering stopped and Alexis felt safe again.
