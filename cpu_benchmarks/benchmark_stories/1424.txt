Once there was a fine little girl named Sarah. She loved to look at her model of a boat. She adored it, and loved to run her hands along it. 
One day, Sarah wanted to take her model boat outside and play with it. She asked her mom if she could, and her mom said yes.
So Sarah went outside with her model boat, and suddenly she saw a big puddle of water! She went closer and saw that it was getting bigger and bigger by the second.
Sarah knew that if the boat got in the water it would get ruined! So she quickly reached down and grabbed it. She then looked around for something to dry it off. 
Suddenly she found a towel nearby. She picked it up, and started to dry her model boat. Finally, once she was done, Sarah brought the boat back inside and put it in a safe place. 
Now Sarah was very happy, because her model boat stayed safe, and it was nice and dry!
