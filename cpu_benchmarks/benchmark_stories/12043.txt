Once upon a time, there was a little puppy named Max. Max loved to play outside and chase after butterflies. One day, Max got lost in the woods and couldn't find his way back home. He was very scared and didn't know what to do. 
Suddenly, Max saw a friendly veterinarian walking by. The veterinarian saw that Max was lost and took him to her lively animal hospital. She gave him some food and water and checked him over to make sure he was okay. 
But then something strange happened. Max started to shrink! He was getting smaller and smaller until he was the size of a tiny mouse. The veterinarian was surprised but knew just what to do. She gave Max some special medicine and he started to grow back to his normal size. 
After that, Max was so happy to be back to his regular size and he thanked the veterinarian for helping him. He never forgot how kind she was and always wagged his tail whenever he saw her. From then on, Max made sure to never get lost again.
