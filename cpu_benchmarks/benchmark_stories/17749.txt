Molly and Sarah were best friends. They loved to play together. One day, Molly showed Sarah the bright sunshine outside. It was a beautiful day. The sunshine looked pink in the sky.
The girls held hands and ran in the sunshine. Molly laughed and made Sarah laugh too. They played tag and danced in the sunshine.
Molly and Sarah collected some flowers from the garden. They were pretty and pink. Molly gave a flower to Sarah and Sarah gave one to Molly.
Before it was time for lunch, Molly taught Sarah how to make a wish. Molly showed Sarah that she had to close her eyes and think of something special that she wanted. Sarah closed her eyes and wished for more days like this.
Molly and Sarah ran back inside. They laughed and gave each other big hugs. They had had so much fun in the sunshine.
