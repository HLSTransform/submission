Once upon a time, there was a bald dad and his beautiful daughter. Everyday, they went on walks together.
One day, the dad told his daughter that if he closed his eyes and wished, he would receive a special surprise. The daughter was excited and joined her dad with her eyes closed. Breathlessly, the dad asked, "What do you wish for?"
The daughter smiled and replied, "A puppy!"
The dad smiled and opened his eyes, and when he looked down, there was indeed a puppy coming up to the daughter. "You can receive your puppy now," the dad said.
The daughter and the puppy hugged each other and the dad was delighted. From then on, they went on their morning walks together as a happy bald dad, a beautiful daughter and a playful pup.
