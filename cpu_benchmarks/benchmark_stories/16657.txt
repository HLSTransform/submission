Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cord for her favorite toy, a teddy bear. One day, Lily noticed that the cord didn't fit well on the teddy bear anymore. She tried to pull it, but it was too tight.
Lily's mommy saw her struggling and asked what was wrong. Lily showed her the cord and said, "It doesn't fit, mommy." Her mommy smiled and said, "Don't worry, we'll fix it together."
They worked on the cord and soon it was amazing! It fit perfectly on the teddy bear again. Lily was so happy and hugged her teddy bear tightly. She knew that her mommy could fix anything. The end.
