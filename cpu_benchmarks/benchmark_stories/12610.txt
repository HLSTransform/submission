One day, a little girl named Lily went outside to play. It had rained a lot, and there was a big puddle in the yard. Lily loved jumping in puddles, so she ran over to it. But then she saw a frog sitting in the puddle! Lily was scared of frogs, so she was very fearful. 
Just then, Lily's friend Emily came over. Emily was very brave and not fearful at all. She saw the frog in the puddle and said, "Hello, Mr. Frog! How are you today?" The frog didn't speak, but he looked at Emily and Lily with his big eyes. 
Lily saw that Emily wasn't scared of the frog, so she decided to be brave too. She took a deep breath and said, "Hello, Mr. Frog. I'm Lily. Nice to meet you." The frog still didn't speak, but Lily felt proud of herself for being brave enough to speak to him. Emily and Lily played with the frog in the puddle for a while, and Lily wasn't scared anymore.
