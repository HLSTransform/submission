Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to look up at the stars and wonder about the planet she saw up there. One day, she asked her friend Timmy if he had ever been to the planet.
Timmy shook his head and said, "No, I haven't been there. But I promise one day we will go together."
Lily was so happy to hear that and she smiled from ear to ear. But then, another friend named Sarah came over and saw how happy Lily was. Sarah felt envious and wanted to go to the planet too.
"I want to go to the planet too!" Sarah said.
Lily felt sad because she didn't want to leave Sarah out, but she had promised Timmy they would go together. They all talked and worked it out, and in the end, they all went to the planet together and had a great adventure.
