Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was three years old and her name was Sally. One day, Sally saw a lady at the park. She had lots of toys and she asked Sally if she wanted to play with them. 
At first, Sally said 'Yes, please!' but suddenly she changed her mind. She thought the toys looked fake and she didn't want to play with them. So she refused the lady. 
The lady was very sad and asked Sally why she said 'No'. Sally said she didn't like fake toys.
The lady smiled and said that she understood. She gave Sally a big hug and said 'Thankyou for being honest and refusing the toys'. Then she said goodbye and left the park. 
Sally was happy that she stayed true to herself and refused the fake toys. She went home and played with her real toys instead. The end!
