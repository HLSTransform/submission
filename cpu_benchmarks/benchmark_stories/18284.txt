Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the jungle with her mommy and daddy. One day, they saw an ugly monkey swinging from tree to tree.
Lily said, "Mommy, that monkey is ugly!"
Her mommy replied, "Lily, we should not call anyone ugly. Everyone is special in their own way."
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I know, let's add some bananas to the monkey's home. Maybe he will be happy and not feel so ugly."
So, they added some bananas to the monkey's home and he was very happy. The monkey even gave them a big smile and said, "Thank you so much for being kind to me." From that day on, Lily learned that adding kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.
