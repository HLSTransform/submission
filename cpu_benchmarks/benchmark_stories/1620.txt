Sara likes to play in the garden. She likes to look at the flowers and the bugs. One day, she sees a big spider on a pink flower. The spider is making a cobweb. Sara thinks the cobweb is pretty. She wants to touch it.
She goes near the spider and the cobweb. She says hello to the spider. The spider does not say hello back. The spider is busy. Sara reaches out her hand to the cobweb. She wants to feel how soft it is.
But the spider does not like that. The spider thinks Sara is a bug. The spider wants to wrap Sara in the cobweb. The spider jumps on Sara's hand and starts to wrap it with silk. Sara feels something tickle her hand. She looks and sees the spider and the cobweb. She is scared.
She screams and shakes her hand. The spider and the cobweb fall off. Sara runs away from the flower. She runs to her mom. She tells her mom what happened. Her mom hugs her and says it is okay. She says the spider was not trying to hurt her. She says the spider was just protecting its home.
Sara feels better. She says sorry to the spider. She says she will not touch the cobweb again. She says she will look at it from far away. She says she will find another flower to play with. She says she likes pink flowers, but not spiders.
