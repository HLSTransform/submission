Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Susie. She smiled at all of the creatures she saw when she walked out of her house each day. One day, she saw an animal with a big, fierce face. It was a lion! The lion walked towards her and Susie was scared. 
The lion came close and said, “Don't be scared, Susie. I promise I won't hurt you.” Susie was surprised and stepped back. The lion laughed and handed her a big jar. He explained that he wanted her to have the jar as a gift.
The lion smiled and said, “This jar has magical powers. Whatever you wish for will come true, as long as you promise to use it wisely.” Susie was so excited! She hugged the lion tight and thanked him.
Since then, Susie has taken great care of the jar. Whenever she has a wish, she pulls out the jar and closes her eyes. She whispers her wish, before tightly closing the jar again and making a promise to use it wisely.
