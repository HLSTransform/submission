Anna and Ben like to play with crayons. They have many colors and they make marks on paper. Sometimes they make marks on the wall too, but Mommy does not like that. She says it is not polite to make marks on the wall.
One day, Anna and Ben are playing with crayons in their room. Anna wants to make a mark on the wall. She thinks it will be fun. She takes a red crayon and strikes the wall hard. She makes a big mark. She smiles and says, "Look, Ben! I made a mark on the wall!"
Ben sees the mark and he is scared. He knows Mommy will be angry. He says, "No, Anna! That is bad! Mommy will be mad! You should not make marks on the wall!"
Anna does not listen to Ben. She thinks he is silly. She says, "It is not bad. It is pretty. I like to make marks on the wall. You can make one too. Here, take a blue crayon and strike the wall."
Ben does not want to make a mark on the wall. He wants to be polite. He says, "No, thank you. I do not want to make a mark on the wall. I want to make marks on paper. That is polite. Mommy likes that."
Anna gets angry. She says, "You are no fun. You are boring. I do not want to play with you. Go away!"
Ben feels sad. He does not want to fight with Anna. He loves his sister. He says, "I am sorry, Anna. I do not want to go away. I want to play with you. But please do not make marks on the wall. Mommy will be sad. And we will be in trouble."
Anna thinks for a moment. She looks at the mark on the wall. She looks at Ben. She looks at the crayons. She says, "You are right, Ben. I am sorry too. I do not want to make Mommy sad. I do not want to be in trouble. I want to be polite. Let us make marks on paper. That is fun too."
Ben smiles. He says, "OK, Anna. Let us make marks on paper. We can make many colors and shapes. We can make a picture for Mommy. She will be happy."
Anna and Ben hug. They take their crayons and paper. They make marks on paper. They make a picture for Mommy. They are polite. They are happy.
