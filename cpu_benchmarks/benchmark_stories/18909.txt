Tim and Tom were brothers who liked to play with their toys. They had many toys, but their favorite ones were their spears. They made the spears from sticks and stones, and they pretended to be hunters and warriors.
One day, they decided to have a contest to see who could throw their spear the farthest. They went to the big field behind their house, and marked a line with a rock. They took turns to throw their spears, and measured how far they went with their steps.
Tim threw his spear first, and it flew very far. He counted 20 steps from the line to his spear. He was happy and proud. He said, "Look, Tom, I threw my spear 20 steps! Can you do better?"
Tom was competitive, and he wanted to win. He picked up his spear, and threw it with all his might. His spear flew even farther than Tim's. He counted 25 steps from the line to his spear. He was happy and proud. He said, "Look, Tim, I threw my spear 25 steps! I won!"
Tim was sad, and he felt like crying. He did not like to lose. He said, "No fair, Tom, your spear is bigger and heavier than mine. That's why you threw it farther."
Tom felt sorry for his brother, and he did not want to make him cry. He said, "Don't be sad, Tim, your spear is very good too. I admire how you made it from a stick and a stone. It is very sharp and strong. You are a good hunter and warrior."
Tim smiled, and he felt better. He said, "Thank you, Tom, you are very kind. I admire how you threw your spear so far. You are a good hunter and warrior too."
They hugged each other, and they decided to share their spears. They played together, and they had fun. They were brothers, and they loved each other.
