One day, a little girl wanted to paint. She went outside, and looked around. The grass was green, and the sky was blue. It was a mild day, so it was perfect for painting.
The little girl began to paint, and she used all the colors from her box of paints. Red, yellow, and blue. She painted on the grass, and she made a beautiful picture.
She painted flowers and birds, and she was very proud of her work. The sun was shining, so everything looked very bright.
When she was finished, she stood up and looked at her painting. She felt very happy, because she had made something beautiful. She knew she would always remember this mild day and the painting she made on the grass.
