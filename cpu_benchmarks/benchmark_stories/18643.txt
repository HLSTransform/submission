Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dream about princesses and unicorns. One day, Lily's mom asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up. Lily replied, "I want to go to university and be a princess!"
Her mom smiled and said, "That's a great dream, Lily. But first, you need to go to school and learn lots of things."
Lily didn't want to go to school. She thought it was disgusting to sit in a classroom all day. But her mom explained that school was important if she wanted to go to university and be a princess.
Lily sighed and said, "Okay, I'll go to school. But I still want to be a princess!"
