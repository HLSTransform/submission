Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play with their bikes. Tim has a red bike with two big pedals. Sam has a blue bike with three small pedals.
One day, they go to the park. They see many flowers and trees. They also see a big pile of leaves. Tim has an idea.
"Let's sort the leaves by color!" he says to Sam.
"OK, how do we do that?" Sam asks.
"We use our pedals to move the leaves. We make a pile of red leaves, a pile of yellow leaves, and a pile of brown leaves. Then we can jump in them!" Tim explains.
They start to sort the leaves with their pedals. They have fun moving the leaves around. They make three piles of different colors. They are proud of their work.
"Look, we sorted the leaves!" Tim says.
"Yes, we did! Now let's jump in them!" Sam says.
They park their bikes and run to the piles. They jump in the leaves and laugh. They hear a crunch and a crack. They look at their bikes. The pedals are broken.
"Oh no, our pedals!" Tim cries.
"Our pedals!" Sam echoes.
They are sad. They love their bikes. They don't know what to do.
A man walks by. He sees the boys and their bikes. He has a toolbox. He is a mechanic.
"Hello, boys. What happened to your pedals?" he asks.
"We were sorting the leaves with our pedals. And then they broke." Tim says.
"We are sorry. We didn't mean to break them." Sam says.
The man smiles. He is kind.
"Don't worry, boys. I can fix your pedals. It will only take a few minutes. You can help me if you want." he says.
"Really? You can fix them?" Tim asks.
"Yes, I can. And you can learn how to fix them too. Come, I'll show you." he says.
He opens his toolbox. He takes out some tools and some spare pedals. He shows the boys how to remove the broken pedals and replace them with the new ones. He lets the boys use the tools and help him. He teaches them the names of the tools and the parts of the bike.
"There, all done. Your pedals are good as new." he says.
"Wow, thank you, mister. You are very nice." Tim says.
"Thank you, thank you. You are very smart." Sam says.
The man smiles again. He is happy.
"You're welcome, boys. You are very brave and helpful. And you did a great job sorting the leaves. They look very pretty." he says.
He puts his tools back in his toolbox. He waves goodbye to the boys.
"Have fun with your bikes. And be careful with your pedals." he says.
He walks away.
Tim and Sam look at their bikes. They have new pedals. They are shiny and strong. They are happy.
They hug each other.
"We have new pedals!" Tim says.
"We have new pedals!" Sam says.
They get on their bikes. They ride around the park. They see the flowers and the trees. They see the piles of leaves. They smile.
They have new pedals. They have a new friend. They have a good day.
