Once upon a time, there was a giant who lived in a big forest. He was very lonely and sad because he had no friends to play with. One day, he saw a little girl walking in the forest. The giant approached the girl and asked, "Will you be my friend?"
The girl smiled and said, "Of course! My name is Lily. What is your name?"
The giant said, "My name is George. Thank you for being my friend."
Lily and George played together every day. One day, they found a beautiful flower in the forest. Lily said, "I want to print a picture of this flower so we can remember it forever." George was very compassionate and helped Lily take a picture of the flower.
But then, a mean witch appeared and took the flower away. Lily and George were very sad. They decided to work together to get the flower back. They went on an adventure and finally found the witch's house. They knocked on the door and asked for the flower back. The witch was surprised by their kindness and gave the flower back to them. Lily and George were very happy and hugged each other. From that day on, they knew they would always be best friends.
