Once upon a time, there was a very lucky bear. He had coal. He had a lot of coal. He kept it in a messy pile. He loved his coal. Every day he would look at it and smile.
But one day, something amazing happened. The coal didn't stay coal. It started to move and shake. The bear watched as the coal changed. Slowly, he saw it become something else.
The coal became diamonds! Bright and sparkly diamonds! They were the most beautiful diamonds the bear had ever seen.
The bear was so excited that he gathered up all the diamonds and made a big, shiny necklace. He was so proud of his necklace! Every day he would show it off to his friends and everyone was so happy.
The bear will never forget his coal and how it became something very special and very beautiful.
