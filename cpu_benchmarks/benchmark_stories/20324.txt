Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big puddle near the swings. They wanted to splash in it.
"Let's go to the puddle!" Lily said.
"OK!" Ben said.
They ran to the puddle and jumped in. The water was cold and wet. They laughed and kicked and splashed. They had fun.
But then they heard a small sound. It was a meow. They looked around and saw a kitten. The kitten was stuck in a bush near the puddle. The kitten was wet and scared. It looked uncomfortable.
"Look, a kitten!" Lily said.
"It needs help!" Ben said.
They ran to the bush and tried to get the kitten out. But the bush was prickly and the kitten was scared. It scratched and bit them.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lily and Ben said.
They did not give up. They wanted to rescue the kitten. They used a stick to move the bush. They used a towel to wrap the kitten. They used their hands to pet the kitten.
"Shh, shh, shh, it's OK, we are here to help you," Lily and Ben said.
The kitten stopped meowing and scratching and biting. It started purring and cuddling. It looked happy.
"Yay, we rescued the kitten!" Lily and Ben said.
They took the kitten to their mom. She was sitting on a bench. She saw them and smiled.
"What a cute kitten! Where did you find it?" she asked.
"We found it in a bush near the puddle. It was wet and scared. We rescued it," Lily and Ben said.
"That's very kind of you. You are good friends to the kitten. Do you want to keep it?" she asked.
"Yes, please!" Lily and Ben said.
They named the kitten Puddle. They took it home and gave it food and water and a warm bed. They played with it and loved it. They were happy. Puddle was happy. They were a family.
