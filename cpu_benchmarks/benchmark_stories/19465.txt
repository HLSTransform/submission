It was almost noon, and Lucy was so excited! She was walking outside with her mom and dad, looking for something special. Suddenly, Lucy stopped and froze. She had found the perfect spot for the picnic!
Mom and Dad set up the picnic blanket and opened the basket of food. Lucy sat down and waited carefully for the picnic to begin. As soon as her parents began to take out the food, Lucy smiled. She knew it was going to be a fun afternoon.
Mom and Dad asked Lucy to be careful as she ate. Lucy nodded and made sure she didn't go too fast. Every couple of bites, she would freeze and look around. The day was so beautiful and nice that it was hard to not just want to run around and play.
Finally, noon came and it was time to go home. Lucy was a bit sad that the picnic was over but she was also happy that she had been so careful. She knew that if she hadn't been careful, she wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much.
