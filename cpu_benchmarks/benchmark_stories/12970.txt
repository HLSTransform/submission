Once upon a time, there was a boy who loved to help others. Every morning, he would get dressed and rush off to his class. He was always the first one there, ready to lend a helping hand. 
One morning, he noticed that some of the new students in his class were struggling with their paperwork. He walked over to them and asked, “Can I help?”
 
The new students were so happy for the help, and thanked him for it. They spent the rest of the class together, as the boy helped them fill out the forms tightly. 
Later, the teacher noticed how nice the boy was, and thanked him for all his help. Everyone in the class felt so happy and thankful for his kind help that day.
