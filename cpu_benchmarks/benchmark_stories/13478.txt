Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved candy, especially sweet lollipops. One day, she went to the candy store with her mom. Her mom bought her a big red lollipop, but Lily accidentally dropped it on the floor. 
Lily cried and cried because she couldn't eat her lollipop anymore. Her mom tried to make her feel better by giving her a different candy, but Lily still wanted her lollipop. Suddenly, she had an idea. She rubbed the lollipop on her shirt to get the dirt off. 
But the lollipop still tasted dirty. Lily was sad again. Then, she saw an exit sign and got another idea. She took the lollipop outside and threw it in the trash can near the exit. Lily felt better knowing that she did the right thing. Even though she didn't get to eat her sweet lollipop, she learned that sometimes it's better to let things go.
