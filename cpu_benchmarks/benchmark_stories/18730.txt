Once upon a time, there was a mommy who wanted to make a cake for her little boy. She went to the store to buy a mixer. She found one that was cheap and bought it. When she came home, she started to mix the cake batter. The little boy was so happy that he helped his mommy. He loved to come and watch the mixer go round and round. Finally, the cake was ready and it was delicious! The mommy and her little boy were very happy.
