Once upon a time, there was a fireman named Tom. Tom was a very foolish fireman. He liked to play with his red fire truck and smile all the time. One sunny day, Tom was playing outside with his fire truck when he saw a little girl crying.
Tom went to the little girl and asked, "Why are you sad?" The little girl said, "My cat is stuck in a tree! Can you help me?" Tom wanted to help, but he didn't know how to climb the tree. He felt bad and started to think.
Then, Tom had an idea. He took his red fire truck and put it under the tree. He stood on the truck and reached up to the cat. He grabbed the cat and gave it back to the little girl. The girl was so happy, she smiled and said, "Thank you, Tom!" Tom smiled back and felt proud that he could help. From that day on, Tom was not a foolish fireman anymore.
