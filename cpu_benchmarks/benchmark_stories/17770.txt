Once upon a time there was a great sight. It was so big and bright that everyone wanted to take a look.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a big green tree appeared. It was so tall and it had lots of leaves. All the children were so happy!
Then, there was a loud noise. A big, yellow butterfly suddenly appeared! Everyone was so amazed.
The butterfly flew around the tree and the children chased after it. They were smiling and having such a great time. 
Then, just as suddenly, it disappeared again. Everyone was sad, but they all knew it was a great sight and that they were lucky to have seen it.
