Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved to play in the park. She would climb up and down the monkey bars and swing on the swings. One day when she was playing she found a big, long rope. She excitedly grabbed it and started to swing it around.
The little girl's mom saw her playing and called out to her. "What are you doing?" she asked.
The little girl said, "I found this rope! Can I keep it and play with it?"
Her mom replied, "Yes, but be careful. If the rope is too tight, it might break!"
The little girl nodded her head, and the mom smiled. Now, the little girl had something new to play with. She wrapped the rope around the monkey bars, then shook it as hard as she could. She laughed and smiled as the rope swung around, happy to have something new to play with.
The girl's mom watched her play and smiled. She was glad her daughter was having so much fun. She reminded the girl to not make the rope too tight, in case it might break.
The little girl remembered her mom's words and was more careful with the rope. She made sure it wasn't too tight, so she could keep playing and swinging!
