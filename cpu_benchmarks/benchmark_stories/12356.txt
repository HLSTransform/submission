Once upon a time there was a farm full of animals and plants. The animals were all happy and content living together. There was a cow, a sheep and a rabbit who liked to have fun together.
One fine day, the cow noticed some wheat growing in the corner of the farm. She wanted the wheat for herself but she was too shy to take it.
The sheep though saw the cow behaving shyly and decided he wanted the wheat too. He quickly ran and grabbed some of the wheat and ran away.
The cow became very envious of the sheep and ran after him. She wanted to take some of the wheat as well. The sheep refused to share, so the cow was very angry.
“Why can’t you behave better?” She said. 
The sheep was a bit scared and quickly shared the wheat. The cow was happy and the animals enjoyed the wheat together.
