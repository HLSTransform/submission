Once upon a time, there was a young lion. He was fierce and strong. He lived in a big jungle with his family. 
One day, he went out to play with his friends. They played hide and seek, but the young lion couldn't find anyone. He looked everywhere but couldn't see his friends. 
Suddenly, he heard a loud roar. It was his father, the king of the jungle. He had completed his hunt and brought food for the family. The young lion was happy to see his father and they all ate together. From that day on, the young lion learned to hunt and completed his first hunt with his father.
