Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was an ordinary boy who loved to draw. He would draw every day and use his eraser to fix any mistakes he made. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a new toy - a recorder.
Timmy was so excited to play with his new toy. He showed it to his friend, Billy, and said, "Look at my new toy! It can record sounds!" Billy was curious and asked, "What does that mean?"
Timmy replied, "It means I can make sounds and listen to them later." Billy was amazed and asked if he could try it too. Timmy happily let him play with it.
Later that day, Timmy and Billy were playing outside when they heard a strange noise. They didn't know what it was, so Timmy decided to use his recorder to record the sound. When they played it back, they realized it was just a bird singing. They laughed and continued playing, grateful for Timmy's new toy.
