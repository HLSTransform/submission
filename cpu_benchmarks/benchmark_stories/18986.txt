Once upon a time, there was a gentle cow named Daisy. Daisy lived on a farm with her friends. They liked to eat hay and play in the sun.
One day, Daisy saw a little girl named Emma. Emma did not know what hay was. Daisy wanted to explain to her. She said, "Hay is what we eat. It is dry grass, and it is yummy."
Emma smiled and thanked Daisy for being a good friend. They played together and had lots of fun. And from that day on, Emma knew what hay was, and they became the best of friends.
