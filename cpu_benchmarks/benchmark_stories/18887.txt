Lily and Tom were playing in the park with their mom. They liked to run and slide and swing and laugh. It was a hot day, so they did not need their coats. They left them on a bench near the slide.
"Look, mom, I can go very fast!" Tom said as he slid down the slide.
"Be careful, Tom, and wait for your turn!" mom said.
Lily wanted to go on the swing, but there was a big girl on it. She waited and waited, but the big girl did not get off.
"Can I have a turn, please?" Lily asked.
"No, this is my swing. Go away!" the big girl said.
Lily felt sad and angry. She did not like the big girl. She ran back to the bench and saw her coat. She had an idea. She took her coat and ran to the slide. She threw the coat over the big girl's head.
"Hey, what are you doing?" the big girl shouted.
Lily giggled and ran away. She hid behind a tree and watched. The big girl tried to get the coat off, but she could not see. She stumbled and fell off the swing.
"Ouch, that hurt!" the big girl cried.
Mom saw what happened and ran to the swing. She helped the big girl up and took the coat off her head.
"I'm sorry, are you okay?" mom asked.
The big girl nodded and rubbed her knee. She looked around and saw Lily.
"Hey, you! You did this! You are mean!" the big girl said.
She ran after Lily, but Lily was faster. She ran and ran until she found a big bush. She crawled under it and hoped the big girl would not find her. She waited and waited, but the big girl did not come. She had vanished.
Lily felt relieved and happy. She had tricked the big girl. She crawled out of the bush and looked for mom and Tom. She saw them on the bench, smiling and waving at her.
"Lily, there you are! We were looking for you!" mom said.
"Did you have fun, Lily?" Tom asked.
Lily nodded and hugged them. She told them what she did and why. Mom and Tom laughed and praised her.
"That was very clever, Lily, but also very naughty. You should not throw things at people, even if they are rude. You could hurt them or yourself. Do you understand?" mom said.
Lily nodded and said sorry. She did not want to hurt anyone. She just wanted to have fun.
Mom smiled and kissed her. She gave her the coat and said it was time to go home. Lily put on the coat and held mom's hand. Tom held the other hand. They walked out of the park, happy and tired. They had a good day.
