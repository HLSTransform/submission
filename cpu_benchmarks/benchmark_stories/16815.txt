Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to a fair. She saw a big, red balloon and wanted it. But she didn't have any money. Suddenly, a kind man came and gave her a prize. Lily was so happy that she kissed the man on the cheek.
"Thank you for being so helpful!" Lily said.
"You're welcome," the man replied with a smile.
Lily held her prize tightly and skipped away, feeling grateful for the man's kindness. From that day on, she always remembered to be helpful to others, just like the man who gave her the prize.
