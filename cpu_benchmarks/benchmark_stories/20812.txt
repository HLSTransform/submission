Once upon a time, there was an ancient tool. All the people in the village loved it, and talked about how useful it was. But one day, an old man came to the village. He said, “I can make this tool better.”
The villagers asked him to try, and he said “Yes”. So the old man worked on the tool, and soon it started to look different. Everyone was excited and talked about how better it would be.
But when the old man was finished, the tool did not work properly anymore. The villagers were sad and angry, and they blamed the old man. They shouted at him and told him to leave the village.
The moral of the story is this: don’t change something if you don’t know what you’re doing. Stick with what works, because if you don’t, it can have a bad ending.
