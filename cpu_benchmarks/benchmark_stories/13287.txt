Once upon a time there was a rabbit. He was very hungry. He went to find food. He hopped and hopped until he found a banana tree. The bananas were deep yellow. The rabbit was so happy. He ate one banana. Then he hopped away. He wanted to find more food. He hopped and hopped until he found another banana tree. The banana looked so sweet and juicy. The rabbit was so happy. He ate one more banana and hopped away. He was full and happy. He saw a flower and hopped off to see it. He enjoyed the wonderful smell and hopped away. The rabbit hopped until the sun went down. What a lovely day hopping around!
