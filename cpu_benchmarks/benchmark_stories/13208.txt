One day, two friends decided to go for a walk in the woods. Suddenly, they saw something very rare and special – a twig! It was so special, because it had two colours – red and yellow! The friends were so excited and wanted it for themselves. 
So they decided to separate the twig in half. The first friend got the yellow part and the second friend got the red part. They were very happy and smiled at each other. 
The friends carefully put the twigs in their pockets and returned home. They had lots of fun and brought back a special twig to remember their time in the woods!
