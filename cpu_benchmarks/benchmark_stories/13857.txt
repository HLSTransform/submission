Once upon a time, there was a fine ornament. It was round and shiny. The ornament lived on a big tree. The tree was in a house with a family.
One day, a boy named Tim saw the ornament. He wanted to play with it. Tim took the ornament off the tree. He started to do a dance with it.
The ornament liked the dance. It made the ornament happy. Tim put the ornament back on the tree. The ornament was safe and sound. The family and the ornament lived happily ever after.
