One day, a boy named John met a very nice lady. She was holding a pretty purse. She said to John, "I am here to protect you. This purse is very useful - it has a lot of things inside." 
John was eager to see what was inside the purse. He carefully opened it and found lots of exciting things! He saw some toys, books and even sweets. He was so excited!
The nice lady smiled and said, "I'm glad you like what I have for you. Remember, this purse is just for you, to protect you and make sure you are always safe. "
John smiled and thanked the nice lady. He said: "I will always keep the purse safe and I will make sure it is very useful!"
