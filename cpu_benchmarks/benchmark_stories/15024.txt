Once upon a time there was a green waffle. It was a special waffle, because it could change! All the other waffles were plain, but this one was different.
One day, it started to move. It jumped up and down and all around. Then it changed shape. It was no longer a plain waffle, it was now something different. 
Pretty soon it was a plane! It was so excited to fly. It zoomed around, up and down and around in circles. It was having such a great time.
But then it had to go back to being a green waffle again. It was sad, but it knew it had enjoyed all the fun of being a plane.
The end.
