Once upon a time, there was a nice man who did nice things with his family. He had a wife who was very happy. One day, the man and his wife went to a beach. It was sunny and the sand was pink.
The man and his wife went for a swim. They saw fishes and shells in the water. Then, they played a game and laughed a lot.
When it was time to go home, the man and his wife saw a rainbow in the sky. It was so pretty! They hugged each other and were very happy. The man smiled at his wife and said he loved her very much.
The man and his wife had a lot of fun at the beach. They will remember that beautiful day forever.
