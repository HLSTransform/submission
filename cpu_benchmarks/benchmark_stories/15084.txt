Once upon a time there was a friendly fireman. He went to work each day, returning in the evening to tell stories and laugh with his family. He was very competitive and worked hard. 
One day on the way home, the fireman had a strange feeling. He hurried back to his house, and when he arrived, it was on fire! The fireman went to work, spraying the water from his hose on the fire. He fought hard to put out the blaze. 
After several hours, the fireman had won the battle. He looked around at the damage the fire had caused, but he made sure everyone was safe. 
The fireman was very proud of his work. He had returned home to find a fire, and despite the odds was able to conquer it. He was relieved that no one was hurt, and had saved his home.
The fireman smiled as he went to bed, satisfied with his achievement.
