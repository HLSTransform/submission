Daddy was old. He loved to take pictures. He liked to take his camera and snap some photos. One day he was taking pictures at the park when he saw a butterfly. He ran to get his camera and snapped a photo. The butterfly was so beautiful.
Daddy printed out the photo and he showed it to me. I was so happy! I wanted to have the photo forever and ever. So, Daddy put it in a picture frame and hung it on the wall in my room.
Every time I see the picture I remember the day Daddy snapped the photo. It reminds me that Daddy is old and he has sweet memories with me. I will never forget my Daddy's special photo of the butterfly.
