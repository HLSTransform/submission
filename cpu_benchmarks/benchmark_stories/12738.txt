Once upon a midnight, Lisa was walking alone in the woods. It was a warm night and the moon was shining above, making a sparkle on the ground. Lisa had a rake with her, she was collecting leaves for a surprise. As she was walking, she noticed a creature in the distance. It looked like a tall man made of ice. 
As Lisa got closer, the man started to melt. Lisa gasped and wondered why this was happening. She started to worry and decided to ask the man a question.
"Why are you melting?" She asked.
The man smiled and said, "It's because I am an independent creature. I'll melt and come back stronger and wiser." Lisa knew this was true and crossed her fingers, hoping that it would be true. 
The next day, Lisa went back to the same spot, and sure enough, the man of ice was back in one piece! Lisa smiled and couldn't contain her excitement. She grabbed her rake and started collecting leaves. She found all the perfect colours for her surprise and made it one of the most delightful surprises ever! 
Moral of the story: Even when things seem scary at first, it's important to stay independent and keep believing in yourself.
