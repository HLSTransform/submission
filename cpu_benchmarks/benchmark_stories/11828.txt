Once upon a time there was a grumpy old wizard. He loved to do one thing: making magic strips.
Every day, the wizard would make a new magic strip. He would put all his magic into each strip. Then, he would watch the strip vanish.
The wizard was so grumpy because he could never keep his magic strips. They always vanished too quickly.
One day, a young girl saw the wizard. She asked him why he was so grumpy. The wizard explained his problem with the vanishing magic strips.
The girl told the wizard that magic strips weren't meant to last forever. They were gifts from the wizard to everyone else. By giving away his magic, the wizard was making others happy. 
The wizard realized this and smiled. He stopped being grumpy and started to give away his magic strips every day. Sure enough, people were happy and he was too!
Moral of the story: When you give away a little of what you have, it can make the world a better place.
