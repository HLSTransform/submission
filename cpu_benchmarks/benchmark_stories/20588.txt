Once upon a time there was a mommy who wanted to make her baby's life better. She bought some soap to make the baby's skin nice and soft. The mommy used the soap every day to make her baby's skin even more calm.
The mommy noticed that every time she used the soap, the baby's skin improved. Soon the baby's skin started to feel great and look even better. 
The mommy was very happy to see that her baby's skin had improved. She thanked the soap for helping her make her baby's life better. 
The end.
