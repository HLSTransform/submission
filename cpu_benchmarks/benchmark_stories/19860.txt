Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pet bird named Blue. Blue was very pretty and had feathers of blue and green. One day, Lily saw Blue eating something from the ground. She didn't know what it was, so she asked Blue. "What are you eating?" she spoke to Blue. Blue replied, "It's a seed, Lily."
But Lily didn't know that the seed was poison. Blue started to feel heavy and sick. Lily noticed that Blue was not feeling well and took her to the vet. The vet gave Blue some medicine and told Lily to be careful of what Blue eats. From that day on, Lily made sure to keep Blue away from anything that could be poison.
