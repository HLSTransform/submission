Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play at school. Today, they have a new game. They have a bell and two chairs.
Sara says, "Let's play school. I will be the teacher and you will be the student. You have to seat on the chair and listen to me. I will ring the bell when it is time to do something."
Tom says, "OK, I will play with you. But what will we do?"
Sara says, "We will do fun things. We will sing, we will draw, we will count, we will read. You have to do what I say and raise your hand if you have a question. Are you ready?"
Tom says, "Yes, I am ready. Let's play school."
Sara rings the bell and says, "Good morning, class. My name is Miss Sara and I am your teacher. Please say your name and something you like."
Tom says, "My name is Tom and I like cars."
Sara says, "Very good, Tom. I like cars too. Now, let's sing a song. Do you know the ABC song?"
Tom says, "Yes, I know the ABC song. I can sing it with you."
Sara says, "OK, let's sing together. A, B, C, D, E, F, G..."
They sing the song and have fun. They play school until the real bell rings and it is time to go home. They say goodbye and hug each other. They are happy. They are friends.
