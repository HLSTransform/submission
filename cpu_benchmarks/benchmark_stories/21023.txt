Once upon a time there was a lady called Grace, who loved helping people learn the truth. One day she started a school to help little kids learn new things. She was filled with joy as the kids started to show progress each day. Every morning, Grace would start by teaching the children simple things such as counting and colours. She was so graceful and gentle in her teaching and the children absolutely adored her. At the end of the day, she would tell the children stories about truth and how to be kind to each other. The children always listened intently and came away feeling happy. Graceâ€™s school was a wonderful place and she made sure everyone always had fun while learning.
