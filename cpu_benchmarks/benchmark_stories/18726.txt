Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a pigeon sitting on a fence. "Hello, little pigeon! Are you cold?" she asked.
The pigeon shivered and said, "Yes, I'm very cold. It's a chilly day."
Lily felt sorry for the pigeon, so she went inside to get some bread. She gave the pigeon some delicious bread to eat, and the pigeon was very happy. "Thank you, Lily! This bread is yummy!" said the pigeon.
Lily smiled and said, "You're welcome, little pigeon. I'm glad you like it." From that day on, the pigeon and Lily became good friends and would often share delicious treats together.
