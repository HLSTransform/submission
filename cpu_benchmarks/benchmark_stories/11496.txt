One day, a little boy named Tim had to wake up early for class. Tim was a gifted boy who loved to learn new things. He jumped out of bed, excited for the day.
In class, Tim's teacher, Miss Lily, said, "Today, we will learn about colors!" Tim and his friends listened carefully. They loved learning with Miss Lily because she made class fun.
After class, Tim went home and told his mom, "Mom, I learned about colors today! Miss Lily said I am gifted!" His mom smiled and said, "I am so proud of you, Tim!" They spent the rest of the day playing with colorful toys and having fun.
