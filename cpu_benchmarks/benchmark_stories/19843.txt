Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with yarn. She would wrap it around her fingers and make pretty bracelets. But one day, Lily ran out of yarn. She needed more yarn to make more bracelets.
Lily went to the store with her mom to buy more yarn. She looked for yarn that was cheap because she didn't have a lot of money. Finally, she found some yarn that was just the right price.
When Lily got home, she was so happy to have more yarn. She made lots of bracelets and showed them to her mom. Her mom was proud of her and told her she did a great job. Lily was so happy that she had the yarn she needed to make her bracelets.
