John was a cute little three year old with a big imagination. When he was tired, he liked to take a nap. After he woke up from his nap, he was full of energy. 
John loved playing sports. He enjoyed playing football, basketball and baseball. His favorite was baseball because he could hit the ball and run around the bases. 
John really wanted to make a team. He asked all the kids in the neighbourhood if they wanted to join his team, but none of them said yes. John was disappointed. 
Then one day, John looked out his window and saw a tiny puppy running around outside. It was so cute and it looked like it wanted to join John's team. John named the puppy 'Basketball' and he was so excited to have a teammate. 
John and Basketball played together every day. They played tag, they rode bikes and they even played baseball. They had so much fun! 
John was so happy to have a best friend and after a fun day of playing sports, they both took a nap together.
