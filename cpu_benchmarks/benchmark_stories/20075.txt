Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she found a pink rock while she was walking in the park. 
"Wow! This rock is so pretty!" Lily said to herself. 
Just then, her friend Tommy came over and asked, "What did you find, Lily?" 
"I found a pink rock! Look how pretty it is!" Lily said, showing the rock to Tommy. 
Tommy looked at the rock and said, "That's a cool rock, Lily. What's its name?" 
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I don't know. Let's name it Pinky!" 
From that day on, Lily and Tommy played with Pinky the pink rock every time they went to the park. They loved their new friend and were happy to have found such a special treasure.
