Once upon a time, there was a boy who always forgot to wake up on time. His mummy decided it was time to get him an alarm. 
So they went to the shop together. There was a special alarm with a funny sound and it was perfect for him. But the boy was impatient and didn't want to wait until they got home to set it up.
Mummy explained that the alarm was for when it was time for him to wake up. Every morning when it went off, he had to get up and get ready for the day. The boy smiled as he liked the idea.
The next morning, the alarm made the funny sound and the boy was so excited. He grabbed his clothes and ran to the bathroom. 
Mummy was so proud of the boy for understanding what the alarm was for and getting ready so quickly! 
The End.
