Lily liked to play with her toy train. She had a big track that went around her room. She made the train go fast and slow, and made noises like "choo-choo" and "beep-beep". She was happy.
One day, Lily's brother Tom came to her room. He wanted to play with her train too. Lily said no, it was her train. Tom got angry. He grabbed the train and pulled it hard. Lily heard a snap. She looked at the track. It was broken. She cried.
Tom ran away. He did not say sorry. Lily was sad. She did not know how to fix the track. She could not play with her train anymore. She wished Tom was nice.
Later, Lily's mom came to her room. She saw the broken track and the train. She asked Lily what happened. Lily told her about Tom. Mom hugged Lily and said she was sorry. She said she would help her fix the track. She said Tom was wrong and he would have to say sorry too.
Mom got some tape and glue. She put the track back together. She tested the train. It worked. Lily smiled. She thanked mom. She played with her train again. She was happy.
