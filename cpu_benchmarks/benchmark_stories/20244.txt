One day, a furry cat went for a walk. The cat was purple. The cat liked to play and run.
The purple cat saw a dog. The dog said, "Hi, cat. What is your name?" The cat said, "My name is Purple. What is yours?" The dog said, "My name is Brown. Let's play together."
Purple and Brown played all day. They ran, jumped, and laughed. They had fun. Then, something happened. It started to rain. Purple and Brown went home. They were happy and tired.
