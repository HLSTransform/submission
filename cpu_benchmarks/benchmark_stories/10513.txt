Once upon a time, there was a duck who lived on a lake. The duck was feeling dizzy, so he decided to test himself. He said to himself, "Let's jump off this rock and see if I can fly". 
So off he leaped into the air. He flapped his wings, but couldn't quite manage to fly. He ended up swimming back to the rock.
He said to himself, "That was a hard test. I don't think I'm flying today!" He was very disappointed, but he knew he'd try again soon.
Just then, a little girl on the shore cried out, "You can do it, Duck! I believe in you!"
The duck looked over his shoulder and smiled with excitement. "Alright, I'm going to give it one more try!" he said.
So, taking a deep breath, he jumped off the rock again. He flapped his wings harder than before, and this time, he didnâ€™t fall into the water! He was flying! He flapped his wings and flew all around the lake, feeling dizzy with joy. 
The little girl waved and shouted, "Way to go, Duck! You passed the test!"
