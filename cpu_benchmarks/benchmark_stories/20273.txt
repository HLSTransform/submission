Once upon a time, in a small country, there lived a selfish dog named Max. Max did not like to share his toys with other dogs. One day, Max saw a little dog named Tim playing with a ball. Max wanted the ball for himself.
Max went to Tim and said, "Give me your ball!" Tim looked at Max and said, "No, it's my ball." Max was angry and decided to bite the ball. He bit the ball so hard that it popped.
Tim was very sad and started to cry. Max felt bad for what he did. He realized that being selfish was not good. Max said, "I'm sorry, Tim. I will give you my ball to play with." Tim stopped crying and they both played happily together. Max learned to share and was not selfish anymore.
