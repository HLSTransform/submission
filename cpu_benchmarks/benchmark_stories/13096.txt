Once upon a time there lived a little boy. He liked going on long journeys. But one day, his journey was too difficult for him. All the way, he kept feeling tired and scared. So he asked his mom for help.
His mom gave him a good suggestion. She said, "You need a rest. I recommend taking a break from your journey. Then start again when you feel better".
The little boy followed his mom's recommendation. He had a little nap and ate something to give him energy. Then he was ready to carry on with his journey.
This time he felt much better. He knew it was a good idea to take a break. He kept going until he reached his destination. And he was so happy when he got there.
This was a lesson he learned. Whenever the journey was difficult, he must take a break and rest. That was the best recommendation he ever got!
