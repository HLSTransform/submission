Once upon a time, there was a strong man who wanted to create something special. He tried to make a big cake, but it wasn’t special enough. Then he tried to make a big painting, but that too wasn’t special enough.
So then, he decided to make an opera. He sang some songs and told a story with his voice. Everyone who heard it thought it was amazing. They clapped and said, “That was very special!”
That made the strong man happy. He was proud of himself for creating something so special. From then on, he sang more operas and everyone who heard them said they were very good.
So, the strong man kept creating operas and the people kept enjoying them. Everyone was very happy!
