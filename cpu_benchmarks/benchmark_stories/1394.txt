Once there was a cute little bunny. Every day it hopped around, looking for things to nibble on. But one day it saw something it really liked. It was a small red ball. 
The bunny hopped over and grabbed the ball. Then it used all its speed and threw the ball as high as it could into the air. The ball went so high that the bunny could hardly see it. 
The ball came down a few minutes later and the bunny caught it. Then it threw the ball again. This time it flew even higher than before. The bunny was so excited. 
The bunny kept throwing and catching the ball until the sun started to set. Then the bunny hopped away with its red ball, ready to play again tomorrow.
