Once upon a time, there were three friends. Their names were Molly, Sam and Beth. Sam was bald and Beth had long, brown hair. Molly and Sam became fast friends and they decided to go on an adventure.
They set off together and soon found a big, scary monster. It had green skin, big claws and lots of teeth. The three friends were frightened, but decided to unite and fight the monster.
Sam picked up some stones from the ground and threw them at the monster. Beth used her long hair to tie up the monster. Molly found a stick and started hitting the monster with it.
The brave friends kept fighting until the monster was gone. They had stopped the monster! The three friends hugged and laughed. They were so proud of what they had done.
The three friends were now united and were sure to have many more adventures together. With their quick thinking and brave hearts, they won the battle against the monster!
