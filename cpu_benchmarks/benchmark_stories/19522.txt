Joseph went outside to admire the big house across the street. He thought it was so beautiful and it seemed so big, if he had a house like that he would be so happy! 
Joseph looked inside the house and saw a big, cozy bed. He was very sleepy, but he wanted to admire the house a bit more before he went home. 
He noticed a window on the side of the house. Suddenly, he spotted a dog looking out of the window. “Yup,” he thought, “I want to live here!” 
Joseph waved to the dog, said goodbye to the house, and went back home. He dreamed about living in the big house all night long.
