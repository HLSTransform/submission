Once upon a time, there was a human. He was green and loved to lay in the sun. Every day, he would go outside and lay in the grass, feeling the warm sunshine on his face. He especially liked it when the sun was bright and yellow.
One day, he lay in the grass for so long that he fell asleep. When he woke up, he saw that he was surrounded by tall, green trees. He thought it was very special and decided to stay for a few more minutes.
As he lay in the grass, he felt so peaceful and content. He knew he would have to leave soon, but for the moment, he wanted to stay there forever. 
Finally, he opened his eyes, said goodbye to the trees, and headed back home. He was so happy he had taken the time to lay in the green grass and feel the sun on his face.
