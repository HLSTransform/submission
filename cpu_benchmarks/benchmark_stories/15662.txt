Mommy and Tori were in the kitchen on Wednesday morning.
Mommy said, "Tori, it's time to pack the lunch boxes."
Tori said, "Yay! Can I help?"
Mommy said, "Yes, you can pack your box."
So Tori went to the cupboard and looked inside. It was empty!
She said, "Mommy, my box is empty!"
Mommy smiled and said, "That's okay, let's get some food to put in it. What would you like to eat today?"
Tori said, "I want an apple and a cheese sandwich!"
So Mommy got the apple and the cheese and helped Tori to pack her lunch box.
When it was finished, Tori's lunch box was full.
Tori was happy. She said, "My lunch box is ready for Wednesday!"
