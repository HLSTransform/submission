Once upon a time there was an otter. He was so fast that he could run faster than any of the other animals in the forest. 
One day, he was running in the forest and he noticed a very long log. It was so big he could hardly believe it! So he decided he wanted to race the log. 
The otter said to the log, "I'm going to race you, let's see who can get to the end first!" 
The log replied, "I'm a log so I can't really run. But I can roll. So if I roll, can I still race you?" 
The otter thought about it for a moment and said, "Yes, if you roll on the ground we can both race and see who gets to the end first!" 
So the otter and the log started their race. The otter ran as fast as he could and the log rolled as fast as it could. In the end, the otter won the race and the log was very proud of its long race.
