Tim and Sam are young brothers. They like to play golf with their dad. Dad has a big bag with many sticks. He lets Tim and Sam use the small sticks. They hit the ball and try to make it go in the hole.
One day, dad says he has to go to work. He tells Tim and Sam to be good and not touch his big bag. He promises to play golf with them when he comes back. Tim and Sam say okay and hug dad.
But Tim and Sam are bored. They want to play golf. They see dad's big bag in the garage. They think dad will not mind if they use his big sticks. They take the big sticks and go to the backyard. They hit the ball very hard. The ball flies far and fast.
But the ball does not go in the hole. It goes over the fence. It hits the window of the neighbor's house. The window breaks. The neighbor is angry. He comes out and yells at Tim and Sam. He says he will tell dad.
Tim and Sam are scared. They run inside and hide under the bed. They hope dad will not be mad. They wish they had not touched his big bag. They wish they had kept their promise.
