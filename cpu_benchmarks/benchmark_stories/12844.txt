John walked down the street with his mum. He smiled as he waved at all of the people he passed. He always felt so welcome in his neighbourhood. His mum pointed to a high building and said, "Look John, that's the library." John loved libraries and he smiled wide at the thought of a secret adventure waiting inside.
John and his mum stepped into the library and he ran over to the books. He loved searching through all of them, looking at the pictures and imagining different stories. Suddenly he felt worried - he saw someone sneering from the corner of his eye. He turned and saw a boy looking through the books too. The boy looked up and said, "I hate this place!"
John's mum saw the two boys and stepped in. She said something to the boy, but John couldn't understand. He looked up at his mum and saw her firm but kind expression. She turned back to the boy and said, "It's not nice to hate places. Everyone is welcome here."
The boy seemed surprised, but after a while he nodded. He gave John a small smile and said, "This place isn't so bad after all." John smiled back, relieved that nobody would be hating anymore. He was happy to be welcomed in such a special, high place.
