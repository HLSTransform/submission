Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Ruby. She loved to explore her garden. Everyday, she would prepare for her adventures. Ruby had a little backpack with snacks, and a book full of pictures.
Today, Ruby was facing something special â€“ it was very silent. She liked silence, and enjoyed exploring without noise. Around the corner of her garden, she spotted something lively. She was curious to learn what it was. Running over to the lively thing, she discovered a pond with jumping fish. She was amazed.
Ruby peered into the water, but the lively fish were careful not to come near her. Then, she heard a voice.
"Why don't you try talking to them?" it said.
Ruby smiled. She had an idea. She kneeled down by the pond and whispered.
"Hello little fishes. I am Ruby. Do you want to be my friends?"
To her surprise, the fish starts swimming around her. She had made new friends.
Ruby joyfully prepared to look after her new aquatic friends. She looked forward to many more silent days, lively with her fishy friends.
