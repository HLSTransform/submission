Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, while she was playing in the park, she found a shiny gold coin on the ground. She recognized it as something special and picked it up.
As she was walking home, she saw a big dog that looked frightened. Lily knew she had to help the dog. She went up to him and petted him gently. The dog stopped being frightened and started wagging his tail.
Lily continued walking home, happy that she found the gold coin and helped the dog. She knew that doing good things always made her feel happy inside.
