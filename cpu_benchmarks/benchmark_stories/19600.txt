Once, there was a very patient lady. Every day, she went to the beach and collected a net full of things from the sea. She had so many wonderful things, like shells and rocks and seaweed and fish. She was so excited that she wanted to show everyone her treasures.
So, one day, she decided to marry the net! She took out some of the prettiest treasures from the net and invited all of her friends and family to come celebrate. Everyone was so excited to help marry the net! 
On the day of the wedding, everyone laughed and cheered as the lady and the net became married. Everyone was so patient, as they helped the lady put the net in a very special place. 
From that day on, the net was always happy and so was the lady. They were married forever, and her net was always brimming with treasures from the sea.
