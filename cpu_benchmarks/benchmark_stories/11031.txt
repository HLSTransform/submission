Sara and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to dig in the ground and make holes. They found some rocks and sticks and put them in their holes. They were happy.
But then a big boy came. He was mean. He kicked their holes and removed their rocks and sticks. He laughed at them and ran away.
Sara and Ben were upset. They cried and hugged each other. They wanted their holes and rocks and sticks back.
"Hey, you!" they heard a voice. It was Lily, their friend. She saw what the big boy did. She was angry. She had a plan.
"Come with me," she said. "I know where he lives. We can get your things back."
Sara and Ben followed Lily. They walked to the big boy's house. They saw his bike in the yard. It had a basket. In the basket, they saw their rocks and sticks.
Lily was quick. She removed the rocks and sticks from the basket and gave them to Sara and Ben. They smiled and thanked her.
"Let's go," Lily said. "Before he sees us."
They ran back to the park. They fixed their holes and put their rocks and sticks in them. They were happy again. They played and laughed with Lily. They were friends.
