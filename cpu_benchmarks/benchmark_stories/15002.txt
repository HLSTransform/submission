Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. He was a helpful boy who always thought of others before himself.
One day, Jack went to the store to buy a pizza. He was so excited to have it that he quickly said goodbye to the storekeeper and started to leave.
Suddenly, he heard a small voice. It was a little girl who was crying. Jack realized that the girl was alone, so he asked her what was wrong.
"I couldn't find my mommy," the girl said.
Jack felt bad for the girl. He was about to leave when he had an idea. He asked the girl if she wanted to share the pizza with him.
The girl smiled and accepted his offer.
They had a great time! After they finished the pizza, Jack and the girl went to find the girl's mommy. Finally, after much searching, they found her!
The little girl thanked Jack for all of his help and they said goodbye.
