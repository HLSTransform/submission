Once upon a time, there was a boy named John. One day, John was playing in the park when he saw an interesting barrel. He could not help but investigate it. He started walking towards the barrel, when suddenly he heard a loud call from his mother.
John froze and felt ashamed. He had forgotten that his mother asked him to stay near the park bench. So he quickly ran back to the bench. 
When he arrived, he saw his mother standing there with a stern expression on her face. She spoke to John: "I told you not to wander off, why did you disobey me?"
John hung his head low and was too ashamed to answer. He knew he made a mistake and his mother was disappointed in him. His mother took him home and told him not to do it again. John promised he would listen next time.
