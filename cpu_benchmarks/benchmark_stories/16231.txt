Once, there was a little boy. His name was Billy. He was only three years old.
One day, Billy's dad was un packing some lumber he had bought from the store. It was a lot of work and Dad was getting very tired.
Billy wanted to help so he asked, "Daddy, can I help you unpack the lumber?"
Dad was very proud of Billy and said, "Sure, buddy. Let's unpack it together."
So Dad helped Billy unpack the lumber. But soon Billy felt a bitter taste in his mouth.
Billy looked sadly at his dad and said, "Daddy, my tummy hurts. It tastes very bitter."
Dad stopped working and hugged Billy. He said, "It's okay buddy, let's go home. I can finish this later."
So Dad and Billy stopped working and went home. Dad still had to unpack the lumber, but Billy was happy that he was able to help his daddy.
