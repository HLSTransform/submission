Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her backyard with her pink ball. One day, she saw a bird flying high in the sky. She stopped playing and gazed at the bird. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise and saw a big truck with shiny steel wheels passing by. She was amazed by the steel wheels and gazed at them for a while. After the truck was gone, she went back to playing with her pink ball, but she couldn't stop thinking about the steel wheels. From that day on, every time she heard a loud noise, she would look up and gaze at the sky, hoping to see something new and exciting.
