Once upon a time there was a wide sign. The sign was very tall and stood in a big field. One day, some birds flew by and saw the sign. They thought it was strange and wanted to know more.
The birds found out that the sign said, "If you increase, you will find your way." When the birds heard this, they wondered how it all worked. So, the birds decided to try increasing.
The birds started twirling and spinning around in the air. They went around and around until the sign started to grow larger and larger. The birds kept spinning and soon the sign was so big that you could see it from miles away.
The sign was so big that it was now like a bridge and the birds could follow it to their new home! From then on, the birds knew that if they increased, they could find their way.
