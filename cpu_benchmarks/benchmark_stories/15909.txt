Once upon a time there was a duck who lived in a nice nest. Every morning the duck would wake up and splash around in the pond. One day the duck splashed a bit too far away and couldn't find its way back to the nest.
The duck was worried, so it quacked loudly hoping its mum would come to the rescue. Sure enough, the mum duck heard and came quickly to the pond.
The mum duck said to her lost duckling, "Climb on my back and we can go back to the nest". So the duckling climbed on the big mum duck's back and the mum duck started to splash across the pond, back to the nest. 
Finally, the duckling was back safely in the nest. The duckling said to its mum, " You're very nice! Thank you for helping me." 
The mum duck said, "It's okay, that's what mums do. Now let's splash around in the pond and have some fun!"
