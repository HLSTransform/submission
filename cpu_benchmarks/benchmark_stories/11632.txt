Once upon a time, there was a tiny mouse. He was very sad and so he began to weep. There were so many tears that it made a bright, shiny tray full of them. Suddenly, the mouse saw something shiny under the tray. It was a beautiful, bright banana! The mouse quickly stopped weeping, and grabbed the banana from under the tray. He was so happy and grateful to have found it that he squeaked with joy! He popped the banana in his mouth and scurried away, feeling happy and full. And that's the story of the mouse and his bright tray of tears.
