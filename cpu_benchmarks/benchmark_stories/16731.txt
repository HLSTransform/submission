Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play in the woods. They admired the animals they saw, like the birds, the rabbits and the deer. They wanted to be like them, fast and free.
One day, they saw a big wolf in the trees. The wolf had a shiny coat and sharp teeth. He looked strong and successful. Tom and Sam wanted to be his friend.
"Hello, wolf!" Tom said. "We like you. Can we play with you?"
The wolf did not answer. He growled and showed his teeth. He did not want to play. He wanted to eat.
"Run, Sam, run!" Tom shouted. They turned and ran back to their home. The wolf chased them, but they were faster.
They reached their home and slammed the door. The wolf could not get in. He howled and left.
Tom and Sam hugged each other. They were scared, but they were safe.
They learned a lesson that day. They learned that not all animals are friendly. They learned that some animals are dangerous. They learned that they should not admire the wolf, but respect him and stay away from him. They learned that they were happy to be brothers, not wolves.
