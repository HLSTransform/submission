Once upon a time there was a lucky elephant. He was very happy in the jungle because he could find lots of food to eat. One day he went out to look for food. As he was walking along, he saw a big tree with lots of bananas in it. He was very excited and ran to the tree to grab the bananas. But when he tried to grab them, he couldn't reach them. He jumped up and down, trying to grab the bananas but he still couldn't reach them. Then he had an idea. He grabbed some leaves from the ground and made a pile of them underneath the tree. The pile was so high that he could finally grab the bananas. He was so happy! He ate all the bananas and went on his way.
