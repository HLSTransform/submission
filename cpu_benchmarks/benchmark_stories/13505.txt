Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to pick flowers in the meadow. One day, she met a friendly butterfly who said, "Hello little girl, what are you doing?"
"I'm picking flowers," replied Lily.
"That's lovely," said the butterfly. "Did you know that flowers are a symbol of beauty?"
Lily didn't understand what a symbol was, so the butterfly explained, "A symbol is something that represents something else. Like how a heart symbolizes love."
Lily nodded in understanding and continued to pick flowers. As she walked home, she saw a gentle breeze blowing through the trees. She closed her eyes and felt the breeze on her face. It made her feel happy.
When she got home, she showed her mom the flowers she had gained from the meadow. Her mom smiled and said, "Those are beautiful, just like you." Lily felt proud and happy knowing that the flowers were a symbol of beauty and that she had gained them all by herself.
