Lily liked to stir her soup with a big spoon. She liked to see the bubbles and the colors in the bowl. She liked to pretend she was making magic in her own world.
One day, she saw a pretty flower on the table. It was yellow and red and smelled nice. She wanted to put it in her soup to make it more magic. She reached for the flower, but her mom saw her.
"No, Lily, don't do that!" her mom said. "That flower is not for eating. It is for looking. It can make you sick if you eat it."
But Lily did not listen. She was too curious. She grabbed the flower and threw it in her soup. She stirred it with her spoon and smiled.
"Look, mom, I made magic soup!" she said.
Her mom was angry and scared. She took the bowl away from Lily and threw it in the trash. She checked Lily's mouth for any petals or leaves. She called the doctor to see if Lily was okay.
Lily did not understand why her mom was so mad. She did not feel sick. She just wanted to make magic soup. She started to cry. She had no soup, no flower, and no magic. She had nothing.
