Once upon a time, there was a mouse. He was looking for something, but he wasn't sure what he was looking for.
He wanted to find something special. He searched in the garden and under the sofa, but he could not find it anywhere.
The mouse was getting frustrated. He searched and searched, but nothing seemed to turn up. He was feeling sad.
Then one day, he saw a shiny coin in the grass. He was so excited. He picked it up and ran off with it. 
Back home, the mouse showed his friends the coin. They were all so happy. 
They had found something special!
