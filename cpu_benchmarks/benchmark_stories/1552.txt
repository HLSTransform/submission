Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with her pastel colors. One day, she was drawing a picture of a butterfly when her mom came into the room. "What a beautiful butterfly you're drawing, Lily!" her mom said. Lily smiled and whispered, "Thank you, Mommy."
Later that day, Lily and her mom went to the park. They saw a big hill and decided to climb it. When they reached the top, they could see the whole city. "Wow, we're so high up!" Lily exclaimed. Her mom agreed and they sat down to rest. Lily took out her pastels and started drawing the view. A little boy came up to her and asked, "Can I see what you're drawing?" Lily showed him her picture and the boy said, "That's amazing! You're so talented!" Lily blushed and whispered, "Thank you."
