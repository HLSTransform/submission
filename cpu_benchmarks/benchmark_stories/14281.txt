Sally and Roger were best friends and did everything together. One day, Sally wanted to go to the park, but Roger wanted to stay inside and play with his toys. Sally insisted they go outside and Roger disagreed.
Sally felt very annoyed and began to shout at Roger. Roger felt sad and said that he just wanted to stay inside. Sally said no and they started to argue.
After one minute, Sally noticed that Roger was getting very upset. She became humble and asked Roger what made him unhappy. Roger explained that he was tired and just wanted to rest.
Sally realized she had been too insistent and hugged Roger. She said they could stay inside and promised to come back tomorrow to the park. Roger smiled and they chose the game they wanted to play together. They disagreed but at the end they were happy again.
