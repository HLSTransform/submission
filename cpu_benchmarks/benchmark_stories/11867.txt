Once there was a little girl called Daisy. She was three years old and wanted to do everything by herself. She wanted to manage it all, but sometimes felt a bit anxious.
One sunny day, Daisy decided to go for a walk in the park. She went to the sandpit and managed to carry her bucket and spade. When she got there, she started to dig a big hole as she was very determined.
After a while, Daisy became a bit anxious as she couldn't find any daisies in the park. She looked all around and then suddenly, spotted one in the distance.
Excitedly, she managed to pick it up, although she was a bit worried that it would break. After a few minutes of carefulness, Daisy found that the daisy was in perfect condition.
She smiled and put it in her pocket so she wouldn't forget it. She waved goodbye to the park and headed home feeling very proud that she had managed to pick up such a special flower.
