Once upon a time there were two friends - Mary and Tom. They wanted to do something special together so they decided to go on an adventure.
They set off together and walked until they could see a light through the trees. Mary and Tom knew that this must be their special place and decided to investigate.
When they got closer they noticed that it was a big old house. They thought it looked peaceful, so they decided to take a closer look.
They walked around the house and noticed a window was open, they decided to peek inside. What they saw was more beautiful than they imagined - it was a room filled with light.
They both looked around and it made them feel so peaceful. They had discovered a wonderful place, and they decided that it was their own special spot!
