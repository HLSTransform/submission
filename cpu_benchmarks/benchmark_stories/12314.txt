Max was a three year old who loved to play outside. One day, he decided to go for a slide. His mom explained to him how to be safe and she waved goodbye as he slid away. 
Max had lots of fun sliding as fast as he could. Before he knew it, he had slide right into a network of pipes. He was so amazed that he decided to explore the network. 
As he walked through the network, Max got a little scared. He saw that some of the pipes were very important and he knew he had to be gentle with them. He started to slide away, but he accidentally broke one of the pipes. 
Max's mom heard a loud noise and came running in to the network. She was very surprised to see Max and wanted to know why he was here. Max tried to explain, but his mom was already mad. She told him that it was important to stick to the rules and listen to her if he wanted to stay safe.
Max felt guilty and wished he had followed his mom's rules. He learnt an important lesson that day and never forgot it.
