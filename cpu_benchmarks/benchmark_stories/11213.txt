Once upon a time there was a little girl named Emma. She was three years old and had long blonde hair. Every day, Emma tried to help her mum in the garden.
One day, Emma was pulling some weeds and her mum saw a herb growing next to it. She called out to Emma and said, "Look! There's a herb. Can you try and pull it out?"
So Emma tried to pull the herb out, but it was very hard to do so. She used her hands to pull it, and she used her feet too. She pulled and pulled, but it just wouldn't come out. 
Eventually, Emma got so frustrated that she started to cry. Her mum saw that she was feeling embarrassed, so she said, "It's okay, Emma, don't worry. I'm sure you'll get it one day."
Unfortunately, Emma never managed to pull out the herb. She had tried so hard, but it just wouldn't budge. Emma was so upset and embarrassed that she ran away and never tried to pull out the herb again.
