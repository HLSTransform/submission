Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with her crayons and markers, but one day she ran out of ink. She felt worried because she couldn't make any more drawings.
Lily's mommy saw her sad face and asked, "What's wrong, sweetie?"
"I ran out of ink for my markers," Lily said.
Mommy smiled and said, "Don't worry, the sun will shine tomorrow and we can go buy more ink for you."
The next day, the sun shone bright and they went to the store. Lily was so happy to get new ink for her markers. She ran home and drew a beautiful picture of the sun shining in the sky. She showed it to her mommy and said, "Look, mommy, the sun shines so bright!"
