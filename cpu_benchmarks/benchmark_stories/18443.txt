Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny liked to play with his friends in the forest. One day, Benny found a soft bulb on the ground. He picked it up and showed it to his friends. They all wanted to play with it, but Benny didn't want to share.
Benny's friends were sad and went home. Benny felt lonely without his friends. He thought about what he did and realized it wasn't nice to not share. Benny decided to go find his friends and apologize. When he found them, he gave the soft bulb to his friend and said sorry. His friends were happy and forgave him.
Benny learned that it feels good to accept others and share. From that day on, Benny always shared his toys with his friends. The end.
