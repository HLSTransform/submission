Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and sing to the rhythm of the music. Sometimes she would make noisy sounds with her toys while she danced. 
One day, Lily and her mom decided to bake some cookies. They had all the ingredients they needed, like flour, sugar, and eggs. Lily helped her mom by adding the ingredients to the mixing bowl. 
As they mixed the dough, Lily started to dance to the rhythm of the mixer. The noise it made was so loud and fun! Finally, they put the cookies in the oven and waited until they were ready to eat. Lily was so happy because she had so much fun baking and dancing with her mom.
