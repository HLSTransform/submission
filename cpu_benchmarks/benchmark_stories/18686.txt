Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear her unusual vest that had lots of colors. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friend, Timmy.
"Wow, Lily! Your vest is so pretty!" said Timmy.
"Thank you, Timmy! I love wearing it because it makes me feel happy," replied Lily.
As they played, Lily noticed that Timmy looked cold. She asked him if he wanted to wear her vest to keep him warm.
"Are you sure, Lily? Your vest is so special!" said Timmy.
"Yes, I'm sure. I love sharing with my friends," responded Lily.
So, Timmy put on the unusual vest and felt warm and cozy. They continued to play together, happy and content. From that day on, Lily and Timmy shared everything with each other and their friendship grew stronger.
