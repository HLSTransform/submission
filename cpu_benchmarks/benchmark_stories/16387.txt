Once upon a time, there was a silly train. The train was made of steel. It was very big and strong. The train loved to travel on the tracks.
One day, the silly train decided to travel far away from home. It went through the woods and over the hills. The silly train saw many animals and plants.
After a long time, the silly train missed its home. It wanted to go back. The train traveled back on the tracks. It was happy to be home again.
