Once upon a time, there was a shy little girl named Lily. She loved to sit on her cozy couch and watch her favorite TV show. One day, Lily's mom brought her a yummy ice cream cone. 
Lily was so happy and she started to lick the ice cream. But then, the sun came out and it got very hot. The ice cream started to melt and Lily's hands got all sticky. 
"Lily, what's wrong?" asked her mom. 
"My ice cream is melting!" replied Lily. 
"Don't worry, let's go inside and we can put it in the freezer to make it cold again," said her mom. 
Lily smiled and followed her mom inside. She sat back down on her cozy couch and enjoyed her cold ice cream.
