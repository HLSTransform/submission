Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with blocks and cars. But today they have a test at school. The test is about colors and shapes. Lily and Ben want to do well on the test.
Before the test, they look at their books. Lily sees a red circle. She says, "This is a red circle. I know it." Ben sees a blue square. He says, "This is a blue square. I know it." They are happy.
But then they see a yellow triangle. Lily says, "This is a yellow circle. I know it." Ben says, "No, this is a yellow square. I know it." They are not happy. They start to quarrel. They say, "You are wrong. I am right." They are loud and angry.
The teacher hears them. She comes to them. She says, "Stop quarreling. You are both wrong. This is a yellow triangle. It has three sides. A circle has no sides. A square has four sides. Can you see the difference?" Lily and Ben look at the yellow triangle. They see the difference. They feel silly. They say, "Sorry, teacher. Sorry, friend. We were wrong. We will not quarrel again." The teacher smiles. She says, "Good. Now, let's take the test. It is easy. You can do it."
Lily and Ben take the test. They answer the questions about colors and shapes. They do well on the test. They are happy. They hug each other. They say, "We are friends. We help each other. We learn together." They are peaceful. They play with blocks and cars. They have fun. The end.
