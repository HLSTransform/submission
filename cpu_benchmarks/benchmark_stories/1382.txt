Once upon a time there was a young guard. He was always very friendly to everyone he saw. One day, he decided to go for a walk. As he was walking, he saw something that matched his coat. It was a beautiful necklace! He knew he had to have it.
The guard went to the store and asked how much the necklace was. The store clerk told him it would cost a bit of money. The young guard only had a few coins. He didn't have enough to buy the necklace.
The store clerk saw how much the guard wanted the necklace. He decided to give it to him for free. The guard was so happy with his new necklace and he thanked the store clerk for being so kind. Then, he happily took his necklace and went back to his job.
From then on, the young guard always wore his new necklace everywhere he went. He was very proud of it and felt like it made him look even more official when guarding the city. The guard and his necklace were a perfect match!
