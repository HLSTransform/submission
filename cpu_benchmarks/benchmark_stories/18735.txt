Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside in the garden. One day, Timmy saw a big hole in the ground. He wanted to see what was inside, so he slipped down the hole.
Timmy went underground and found a big room with lots of cheese. He was so happy and started to eat the cheese. But then, he heard a loud noise. It was a cat! The cat saw Timmy and chased him around the room.
Timmy tried to run away, but he slipped on some cheese and fell. The cat caught him and ate him for dinner. The end.
