Once upon a time, there was a thoughtful little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One sunny day, Lily saw a big gray door in the park. She had never seen it before. She was very curious and wanted to know what was behind the door.
Lily went to her best friend, Tom, and asked, "Tom, did you see the gray door in the park? Can we enter and see what's inside?" Tom was excited too and said, "Yes, let's go together!" So, they went to the park and stood in front of the gray door.
Lily and Tom held hands and entered the door. Inside, they found a beautiful garden with colorful flowers and butterflies. They played together, laughed, and had a great time. After a while, they decided to go back home. They left the garden through the gray door and promised to keep it a secret. From that day on, Lily and Tom had a special place to play and be happy.
