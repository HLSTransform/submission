Sammy had a great day. First, he went to the park with his mom and dad. They walked together and Sammy laughed when a big dog ran by. Next, they went to the beach. Sammy was so happy because there were big waves. He ran into the water, but it was wet! He laughed when he got all wet, but he knew he had to go inside and dry off.
Finally, Sammy and his mom and dad went to the ice cream store and they all got a sundae. It was so yummy! Sammyâ€™s eyes lit up and he laughed as he ate it. After that, they went home and Sammy said goodnight to his mom and dad.
As Sammy closed his eyes, he knew something good would happen tomorrow. He had a good feeling about it. He didn't know what it would be, but he had a will to find out. He giggled and soon felt asleep with a smile on his face.
