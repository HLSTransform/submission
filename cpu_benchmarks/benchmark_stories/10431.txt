Mum and Dad brought Timmy to the beach. Timmy had never been to the beach before and was very excited. He squealed when the waves revealed themselves and came up to tickle his toes. 
It was a hot day, and Mum suggested going for a swim. She handed Timmy a thermometer. He picked it up and felt its rough surface, not quite sure what it was for. 
“We put this thermometer in the water to see how warm it is,” Mum explained. “If it says it’s safe to swim, we’ll go for a dip. Otherwise, we’ll stay here and build a sandcastle.” 
Timmy put the thermometer in the water and waited. All of a sudden, it started to beep. Timmy pulled it out and saw that the thermometer had revealed the water was safe to swim. “Let’s go swimming!” he cheered.
Mum and Dad smiled at each other. They were so proud of Timmy’s enthusiasm. Timmy had had a great day at the beach and learnt a lot.
