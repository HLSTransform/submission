John was walking in the forest. He suddenly heard a quiet whistle. It was coming from a small hut. He wondered who was inside. He peeked in and saw a little girl. She was wearing a dress and she had a hat on. The girl was sitting on the floor and she was whistling. John smiled and said hello. The girl stopped whistling and waved. She asked John to come in. He walked inside the hut and the girl offered him a piece of cake. They ate together and talked about the forest and the birds. After a while, the girl started whistling again. John smiled and said farewell. He waved goodbye and went back on his way. The forest seemed even more beautiful and peaceful now that he had heard the quiet whistle of the little girl.
