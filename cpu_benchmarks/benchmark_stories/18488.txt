Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved candy, especially sour candy. One day, Lily's mom bought her a big bag of sour gummies.
Lily was so happy and excited to eat them, but she couldn't open the bag. She tried and tried, but the bag wouldn't open. "Mommy, can you help me open this bag of candy?" Lily asked.
Her mom came over and tried to open the bag, but it was still too hard. "Let's wrap the bag in a towel and try again," her mom suggested. So they wrapped the bag in a towel and tried again. This time, the bag finally opened and Lily got to enjoy her sour gummies.
