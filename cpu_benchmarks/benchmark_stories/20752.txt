Once there was a nice girl called Sarah. She was very excited about her first job. She wasn't sure if she was ready, but she felt happy too.
On her first day, she arrived at work and it was so noisy! But Sarah was determined to make a good impression, so she worked very hard. People noticed how hard she worked and they thought she was amazing.
But the next day, it was so noisy that Sarah couldn't hear her boss properly. She made a mistake and her boss was very angry. Sarah felt so sad.
But then something wonderful happened; her boss forgave her. He said that everyone makes mistakes and it was alright. Sarah was so happy.
Sarah was relieved that her boss had forgiven her. She was so grateful and she was determined to do a better job next time.
