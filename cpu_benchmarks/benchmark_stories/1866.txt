Once upon a time there was a little girl named Adele. She was always in a hurry to go outside and play with her friends.
One evening, Adele’s mom told her to hurry to the kitchen and help with the dinner. Adele ran to the kitchen and saw her mom had the table all set.
When the food was ready, Adele’s mom said, “Let’s all say a prayer before eating. The prayer reminded Adele of how compassionate her mom was.
After the prayer, Adele, her mom, and her dad all enjoyed the dinner. Adele was so happy she got to help make it. And she was happy that her mom was so compassionate and caring.
