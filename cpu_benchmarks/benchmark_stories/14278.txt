Once there was a little girl called Amelia. She was only 3 years old. All Amelia wanted to do was dream.
She dreamed of riding a unicorn that was as white as snow. She dreamed of sailing away on a big pirate ship. But most of all, Amelia dreamed of flying away in a dirigible.
One day, while Amelia was washing her hands at the sink, she accidentally dropped her favourite doll in the water. It sunk quickly and Amelia was very hurt.
But then the most amazing thing happened. A fish popped out of the sink holding the doll in his mouth! Amelia was so happy.
The fish said, “Don’t worry Amelia - it’s never too late to chase your dreams.” And so Amelia set off on a magical adventure, dreaming of unicorns, pirate ships and dirigibles.
