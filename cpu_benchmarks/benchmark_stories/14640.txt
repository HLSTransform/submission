Once there was a little girl who felt very sick. Her mommy took her to the hospital. As she went in, the little girl saw all sorts of people in their white coats. She was scared.
But the doctors and nurses were very gentle. When they first saw the little girl, they all smiled at her. She smiled back. Then they helped the little girl to the special room.
The nurse checked the little girl's temperature and listened to her heart. She looked in the little girl's eyes and used a long, thin tube to look in her mouth. The little girl was afraid, but the nurse was very gentle.
Then the doctors used their tools and medicines to make the little girl feel better. The little girl could not recognize all of their tools, but she knew she was in a safe place.
When the little girl was all better she went home with a big smile. She was happy to recognize her home and her mommy. The hospital made her feel better and more secure.
