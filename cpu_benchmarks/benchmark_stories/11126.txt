Once upon a time, there was a little red automobile. It was going down the road, when it saw a big blue automobile coming the other way. They both stopped and looked at each other.
The little red automobile shouted, "Hi, I am sorry, but I need to get by!" The big blue automobile shouted back, "I am sorry too! Let's find a way to help each other." So, they thought and thought.
Then, the little red automobile had an idea. It moved to the side of the road, and the big blue automobile did the same. They smiled and waved as they passed each other. Now they could both keep going on their way, happy and not sorry anymore.
