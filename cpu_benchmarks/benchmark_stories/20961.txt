Jack and Bertie were having a very jolly time decorating the house for their mom's birthday. They had painted the walls, hung balloons, and taped paper streamers everywhere.
"We should hurry up," said Jack, "Mommy will be back in one minute!"
Bertie grabbed a bag of colorful stickers and began to stick them all over the windows. She smiled as she looked at their colorful work.
"We did it! Now, let's surprise Mommy!" exclaimed Jack.
They both rushed out to the driveway and waited for their mom to come home. As soon as they saw her car turn the corner, they started jumping up and down with excitement.
Mommy gasped in surprise when she opened the door and saw the decorations. "You two did such a wonderful job! I'm so lucky to have you!"
Jack and Bertie gave their Mom a big hug and laughed as they all admired their jolly decorations.
