Once upon a time there was a happy girl named Mama. Mama always liked to play with her friends at the park and was always happy.
One day Mama was sad. She wiped her eyes because she was very sad. Every morning, Mama would wake up and wish she could be happy again.
Mama's friends noticed she was sad and asked her why. Mama told them she was sad because of the rain. They asked her if the rain made her sad because she loves playing in the park.
Mama smiled and said yes. She said it's still raining and she can't play outside. She wiped away her tears and said it will be okay.
Mama's friends pulled out umbrellas, and they all started playing in the rain. Mama laughed and wiped away her tears. She was happy again!
