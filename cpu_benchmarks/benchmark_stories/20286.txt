One day, a little boy named Tim saw a shadow on the wall. He did not recognize it. Tim was scared. He called his mom.
"Mom, there is a shadow on the wall!" Tim said. His mom came to see. She looked at the shadow and smiled. "Don't worry, Tim. It's just a gentle bird outside the window."
Tim looked at the window and saw the gentle bird. He felt happy. "Hello, gentle bird!" Tim said. The bird sang a pretty song. Tim and his mom listened and smiled. The shadow was not scary anymore.
