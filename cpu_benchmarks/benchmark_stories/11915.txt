Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the forest near her house. One day, she found a big cave. She was scared at first, but then she remembered her mom's words: "Don't be afraid to try new things, Lily."
Lily went inside the cave and found a glowing rock. It was so pretty! She picked it up and put it in her pocket. As she was leaving the cave, she saw a little bunny stuck in a hole. "Oh no!" she said. "How did you get stuck in there?" 
Lily tried to pull the bunny out, but she couldn't. She felt frustrated. Then she remembered the glowing rock in her pocket. She took it out and it shined so bright that it helped her see where the bunny was stuck. She was able to pull the bunny out and they became best friends. From that day on, Lily always carried the glowing rock with her, just in case she needed it again.
