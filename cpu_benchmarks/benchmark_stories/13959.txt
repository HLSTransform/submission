Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the big green field near her house. One day, she was playing with her friend Billy when they saw a man setting up a big tent.
"What's going on?" asked Lily.
"They're having a fair!" replied Billy.
Lily and Billy were so excited and decided to go check it out. They tried different games and ate yummy food. But then, they saw a man with a big hammer trying to hit a bell. 
"I want to try!" said Lily.
She went up to the man and picked up the hammer. She swung it as hard as she could, but she missed the bell. The man said, "Sorry, you didn't hit it. You failed the test."
Lily was sad and started to cry. Billy tried to cheer her up, but it didn't work. They went home feeling disappointed. From that day on, Lily didn't want to go to fairs anymore because she was afraid of failing again.
