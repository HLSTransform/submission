Once upon a time, there was a crab who lived in a big ocean. One day, the crab went to the beach to play with his friends. While they were playing, the crab saw a shiny shell that he really wanted to have. But the shell was not available, it belonged to another crab.
The crab said to his friend, "I want that shell, but it's not available. What should I do?"
His friend replied, "You should leave it. It's not yours and it belongs to someone else."
The crab thought about it and realized that his friend was right. He left the shiny shell and went back home. When he got home, he felt happy that he did the right thing.
The moral of the story is that it's important to respect what belongs to others and to be happy with what you have.
