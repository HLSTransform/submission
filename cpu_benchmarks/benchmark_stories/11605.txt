Once upon a time there was a little girl with a broken hat. She loved her hat and wanted to wear it all the time, but the broken parts made it hard.
One day, she walked past a store with a big window, and spotted a hat just like hers inside. She ran into the store and asked the shopkeeper if she could buy it.
The shopkeeper said no and the little girl started to cry. She tried to open the window to take her hat, but the shopkeeper grabbed her.
The little girl screamed and screamed, but nobody heard her. The shopkeeper pushed her out of the store and locked the window.
The little girl went home with her broken hat, feeling worse than before. She never got her new hat, and she never saw the shopkeeper again.
