Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went for a walk in the park with her mommy. They saw some ducks swimming in the pond and a big dog playing fetch with his owner. Suddenly, Lily fell down and hurt her knee. It was bleeding and she started to cry.
Mommy quickly took out a bandage from her bag and put it on Lily's knee. "Don't worry, it will make it better," mommy said. Lily stopped crying and looked at the bandage. "It's pink, my favorite color," she said with a smile. Then they continued their walk, but Lily had to walk slowly because her knee hurt.
As they were walking, they heard some noisy birds chirping on the trees. "Those birds are so noisy," Lily said to her mommy. "Yes, they are," mommy replied. They kept walking and enjoying the beautiful day in the park. Finally, they went back home and had some cookies and milk. Lily was happy because her knee was feeling better thanks to the bandage.
