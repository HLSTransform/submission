Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a creative little girl named Lily. She loved to look at the sky and paint it with her bright colors. The sky was her favorite thing to draw.
One sunny day, Lily went to the park to draw the sky. She brought her paper and colors, and found a nice spot to sit. She was so excited to start drawing the pretty sky. But, oh no! Lily forget to bring her favorite blue color for the sky.
Lily felt sad, but then she had a creative idea. She mixed her green and yellow colors together and made a new color. It was not the same blue, but it was still pretty. She used this new color to draw the sky.
In the end, Lily's picture of the sky was very beautiful. Everyone who saw her drawing loved it. Lily learned that even if you forget something, you can still be creative and make something nice. And from that day on, Lily never forget to be creative again.
