Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved flowers and had a pretty vase in her room. One day, her mom asked her to wash the vase. Lily didn't want to do it because she was feeling grumpy. But her mom said it was important to keep the vase clean so the flowers would stay healthy. 
Lily took the vase to the sink and used soap and water to wash it. It was hard work, but she did it all by herself. When she was finished, she felt proud of herself for doing a good job. 
Later that day, Lily's mom brought home some beautiful flowers and put them in the vase. Lily smiled and felt happy. She realized that washing the vase was worth it because it made her room look pretty and made her feel good inside.
