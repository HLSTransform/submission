Once upon a time, there was a big giant who lived in a castle. He was very mean and would not allow anyone to come close to his castle. One day, a little boy named Timmy was walking by the castle and saw the giant. The giant yelled at Timmy and said, "You are stupid and not allowed here!" 
Timmy was scared but he knew he had to do something. He went back home and thought of a plan. He decided to make a big cake and bring it to the giant. When he got to the castle, he said, "Mr. Giant, I made you a cake. Will you allow me to come in and give it to you?" 
The giant was surprised by Timmy's kindness and said, "Yes, you may come in." Timmy gave the giant the cake and they became friends. The giant learned that being mean was not the way to make friends and he allowed Timmy to visit him whenever he wanted. From that day on, the giant was no longer mean and Timmy had a new friend.
