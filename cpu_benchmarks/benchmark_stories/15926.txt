Mum and Dad took baby to the yard. It was sunny and the grass was soft.
"It's time for us to find something to do," said Mum.
Dad said, "Let's spend some time in the yard!"
Baby clapped and smiled. He loved the yard.
Mum and Dad played with Baby, throwing a ball to each other. Baby was so happy.
But then it started to rain. It was so hard and it felt so bitter.
"We don't want to get too wet. Let's go inside," said Mum.
Baby was sad. He wanted to stay in the yard.
Mum put her arms around him and said, "Don't worry. We can come back tomorrow and spend some more time in the yard."
Baby smiled and said, "Ok, let's go home now." 
Mum and Dad took baby back home, and they all talked about how much fun they were going to have the next time they came to the yard.
