Once upon a time there were two friends named Sue and Sam. They were very excited because they were going to a park. When they arrived they saw a big, orange tree.
Sue said to Sam, "Look! The tree is orange!" Sam said, "Yes, it sure is!"
They both spoke to the tree. Sue said, "Hi tree! Can you give us any fruit?" The tree stayed still and did not answer.
Suddenly, a purple bird flew down from the tree. It spoke to Sue and said, "I can give you something special!" The bird flew away and came back with a big, orange fruit.
Sue and Sam were very excited. They took the fruit and said, "Thank you very much purple bird!" The bird flew away and Sue and Sam happily ate their orange fruit.
