Once upon a time, there was a little mouse. The mouse liked to create things. He made a big, smelly cake. The cake was so smelly that it made the mouse's nose wiggle.
One day, the mouse went outside to play. He saw a big cat. The cat saw the smelly cake and wanted to eat it. The mouse was scared, but he had an idea. He gave the cat the smelly cake.
The cat ate the smelly cake and was very happy. The mouse was happy too. The cat and the mouse became friends. They played together every day. And they both loved the smelly cake.
