Once upon a time, there was a brother and sister who loved to ride their bikes. Every day they went out, down the dirt path all the way to the park, ready to explore and find treasures.  
One day they found something incredible: a big, green treasure box! It was full of wonderful things, like shiny coins and golden coins. But the best treasure of them all was a nice big bike with two sparkly handles.  
"Wow, this really is a treasure!" said the brother.
The sister smiled and said, "Let's take it home and ride it together!"
The brother nodded, and together they picked up the bike and carefully carried it all the way back home.  
From then on, every day they went out to the park and rode their new bike together. It was so much fun, and it felt so good to ride together. Soon enough, the brother and sister had many wonderful adventures together on their magical bike. They were the happiest when they were riding together, and that bike became their special shared treasure.
