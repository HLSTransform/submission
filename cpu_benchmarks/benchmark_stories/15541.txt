Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a tall slide. They want to go on the slide.
But there is a man at the slide. He says, "You have to pay me to use the slide. Give me one coin each."
Tom and Mia are sad. They do not have any coins. They only have a ball and a doll.
They say, "Please, let us use the slide. We do not have any coins. We have a ball and a doll. Do you want them?"
The man says, "No, I do not want your ball and your doll. I want coins. Go away."
Tom and Mia are angry. They do not like the man. He is mean and greedy.
They have an idea. They run to the swings. They swing very high. They make a lot of noise. They shout, "Wee! Wee! Wee!"
The man does not like the noise. He says, "Stop that noise! You are bothering me!"
Tom and Mia say, "No, we will not stop. We like to make noise. We like to swing. You cannot stop us. You are not the boss of us."
The man is annoyed. He says, "Fine, you can use the slide. Just be quiet."
Tom and Mia are happy. They run to the slide. They take turns to slide down. They have fun. They do not pay the man. They do not care about him. They are smart and brave.
