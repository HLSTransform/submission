Once upon a time, there was a little horse named Henny. Henny lived on a farm with many other animals. Henny's job was to carry hay from one place to another. But one day, Henny could not manage to carry the hay. She felt very ashamed.
Henny went to her friend, the cow named Mooey. Henny said, "Mooey, I cannot carry the hay today. I feel bad." Mooey looked at Henny and said, "Do not feel bad, Henny. We all have days when we cannot do our job. I will help you."
Mooey and Henny worked together to carry the hay. It was hard work, but they did it. In the end, Henny felt happy and not ashamed. All the animals on the farm were happy too. They learned that if they help each other, they can do anything.
