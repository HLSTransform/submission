Tom and Lily were twins. They liked to play with their toys and share their snacks. But they did not like to share their gifts. When their birthday came, they each got a big gift from their mom and dad. Tom got a red car that could roll fast. Lily got a pink doll that could talk and sing.
Tom wanted to play with his car on the floor. He rolled it back and forth and made loud noises. Lily wanted to play with her doll on the bed. She hugged it and listened to its voice. But soon they got bored of their own gifts. They wanted to try the other one.
"Can I play with your car, Tom?" Lily asked.
"No, it's mine. You have your doll," Tom said.
"Can I play with your doll, Lily?" Tom asked.
"No, it's mine. You have your car," Lily said.
They both got angry and started to cry. Their mom and dad heard them and came to their room.
"What's wrong, Tom and Lily?" their mom asked.
"They won't share their gifts with me!" they both said.
Their mom and dad looked at each other and smiled. They had an idea.
"How about we play a game?" their dad said. "We can take turns with the gifts. You can roll the car for five minutes, then give it to your sister. She can play with the doll for five minutes, then give it to you. That way, you can both enjoy the gifts and have fun together."
Tom and Lily thought about it. They liked the idea of playing a game. They liked the idea of trying the other gift. They nodded and agreed.
"Okay, let's play!" they said.
They wiped their tears and smiled. They gave each other a hug and said sorry. Then they started to play with the gifts. They rolled the car and talked to the doll. They laughed and sang. They were cheerful and happy. Their mom and dad watched them and felt proud. They knew they had taught them a good lesson. Sharing is caring.
