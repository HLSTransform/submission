One day, a little boy named Tim went to his old grandma's house. Grandma had a big box. Tim wanted to find out what was in the box. The box was heavy. Tim thought it had a lot of weight.
Tim asked his grandma if he could open the box. She said, "No, Tim. The box is not for you." But Tim did not listen. He wanted to find out what was inside. When grandma was not looking, Tim tried to lift the box. It was very heavy.
Tim tried and tried to lift the box. He pushed and pulled. Then, the box fell on Tim's foot. It hurt a lot. Tim cried. Grandma came and helped Tim. She was sad that Tim did not listen. The box was not for him.
