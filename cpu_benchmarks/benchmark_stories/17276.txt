Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweetie. Tweetie loved to fly high in the sky and see all the pretty flowers and trees. One day, Tweetie was flying when he saw a little girl named Lily. Lily was crying because she dropped her yogurt on the ground.
Tweetie flew down to Lily and said, "Don't cry, I can help you." Lily was so happy to have a helper. Tweetie picked up the yogurt with his beak and gave it to Lily. Lily was so grateful and said, "Thank you, little bird. You are my hero."
Tweetie felt happy that he could help someone in need. He flew away feeling proud and not so helpless anymore. From that day on, Tweetie knew that he could fly to help others whenever they needed it.
