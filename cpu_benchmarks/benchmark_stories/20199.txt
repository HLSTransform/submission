Lila and Tom were playing on the beach. They liked to make sand castles and look for shells. They saw a big rock with a hole in it. They wanted to see what was inside.
"Let's go, Lila!" Tom said. "Maybe we can find a treasure!"
They ran to the rock and peeked inside. They saw something pink and slimy. It had eight arms and two big eyes. It was an octopus!
"Wow!" Lila said. "Look at that!"
The octopus saw them too. It was scared. It wanted to hide. It tried to squeeze into the hole, but it was too big. It was stuck. It felt helpless.
"Help! Help!" It whistled. "Please, help me!"
Lila and Tom heard the whistle. They felt sorry for the octopus. They wanted to help it.
"Don't be afraid, octopus!" Lila said. "We are not going to hurt you. We are going to help you."
They gently pulled the octopus out of the hole. The octopus was free. It was happy. It thanked Lila and Tom with a whistle.
"Thank you! Thank you!" It whistled. "You are very kind!"
The octopus waved its arms and swam away. Lila and Tom waved back. They smiled. They had made a new friend.
