Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Suzy. She was very curious and always asked her mom what she was doing. One day, Suzy asked her mom curiously, "Mommy, what are you baking?" Her mom replied "I'm baking a cake for your birthday, Suzy!" 
Suzy was so excited. She wanted to help her mom. "Can I help you, Mommy?" she asked. Her mom said "Yes, why don't you go pick some berries from the bush and I'll bake them into the cake!" 
So Suzy ran outside to the bush to pick some berries. Suddenly, she spotted a big, clumsy bear trying to pick the berries. Suzy was scared, but she remembered her mom's words. She knew that she should be kind and not be foolish.
So she smiled at the bear and said, "Hey, big bear! Could you help me pick some berries for my mom's cake?" The bear smiled and said "Why, of course!" 
The bear and Suzy worked together to pick all the berries they needed. Suzy thanked the bear and ran back to her mom with the basket of berries.
Suzy's mom was so proud of her for being kind and using her head to ask for help instead of being foolish. Together, they mixed the berries into the cake batter and it made the most delicious cake ever!
