Once upon a time, there was a new bell in the town. The bell was big and shiny. Everyone in the town loved the bell. They were very happy to have it. The bell would ring every day to tell the time.
One sunny day, a little girl named Lily was playing with her friends. They were playing with a big sheet. They liked to use the sheet as a cape, a tent, and even a parachute. They were having so much fun.
Then, Lily had an idea. She said, "Let's go to the bell and use the sheet to make it ring!" Her friends agreed, and they all ran to the bell. They wrapped the sheet around the bell and pulled it back and forth. The bell went "ring, ring, ring!"
Everyone in the town heard the bell ring and came to see what was happening. They saw Lily and her friends playing with the sheet and the bell. The people clapped and cheered for them. It was a fun and happy day for everyone.
