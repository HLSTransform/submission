Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the park and listening to the musician play his guitar. He was her favorite musician in the whole wide world. 
One day, Lily saw another girl watching the musician play. She looked so envious of Lily, who got to see the musician all the time. But Lily didn't mind, she was just happy to be there. 
Later that day, Lily's mom took her to get ice cream. As they walked by the park, Lily saw the musician packing up his guitar. She asked her mom why he was leaving so early. Her mom shrugged and said, "Maybe he has another show to play." 
The next day, Lily went to the park as usual, but the musician wasn't there. She waited and waited, but he never showed up. Lily was sad, but she remembered her mom's words and hoped that he was just playing somewhere else. 
A few days later, Lily's mom took her to a big concert. As they walked in, Lily saw the musician on stage, playing his guitar for everyone to hear. She was so happy and knew that he was the best musician in the whole wide world.
