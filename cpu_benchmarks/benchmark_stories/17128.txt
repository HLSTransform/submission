Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cheerful smile and loved to play with her toys. One day, Lily's mommy gave her a bottle of milk to drink. Lily drank all the milk and then she shrugged her shoulders. 
Later that day, Lily went to the park to play. She saw her friends and they were all playing together. Lily felt a little shy, but then she saw her friend Emma waving at her. Lily felt cheerful and ran towards her friend. 
At the end of the day, Lily went back home and her mommy asked her how her day was. Lily smiled and said, "I had fun with my friends at the park and then I shrugged when I finished my milk." Her mommy smiled and gave her a big hug.
