Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play with words. They made poems with rhymes and sounds and wrote them on paper. They were proud of their poems and wanted to show them to everyone.
One day, they had a very naughty idea. They decided to hang their poems on the walls of the school, where the teacher and the other children could see them. They thought it would be funny and clever, but they did not ask for permission.
They sneaked into the school at night, with a roll of tape and their poems. They hung them on the windows, the doors, the blackboard, and even the teacher's desk. They giggled and whispered as they did it, and then ran away.
The next morning, the teacher and the other children were very surprised and angry when they saw the poems. They were not nice poems, but rude and mean ones. They made fun of the teacher's nose, the children's names, and the school rules. They hurt the feelings of many people and broke the trust of the teacher.
The teacher was very smart and soon found out who did it. She called Lily and Tom to her office and scolded them. She made them take down all the poems and apologize to everyone. She also gave them a lot of extra homework and no recess for a week. Lily and Tom felt very ashamed and sorry for what they did. They learned that hanging poems without permission was not funny or clever, but naughty and wrong. They also learned that words can be powerful and hurtful, and that they should use them with care and respect.
