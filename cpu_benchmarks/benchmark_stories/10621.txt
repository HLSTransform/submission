Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved animals. Every day she would go to the park to watch the birds. She particularly liked to watch a dove who was very charming.
One day, while the little girl was watching the dove, she heard a loud snap sound. She was so startled, she hid behind a tree. After a few moments, the little girl looked out and saw that the dove was stuck in a branch.
The little girl ran to the dove. She started to carefully try to remove it from the branch. Suddenly, with a tiny snap sound, the dove was free again and flew away.
The little girl realized that she should be gentle and careful, especially when helping others. The moral of the story is that a gentle touch can do more than a strong one!
