Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited to go on an adventure with her mommy. They went to a big building with lots of floors. They went inside an elevator to go up to the top floor. 
But then, the elevator stopped moving and they were stuck. Lily started to feel scared and silly. She didn't know what to do. Her mommy tried to call for help, but her phone didn't work in the elevator. 
Lily remembered a game she played where she had to sit still and be quiet. She told her mommy and they both sat quietly together. Soon, they heard a noise and the elevator started moving again. They made it to the top floor and had a great adventure, but they never forgot the silly elevator ride.
