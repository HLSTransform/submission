Once upon a time, there was a little baby named Timmy. Timmy loved to crawl around on the floor and explore. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a tasty cookie to eat. Timmy loved the cookie so much that he wanted to eat it all at once, but his mom had a question for him. "Timmy, do you want to share your cookie with me?" she asked. Timmy thought about it for a moment and then gave his mom a big smile and offered her a piece of his tasty cookie.
