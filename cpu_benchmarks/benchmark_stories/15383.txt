Once upon a time, there was a girl who wanted to travel. She looked out the window and saw a beautiful landscape. The trees were tall and the sky was so blue.
She told her parents she wanted to travel and they said yes. So the girl packed her things and soon she was off!
The girl traveled far and wide. She saw a lot of different places and had lots of fun. Everywhere she went she saw a new landscape.
When the girl came home she told her parents all about her trip. She had seen so many different places and each one was more beautiful than the last. Even though the girl was sad to be back home, she was happy for her normal life too.
