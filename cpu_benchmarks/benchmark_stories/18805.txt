Anna and Ben are playing with their toy kitchen. They have a lot of food and dishes to pretend with. Anna likes to be the chef and Ben likes to be the customer.
"Hello, welcome to my restaurant!" Anna says. "What do you want to eat?"
"I want a big pizza with cheese and ham," Ben says.
"Okay, I will make it for you. But first, I need to measure the dough. Can you help me?" Anna says.
"Sure, I can help you. How do we measure the dough?" Ben says.
"We use this black ruler. It has numbers on it. We need to make the dough as long as the number ten. Can you see the number ten?" Anna says.
"Yes, I can see it. It is here, at the end of the ruler. I will hold the ruler and you roll the dough," Ben says.
They work together to measure and roll the dough. Then Anna adds cheese and ham on top. She puts the pizza in the oven and sets the timer.
"Your pizza will be ready soon. Do you want anything to drink?" Anna says.
"I want some juice, please. And a cookie for dessert," Ben says.
"Okay, I will get them for you. You can sit at the table and wait. Here is a menu and a napkin," Anna says.
She brings him a glass of juice and a cookie. She checks the oven and sees that the pizza is done. She takes it out and cuts it into slices.
"Your pizza is ready! It looks yummy. Here you go. Enjoy your meal!" Anna says.
"Thank you, chef Anna. You are the best. This pizza is delicious. You are a great cook," Ben says.
They smile and eat their pizza. They are happy and full. They love playing with their toy kitchen.
