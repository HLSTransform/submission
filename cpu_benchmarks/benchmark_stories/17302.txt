Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max was very lively and loved to play fetch with his owner, Lily. Lily was the owner of a big garden, where Max loved to run around and play.
One day, Lily noticed that Max kept digging in one corner of the garden. She wondered what he was looking for. She decided to keep an eye on him and see what he was up to.
The next day, Lily found a little treasure buried in the spot where Max had been digging. It was a shiny bone! She realized that Max had been digging to hide his treasure. From that day on, Max would keep his treasures hidden in the garden, and Lily would always be on the lookout for his secret spots.
