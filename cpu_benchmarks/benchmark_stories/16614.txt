Tom and Sam were friends who liked to sail boats. They had small boats made of wood and paper that they put in the pond. They liked to see whose boat was faster and better.
One day, they saw a big trophy on a table near the pond. It was shiny and had a boat on top. They both wanted the trophy very much. They decided to have a race with their boats and the winner would get the trophy.
They put their boats in the water and said, "Ready, set, go!" They blew on their boats to make them move. Tom's boat was red and Sam's boat was blue. They were both very colorful.
Tom's boat was faster than Sam's boat. It reached the other side of the pond first. Tom was very happy and ran to the table to get the trophy. He picked it up and shouted, "I won! I won! This trophy is mine!"
Sam was very sad and angry. He did not like to lose. He wanted the trophy too. He ran to the table and tried to take the trophy from Tom. They both pulled and pushed and yelled at each other.
But the trophy was not very strong. It broke in half and fell to the ground. The boat on top fell off and the shiny part cracked. Tom and Sam looked at the broken trophy and cried. They had ruined it.
A man came to the table and saw the mess. He was the owner of the trophy. He was very mad and said, "What have you done? This trophy was for the best sailor in the town. You are not sailors, you are troublemakers. You have to pay for the trophy and you have to leave the pond. You are not welcome here anymore."
Tom and Sam felt very sorry and ashamed. They had lost their boats, their trophy, and their place to sail. They had also lost their friendship. They learned that being greedy and selfish is not good. They wished they had shared the trophy and played nicely.
