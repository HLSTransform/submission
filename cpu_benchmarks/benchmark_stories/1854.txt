Once upon a time there was a little boy named Ted who loved to explore. One day he was looking through his telescope and he saw something pink up in the sky. He was so excited to see it!
It turned out to be a beautiful little planet. It was a special kind of planet because it was made out of pink bubblegum. The pink bubblegum was so sparkly and delicious, it made Ted's mouth water.
Ted wanted to go explore the planet. He put on his space suit and launched off in his rocket ship. As he got closer to the planet, he was so excited. He was amazed at how soft and bouncy the pink bubblegum planet was. He jumped up and down and it felt like being on a trampoline. He had the best time exploring on the planet.
When it was finally time for Ted to go home he was a little sad to leave the planet. But he knew that he could always come back to explore and have fun. As he flew off into the night, Ted couldn't help but smile.
