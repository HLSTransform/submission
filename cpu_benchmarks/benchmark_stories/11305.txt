Once upon a time, there was a deaf crane living in a pond. He was alone in the pond and felt very lonely.
One day, a small bird flew close to the pond and spotted the crane. The bird flew closer and said: "Hello, Crane! My name is Max. Would you like to be my friend?"
The crane was so excited and happily replied: "Yes!"
Max and the crane became great friends and played together every day. They matched feathers and chased each other through the sky. The crane was so happy to have a friend. 
Max and the crane played until the sun set. Then, Max said goodbye and flew away. But the crane knew that their friendship would last forever.
