Lily liked to cook with her mom. They made eggs and toast for breakfast. Lily cracked the eggs and put them in a bowl. Mom put bread in the toaster and turned it on. Lily stirred the eggs with a fork.
Lily had a dog named Spot. Spot was a good dog, but he liked to run away. He had a cheap collar that was too big for him. Sometimes it fell off when he ran. Mom said they needed to buy a new collar for Spot.
One day, Lily and Mom went to the store to buy a new collar for Spot. They saw many collars in different colors and sizes. Lily picked a red collar with a bell. She said it was pretty and it would make a sound when Spot ran. Mom said it was a good choice and it was not too cheap or too expensive.
They went home and put the new collar on Spot. Spot liked his new collar. He wagged his tail and licked Lily's face. Lily hugged him and said he was a good dog. They went to the kitchen to cook some cookies for a snack. Lily and Mom and Spot were happy.
