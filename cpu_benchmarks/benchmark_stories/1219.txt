Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her toy chain. It was her most favorite toy. 
One day, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her toys. Lily replied, "But Mommy, I can't do it alone!" 
"Don't worry, Lily," said her mom. "I'll help you. Together we can complete this task." 
So, Lily and her mom started to clean up. They picked up all the toys and put them in their regular places. Finally, they completed the task and Lily's room was clean again. 
Lily hugged her mom and said, "Thank you, Mommy. I love you!" And her mom replied, "I love you too, Lily. Now let's go have some fun with your toy chain!"
