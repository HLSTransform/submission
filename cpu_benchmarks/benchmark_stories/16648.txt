Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat grapes, they were her favorite snack. One day, she found a grape that was not normal. It was big and squishy, and didn't taste very good. 
Lily decided to polish the grape to make it shiny and pretty. She rubbed it with a cloth until it sparkled like a diamond. Even though it still didn't taste good, she was happy that it looked nice. 
Lily learned that sometimes things aren't normal, but that's okay. She could still make them better by polishing them and making them shine. And even if they don't taste good, they can still be pretty to look at.
